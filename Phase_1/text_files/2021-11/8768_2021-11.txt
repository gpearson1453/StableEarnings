THANKS broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane as a
handy winner. TIMBERLAKE GAGE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well
to gain the place. SHENANDOAH STAR disputed the pace with the winner for the opening quarter, chased that rival for five furlongs and gave way.
JUPITER S. lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. THECHAMPISFLORING was carried out through the first turn,
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. SALTY NUGGET drifted out through the first turn, showed no
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

ridden out to be kept to task. DANCE BALLERINA chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second
best. RAISED A REDHEAD was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. PHANTOM MISTRESS was void of early speed,

POPPY'S C NOTE was hustled along to duel for the early advantage from the inside with SILVER SERVICE, disposed of that rival after the opening quarter
and drew off with complete authority. OFFICER OF WAR was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. SILVER SERVICE broke sharply to dispute the early fractions with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after
going a half. HAWK'S RISING was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. DIZZY DANCER lagged and raced
four-wide through the second turn.

Footnotes
DUSALUT broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear lead nearing the three-eighths marker, increased that margin through the final turn and
held off the closing FANTASTIC DAY to prevail. FANTASTIC DAY was off slow step slow then allowed to settle, angled out with a furlong to run and finished
with good late energy. LICORICE DROP POPS was off a step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a late bid.
TADEO was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE was never far back,
raced four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. FORT LEWIS RIVERS chased the leader while racing three-wide and weakened.

Footnotes
PERFECT COME BACK was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with EL ALTO HOMBRE and
edged away from that rival in the closing yards. EL ALTO HOMBRE sprinted clear at once, relinquished the pace setting duties before going a half, re-bid
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead through the final turn, responded when challenged by the winner and gave way grudgingly to that rival
late. PISTOL POWER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the third turn and finished evenly late. LOLLY EXPRESS settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the third turn and finished with some late run. ENGRAM showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the third turn and
finished with a belated bid. HEY SEQUOIA lacked early speed, saved ground through the third turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. JUNE
GLOOM showed brief speed and weakened. CHRISTINE'S JACK chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half
and weakened after going three-quarters. TUNE TO WIN raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders, saved ground through the third turn
and weakened. WINGS OF THE WIND was void of early speed, saved ground through the third turn and did not reach contention.

to gain in the drive. MY BOY RUDY lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late. SMOKE AND BURN raced four-wide
through the first turn, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. BULLET EXPRESS was forwardly placed
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE SUPPLY PROGRAM was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half. BOLDLY TRUE lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. KNOWN

way late. TURNAROUND lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the third turn and did not threaten. ATTERCOP showed no early speed, saved ground
through the second turn and did not menace. CAPES HOT ROCKET settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the third turn and weakened.
