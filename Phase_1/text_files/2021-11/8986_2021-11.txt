Footnotes
ELEVATED FOREVER exchanged contact with Compromiso leaving the gate then settled close off the rail, started a three wide bid nearing the three
eighths pole, took over two deep approaching the quarter, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. GOOFY BOY
saved early ground well off the pace then eased outward into the backsretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. DYNAMIC DAY rated a slim early lead inside, was headed at the nine sixteenths pole and dueled
through the backstretch, gave up the lead at the rail nearing the quarter pole and relented second inside the sixteenth. COMPROMISO was jostled at the
break, saved ground and showed only mild response. DEO FORTE exchanged contact with Compromiso leaving the gate then stalked the early pace two
deep, dueled at even terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole but dropped back between horses at the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn. PERUVIAN
DANCER saved ground.

Footnotes
COURAGEOUS GRACE settled close inside on the opening turn, raced hemmed in past the three eighths pole but angled out with a three wide bid midway
on the far turn, took the lead inside the eighth pole and was steadily handled to widen. DAMISELA stalked inside then challenged at the three eighths pole,
took the lead nearing the five sixteenths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught toward the head of the lane and the duel
was for second. SUZZETTE STAR rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
continued in the four path of the far turn and came along for third the final strides. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS stalked three wide then challenged at the three
eighths pole, dueled to a brief slim lead two deep approaching the top of the lane but was caught past the eighth pole and gave way to Damisela
mid-stretch. ELLIE BEAR raced in the three path the opening turn and settled back leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but
showed little in the lane. MASHUGANA saved ground and showed little response. SPUNKY ALI CAT rated a slim lead two deep, came under pressure at
the three eighths and was met approaching the five sixteenths pole, dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn then weakened. CASTLE OF CAYLEE
was eased shortly after the start and vanned off post race.

Footnotes
JACKIE THE JOKER raced off the rail on the first turn then stalked from the three path into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole,
closed to even terms two deep at the quarter and dug in determinedly through the stretch to eke out the nod in the final strides. TIMEISGOLDEN tapered in
while hustled along and took a slim lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths, was met at the rail nearing the
quarter pole and dueled gamely to the finish, though, missed the nod through the final strides. ENJOY SUMMER settled off the rail on the first turn then
eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened the final eighth. KEEN
MACHINE saved ground and rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out into the lane but showed little. STACIAS RUBY raced with the pace inside, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. UNBRIDLED IRISH broke a step slow,
rounded the first turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. BODIE'S STORM became fractious and sat down in the gate, and
after reloading was rated off the pace about the three path on the first turn then faded past the seven sixteenths pole. FEAR NOT N BELIEVE saved ground.

Footnotes
FAST LOADED settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the three path of the far turn then dug
in through the lane to get up the final stride. CIELO AZUL stalked from the three path then challenged three wide approaching the three eighths pole,
contested even terms through the far turn, took a brief lead mid-stretch but was nipped under the wire. TWEET THIS stalked then challenged two deep
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim lead between horses approaching the five sixteenths, raced at even terms nearest the rail on the far turn,
thouth, relented late yards. BLACK STEEL angled to the rail and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught
at the rail toward the five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn and flattened the final furlong. DR. DEVERA'S WAY rated close to the early pace inside,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. CONFUSION BABY BOY came slightly out at the break
then settled back off the rail and showed little response. GAMING JACK was shuffled back early then saved ground.

Footnotes
SWISS LEGACY engaged in close early chase and contested even terms three wide on the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch, drew briefly clear in later
yards and held on. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, angled four wide into the stretch, dug in for second the final
yards and was gaining slowly on the winner. THUNDER KITTEN was hustled along to set a pressured early pace, was met toward the five sixteenths pole
and contested even terms at the rail on the turn, took a brief nod toward the head of the lane but was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth.
MY PHOENIX was hustled along and took a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms between horses on the turn, dropped back
mid-stretch and flattened later yards. ROLL DEM BONES gave close chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole.
REMYS GUNSMOKE gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little further in the lane. TIMMY broke a step slow and was not a factor.
JUBA'S YANKEE ONE ducked in leaving the gate and dropped well back. PULL UP MY SOCKS chased outside and never factored.

Footnotes
JUNGLE BEAST settled off the pace in the two and three paths on the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep
approaching the far turn, dueled clear past the quarter pole and was steadily handled to widen. LATE IN THE GAME raced well off pace about the three
path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, angled in mid-stretch and
closed well to take second the final strides. MY JUBA stalked off the rail then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the
far turn but was outfinished for second the final strides. HESSICA saved early ground, bid at the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn,
drifted outward in the upper stretch and finished well widest. BAYS CASTLE was shuffled back at the start and rounded the first turn in the four path, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path then flattened the final sixteenth. WINDSOR'S PLAY tapered in and closed toward
contention through the front stretch then stalked in the two and three paths, challenged and took a brief slim lead nearing the three eighths pole, but
dropped back at the rail past the quarter pole and weakened into the stretch. SPECTACULO rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. MAY MAYS CASTLE raced well back and
never factored. SUGAR LIPS rounded the opening turn about the three path, eased outward into the backstretch and showed little response. CASTLE
LIGHTS rated the early pace inside, was met nearing the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
MACKENZIE'S STAR was bumped outward and into FRENCH NOUGET leaving the gate then saved ground on the opening turn and rated close into the
backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, closed to the lead in the three path midway on the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane but
drew clear past the eighth pole then only moderately handled to hold on well. The latter was bumped at the break then angled in through the front stretch to
stalk the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth
pole. PARTLY DANDY was bumped outward and into Mackenzie's Star leaving the gate then pinched back early, rounded the opening turn about the four
path and stalked into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths but was headed midway on the far
turn and relented the final sixteenth. FONDA ROMANA saved ground through the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled to the seven path on
the far turn and finished well outside. DAH PHILLY was shuffled back early, rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced well back leaving the
turn, entered the far turn near the rail, angled out with a bid into the stretch and was closing well the final sixteenth. ENDUROS TIGRESS saved ground off
the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, then flattened the final furlong. WALKNTHEPLANK raced well off
the pace and off the rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, though, showed little response.
ROBTHEQUEEN was forced outward and into Partly Dandy leaving the gate then saved ground on the first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole,
though, flattened in the four path of the far turn. CITY PRINCESS came out at the break and rated close through the front stretch, took a slim brief lead past
the half mile pole but was caught approaching the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. CATHERINES WARRIOR set the early pace inside,
was caught approaching the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and faded off the rail on the far
turn.
