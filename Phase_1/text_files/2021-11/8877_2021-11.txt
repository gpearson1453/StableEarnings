Footnotes
NOBLE EL SID rated off the pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and reached even terms toward the head of the lane, then dug in
determinedly through the stretch to take the nod under the wire. GHOST MINE ran in the three path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and
dueled for the lead past the three eighths, drew clear toward the quarter, was met leaving the far turn and dueled gamely the length of the stretch, but lost
the nod under the wire. YES SIR BOB rated off the pace off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four path, drifted toward the head of the lane but dug in to finish well at the outside flank of the winner. A BIT OF HARLOW drew clear and angled to the
inside to rate the pace, came under pressure but gave up the lead past the three eighths pole, dropped back into the far turn then weakened. FAST RIDE
rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
DIXIE SUNRISE settled off the early pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and moved alongside for the lead two
deep midway on the far turn, ran clear leaving the turn and was kept alert through the lane. QUINCYS WAY settled off the pace and off the rail on the
opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then dueled CHOPRA the length of the
stretch and shared second with that one, while the latter, rated close inside on the opening turn then eased outward and gave chase into the backstretch,
rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled Quincys Way through the stretch to share second. GATTOLOTTACHARM moved to the inside at the nine
sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong.
CHARITABLE MISS was carried out into the first turn and raced well off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and
ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MASTERDANCER bore outward into the first turn and was well off the pace leaving the turn, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the run into the first turn, though,
took no further action.

Footnotes
DINNER AT FIVE broke sharply with the lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far
turn then further increased her margin under steady stretch handling. SHERIFF'S KID was forced in steadying at the break and raced well reserved off the
rail on the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then dug in through the lane to take second later
yards. WIN THEN GRIN raced boxed at the rail through the first turn then settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail and dug in through the lane to take third late. CAPTIVATING GAL stalked two deep, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced off
the rail on the far turn, then flattened the final furlong. WILD CAPPUCINO rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths and raced outside into the
backstretch, showed only mild response, ran in the five path of the far turn and lacked further. ESTHER'S FORTUNE was not a factor. SUNSHINE BAY
broke inward then stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
ANOTHER VICTORY saved ground just off the pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, slipped through at the rail leaving the far turn and dug in
determinedly to eke out the nod over TRINGALE, who took over at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to rate a slim lead, came under
pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn but dug in gamely between horses
to duel for second while outfinished for the win. GREAT CAMANOE rounded the first turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, bid toward the
three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, dueled gamely from the head of the lane but missed the nod for second. FU
MAN SUE was reluctant to load then closed to contention and stalked two deep, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled close through the far
turn before weakening. SILVER TAURUS rounded the opening turn in the four path and gave chase, to no avail, from the three eighths pole.

LITTLE BOLD BANDIT chased through the backstretch and took over two deep midway on the turn, drew clear approaching the top of the lane and was
steadily handled to widen. D TACHYON gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and dug in from the top of the stretch to take second later yards.
TANELEER was hustled to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, ran clear at the five sixteenths, rounded the turn at
the rail but dropped back steadying toward the top of the lane and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS engaged in close
chase through the backstretch, ran off the rail on the turn then weakened. I'D LIKE TO KNOW gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail, angled to the
outside entering the stretch and finished evenly. RICHIE'S B L was reluctant to load but came away sharply with a brief early lead, gave chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. ORIENTATED gave only distant chase. RAVEN RAHY raced briefly close and was taken
in hand shortly after the start.

Footnotes
KUKULKAN gave chase through the backstretch and raced four wide on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and reached the front the final yards. MAJESTIC
SEAS chased through the backstretch and drew to even terms two deep midway on the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead inside the sixteenth pole but was
outfinished through the final yards. PERTH AMBOY closed to a boxed in position and checked nearing the five sixteenths pole, resumed stride toward the
quarter, lacked a clear path approaching the head of the lane but came on a bit late to take third the final strides. STRONG SAFETY was hustled clear and
angled to the inside leaving the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in at the rail to the challenge of Majestic Seas midway on the turn,
continued close through the upper stretch but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. BANNER MAN came out to make contact with HERCULES HARBOR
leaving the gate then gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail, angled five wide into the stretch and finished evenly, while the latter was bumped at
the break then steadied on the chute and dropped well back from early contention, rounded the turn at the rail and could only close the gap in the lane.
INDUS VALLEY MAN chased, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened.

Footnotes
SOPHIE RULES was bumped leaving the gate, took over into the backstretch and rated the pace, came under pressure entering the stretch and widened
under steady encouragement. CAT LAK engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the stretch but
dug in to recover second mid-stretch. WAITING FOR A STAR broke out to make contact with Sophie Rules then steadied on the chute, picked up the chase
outside and improved in the five path of the turn, was carried a bit wider into the lane then finished evenly to take third later yards. ALLISON K was slow into
stride then gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well to pass rivals. MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased inside, raced
close at the rail on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. DAMISELA gave close early chase then weakened off the rail on the turn. SOLID AS A
ROCK chased the pace inside, steadied off the heels of Mary's Listed Next past the five sixteenths pole and flattened stride. BRING IT ON HOME gave
chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path. This race was hand timed.
