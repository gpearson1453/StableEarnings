SQUARED STRAIGHT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held firm around the turn, came three wide into the lane and stayed sharp under steady
encouragement. RISE UP MOSCOW chased the pacesetter into the turn, hustled up three wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and secured second
best. SMOKE STACK gained position along the outside into the turn, came five wide turning for home then angled in and stayed on for a share. LUCKY
CHANCE lacked early speed, raced wide into the lane, finished with interest and improved position. OUR HY ROLLER raced off the early pace, urged five
wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GIVE A LITTLE chased on the inside through the turn then flattened out in the lane. HELLO HANDSOME
raced off the early speed, turned for home three to four wide and failed to move on. Hand timed.

GO GO SADIE took over the lead soon after the start and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened advantage under pressure in
the upper stretch and held clear in late stages under a driving finish. OUTLAW DAISY broke on top then conceded position to GO GO SADIE, remained
forwardly placed around the turn, was set down two wide for the drive, stayed game in pursuit and closed the gap on the winner in deep stretch. KEBA
LUCKY DAY hustled along in steady pursuit of the early leaders, came out turning for home, bumped with ROPERS N WRANGLERS at the head of the
lane then sustained a steady bid and secured show. ROPERS N WRANGLERS was ridden along the outside around the turn, bumped with KEBA LUCKY
DAY at the head of the lane then lacked the needed response for late impact. SCAM LIKELY raced in contention around the turn then weakened in the lane.
SPARKLING WINE chased on the inside and never threatened. WUMPMUG was not too far back in opening stages then faded around the turn. MISS MY
MAMMA raced in the back throughout. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TIGER'S SONG tracked the pace in the early going then headed in pursuit around the turn, came five wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady
pressure, finished gamely and got up in final strides. MINEHUNTER matched strides out of the gate then cleared on top, held firm around the turn and
saved ground into the lane, roused for more in the upper stretch, stayed on with response but could not hold off the winner approaching the wire.
SHOTGUN RIDER hustled up two to three wide wide around the turn, angled inside in the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained show.
SEATTLE SEE YA raced off the early speed, came five wide into the lane and improved position. ROUGE SUNSET was off to a good start and matched
strides for the early lead, remained forwardly placed around the turn then gave way in the lane. NORTH FORK raced off the early speed, went three to four
wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. AGUA DORADO saved ground along the inside and failed to move into contention. LITIGATOR raced in
contention around the turn then retreated in the lane. Hand timed.

Footnotes
GUARDING ELK CAMP broke on top then quickly came under pressure from SUMMER LOVE, vied through the opening quarter then shook free
approaching the three eighths pole, roused for more turning for home, responded willingly, widened to a commanding lead and kept to task. RED NOVA
tracked the early pace, headed in pursuit three wide around the turn then shifted inside at the head of the lane, sustained a steady inside bid and dug in
gamely to capture place. FICTIONAL raced in range around the turn then came under a drive turning for home, stayed on three deep with response and got
edged out late for place. TWITTERATI launched a bid entering the turn, gained closer contention then raced between foes in the upper stretch and evened
out. KEANNA raced in the back then ridden along four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. RUN FOR BELLE raced near midpack, was
under a ride along the outside at the quarter pole and failed to kick on. TWIRLY GIRL saved ground and failed to move into contention. SUMMER LOVE
dueled for the lead with the eventual winner in early stages, remained in range through the turn then retreated at the head of the lane. Hand timed.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON tracked the pace in the early going then headed in pursuit entering the turn, was under pressure trying to reach the leader at the
quarter pole, stayed on gamely through the lane, surged in deep stretch and edged away. MINISTER OF SOUL gained the lead soon after the start, showed
the way into the turn, held off the bids from an outside duo at the quarter pole, stayed on two wide under pressure through the lane then got edged out in
final stages. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO was allowed to settle through early stages then came under a ride two wide late on the turn, sustained a steady bid
through the lane and secured a share. SWIFT AS I AM hustled up out of the gate and raced in range through the backstretch, flattened out under pressure
around the turn, urged along the outside entering the lane, shifted in a couple paths and had no late response. COLLUSIONIST was forwardly placed sitting
just off the early pacesetter, remained in contention under a ride around the turn then weakened in the lane. BLACK OPS raced off the pace, saved ground
around the turn and failed to move into contention. Hand timed.

FORTY NINE MODEL hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, sustained a two wide bid through the lane and dug in to capture place. DELIGHTFUL
HIPS was forwardly placed behind the early leader, stayed on with response along the inside through the lane and got edged out late for place.
APRILINTHEPINES hustled up two wide around the turn, was ridden along three wide in the lane and needed more for late impact. WITHIN THE LAW
