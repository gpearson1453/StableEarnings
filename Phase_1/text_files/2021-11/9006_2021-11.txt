was no threat late. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR chased the winner and weakened in the lane. GALTERO raced wide early and was no menace. JAMAICAN

Footnotes
LELAWALA pressed early, rallied in the stretch three wide, drew off late under mild urging. MY BACK PAGES raced mid pack early, rallied on the inside,
finished willingly and was second best. MISSISSIPPI MUSE raced mid pack early, closed a gap on the rail. GRAY FASHION was bumped start and settled
early, swung wide, had had a mild bid late. REAL GOOD VYBZ had good position throughout and went evenly. JESS FOR KICKS set the pace with a clear
lead for a half, then faltered in the stretch. WHAT'S SO FUNNY raced mid pack and was no threat. LEX K contended early and was through after a half.
TEST YOUR FAITH was outrun. FRESH MORNING was no factor.
