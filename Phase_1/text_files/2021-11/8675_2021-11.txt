Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL D stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, asked for more in late turn, gained a clear lead into the lane while in the six path,
continued in mid-track through the final eighth and held. IMA N H LADY CAT chased the pace from the two path through the turn, did not go with the winner
into the lane, kept on from the two path and was gaining to the end. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY saved ground through the turns then offered a mild gain late
while never a serious threat. TOUCHING THE SKY set the pace along the inside through mid-turn then weakened in the drive. THE STONE EVENT raced
in the two to the four path through the first turn, continued off the inside through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a serious
factor. K TO THE CAMP was in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and tired.

Footnotes
PROTOMAGIC was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane with momentum, continued with good energy when straightened in
the lane, caught the leader before the sixteenth pole and quickly drew away. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC vied for the lead from the outset while along the inside,
continued on near even terms through the the term and into the lane, still had a short lead with an eighth to go, was no match for the fast closing winner
then stayed on to save the place spot. MISSISSIPPI MUSE pressed the pacesetters three wide through mid-turn, settled off the pace in late turn then got up
for the show spot. SIMPLY COMPLICATED vied for the lead two wide through the turn, was still close up when bumped near the eighth pole then faltered
thereafter. KASS' CHOICE was never a factor while saving ground. I'MPRETTY I'MSMART ducked into sharply to the rail at the start, lost her rider and was
eventually walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF FINISH ORDER. The half-mile
time was omitted due to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
CLOSE THE CASE stalked the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane while two wide, inched up through the lane, was on near even
terms with a sixteenth to go then edged up late. ROCK N JUNE BUG set the pace from along the inside into the lane, dueled with the winner through the
lane and gave ground grudgingly. MAJOR SPARKS was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, shifted in to the rail inside
the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. TOSS OF FATE raced near the rail through the far turn, came into the lane from the three path, raced between
rivals inside the eighth pole, had aim on the top ones but lacked a closing response. MR. GARY D was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane
from the four path and lacked a bid. CIELO AZUL stalked the early pace from the three path, continued three wide into the far turn, swung into the lane from
the five path and tired.

BONNIE BILL chased the pacesetters from the two path through the turn, guided to the inside into the lane, gained momentum inside the eighth pole,
caught the leader inside the sixteenth pole, drove past and cleared late. ORO AZTECA set the pace while along the inside through the turn, continued on a
clear lead with an eighth to travel then could not hold the winner safe while shortening late. HUMBLE WARRIOR was near the rail through the turn, came
into the lane from the four path then offered a mild gain from mid-track. TITLETOWN JUSTICE raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane, gained
momentum inside the three-sixteenths pole and was gaining to the end to just miss the show spot. MALIBU CLASSIC raced near the rail through the turn,
came into the lane from the three path and gained belatedly. METALLIC MAN pressed the pace two wide through the turn and tired after entering the lane.
VENICE BEACH was bumped two times early and was always last.
