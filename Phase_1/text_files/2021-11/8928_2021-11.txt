Footnotes
AEGEAN SEA cleared the field entering the first turn, pulled a bit early, set the pace racing on her own, responded entering the stretch, pulled away and
was kept to the task through the lane. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out and rallied for second.
IMPERIAL MOON stalked the pace, chased the winner on the far turn, weakened and bested the others for the show spot. HOLIDAY RAID raced off the
pace and had no rally. LIGHT UP NIGHT was outrun early and passed tired rivals. SOUR MASH raced three wide early, settled off the rail and faded.
BELONGS TO BABE was steadied at the start, raced off the pace, failed to respond when asked and gave way.

BULLET BUTCH pursued the loose pacesetter, bid on the turn then edged clear late under steady handling. IMPERIAL ROAD quickly took command, was
collared near the eighth pole then steadied late when issue decided. FAR MO POWER dropped back outside, moved very wide and closed well.
HELOSTHISMARBLES chased off the pace three wide then flattened out in the stretch. UPTOWN SHOES saved ground throughout and lacked a rally.
KINDA CLASS'Y lacked speed between rivals and was always outrun. STELLA'S TOUR raced very wide throughout and was never in contention. ALPHA'S
CANDY MAN moved three wide and gave way on the turn. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

PLATINUM ICE rushed to the front inside, widened easily on the turn and maintained a big advantage under mild coaxing. MY FIRST LOVE urged close up
down the backstretch, pursued the winner inside but proved no match. DECISIVE CAUSE advanced inside then went evenly through the stretch.
OUTWORKABLE hustled outside off the leaders and lacked a rally. LUNA FORTUNA flashed speed outside and began fading on the turn. MISS ATOCHA
STAR dropped back early and lost contact with her field.

no match for the winner. CAPE COD SALLY prompted the leaders outside, raced wide and finished well. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE saved ground off the

always outrun. SWEET SAVAGE hustled to a narrow advantage then began fading on the turn. LET'S CELEBRATE lacked speed and gave way readily.
