Footnotes
TWOBITSARIDE rated close inside the first turn then eased out with a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, threatened two deep midway on the turn and
took over while losing ground into the stretch, dueled clear mid-stretch and held well with steady handling. J J WEDGIT MAN settled back two deep on the
opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the five path of the far turn
then dug in through the lane to take second the final strides. LUFTY'S KISSES rounded the first turn in the four path and took the lead three wide past the
half mile pole, drew clear at the three eighths and was pressured from that point, was caught at the rail nearing the top of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch
then flattened later yards. RUM RUNNER RED steadied early and rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five and six paths of the far turn and finished well outside. ADIOS SEE YA stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. EXPLOITATION saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the
three eighths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the
inside to set the early pace, was caught leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back at the three eighths and faded at the rail on

Footnotes
JACKLIGHTING settled in the three path the first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and improved four wide on the far turn, dueled to the lead
mid-stretch, drew clear past the sixteenth pole and held on well. BUFF N saved early ground then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced five wide on
the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. KITE SURFER saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far
turn, angled to the five path into the stretch and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. CHESTNUT LIME settled just off the pace about the three
path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, closed to a slim brief lead three wide midway on the far turn but was caught toward the head of the
lane and flattened the final sixteenth. VIDMER'S COURAGE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure from the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at
even terms, was met at the rail midway on the far turn but held on to about mid-stretch before weakening. SONDE ST BLUES stalked from the two and
three paths on the first turn then challenged at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms and continued close between horses on the far turn, but was
shuffled back leaving the turn, angled to the rail then weakened. MASTER YOO dropped well back while saving ground and could only close the gap.

FIRE DOWN BELOW settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, dug in from the
top of the lane to take over mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. CREEKMORE steadied off the heels of Johnny Obvious into the first turn and settled off
the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the five sixteenths and drew clear into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn
but was met mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. HAN SENSE raced boxed in past the five eighths pole and settled off the pace, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths, improved at the rail on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch and was gaining on the runner-up. WALL settled back in
the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, lacked room in the three path of the far turn, came between horses into the stretch and ran
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. HOBE SOUND rounded the opening turn in the three path then angled outside into the backstretch, bid toward
the seven sixteenths pole, ran seven wide on the far turn and passed a rival. AWESOME BUZZ rounded the first turn in the five path and settled close
outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened three wide on the far turn. MEGA MILLIONS stalked off
the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened toward the far turn. TOM TERRIFIC stalked in the four path the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn. JOHNNY OBVIOUS was hustled to the lead through the front stretch
and moved to the inside entering the first turn, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths, gave chase
from that point but faded midway on the far turn.

Footnotes
GRECIAN ADMIRAL settled of the rail on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to near
even terms three wide approaching the top of the lane then dug in under determined handling to edge out the game effort of PISTOL P, who rated a slim
lead inside and was met at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that point and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely to the
winner leaving the turn but grudgingly ceded in later yards. REMYS SHOWTIME stalked from the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn, but dropped back into the lane and flattened later yards.
PONTICELLO saved ground racing well back on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly through the
lane while outfinished for third. OFFICER APPEAL rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. CHARITABLE VISIT settled back in the three and four paths the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and showed little more. NAUTICAL WARRIOR rounded the opening turn about the four
path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn. WONDER HOW raced with the pace through the front stretch then
stalked into the first turn, was at near even terms leaving the turn but faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
STAR OF NIGHT stalked off the rail then drew close and challenged toward the three eighths pole, closed to the lead two deep at the quarter, ran clear
leaving the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. BOUNDTOBEBAD took a quick lead inside and rated the pace, dug in to the challenge of Star Of
Night nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the quarter and remained close at the rail through the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and was
steadily handled to hold second. DOOR BUSTER settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn then dueled through the stretch for third. STOWE ANGEL saved early ground then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn in the three path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. NURSE TOMPKINS saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase at the three eighths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and passed a rival in the lane. SEE YA MANANA steadied off the heels of Door Buster in the first turn and settled off
the pace from the seven eighths pole, bid nearing the three eighths, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride. THE BETTER ONE settled back
off the rail on the opening turn and showed little response from the half mile pole. POWER FORWARD rounded the first turn five wide and settled off the
pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
VICTORY ROYALE took the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn, was steadily handled to mid-stretch then
taken in hand later yards. REAL APPEAL pressured the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn, took over second past the eighth pole and was steadily
handled through the lane. TRUENO FUERTE pressured the pace three wide, dropped back midway on the turn, gave up second past the eighth pole but
ran evenly through the lane. EX RATED broke a step slow and gave chase detached from the field through the backstretch, angled outward on the turn,
entered the stretch about the six path, was bumped outward at the eighth pole, but finished evenly outside. NICKY D gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the four path, raced evenly to late stretch then flattened nearing the wire. DAFFYDILL chased toward the inside, angled out and
made contact with Ex Rated at the eighth pole, then flattened stride while lugging in. SMITTY'S PRINCESS chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn,
checked at the inside flank of Daffydill nearing the head of the lane and showed little more. ANOTHER EXCUSE engaged in close early chase then faded in
the four path of the turn.
