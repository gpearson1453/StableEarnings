Footnotes
BAND CAMP , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was patiently rated well off the duel, swung four wide in upper stretch, closed outside
horses, led late and drew clear. THE LAST JUMPSTART saved ground around the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, advanced between horses
in mid stretch and rallied inside foes. MR. HOUGHTON bore in leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside SUPER BOURBON, went clear in mid
stretch and faded late. HAMPDEN LANE chased the pace in the two path around the turn, floated out in upper stretch and weakened. SUPER BOURBON
bumped with LA TACHE leaving the starting gate, rushed up down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail dueling with MR. HOUGHTON and gave way late.
LA TACHE bumped with SUPER BOURBON leaving the starting gate, trailed and swung to the six path turning for home.

Footnotes
KING'S RIVER , bumped at the break, recovered and settled within range and off the inside, came under a ride mid turn, shifted out five wide for the drive,
closed determinedly outside rivals while on his left lead, took over late and was edging away at the wire. DANCE FOR GREEN , bumped with the winner at
the start, raced forwardly while about four wide early, dropped in some around the turn and stalked the dueling leaders, raced three wide into the stretch, bid
to the inside of BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH in mid stretch, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining, kept on gamely but could not withstand the winner's
surge. BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH attended the pace outside DUNPHY, moved to engage that one leaving the far turn, sparred then gained a short lead into
the lane, wandered outward a couple of paths while clearing, corrected with a right handed ask, was taken on from his inside in mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. WESLEY THOMAS , in the clear stalking into the turn, raced three wide and outside a rival in upper stretch, angled out to be about five wide
past the three sixteenths and churned on. MISTER AGENT broke a bit slow, was sent up inside rivals soon after and stalked, dropped back a bit under a
ride leaving the far turn, came back while saving ground nearing mid stretch then flattened out. GET LIKE MIKE , off the pace, was ridden two wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. BIGDADDYSBOY came in a bit at the break and bumped with the winner, dropped off the pace and failed to generate a run.
DUNPHY sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, got involved in a duel to the inside of BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH nearing the three eighths,
battled to upper stretch then succumbed.

Footnotes
MEDAGOOCH prompted the pace, gained a two wide lead entering the stretch then drew off under steady handling. BLUE KINGDOM , in the three path
between horses entering the turn, moved to the four path turning for home and rallied mildly outside rivals. ROUND DANCE , four wide entering the turn,
chased the pace and gave way in the drive. WITHOUT PRETENCE lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch and
passed foes. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. WHITE SERIES was a brief factor between
horses leaving the backstretch and gave way on the turn. CHOCHOCHO hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MALINOIS was nudged clear early, set a rated pace removed from the inside, was confronted from his outside while three wide into the lane, dueled
maintaining a slim advantage under a drive nearing mid stretch, spurted back clear soon after then widened while kept to task. SECRET ZIPPER stumbled
at the break, recovered and moved up four wide outside rivals around the first turn, stalked three deep through the backstretch run, was under a hearty ride
pursing the leaders three wide into the lane, shifted in leaving mid stretch and kept on with good effort to gain the place. FORMAL AFFAIR , three wide
stalking the winner, moved up four wide under a ride to join that one into the stretch, dueled heading to the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly while
on his left lead. DESVIO , inside a par of rivals, edged up under asking nearing the half, angled out near the five sixteenths, wandered out to about the
seven path entering the stretch, corrected but came up empty in the final furlong. EDDIE FELSON , between rivals a long way while chasing the pace,
dropped back past the five sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch and faded. PHOTO HOP failed to menace and gave up ground through the lane.

remained off the rail while chasing the winner around the turn and weakened in the stretch run. CHAVETA saved ground around the turn, angled out in

TAKE A HINT , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted in a bit when taking the lead in mid stretch then edged clear under brisk urging.
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail setting a pressured pace, opened up a bit leaving the turn, was hooked in mid
stretch and gave way grudgingly. COFFEEWITHCHRIS , not an early factor, circled the turn three deep and rallied mildly outside foes. ROMINSKI prompted
the pace for a half mile then weakened. KENNY HAD A NOTION , always well off the inner rail, was outrun. EXCULPATORY , a forward factor along the
inner rail early, was done on the turn and retreated through the stretch.

TOO MANY KISSES was squeezed back from between rivals leaving the chute, settled well off the early pace while saving ground, eased out and around a
rival leaving the three eighths, dropped back in to advance inside a foe nearing the lane, came back out and worked her way between runners leaving mid
stretch, shifted out as the leader drifted, closed in under right handed asks, took over late and edged clear. ROYAL WHISPER , a bit rank leaving the gate,
steadied soon after then angled out and rushed up four wide outside runners to take command, edged clear near the half, moved away while guided inward
around the turn, remained well clear under a drive past mid stretch, drifted out late and gave way grudgingly. BAY STREET vied inside ROYAL WHISPER
early on, rated back off that one and angled out near the half, stalked around the turn, was under pressure three wide pursuing in upper stretch, stayed on
with effort to deep stretch then flattened out. BELLA BETTINA , three wide between rivals leaving the far turn, angled out and picked up some momentum,
closed in while about five wide past mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain. MY FLICKER settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out then back
in past the five sixteenths, edged up along the rail in upper stretch, chased and faded. SULTRY SALLY H , three to four wide, made a mild run leaving mid
stretch then failed to sustain. FAST TRACKED moved up towards the rail near the half to chase the leaders, appeared to want to get out leaving the far turn,
dropped back, swung out well wide in the drive and failed to threaten. GOLDEN TABBY prompted the early pace off the inside, faltered between rivals near
the five sixteenths, was pulled up in upper stretch while bleeding from both nostrils then was vanned off.

SHAFT'S BULLET stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command near the quarter pole then drew off
while under brisk urging. IT'S SIZZLING TIME lacked speed, circled the turn three deep, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. DOUBLE
CROWN prompted the pace outside NIMITZ CLASS and gave way turning for home. NIMITZ CLASS set the pace along the inner rail, weakened in upper
stretch and dropped back in the late going.

R B'S BIG MOMENT , patiently handled towards the inside while stalking the pace, responded when given her cue and took over along the rail past the five
sixteenths, spurted clear into the lane, drifted out a bit then held firm under a drive. LORRAINE'S WAY , four wide early, edged up outside a rival leaving the
five eighths, bid three deep mid way on the final turn, failed to quicken with the winner entering the lane, stayed on willingly while on her left lead and saved
the place. TOHONORSTELLE settled off the pace, advanced to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, angled four wide with run nearing the lane, drifted in
a bit in upper stretch, corrected but lacked a solid finish. BACALL , off the pace, angled towards the rail leaving the five sixteenths, saved ground into the
stretch but lacked a rally. THREE'S A CROWD was outrun. BREAKING RULES rushed clear into the first turn, dropped in a bit and set the pace two wide,
was joined from both sides nearing the five sixteenths, faltered in upper stretch and wandered outward through the drive. PRINCESS ANISA was used wide
early, faltered leaving the far turn and was eased in the lane.
