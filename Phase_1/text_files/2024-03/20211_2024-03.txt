BAHITI quickly took the lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and held on with
steady stretch handling. SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground racing well off the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn and finished well. HONOUR'S CHOICE raced off the rail the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. AVALANCHE IS COMIN stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off
the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. DREAM OF GOLD saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed
little response.

PHOTO FINISH ducked out and made contact with La Macchina Rossa leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, challenged three wide nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and got up later yards. QUEEN JELLY BEAN raced with the pace inside and
dueled leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in from the head of the lane but reluctantly ceded later yards. AIM'S JUBILEE
settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted toward the head of the lane
but finished evenly to close the gap. YOU CAN'T WIN hopped from the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. YOLO CHARLOTTE rounded the opening turn about the four
path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the six path on the far turn. LA MACCHINA ROSSA was bumped leaving the gate, raced at
the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. NAMI raced in the four path the first turn and never factored. PURE NONSENSE
angled in and raced with the pace two deep, had a slim lead between poles but was caught toward the three eighths pole, faded into the far turn, was pulled
up with a fatal injury midway on the far turn and was euthanized on the track.

CURLIN'S MALIBU rated close off the rail the first turn, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod at the quarter, dueled
from that point and drew clear mid-stretch then widened later yards. KENNY HAD A NOTION raced with the pace two deep, took the nod into the
backstretch and came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met while between horses at the quarter, steadied midway on the far turn, angled
to the four path leaving the turn and came along to take second the final strides. TWO BIT KID moved to the inside and rated the pace, was met into the
backstretch and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced a close factor at the rail on the far turn but flattened nearing mid-stretch. CANDY
INVASION saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. SPRITZER stalked
from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response and was eased the final quarter mile. The Stewards
reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Curlin's Malibu for alleged interference midway on the far turn, lodged by the rider of Kenny Had
