ONE LAS OLAS saved ground racing well off the early pace, started her bid leaving the three eighths pole and entered the far turn off the rail, angled to the
five path through the turn, dug in leaving the turn and closed quickly to take over the final yards. REVEIRS MINUTE took the lead nearing the three quarter
pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in under steady handling leaving
the turn but was caught in the final yards. CLEARLY VISIBLE was reluctant to load and settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, steadied inside the sixteenth pole and flattened late. CHURCH KEY stalked off the rail the first turn,
picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened nearing mid-stretch. MYGIDGETMARIE stalked inside on
the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. ILLUSION OF HOPE raced well back

clear toward the head of lane and held well under steady handling. JUST MURPHY gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path, dug in leaving
the turn and got up for second later yards. COURT TUDOR gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn, angled to the outside at the eighth pole and
dueled to take third the final strides. JUBA'S MOCHA gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, lacked room approaching the
eighth pole but came between horses later yards and finished well. LOVETHEBAND chased, rounded the turn near the rail and finished well.
