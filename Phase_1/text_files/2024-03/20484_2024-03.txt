Footnotes
IN OUR TIME broke a tad slow, tracked in the two path, waited behind a quartet rounding the turn, was roused while angling out to the four path at the top of
the stretch, kicked on to bid approaching the sixteenth, and inched past an inner foe in the final strides. GHOZ ON vied for the lead inside, took a firm
advantage midway around the turn, was cued in the two path at the top of the lane, dug in when facing an outer challenger passing the sixteenth, but was
edged out in the final strides. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS broke out at the start, chased in the five path, was driven four wide around the turn, fanned out to the
seven path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. GOOD MAGIC WOMAN stalked in the four path but lost ground under a drive around the turn,
and made no impact from the three path down the lane. MY SARASOTA QUEEN dueled for the lead in the two path, got floated out to the five path turning
into the stretch, but faded. KHOZANKA pressed in the three path, but drifted out while weakening down the lane. BULLET ON TARGET trailed throughout
around the five path.

for place. PRINCIPIA rated in the five path, tipped to the two path going into the turn, was coaxed approaching the quarter, tipped out to the six path at the
top of the lane, and was along for show. SASSY CHARLEE got sent to set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, but faded in the
stretch. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING stalked in the four path but weakened turning into the stretch. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER stumbled at the start and lost the

Footnotes
PALACE VIEW (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two path, was coaxed from the three path midway around the far turn, fanned out to
the seven path at the top of the lane, drifted back in to the four path while rallying, and drew clear of an inner duo in the closing stages. MR BRIZEL stalked
in the two path, was nudged along the inside around the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the stretch, angled back inside passing the eighth
pole, and ran on to be up for place. MISTER ABARRIO bumped with an outer foe at the start, showed the way in the two path down the backstretch, was
cued along the inside midway around the far turn, drifted out to the four path while clear passing the eighth pole, tipped back inwards, and evened out
between foes late for show. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) laid up close in the three path, bid around the far turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch.
HARRINGTON tracked in the four path, was roused into the far turn, but flattened down the stretch. DIAMOND MESSA got a bit keen early around the first
turn, rated in the three path down the backstretch, but was no menace.

Footnotes
FORTUNA BELLE set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter, but kicked on to retake
the lead while floating out to the four path at the top of the lane, went clear passing the eighth pole, and just held off an outer pair. GITANA tracked in the
three path, was roused between foes midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on, but just missed to settle
with place. CLAY SOLDIER stalked in the two path, was ridden from the rail around the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on
between foes for show. AVATAL HERO raced off the pace in the two path and made no impact. LOVIN MAKES CENTS prompted the pace in the five path,
took a narrow lead in the four path midway around the turn, was cued passing the quarter. but lost the lead in the five path entering the stretch, then lost the
whip around the sixteenth while fading. STARSHIP SUNRISE chased in the four path but weakened down the lane. SPEED SALSA trailed throughout from
the three to five paths.

inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. LET THEM WATCH steadied early, raced four wide and never threatened. DOT steadied early,
raced three wide and made little impact. EL TERRENO dueled inside of the winner to upper stretch, stopped and was eased.
