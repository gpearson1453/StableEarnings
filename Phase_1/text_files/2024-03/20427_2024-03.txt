passing the quarter pole and kicked clear in late stretch. MIAH SAID dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the bend from the three
path and dug in in the lane but was caught late. MAMAS LULLABYE pressed the pace on the outside early, continued to battle from the four path around
the turn and could not go with the top two on the stretch but chased on from there. CHIEF HARLAN raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the two path and showed no kick. GRAY ENOUGH hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside through the
opening stages, came around the bend in the five path and made no bid. SWIFT DANCER dueled between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back
while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
FREEDOM ROAD pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the lane.
LORD BERRIER bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path
coming around the bend and kept on to the finish. RARE JEWEL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the three path
and finished evenly. BIG BUCKSALOT bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch,
dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and weakened further in the lane. SAN COSTANTINO bumped mildly with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, dueled from the rail through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch. GROUP HUG bumped
with the horse to his outside at the break, dropped back to trail well behind the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was never
a factor.

Footnotes

backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and dueled to the wire to get up for the win late. NELIDA bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn
and dueled to the wire to just miss. JUST MERCY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, saved
ground around the second bend and improved position in the lane. MILES OF SMILES bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the three
path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the three path and chased on in the lane.
ARMONIA raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the
stretch. D CITY GIRL saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and weakened in
the lane. NINETY NINE saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and tired in

backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path and made no bid. EMPIRE GIRL saved ground early, trailed the field up the backstretch,
