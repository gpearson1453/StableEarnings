Footnotes
BEST IMPRESSION was taken in hand early, steadied while keen behind the leader as that foe dropped in coming to the three-quarter pole, continued to
be rated under stout restraint while behind two foes, drafted inside while pocketed early on the turn, was let out while finding room at the five-sixteenths then
eased into the two path, gained to make an outside bid in near the three path into upper stretch, took the advantage inside the furlong marker and proved
best under steady urging. STAMP OF APPROVAL went to the front, moved in leaving the chute, showed the way on a solo lead, controlled the action while
inside on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came off the rail into upper stretch then was put to the crop, lost the advantage to the winner inside
the furlong marker and was outfinished but just held the place. AUTUMN'S TURN was urged along towards the rear, moved closer late on the backstretch,
went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, gained on the top two in the final furlong and finished well to just miss the place.
THE TACO LADY moved in leaving the chute, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased two to three wide on the turn,
dropped back near the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch, moved out in the final furlong and tired. LUMENIQUE ducked in at the start and was
off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear while well behind, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
LOTSA TROUBLE broke in at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide before briefly tucking to the two path, came under coaxing three
wide at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged
clear to the finish kept to task. BRICK AMBUSH broke in hitting the near side stall at the start and was steadied when losing his lane as rivals came inwards
from the outside, conceded three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, got displaced from the front near the sixteenth pole and kept on to just get the
bob on the wire to preserve the place honors. MAD BANKER chased three then four wide down the backstretch before going three wide through the turn,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on through to the finish and just missed the
place honors by a nod of the head. ALWAYS A WARRIOR coaxed from the gate, dueled four then three wide down the backstretch with ALLIED ATTACK to
his inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, seized command outside that station and swung four wide for
home, dug in under challenge from flanking threat and was collared a furlong out, then weakened through to the finish. ALLIED ATTACK coaxed from the
start, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his outside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. SOLO IN PARIS broke in at the start and took over the lane of the gate striking BRICK
AMBUSH forcing that rival to steady in behind, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch,
faltered, and was eased home to the end.

Footnotes
SKI PATROL showed speed while moving in early then came back outward, disputed the pace on the outside, inched away in the four path midway through
the turn, extended the advantage near the quarter-pole, responded well when asked for more in upper stretch and held under steady urging. LAFITTE'S
FLEET was urged along on the outside, chased in the five path on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. CO
CONSPIRATOR was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of the winner while well off the rail, moved in late on the backstretch, vied
three then two wide on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, was ridden along passing the five-sixteenths, pursued the top two in the stretch and
lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. WINNING DRIVE was well placed down the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail early on the
turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. HONORARY DEGREE broke a step slow, settled at the rear, raced inside early
on the turn then shifted to the three path under urging, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor.

backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge inside the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the finish to score. IRISH TENOR established the front and showed the way three then two
wide, shook away to a clear lead and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, continued to draw clear to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat
and was caught in the final jumps to the finish shying out under a left handed crop late. SANDY SWEET TOOTH four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. AELFGAR chased just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and tipped out two then three wide, swung five then four
wide into upper stretch, kept on one paced to the finish. BARRON'S BOUNCE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. WITHIN VIEW broke in at the
start trading a bump with BOSS THREE O TWO, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucked to the two path through the
turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHORE TIME chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MERAVIGLIOSO showed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that opponent on the turn, spun off the
inside into the stretch, shook clear at the three-sixteenths, responded well while drifting out a bit in the final furlong and held under strong urging. RUVIES IN
TIME was forced in early then steadied while shut-off, settled between horses, went around the turn in the two path, was roused inside the five-sixteenths,
turned into the stretch in the three path, moved out outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. TEMPERMENTAL was last to commence,
moved up on the outside then tracked the pace, was asked in the three path on the turn then chased the leaders, came five wide into the stretch, was
carried out some in the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. EROS'S GIRL broke out then was corrected by the rider, bumped
with a foe near the three-quarter-pole, settled on the inside, was taken up while pinched back leaving the backstretch, shifted to the two path early on the
turn, remained on her inside lead until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to rally. DARN THAT SONG angled in
quickly while showing speed and bothered foes, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, was
carried out outside the furlong marker and tired. MAGGIE broke out at the start, bumped with a rival near the three-quarter pole, settled between horses,
dropped to the rail leaving the backstretch, shifted three wide outside the five-sixteenths pole, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. PER
RULING CM2024-116/ECM FROM THE NEW YORK RACING COMMISSION, MERAVIGLIOSO WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

BE THE BOSS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and was up in the final jumps to prevail. EXCELLENT TIMING established the front and showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, got set down spinning six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing late threat and
was caught in the final jumps to the finish while clear for the place honors. WRITER'S REGRET chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. BEACH BOY AL chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at

Footnotes
KUPP bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was hustled to the lead, controlled the action while inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path,
spun three wide into the stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND broke
in then was hustled, showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn, kept on well in the stretch and willingly earned the place
while no match for the winner. WHAT'S UP BRO chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
tired while able to get the show. NARCISO DALI moved out early then was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the six path, came seven
wide into the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and improved position. GOT THUNDER was last to commence, raced off
the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. RYAN'S CAT dropped back early then was hard ridden off the pace, went five then
four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. AUTHORIZE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was
urged along at the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, moved in some near the furlong marker and
failed to threaten. DREAMS SHE DREAMS bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MUAZARAH veered in at the start forcing CLASSIC KINGDOM to steady and then bumped PICCOLO DIAVOLO, established the front and showed the way
in hand just off the inside, came under some pressure from MY MAN WOODY near the quarter pole and got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, then edged clear under a drive. CONNIVING chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tipping out five wide through the turn coming
under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. PICCOLO DIAVOLO
got bumped at the start by MUAZARAH, who veered inwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch and ran on to procure the show honors. MY MAN WOODY four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and advanced to latch on and apply pressure to the leader near the quarter pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. MR. GEORGIE chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, tipped out six to seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. CLASSIC KINGDOM broke a half a beat slow, then got steadied at the
start when MUAZARAH veered inwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under brief coaxing near the three-eighths and
once more near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. CASTLECOVE SPIRIT three wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired.
