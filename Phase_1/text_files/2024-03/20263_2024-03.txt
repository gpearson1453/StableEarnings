PRINCE MARCO tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and kicked clear in the stretch. MEAN
TWEETS stalked the leader on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in the lane. COLLECT REDEMPTION led the
field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, was caught in upper stretch and chased on in the stretch. DREAM KNIGHT chased the leader on
the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the bend from the two path and kept on from there. GRAND ROCK raced off the pace up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and never threatened. SLIPPERY WHEN WET raced in the middle of the pack early, continued around the turn in the three
path and faded in the lane. GARMENTO trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPIKEZONE led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and held clear to the wire. JUST BEAT THE ODDS stumbled leaving the gate,
tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground late. FLIPPING FISH stalked the leader on the
outside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the four path and chased on in the lane. RAINBOW'S PRIDE chased the leader early,
came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. CAPTURE THE LION raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and never threatened. GET EVEN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and
made no bid. SAINT TAPIT trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and was never a factor.
