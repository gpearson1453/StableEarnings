PLANET FROLIC stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn and dug in under determined handling to eke out the nod over the game effort of SAYYESTOTHELADY the final strides. The latter rated a slim lead
inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely leaving the turn, but ceded the
nod in the final strides. DIAL HER settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path and dug in to take third the final yards. EMBERLY raced in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened leaving the eighth pole. TIMEISGOLDEN saved ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but
flattened stride near the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
LEGENDAIRE was forced out into the opening turn and raced in the five path through the turn, took the nod three wide leaving the half mile pole, came
under pressure past the three eighths pole, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, dug in determinedly leaving the turn and edged ahead later yards.
STOMPING MOON was forced out into the opening turn then corrected course and stalked two deep, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dueled gamely to late stretch before reluctantly ceding. SISYPHUS raced in the four and five paths
the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in from the head of the lane and held on for third.
ARROGANT RIDER raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four
path and ran evenly in the lane. GOLDEN ADAGE steadied early then saved ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and showed little in the lane. MALIBU COWBOY had a slim lead inside through the front stretch but started to drift into the first turn, was met
leaving the turn then kept in check and faded through the backstretch. LIVING THE DREAM raced off the rail the first turn, angled to the outside past the
three eighths pole and ran wide on the far turn.

into the far turn and was steadily handled in the stretch. ABUNDANT STORY settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole
and angled five wide into the far turn, left the turn outside and finished well to take second later yards. MISS ARGENTINA saved ground on the first turn,
picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced four wide on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. JUJU ON DA
BEAT rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened stride. FROSTY RIA raced with the pace
inside, was met and gave chase leaving the half mile pole, dropped back past the three eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened. AMELIA'S
