STORMED OUT close up between horses three wide, was bumped into LEWIS AND CLARK nearing the turn, steadied a bit, responded readily when set
down four wide in upper stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker under a right handed whip and drew clear. MOR CRAFTY bobbled at the start,
rushed to the lead soon thereafter, set the pace until mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner. MY HOMBRE chased the leader four wide down the
backstretch, drifted in a bit bumping STORMED OUT Into LEWIS AND CLARK, kept on into the stretch and faded late. FORMYBOYS was a forward factor
inside rivals for a half then weakened. LEWIS AND CLARK had good early speed between rivals two wide, was bumped nearing the turn causing his rider to
check and dropped out of it. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

CHECK OUT LINE allowed to settle, closed willingly three wide through the turn and into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker and drew off
under right handed urging. CAT'S RHYTHM unhurried early, shifted five wide at the top of the stretch, rallied late three wide and got up for second.
SCARLETT'S AWISH dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. HERE COMES JIGS trailed through the turn, swung wide and
passed tiring rivals. COWCHI stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch and lacked then needed response. TALE OF THE LYON battled for the lead
along the inside into the stretch then weakened. SWEET EMPIRE was through after a half.

CAGUA stalked the pacesetter from three wide through the turn, rallied in upper stretch, engaged the leader midway down the lane and drew clear to the
wire convincingly. J P'S GLADYS hustled up the fence to take the lead leaving the chute, set a well rated pace, responded when challenged turning for
home and was no match for the winner down the lane while a clear second best. ROSY APPLE prompted the early pace, dropped back losing position on
the turn and made a mild bid in the stretch to garner the show. KINGSTON TIME tracked the pace from the rail, saved ground on the turn to be well
positioned and lacked a closing bid. SECRET SEDUCTION was one-paced never posing a threat.

Footnotes
KADESH pressed the pace throughout while under stout restraint down the backside, rallied turning for home, wore down the pacesetter in mid-stretch,
opened a clear advantage and held the closer safe. ICE BLAST slow early to be the distant trailer, gradually made up ground into the final turn, found best
stride late and closed well belatedly to be gaining in deep stretch. SMASH set a pressured pace to mid-stretch and tired late in the lane in a game effort.
SUDDEN SHIFT tracked the leaders to the far turn to be well placed on the final bend and failed to mount a closing rally. BLAME IT ON EDDIE failed to
menace. STRIKE THE TOP was never a threat.

INSIDE STUNT set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, disposed of the presser, responded when challenged by the closer, dueled through the lane and
prevailed in a game effort. ROCKSTAR RO tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch, battled head and
head through the lane and came up just short while clearly best of the rest. MUTUAL CONFIDENCE slow early to trail, made a steady, grinding advance to
be along for the show. TRIGZ TOO chased the early pace to be in contention and faded on the bend. LIMIT UP pressed the pace for a half mile and
weakened in the lane.
