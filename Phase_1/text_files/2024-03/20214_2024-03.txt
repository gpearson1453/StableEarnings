Footnotes
WASABI BOY set the pace from the inside, then came two wide off the turn and dug in gamely to hold on late to prove best under a drive.
COUNTERFEITCURENCY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn but could not get up to just miss. BRODIX was well placed two
wide early, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out late. FINANCIAL STRENGTH tracked the early pace on the inside, then was shuffled back on
the turn, eased out leaving the five sixteenths and swung out five wide leaving the turn and finished well. BROTHER SHOWTYME was rated early, made a
four wide move on the turn but flattened out in the lane. ROCKIN THE PALACE was settled early, three to four wide on the turn and came six wide into the
lane but had no late rally. SUNSHINE HARRY hit the gate coming out the gate, then raced wide and was not a threat. ROAN FOR THE ROSE was settled
back on the inside and never factored.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S MISS was bumped at the start, made a three wide move on the turn and dueled for command off the turn and drew clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best under left handed crop urging. FIREBALL EXPRESS set the early pace and then was confronted leaving the quarter pole and dueled
for command to the furlong marker but then could not go with the winner while saving the place award. SWEEPING PASSION stalked the early pace three
wide, then dropped to the inside on the turn by the quarter pole while chasing, then needed more late to just miss the place award. DUST BUNNY was
settled early, advanced three to four wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane but needed more late. B B QUEEN was reserved early towards the
inside, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. BIONIC KAT showed good early speed on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S DEFENSE was away alertly to set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and drew off smartly under left handed crop to
prove much the best. NEVA'S GIRL pressed the pace three wide and then came four wide off the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while
winning the battle for the place award. VIROLOGIST tracked the early pace three wide, made a quick move to go in between rivals by the quarter pole but
flattened out, lost bob for place award. NO COMMON CENT was settled early, came four wide into the lane, then drifted in through the lane and had no late
kick, bested rest. WINNING MOON was off slowly, then passed the tiring rivals. AUNT JO tracked the pace on the inside and then was empty. UPTOWN
CHARLY GIRL failed to menace. SENSIBLE MARRIAGE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. SHORT OF DINERO showed brief foot and
stopped.

POWERFULLY BUILT pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to gain a short lead nearing the quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the drive
and held on to prove best. EAGLES CRY was reserved early, shifted out and made a five wide move on the turn and came wide into the lane, closed well to
just miss. GAGETOWN was bumped at the start, then advanced and moved up on the inside on the turn, then waited behind the vying leaders nearing the
quarter pole, swung out three wide leaving the turn, then dove back towards the inside to make a two wide bid nearing the furlong marker but hung late.
GENGHIS chased the early pace five wide, then angled in on the turn and advanced two wide by the quarter pole, then lacked room leaving the furlong
marker and angled in to the rail by the sixteenth marker and ran on well. INDIAN LAKE tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole
but flattened out in the final furlong. DALTON tracked the pace and was three wide on the turn but lacked the needed kick. MEET ME AT MUNDIS was
allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and was full of run by the quarter pole, then had to check when blocked nearing the furlong marker and lost
all chance, rough trip. BRIT'S CANDYMAN set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.
