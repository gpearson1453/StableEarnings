Footnotes
PIMENOVA broke out at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, bid early into the far turn, stuck her head in front midway around the far turn, was
coaxed from the three path into the stretch, and kicked on, drifted out in the final sixteenth, but dug in to hold off an outer foe. CHILLING FACTOR stalked in
the five path, ranged up passing the quarter, ran on from the five path into the stretch, bid inside the final furlong, but got herded out causing her to switch
back to her left lead, and hung late for place. ANONYMOUS SOURCE tracked in the two path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, floated out to the
four path in upper stretch, and chased on for show. FUNTASTICA hopped at the start, trailed in the three path and never menaced in the six path down the
lane. NIGHTSABER (GB) showed the way in the three path down the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, but yielded in the stretch.

Footnotes
VIBRANT LADY settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes, swung five wide in upper stretch, kicked in and was up and clear late. PARALLEL
raced off the early pace two wide, made a four wide move around the far turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, drew clear soon after but was no match
for the winner late. SLEEPWALKER raced in range inside and finished evenly to gain the show. LADY O'BRIEN chased the pace inside and lacked the
needed rally. TINTA ROJA set the pace inside and weakened in midstretch. MEXICAN SUGAR bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, bid three
wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. BONMATI stalked the early pace three wide, bid two wide around the far turn, briefly led near the quarter
pole and tired in the drive. ITS SATISFACTUAL saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn, checked in midstretch and had no further
bids. BABY BLOCKS bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn and failed to sustain the bid in the lane.
STAR PERFORMANCE was outrun while racing two and three wide. TRES LECHES was pinched at the start, saved ground and never factored. LUNETTA
JAK played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
SMOKIN CLOUD prompted the pace from the three path into the turn, was coaxed along around the turn, stayed on from the four path into the final furlong,
switched to his left lead around the sixteenth, and drew past an inner foe. ACAMAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, tipped to the
rail entering the turn, was cued midway around the turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. GEPARD set the pace in the two
path, waited under confident handling around the turn, was roused from the two path into the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong to be caught by an
outer pair. EXALTED CHARM bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but made no
impact. GONE NUTS chased in the three path but never threatened from the seven path in the stretch.

TRAVEL HAPPY set the pace n the two path and widened under a drive. TAKE THE COOKIES was bumped at the start, advanced four wide around the
turn, was no match for the winner but kept on for the place. COLLECTED DREAMS raced off the early pace, advanced five wide around the turn and
flattened out a bit in the drive. SMART JENNY chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. MY SWEETHEART DANI failed to menace while
racing four wide. ELLAGIO pressed the pace three wide and tired in the drive. REVOLU chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. LADY
OAKRIDGE was bumped at the start, raced five wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
DRUM ROLL was prompted along from in range along the inside, continued under a ride along the rail rounding the turn, got put in tight in upper stretch, but
surged thru passing the eighth pole, took the lead around the sixteenth, and held off an outer foe. WISE AND ELEGANT rated in the four path, floated out to
the five path midway around the turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied for place. LOVE MAMI LOVE stalked in the three path, was
cued passing the quarter, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane, kept on to narrowly lead passing the eighth pole, but was outkicked on both sides
to show. EUPHIMA (ARG) pressed in the three path, bid around the turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, but evened out in the final furlong.
DELTA CHARM hopped at the start, set the pace inside, was roused from the two path into the stretch, but faded. BOSSY DIVA tracked in the two path, but
was stymied between foes in the three path passing the quarter, and came up empty.
