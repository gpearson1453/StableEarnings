MAKE IT A DOUBLE pressured the pace and dueled to even terms approaching the eighth pole, dug in under determined handling and took the nod in the
final stride. SUPER WILDCAT took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was
nipped in the final stride. MIDNIGHT REGRET bobbled from the gate and was squeezed a stride later, gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the
rail on the turn then flattened later yards. SEEMS TO WHISPER broke inward and made contact with Midnight Regret then gave chase, entered the turn off
the rail, angled to the five path through the turn and flattened in the lane. DAPHNE'S FIRE broke outward and made contact with Midnight Regret then gave
chase and rounded the turn about the six path. ALWAYS SOMETHING had a brief early lead then gave chase, but weakened in the four path on the turn.
THUNDER BOSS pressured the pace to the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at that point and weakened off the rail on the turn.

PROFITUNITY rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Debt Relief approaching the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was
kept alert in the stretch. JOLENES ECLIPTICAL saved ground on the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and settled for second. DEBT RELIEF stalked two deep the first turn, challenged nearing the three
eighths pole, dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the turn. COWGIRL NATION saved ground on the opening turn, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch but showed little further. WAC IS FAST came out
and made contact with Pass The Cash into the first turn then settled off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail
on the far turn. CHELLS GIRL broke outward, rounded the opening turn in the three path and never factored. PASS THE CASH was bumped wide into the
first turn then closed toward contention leaving the half mile pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn. The Stewards
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Wac Is Fast for interference into the first turn, lodged by the rider of Pass The Cash, and as a result, disqualified
Wac Is Fast to seventh place.

ROYAL PAIN saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and entered the far turn near the rail, angled to the four path approaching the top of the lane,
dueled for the lead mid-stretch and edged away later yards. BOSS E BOOGS tapered in and stalked the early pace off the rail, took the nod at the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, had the lead midway on the far turn and was
steadily handled leaving the turn, but relented inside the sixteenth pole. MOTIVATING raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile
pole, ran in the three path on the far turn and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. GOLDEN ARM was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside
then rated the pace, was met and dueled at mostly even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far
turn then flattened near mid-stretch. PERSONABLE became a bit anxious in the gate and rounded the opening turn about the four path, left the turn outside,
angled in past the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased back out entering the stretch and showed little in the lane. CAPTAIN CREED
raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the five path and weakened. WOODLINE stalked the early
pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn.

Footnotes
GRAND ESCAPE pressured the pace inside and took the nod at the quarter pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and was steadily handled
to hold on well. PROTA steadied through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then dug in leaving the eighth pole, eased out late stretch and finished
well. PRIZE FIGHTER steadied at the start then gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and finished well to take third later yards. GRAND FIBER
ducked in and made contact with WILD BEHAVIOR leaving the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the six path and finished well; outside.
The latter was jostled leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. LOADED SNIPER set a
pressured pace, was met at the quarter pole and raced close two deep on the turn, but weakened inside the eighth pole. SUPER JORDAN ducked out and
made contact with Wild Behavior leaving the gate then pressured the pace through the backstretch, dropped back three wide midway on the turn and
weakened in the stretch. CAJUN FUN was not a factor and rounded the turn about the five path.
