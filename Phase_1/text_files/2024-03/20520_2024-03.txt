Footnotes
LAST DIAMOND outrun early, made a four wide gain late in the turn, challenged entering the stretch, kicked clear under steady handling. KANT CONQUER
ME with the early pace while between horses, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch then
could not keep up the final furlong, held the place. MACHO STRIKER forwardly placed early along the rail and inside the runner up, fell off the dueling
leaders turn while attempting to get out midway on the bend, slowly gaining for the second spot late. GENTLE BEN behind the pace along the inside,
continued evenly through the stretch. NO MO WHINING off slowly, continued to trail for a half, angled out five wide late in the turn, improved position with
some belated interest while remaining well out in the strip. DAY JO with the early pace outside, dueled turn in the two path, first to blink turning for home.
MO ANGELL lacked speed, three to four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. TAP VALLEY in the second flight while racing three wide, was
finished after a half.

Footnotes
MITOLE'S LEGACY away in good order, set the pace inside, asked for more into the stretch, drew out steadily under firm handling. NO PAY NO HAY broke
alertly, pressed the winner from the two path for a half, proved no match for winner through the stretch, narrowly gained the nod for the place. TOP REVIEW
hesitated at the start, moved up to mid pack, steered three wide late in the turn, roused, finished willingly to narrowly miss the place. DEVIOUS DIVA behind
the pace inside early, angled out steadily to be four wide turning for home, slight bother mid stretch, lacked closing kick. TORREY STREET forwardly placed
outside, moved closer three wide turning for home, flattened out through the stretch while drifting slightly. SHARP ATTACK off a step slow, off the pace in
the two path, came up empty for the drive. RESOLUTION remained back while racing three to four wide. CATHOLIC SUE fell back to trail after the start,
was always outrun.

Footnotes
JUST LIKE MAGIC settled off the early pace inside, continued to save ground up the backstretch and into the far turn, moved closer while reaming inside
late in that bend while in some traffic, slipped through entering the stretch, drew clear under steady handling. AMAZING GAL closest to the leader off the
inside, challenged in the three path turning for home losing ground to the winner, could not get to that one the final furlong, proved determined for the place.
HALAGA broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, continued to set the pace the middle half, allowed the winner the
inside entering the stretch, could not match that one to the wire, outfinished for the runner up position. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL settled off the pace and
the inside, crept slightly closer four wide late in the final turn, lacked a further advance. HASHTAG WINNER turned in a one paced effort while racing mostly
in the two path. UNDECODED raced three wide and lacked a rally. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER saved ground to no avail. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO squeezed at
the start to be away slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LOOK SHARP slipped and lost footing at the break, was used a bit to move up and become a forward factor by late backstretch, dueled into the lane, shook
clear, enough left to last. QUEBRANCHO back off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, closed belatedly down the middle of the strip to be
rapidly getting to the winner in the waning strides, too late. SCOTT CITY broke alertly, cleared toward the rail, pace, dueled inside winner late turn, could not
match that one nor contain the runner up, comfortably clear for the show. PREPAREDNESS void of speed for a half bit rank in some traffic late in the turn,
staged a mild late rally to improve position. PERSCRIPTURE broke back, lacked speed, moved out, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally in
the drive. GUST OF WIND last to leave, raced back early, improved four wide late turn, flattened out in the drive. STAUF in mid pack early, began to fade
before a half. SEEKING CHROME tracked the issue up front toward the inside and began to weaken before a half, continued to fade stretch.

Footnotes
SULWE allowed the pace to early while in the two path, continued one paced up the backstretch, angled three wide when moving to challenge second turn,
took over, clear past the furlong marker, held the next two safe late under firm handling. CASHMERE BABY tracked while racing along the inside, closer
second turn continuing along the rail, brief bid turning for home then could not keep up with the winner. KABOOM BABY lacked early foot while racing off
the inside, advanced four wide late in the final turn, lugged in past the furlong marker and then stalled. C. C. HARBOR off a step slow, trailed for six furlongs
while saving ground, came in the two path for the drive and displayed some mild late interest to improve position. MOCHA KISS broke alertly, clear early,
extended that advantage the second quarter, faltered when headed turning for home. HOT SPRINGS BLING closest to the leader while three wide for five
furlongs, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
DELUCA in mid pack through the first turn, pulled while caught up in traffic onto the backstretch, bit closer three wide and in additional traffic turning for
home, angled in a bit, challenged between horses inside the furlong grounds, proved determined late to be best. GREERS FERRY within striking distance
outside, closer three wide then challenged on the outside into the stretch, vied past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going. FAMOUS FINAL SCENE
sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace inside, continued to hold a slight advantage late in the final turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the top two
a furlong outside then weakned. P R CALL ME MAYBE back off the pace and the inside, loomed a threat four wide late in the final turn, flattened out in the
drive. JUST BE HAPPY raced off the pace while inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, went evenly down the stretch in lacking a closing
response. PHENOMENAL DREAM forwardly place along the inside, inched closer on the rail behind the leader late in the final bend, a bit tight into the
stretch, had little left when clear through the stretch. GOLDEN DIVERSION prompted the pace while in the two path, remained forwardly placed, in traffic
late in the final turn, gave way. IMPECCABILITY hesitated at the break, remained always back. RAINBOW MAN broke back, was never involved.

Footnotes
ALAMO in the second flight outside, ranged up four wide after tipping out a bit turning for home, engaged the leader soon after and wore that one down
under firm handling. KAVA in mid pack and along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, moved out to bother LATIFAH entering the stretch,
slight closer between the two leaders nearing the furlong grounds, altered course to the inside and finished with good courage to earn the place.
GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN broke alertly, set the pace while rating in hand, continued to show the way into the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top two
until late. SHE'S MO FANCY in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked the needed closing response. LATIFAH chased the
leader while off the inside, continued to pursue while three wide through the second bend, was beginning to tired when bothered by the runner up in upper
stretch, continued to falter. BOOGIE ON went one paced throughout while three wide turning into the stretch. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS void of speed while
four wide through the first turn, continued off the inside, four wide again exiting the second bend, lacked a rally. MONEY IS TIME off a step slow, never
menaced. FABULOUS TALE was finished early, trailed to be always outrun.

Footnotes
MAHOMEY lacked early foot while out in the strip, raced four wide through the turn, moved out widest for the drive, rallied down the middle of the strip, late
bid outside, edged clear. BLAME J D back off the pace in the two path, continued back through the turn, rallied through traffic to finished willingly and be in
time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. AL'S ROMEO moved up after the start to be clear early, showed the way through the turn inside,
continued to hold the advantage past the furlong marker but could not contain the top two. WHERE'S RANDY broke back, dropped inside for the run
through the turn, angled out three wide around a pair of rivals exiting the bend, moved back toward inside and improved position. PEACE DOG away in
good order, forwardly placed four wide through the turn, chased past the furlong marker then weakened in the final furlong. SHAKE UP in mid pack and
three wide, continued one paced through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. ATTA PARTY prompted the pace three wide, weakened from between
horses past the furlong marker. MIRI A COINCIDENCE off a step slow, moved up to mid pack off rail, three wide into the lane, came up empty for the run to
the wire. IM THE MACHINE void of speed, five wide through the turn, failed to rally. DIDJA in some early traffic to be bothered, moved up when free, raced
forwardly for a half then gave way through the stretch. MACHO ROCCO in the second flight inside, gave way in the turn, stopped, jogged in well back.

Footnotes
MAXIMUS MAGIC moved up to show the way into and through the first turn closest to the inside, continued to set the pace, two path second turn, allowed
the runner up the inside nearing the furlong marker, late duel to the wire, dug in late to prevail in determined fashion. COUNT DRACULA tracked the issue
up front along the inside, continued to save ground in some traffic second turn, lodged a bid along the rail and inside the winner with a furlong remaining,
dueled to the wire, outgutted in the final strides to miss. PAPPY'S REVENGE away in good order, pressured the winner from the outside until a furlong
remained then could not keep up with that one or the runner up, all out to save the show. GIVE ME A REASON also in the first flight, four wide through both
turns,had little left in the final furlong as well. BRILLIANT MAN off a step slow, three wide and in some traffic into the far turn, improved position a bit without
posing a serious threat. WILLY D'S lacked speed, four out to five wide through the final turn when making a mild advance, flattened out and went evenly
through the lane. SEARCY in the lead group while five wide into the first turn, angled in to save some ground, two path second turn, no rally.
GEWURZTRAMINER broke back, void of speed, moved well out in the strip to be five then six wide far turn, failed to rally. CASH ONLY was finished after a
half. BIG TO DO was also through early.
