Footnotes
MI AMORE rated in the two path, was cued while three-wide passing the three-eighths, ranged up passing the quarter, swept to the lead while floating out to
the five path entering the stretch, then tipped back inwards while drawing clear. SPIRIT OF VICTORY stalked in the two path, came under a ride while
tipping to the rail entering the far turn, had to wait briefly around the three-sixteenths, but chased on from the four path down the lane for place. JESS'S
MOMENT had a slow start, trailed in the two path, was under right handed encouragement rounding the far turn, cut the corner turning into the stretch, and
kept on for show. INABLINK bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was coaxed early into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path
entering the stretch, but made no impact. MY LITTLE SECRET showed the way in the two path, was cued midway around the far turn, but faded in the two
path down the lane. AFFECTIONATE prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn, steadied between foes just before the quarter, but
came up empty from the four path in the stretch. OUR MAGIC PRINCESS bumped at the start with an outer foe, raced off the pace in the four path, but was
pulled up midway down the backstretch, and vanned off.

LOOKINFORBARGAINS settled off the pace inside, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled three wide turning for home, surged clear and
continued to widen while lugging in through the final sixteenth. JUST THE SKY raced off the pace inside and rallied for the place. GALILEO'S JEWEL (IRE)
set the pace between foes, cleared late on the first turn, led inside to midstretch and held well enough for the show. MS LADY DE VEGA (IRE) raced two
and three wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. JUSTICE JULIA stalked the pace three wide and faded through the stretch. PRINCESS CAIRO had
early speed inside, tipped two wide midway down the backstretch, pressed two wide around the far turn and tired in the stretch. Z TRAIN (IRE) was outrun
inside. VERSIFY saved ground and failed to menace. TENACIOUS EMPRESS was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
KHOSEA tracked inside, was coaxed into the far turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, rallied while tipping inwards, bid passing the
sixteenth, and got up on the wire. LINNY KATE had a slow start, raced off the pace in the two path, ranged up under coaxing while four wide approaching
the quarter, took the lead in the five path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on, but got nailed at the wire by an outer foe to place. NANA FANNY chased in
the two path, but lost ground and had to steady midway around the far turn, angled out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and kept on while on her left
lead for show. A RING THING showed the way in the two path turning into the backstretch, was cued along the inside early into the far turn, but flattened
from the two path in the final furlong. RUNAWAY BREEZE bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid two wide passing
the quarter, but faded from the four path in the final furlong. TAPPLE CIDER bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, was cued while
three wide going into the far turn, but failed to menace.

ROUGH DRAFT stalked in the two path, was cued from the rail passing the quarter, swung out to the four path turning into the stretch, kicked on while
closing with an outer foe into the final furlong, and prevailed between foes in the closing stages. BORDER TOWN tracked in the four path, was roused
midway around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, ran on in tandem with an inner foe while tipping in slightly, and got edged out by that foe
late to place. SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) showed the way from the two path around the first turn, tipped out to the three path entering the backstretch,
merged back into the two path going into the far turn, was called on for more run passing the quarter, kept on from the two path into the stretch, but was
caught by an outer pair around the sixteenth to show. WICKED FINN rated in the three path, was roused passing the quarter, tipped out to the six path at
the top of the stretch, and stayed on. EYES ON TARGET steadied along the inside around the first turn, laid off the pace from there down the backstretch,
waited along the rail rounding the far turn, was roused turning into the lane, but made no impact. MEHLEK trailed inside, was coaxed midway around the far
turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but did not threaten. FIGHTER IN THE WIN laid up close in the four path down the backstretch, was
cued from the three path into the far turn, but gaveway between foes entering the stretch.

Footnotes
WICKED MERCURY set a rated pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. STARSHIP PIONEER had her head turned at the start, advanced three wide
around the first turn, bid three deep around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but kept on well to hold the place. QUEEN
MACHA saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. MISCREANT failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. ALYBAER was hard held inside and lacked a closing bid. MINT EDITION was outrun while racing four wide. OKAY FINE pressed the winner two
wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH tracked in the three path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, kicked past the inner pacesetter just after the eighth pole, drifted out late,
but held off an outer pair. BURNIN TURF rated in the three path, was cued midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch,
but got herded out and bumped an outer foe late while running on for place. RUSE bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed inside, came under a ride
midway around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kicked on, but got bumped by an outer foe late to settle with show.
STAT showed the way in the three path around the first turn before tipping inside entering the backstretch, was roused passing the quarter, tipped out the
two path entering the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. ENGLISH BEE bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two path, was ridden into the
far turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, but hung on his left lead and finished evenly. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) stalked in the two path,
was roused into the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. AMERICAN SPEED got carried out to the six path around the first turn, raced off the pace in the
five path down the backside, but never threatened. BLUEBIRDS OVER floated out to the five path around the first turn, raced in midpack from the four path
but never menaced.
