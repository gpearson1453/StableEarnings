Footnotes
DILGER (IRE) tracked in the four path, got put to a nudge in the two path early around the turn, tipped out passing the quarter, was floated out to the five
path at the top of the lane, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, and had enough to hold off an outer foe late. SECRET CRUSH bumped with an outer foe
at the start, prompted the pace inside of foes from the three path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the turn, lost ground while angling out to the six
path in upper stretch, and kicked on, but just missed getting up for the win. REYNOLDS CHANNEL laid up close in the five path, took the lead passing the
half and tipped into the two path entering the turn, was cued passing the quarter, angled out to the four path at the top of the lane, but evened out in the final
furlong to show. COME TO PAPA had a slow start and trailed in the three path, floated out to the five path midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven
path at the top of the stretch, and made no impact. YANKEE DRUMMER stalked in the six path, was ridden from the four path into the turn, but weakened
down the lane. BANDOOLA chased in the five path but was empty entering the stretch. NAVESINK PIRATE bumped with an inner foe at the start, vied for
the early lead between foes in the four path but yielded between foes early into the turn.

Footnotes
LIVE HIGH LIVE LOW settled in range while racing three and four wide between foes, stormed to the front near the sixteenth pole and drew off under a
drive. OCALA ROCKET tracked the pace two wide, was bumped in upper stretch and briefly veered out, straightened out and ran on between foes to gain
the place late. RAPSCALLION was bumped after the start, steadied into the first turn, raced in range two wide, waited for room nearing the quarter pole,
angled to the rail in midstretch and rallied inside. SUGAR IT'S ELI raced off the pace two wide, advanced five wide around the far turn and had a mild
stretch gain outside. MISSION MIKE was bumped at the start, raced three wide off the pace, made some progress in upper stretch and flattened out.
GIURO dueled inside to upper stretch, bumped with ANDADOLU in upper stretch, edged ahead of that foe, led to the sixteenth pole and tired late.
HABERDASHERY saved ground off the pace, dropped back down the backstretch, angled four wide near the quarter pole, swung ten wide in upper stretch
and was no threat. JAKE'S AFFECTION was bumped at the start, chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a closing bid. RAGS SPECIAL steadied
entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace around that bend, made a four wide gain around the far turn but faded through the lane. ANADOLU veered
out at the start, advanced four wide around the first turn to take the lead late on that bend, dueled two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn,
bumped in upper stretch and faltered. LAST POST stalked the pace two and three wide, was shut off nearing the eighth pole and checked out of it. TIZ
MARKS SPIRIT was bumped after the start, checked entering the first turn and trailed while racing well off the rail.

Footnotes
BEELINE showed the way in the two path, was roused from the rail when challenged passing the three-eighths, lost the lead to an outer foe passing the
quarter, but dug in gamely to retake command in upper stretch, drifted out in the final sixteenth, but held on. IMPROPTUDE tracked in the three path, got
put to coaxing going into the turn, was floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, ran on down the center for place, and just missed getting up for the
win. PATRIOT SPIRIT got a bit keen while racing in range along the inside going into the turn, then was stymied in the two path rounding the turn, angled
out to the six path turning into stretch, tipped in for the final sixteenth, and kept on for show. VALIANT FORCE bumped with foes on both sides at the start,
chased in the five path, ranged up three wide to bid midway around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, swung from the five path into the stretch, but
flattened. SHIP TO SHORE prompted the pace in the four path, bid two wide midway around the turn, stuck his head in front passing the quarter, but faded
from the four path down the lane. SIR FLASH bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the six path, was cued in the five path midway around the
turn, but was empty entering the stretch. STARSHIP MOCHA bumped with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EASTBOSTONBENNY set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. STAR OF THE BEAST raced in range three wide
and finished willingly to narrow much of the gap. QUESTER raced off the pace two wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show.
CALYPSO CHARLIE went evenly while racing four wide. DOCTOR'S ORDERS hit the starting gate, raced well back three wide, swung eight wide in upper
stretch and rallied belatedly while getting in. EVERY FOUR YEARS failed to menace while racing four wide. STICKY MCSHNICKENS chased the pace from
the rail and weakened in the drive. SNIPER JACK was bumped at the start, raced five wide and never threatened. URGE TO MERGE (IRE) prompted the
pace two wide and tired in the drive. J J VALENTIN was bumped at the start, raced four wide and made little impact. THINGSRGETTINHARRY hesitated at
the start and was never involved. TRICKY TIGER was outrun inside.

Footnotes
NEW ROME opened up early into the first turn to set a clear pace in the two path down the backside, waited confidently rounding the far turn, received a
right handed cue turning into the stretch, drifted out in the in the final furlong, but held sway. MY SUNNY VALENTINE bumped with an outer foe at the start,
laid in midpack from the three path down the backstretch, was coaxed from the four path into the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane,
and ran on for place. FISH MOONEY rated in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kept on to get
up for show. IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path, was roused from the rail passing the quarter, swung
from the four path turning into the stretch, and stayed on while tipping inwards in the final furlong. LADY MAEVE (IRE) tracked inside, was cued midway
around the turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, but flattened. CHICK'S SHADOW chased in the four path, fanned out to the seven path
turning into the stretch, but was no menace. KIZZY stalked in the three path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SAMARITANO stalked the pace two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, seized command near the eighth pole, drew clear soon after and lasted late.
MOONRISE DRIVE saved ground in range, edged closer two and three wide around the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied through the lane
and just missed. BANDERO raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. BOLD ADVANCE
raced off the pace four and five wide and had a mild belated rally. I AM THE GAME pressed the pace in the three path, dueled around the far turn and
through midstretch then weakened. NATHANIEL'S HOPE set the pace along the rail to midstretch and tired. BREAK THE ICE came in and bumped SHAKE
YOUR BONES soon after the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. LAW OF THE JUNGLE failed to menace while racing two wide. JEBY
saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn, swung ten wide in upper stretch and was no threat. TRUTH AND HONESTY tracked the
pace four wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole but faltered in the lane. SHAKE YOUR BONES hit the starting gate then was bumped soon after, raced
two wide and made little impact. MACUTO was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MR SKYLIGHT had his head turned as the gates opened, chased in the four path, was ridden five wide around the turn, angled out to the six path passing
the eighth pole, and drew past an inner for in the closing stages. UNEQUIVOCALLY set the pace inside, was roused from the two path early around the
turn, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, and ran on, but was caught in the closing stages to place. MARCHE rated in the two path, was cued in the
four path early around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on to be up for show. BOURBON SOCIETY was prompted along
while up close in the two path, ridden in the three path around the turn, but was one paced. COUNTRYBOYSURVIVE raced wellback in the five path, was
driven in the six path around the turn, but made no impact from out in the nine path down the lane. TEMECULA tracked in the three path, was ridden
between foes in the four path around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. PRINCETOWN stalked inside but faded in the stretch. ARTFUL DREAMER had
a slow start and always trailed.

Footnotes
GAYLES EVENING prompted the pace in the three path, bid passing the quarter, swept to the lead turning into the stretch, and kicked clear. BARBARA had
a slow start, raced off the pace in the two path, tipped out to the four path rounding the turn, was roused while fanning out to the nine path entering the lane,
and ran on for place. DRINKS ON ME bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased inside, was coaxed from the rail midway around the turn, tipped out to
the four path and bumped an outer foe at the top of the stretch, then finished evenly for show. DEMURELY race in midpack between foes from the two path
early but had to steady just after the half, angled out to the seven path turning into the lane, and was one paced. SERENADE A KITTEN hit the gate leaving,
trailed in the three path early and made no impact. BLAZINGLY bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, was roused three wide passing
the quarter, bumped with an inner foe from the six path in upper stretch, and faded. SPEED SALSA raced wellback along the inside but never threatened,

ARTHUR'S RIDE set the pace in the two path and drew off handily. NOBLE DRAMA trailed four and five wide and rallied for the place. CAPE TRAFALGAR
was hard held early, advanced four wide around the turn, bid outside of the winner near the quarter pole, lugged in in upper stretch and was no match for
the winner. FULL SCREEN stalked the pace three wide, shifted further out turning for home and faded. BIG MARTINI prompted the pace two wide and tired
in the drive. FURIOUS ANGER pressed the winner down the backstretch and retreated inside around the turn.

ADMISSIBLE laid off the pace in the three path, waited in the two path rounding the turn, bumped an outer foe to force her way out to the seven path in
upper stretch, and rallied to get up on the wire. MY LADY JAMES prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path passing the quarter, took the lead
while being roused from the five path into the stretch, was briefly clear around the sixteenth, but got nailed by an outer foe at the wire to place. CYMBAL
COURT got bumped twice by an outer foe at the start, tracked inside but had to steady going into the turn, split foes in the two path passing the quarter,
floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on while tipping inwards in the final sixteenth for show. JORDI'S DREAM bumped an inner foe twice
at the start, stalked in the four path but had to steady early, was ridden around the turn, but got bumped out to the eight path in upper stretch, and finished
evenly. KICK A RHYME (IRE) trailed in the four path, was coaxed in the five path midway around the turn, but made no impact. SILVRETTA (GB) chased in
the five path, but got herded out to the ten path in upper stretch, and did not factor. BOSTON ROSE (IRE) rated in the four path but never threatened.
FROZEN SOLID laid up close in the three path but had to steady going into the turn, and failed to bid. CAVU set the pace in the two path but gaveway in the
final furlong.

split rivals turning for home, bid between foes but was outkicked. UNION TRAIL was bumped at the start, prompted the pace three wide and was one-paced
through the lane. FLY RIGHT raced just behind the early, became keyed up early on the first turn, moved up between foes to take the lead late on the bend,
drew clear down the backstretch, set the pace along the inside from there to midstretch then weakened. SAINT IN THE CITY had a shoe repair prior to the
race, set the early pace along the rail, settled inside when a rival became intent on the lead, re-bid two wide around the far turn but faded in the drive.
MOHEGAN failed to menace while racing two wide. BE THERE broke in a tangle, raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened.
COPERNICUS was crowded at the start, saved ground and made little impact. STOKE THE FIRE broke inwardly and bumped at foe at the start, had some
speed three wide and steadily faded. WILD GUESS hit the starting gate, raced three and four wide and had no response.
