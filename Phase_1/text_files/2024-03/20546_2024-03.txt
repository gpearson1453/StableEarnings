Footnotes
MALLOY saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, rallied along the inside during the drive and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away.
BALI DREAMIN set the pace while racing slightly removed from the rail, was unable to resist the winner late but held on well for the place. KAELY'S
SISTER prompted the pace from the outset, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole but lacked the needed late response. INDICIA was
unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and gained het best stride too late.

Footnotes
SWEET NELLIE vied for the lead with YOU'RE A DANDY while three-wide, shook clear nearing the eighth pole and increased her advantage. YOU'RE A
DANDY vied for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly at the three-sixteenths pole and held on fairly well for the place while being unable to stay
with the winner late. HALLIE'S RAINBOW prompted the pace from between horses, steadied in tight nearing the three-eighths pole dropping back slightly,
then angled to the inside nearing the three-sixteenths pole and rallied along the inside for the show. NIFF saved ground while being forwardly placed,
steadied briefly nearing the three-sixteenths pole while HALLIE'S RAINBOW came over in front of her then angled out and finished in a mild rally.
LUNARCHY was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. RIBALDRY (IRE) saved ground while being
unhurried early but lacked a rally when asked. ZENCHUA SKY dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. THE
RIDER OF HALLIE'S RAINBOW LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SWEET NELLIE FOR THE INCIDENT NEARING THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE
AND THE RIDER OF NIFF LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HALLIE'S RAINBOW FOR THE INCIDENT NEARING THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE
BUT AFTER VIEWING THE REPLAY OF THE RACE THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGED IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. PINBALLER settled in the middle of the field while three-wide but lacked a rally.
CINDY'S STORM brushed at the start with FLYING SAMURAI then raced five-wide and failed to menace. FLYING SAMURAI brushed at the start with

Footnotes
GOLDEN HORNET saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. CORTESE saved ground while being unhurried, angled out for room
nearing the eighth pole to be six-wide and finished fast. SHACKLEFORD STRONG was allowed to settle, moved up four-nearing the quarter pole and
finished in a mild rally. COMISKEY PARK saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch but lacked
the needed late response. TILTED TOWERS was forwardly placed while racing five-wide and weakened. LOOKIN FOR BALA prompted the pace to near
the stretch while racing two-wide and tired. FEVER NATION dropped back early while three-wide and failed to menace.

BEEHIVE saved ground setting the pace while racing in hand and drew clear when asked. DEVIL prompted the pace while two-wide, could not reach the
winner but was clearly second best. THE LAST THRILL chased the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. I DID
THE MATH was allowed to settle early, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. SILVER EYES forwardly placed from the start, was five-wide
the final quarter and weakend. TU ROYAL settled in the middle of the field, was six-wide the final 1/4 and failed to seriously threaten. CHERYL'S APPEAL
saved ground while being reserved off the pace and failed to menace. COLLIE WRAYS KITTY broke slow and out then dropped further back and was not a

Footnotes
WILD BOUT HILARY prompted the pace while racing two-wide, took the lead from SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW leaving the sixteenth pole and won going
away. SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW saved ground setting the pressured pace, was unable to resist the winner late but continued on for second in a game
effort. BE MY BESTIE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished well in a steady effort. SALLY'S SUPRISE settled in the middle of the field,
came six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. HAPPY WORLD steadied while in tight along the inside nearing the seven-sixteenths pole then
continued to save ground while clear and finished willingly. BROKEN HEARTS BAY was unhurried after breaking a step slow then came three-wide into the
stretch and went evenly late. TALKTOMEJUSTICE was five-wide on the turn then eight-wide entering the stretch and weakened. SECRET OPERATION
dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. BLAZE BEAUTY was four-wide on the turn then came seven-wide into the stretch
and failed to menace. ANGEL EXPRESS failed to threaten while racing three-wide. RUMBRANDT was prominent early racing along the inside and gave
way nearing the stretch. THE WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE PLACE PACK 8 were 1/3/4/5/6/7-1/5-3/8-2/5-3/6/8-1/5/8-2/5-2/4/5/9.
