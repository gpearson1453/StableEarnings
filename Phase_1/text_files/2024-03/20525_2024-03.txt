CEES GET DEGREES coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure from
the runner up latched on to the outside, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from that rival through the length of the
stretch and gamely and stubbornly repelled that rival to prevail on the wire. EMERALD FOREST brushed the near side stall at the start, came under coaxing
and chased four wide down the backstretch before advancing to prompt the pace three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped
five wide into upper stretch, dug in latched on to the outside of the leader through the length of the drive and could not go by getting rebuffed to the finish.
LOST IN ROME coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on through to the finish, but was outrun by the top pair.

Footnotes
MYSTIC NIGHT established a forward position, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the lead passing
the five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch in the four path while under the crop, responded well while dueling inside of FIRST GLIMPSE into the final
sixteenth and just held under strong urging. THUNDERIAN bumped with a foe early, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved to
the three then four path late on that bend, came six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed gradually to just miss while up for
the place. FIRST GLIMPSE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
reached even terms for the lead while five wide into upper stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and just missed while caught for the
place but was clear for the show. JUST CALL RAY bumped with a rival early then checked in tight quarters, moved out near the seven-eighths pole, settled
at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, dropped to the four path at the quarter-pole then moved a bit further in and
lacked the needed kick. PREDICTED bumped with rivals on both sides early then was taken up in tight quarters, moved in before the seven-eighths pole
then advanced to take the lead, showed the way with some company to his outside, vied inside for most of the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, came
out to close the two path under extra left-rein pressure late on that bend and tired.

MANDATORY was restless in the gate but broke on top, angled in early, was urged along on the outside, gained three wide on the turn, made a bid late on
that bend, took the advantage in the four path into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and
proved best under strong urging. WHAT'S UP BRO went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his inside, moved clear leaving the backstretch, went
around the turn in the two path, was challenged late on that bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch, fought on with the winner while remaining on his
inside lead in the drive and missed while just able to get the place. CHILENO was urged along at the rear, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went five
wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead outside the eighth-pole, gained in the final furlong, switched back to
the proper lead inside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. KUNSHAN BRIDGE was taken up in tight
quarters near the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace under some coaxing, moved out leaving the backstretch, was urged four wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong, was put to a hand-ride outside the sixteenth-pole then not urged in the final
sixteenth while lacking the needed kick. BEZOS pressed the pace on the inside under urging, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased while saving

Footnotes
TAVIN forwardly placed from the start, advanced to engage AMY'S LIGHT in head to head combat taking narrow command five and a half furlongs from
home, dueled with that rival into the turn and shook her off to the inside near the seven-sixteenths when engaged by BLUE EYED WARRIOR to the outside,
dueled with that rival from that station to the five-sixteenths when placed to coaxing, shook away from that foe and swung three to four wide into upper
stretch now faced with the challenge from the runner up, dug in dueling for the third time in game fashion clinging to the lead and getting bumped by her
main danger a sixteenth out, fought on resolute to prevail on the wire. BORNFORGREATNESS chased four wide down the backstretch and into the turn
before tucking three then two wide advancing on the front with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the stretch to
the finish with the aforementioned foe coming in and bumping her main rival near the sixteenth marker, but was ultimately denied at the end. AMY'S LIGHT
broke in at the start and was corrected and came outwards forcing PRETTY UP to steady off her heels, showed the way narrowly and briefly from the two
path before dueling with the eventual winner along her inside, got shaken off near the seven-sixteenths and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took
the inside route into upper stretch, came again keeping on to secure the show honors. DAME CATHERINE seven to eight paths of the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish.
LOVE LIKE CRAZY chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered no response.
PRETTY UP broke a half a beat slow and was steadied at the start when AMY'S LIGHT came over in front, conceded four lengths to the front, chased five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. AWESOME
GLO coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung six wide for home and tired. SUN AND WIND chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and tired. BLUE EYED WARRIOR broke out at the start and was corrected, raced seven paths off the inside in aim of the front down the backstretch, tucked
three wide into the turn and advanced to duel for command from the seven-sixteenths through to the five-sixteenths, steadily got shaken off and swung
three to four wide into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

Footnotes
DONEGAL SURGES tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead in
upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. LOCKE AND KEY was well placed just
off the pace, came under urging while two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, chased the winner on the outside into the final
sixteenth, gained on that foe late but missed while clear for the place. TEN CENT TOWN pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn,
took a short lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. D'ONT LOSE CRUZ came away
well, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail while asked on the turn, lost the advantage at the five-sixteenths pole then moved to the
two path, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. BEACH BOY AL settled outside under some urging, came under stronger encouragement while five wide
on the turn and failed to threaten. THE INSTITUTE settled near the back, was roused while three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PINEAPPLE MAN pressed then chased the pace on the outside, raced in the three path on the turn, kept MAGNIFICENT MILE in behind the leader turning
into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths pole then took the lead, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under strong
urging. CHALKY CAT settled on the outside while towards the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, went four wide for most of the turn,
shifted five then six wide late on that bend and improved to just get the place. AGILITY went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside
on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought inside the winner into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the place while just able to get
the show. MAGNIFICENT MILE settled in a good position, saved ground on the turn, steadied while in tight along the rail in upper stretch, altered out near
the furlong marker then lacked the needed kick. SOUTH STREET dropped back at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went two then three wide on
the turn and failed to threaten. YOUBETTERBEJOKING was hard ridden towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch
and lacked the needed response. QUICK HAMMER was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved
from the rail to the two path on the turn and came up empty. G MUNNING was restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at the break, was urged along off the
pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and capitulated. THANK YOU JON bumped with a rival at the
start, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and had nothing left.
