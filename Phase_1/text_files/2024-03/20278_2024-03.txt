best. JOE PHILLIPS unhurried early on, rallied widest from far turn and coming on in the final sixteenth but too late. KNIGHT'S CROSS tracking from two
path, ran on in the stretch and along for show spot. MAGNA RULER sharp speed to the lead, stayed on to the stretch but weakened in the late stages.
WIND TWIST no speed throughout, ran on from far turn to move up mildly. INHERENT POWERS was squeezed back at the start, inside trip to far turn
chasing top pair, could not go on and faded back in the stretch. CHAMBERS BAY chased the pace from two path, angled out stretch, gave in. JINGLE bit
tardy from the gate and never menaced throughout. THALBERG never menaced throughout .
