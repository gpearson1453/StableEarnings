show. DOCTOR DOOM trailed early, angled wide on the final turn, offered a mild rally while wide in the stretch. LUCKY AS A SEVEN hustled clear early,
led to the far turn then faltered. ET'S MAGIC MAN saved ground within striking range then proved empty in the stretch.

IRISH CORK raced close up on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out for the drive, rallied outside in the stretch run, dug in gamely to the end
but second best. B DAWK broke inward, raced close up outside a rival, stalked three wide on the backside, chased on the far turn and weakened.
UNBRIDLED BOMBER raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. MAGIC MICHAEL raced off the rail, off the pace,
came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. DONTMESAWITHME vied two wide for the early lead, then pressed the pace, chased on the far turn
and faded.

Footnotes
UNCLE ERNIE quickly took control, repelled early challenges then gradually widened under a steady drive while never seriously menaced. FACTOR IT IN
broke slowest, advanced inside and closed well to be easily second best while no threat to the winner. DOLLARIZATION settled off the leaders, angled wide
in the stretch and finished willingly. SCARAMOUCHE chased wide just off the leaders and weakened in the stretch. BOURBON MUSIC prompted the
winner along the inside then gave way through the lane. FIVE DREAMS dropped back outside, remained wide and lacked a response. HUSHION pressed
the pace for half a mile then stopped through the stretch.

quarter pole and rallied mildly on the rail for third. DATHOSS bobbled at the break, raced off the pace between horses, moved up to challenge on the turn,
dueled two wide past the quarter pole, dug in to midstretch, then weakened. BOYS AND BULLETS raced off the pace with an inside trip and closed
