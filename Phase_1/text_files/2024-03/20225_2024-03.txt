Footnotes
DOMINGO stalked in the three path, was coaxed in the four path passing the quarter, bid turning into the stretch, and inched ahead of an inner duo in the
final furlong. ARTEMPUS prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a nudge around the far turn, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was
out-finished by an outer foe to place. THORNBURY set the pace inside, was roused when challenged midway around the far turn, dug in along the inside
into the stretch, but was edged out by an outer pair to show. EL REZEEN tracked in the two path, was cued while three wide into the far turn, fanned out to
the seven path at the top of the lane, and stayed on. TOUR THE CITY raced in midpack along the inside, was roused passing the three-eighths, tipped out
to the five path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. JHIRSCH laid up close in the two path, waited along the inside around the far turn, drifted out to
the five path in upper stretch, and flattened. GOT SUNNY bumped with an outer foe at the start, was held up in the two path turning into the backstretch, but
made no impact from the six path down the lane. DE LA CRUZ rated in the three path, was cued from the rail into the far turn, but did not factor. THE
DOVER SPECTER chased in the three path but could not produce a bid. LINESMAN steadied going into the first turn, trailed in the two path down the
backside and made no impact. SPEEDREADER broke slowly, raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened. SUPREME DOMINANCE bumped
with an inner foe at the start, laid wellback in the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
BE YOU stalked the pace from the rail, swung four wide in upper stretch, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. BIG CITY set
the pace in the two path, was headed near the quarter pole, fought on to the sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner late but dug in to win the duel and
hold the place. JEFFERSON STREET bumped with SHOW BOAT just after the start, pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the quarter
pole, dueled to the sixteenth pole and was part of a three way photo for the place. ACCLAIMED VICTOR tracked the pace three wide, angled five wide in
upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. TAPAKENA exchanged several bumps with HOWARD WOLOWITZ at the start, raced off the pace two
wide and never threatened. MO RHODES was outrun inside. SHOW BOAT bumped after the start and had only brief speed three wide. HOWARD
WOLOWITZ exchanged several bumps at the start, raced two wide and played no further factor. HEAT LIGHTNING had early speed four wide and retreated
around the turn.

Footnotes
ABRUMAR popped the gate door open during the loading process, showed the way around the first turn to set the pace along the inside down the
backstretch, waited confidently rounding the far turn, was roused from the three path at the top of the stretch, drifted out slightly while digging in, and gamely
held off an outer pair. CUGINO tracked in the three path, was cued while three wide early into the far turn, bid from the five path turning into the lane, got
herded outward, but ran on to be up for place. SILENT HEART laid up close in the two path, bid in hand rounding the far turn, was roused from the four path
into the stretch, but drifted out, and hung between foes for show. TRIPLE ESPRESSO raced off the pace in the three path, was cued passing the quarter,
floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly. ROYAL MAJESTY (GB) trailed along the inside down the backstretch, was coaxed
passing the quarter, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and stayed on, but made no impact. RAPTURE BAY stalked inside but flattened from
the two path in the stretch. TOCAYO laid in midpack in the two path turning into the backstretch, but lost ground between foes rounding the far turn, and
failed to bid in the four path down the lane. OKIRO was in tight and had to steady midway around the first turn, raced wellback in the two path but did not
threaten from the five path in the stretch. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE rated inside but was no menace.

Footnotes
EXACT ESTIMATE was off slowly, advanced four wide into the first turn, angled into the three path midway around that bend, took the lead nearing the far
turn, set the pace in the three path around that bend, edged ahead in upper stretch and dug in to just last. SKYRO settled off the pace while racing two
wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and just missed. OHANA HONOR raced off the pace three wide between foes, angled in in
upper stretch and rallied inside of the top two. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) raced off the pace two and three wide and improved position without threatening in
the lane. LEGACY ISLE set the pace in the two path around the first turn, pressed inside down the backstretch and around the far turn then weakened in the
lane. REGAL KINGDOM failed to menace while racing three and four wide. AMSTRONG raced off the pace two wide, was forced out midway down the
backstretch, made progress in the five path around the far turn but faded while appearing to try to lug in through the lane. HE'S A MESS raced in range
inside, checked midway down the backstretch and never recovered the lost position. CONGRUENT was pulling three wide around the first turn, took the
lead early on the backstretch, took a bad step midway down the backstretch, was pulled up soon after and was euthanized.

quarter, swung from the seven path into the lane, rallied outside of rivals, got bumped by an inner foe in the closing stages, but prevailed. NEVER
SURPRISED bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a nudge around the far turn, was cued turning into the
stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole but was drifting out, bumped with an outer foe late, and was nailed on the wire to place. J P HELLISH

eighth pole, and kept on for show. LET IT RIDE showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backside, was roused along
the inside going into the far turn, but faded in the final furlong. BELOUNI (FR) was unhurried in the four path turning into the backstretch, roused early
around the far turn, and kept on but made no impact. LOYAL COMPANY raced wellback in the two path, was roused passing the quarter, angled out to the
eight path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on, but could not factor. RISK MANAGER bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close in the two path,
came under a ride in the three path early around the far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. TIZ ROMANTIC laid in midpack in
the two path, but flattened along the inside in the stretch. RECKONING FORCE stumbled at the start, trailed in the three path, and did not threaten from the
four path down the lane. ENGLISH BEE got fractious in the gate, then had to steady crossing the wire for the first time, settled in the back of the pack
around the two path, and failed to bid from the three path in the stretch. INDESTRUCTIBLE (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three
path, came under a drive in the four path approaching the far turn, but never threatened from the six path down the lane. SMOKIN' JAY bumped with an

IMPLEMENTATION raced in range at the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, rallied but was outkicked between the top two finishers. POSITIVE
REVIEW chased the pace four wide, angled in in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BABY YODA saved ground and failed to menace.
DANGEROUS RIDE pressed the pace two wide, was urged along around the turn and faded in the stretch. LIGHTNING TONES was off a bit slowly, trailed
in the three path, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. HOWLING TIME chased the pace three wide and tired in the lane.

path turning into the lane, rallied outside of foes into the final furlong, and got up in the final strides. TAWNY PORT laid in range around the two path, was
roused into the final turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, ran on to lead passing the sixteenth, but was caught by an outer foe late to place.
ANGLOPHILE laid in midpack along the inside, tipped out to the two path down the backside, bumped with an inner foe while merging to the rail going into
the final turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and kept on to be up for show. KINGMAX (IRE) settled in midfield in the two path, tipped out to the four
path down the backstretch, was coaxed along while ranging up three wide approaching the quarter, kicked on between foes from the six path in the stretch,
but was out-finished to miss minor rewards. MAIN EVENT pulled around the first turn to set an open pace in the two path, came under a ride along the rail
early into the final turn, stayed on from the two path into the stretch, but was caught by an outer quartet in the final sixteenth. HEADLINE NEWS stalked
under a hold along the inside, had to wait along the rail rounding the final turn, was roused at the top of the lane, had to steady and alter outwards passing
the sixteenth, and could not bid. DYNADRIVE raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed while five wide passing the quarter, and did not threaten. SIX
MINUS was unhurried in the two path early, was cued from the three path into the final turn, but made no impact in the four path down the lane.
CALYCANTHUS tracked in the two path but weakened from the five path in the stretch. CATCH THAT PARTY hesitated at the start, then was held up while
racing in the back of the pack along the inside, moved up from the rail down the backstretch but bumped with an outer foe and had to check going into the
final turn, but was no menace. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF KINGMAX (IRE) AGAINST THE RIDER OF STARTING OVER FOR

Footnotes
FIONA'S MAGIC set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two midway around the turn, dug in while facing challengers on both sides at the top of
the lane, and gamely held off an outer rival. INTO CHAMPAGNE broke out at the start, stalked in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the turn,
bid three wide at the top of the stretch, and ran on but hung for place. LESLIE'S ROSE tracked the three path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the
turn, tried to bid along the inside turning into the lane, tipped out to the three path passing the sixteenth, and evened out for show. QUEEN'S MARTINI
prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden from the three path into the turn, got in tight around the three-sixteenths pole, tipped out to the five path at
the top of the lane, but was one paced. WHOCOULDASKFORMO chased in the five path but never threatened. NEW DIAMOND trailed throughout from
along the inside to the three path.

STEAL SUNSHINE rated inside, was roused from the rail into the turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, got herded outward while dueling
with the inner leader in the final furlong, but got up in the final strides. TUMBARUMBA broke out and bumped an outer foe, prompted the pace in the four
path, bid in the three path around the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, took the lead before the eighth pole, but drifted outward while
digging in in a duel with an outer foe, and was nailed in the final strides to place. IL MIRACOLO set the pace in the two path, was coaxed into the turn, but
lost the lead before the eighth pole, and evened out for show. SHAQ DIESEL got pinched at the start, chased in the three path, tipped out to the seven path
under a drive turning into the lane, but lugged in on his left lead, and did not threaten. GILMORE bumped with two inner foes at the start, stalked in the five
path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
EMMANUEL stalked the pace two and three wide, took over in midstretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and held firm. SIEGE OF BOSTON settled
off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied between foes for the place. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) raced three and four
wide in midpack, angled further out in upper stretch and ran on for the show. SARATOGA FLASH set the pace along the rail, led to midstretch and
weakened. ATONE steadied early, raced off the pace three and four wide and had a mild belated rally. ELDON'S PRINCE bumped with NAPOLEONIC
WAR at the start, saved ground off the pace, was in tight in upper stretch, swung widest soon after and passed tiring rivals. SMOKIN' T raced up close
inside and faded in the stretch. TURF KING (IRE) saved ground off the pace, angled out turning for home and lacked a closing bid. NAPOLEONIC WAR
bumped at the start, prompted the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
CHILI FLAG (FR) was unhurried in the two path turning into the backstretch, waited confidently for most of the far turn before receiving a right handed cue
passing the quarter, swung out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, and rallied outside of foes to be up in the final strides. WALKATHON laid off the
pace in the three path, was roused while angling out to the eight path turning into the lane, tipped inwards while running on to briefly lead inside the final
sixteenth, but was overtaken by an outer foe late to place. ANCIENT PEACE tracked in the four path, ranged up under coaxing passing the quarter, bid on
her left lead from the five path at the top of the stretch, led while lugging in and still on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and was caught by an outer pair
to finish with show. INFINITE DIAMOND laid in range from the two path down the backstretch, was roused early into the far turn, tipped out to the four path
at the top of the lane, drifted to the rail, and evened out late. MOHAWK TRAIL trailed in the two path, fanned widest out to the ten path while under a ride
turning into the stretch, and stayed on. BE MY SUNSHINE raced in midpack in the three path, was roused while tipping out to the seven path turning into
the lane, but was one paced. CANDY LIGHT rated inside, was roused along the rail turning into the stretch, but got shutoff passing the eighth pole, and
could not factor. SPANSIVE chased in the two path, was coaxed early around the far turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the lane, but had to steady
just after the eighth pole, and failed to bid. FOR THE FLAG prompted the pace along the inside around the first turn, took back to settle up close in the three
path passing the half, bid around the far turn, swung from the four path into the lane, but had to steady around the eighth pole, and yielded. MISS CAROL
ANN (IRE) laid wellback along the inside, angled outward through the stretch, but failed to menace. TIME PASSAGE showed the way in the three path
around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backside, but gaveway passing the eighth pole.

Footnotes
DORNOCH set a rated pace in the two path through the opening half, vied two wide around the far turn, edged ahead in upper stretch while continuing on
the left lead, switched leads with about a sixteenth of a mile remaining and drew clear under a drive. LE DOM BRO prompted the pace inside of the winner,
advanced at the rail around the far turn, reached near even terms near the three-eighths pole, vied inside to upper stretch, was no match for the winner in
the final furlong but kept on to hold the place. FRANKIE'S EMPIRE stalked the the top two finishers three wide around both turns and finished evenly to
maintain the show. REAL MACHO had his head turned at the start and broke a bit awkwardly, raced up close two wide and faded after six furlongs.
DANCING GROOM broke outwardly and slowly and trailed throughout while racing in the two path.
