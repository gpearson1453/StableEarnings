LUCK IN MY EYES was void of any early speed, advanced between rivals through the turn, angled in mid stretch, was closing, took control late and edged
clear. BAROSSA tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, took a brief lead mid stretch, couldn't hold off the winner, was no match late
and finished second best. REVOLT AND RIOT was reserved early, raced three wide through the second turn, passed rivals and was along for third. SEXY
DEXY set a pressured early pace, opened up along the backstretch, raced three wide into the second turn and weakened late. TONE FEELIN pressed the
early pace, raced four wide into the second turn and faded. BIG LEAGUE BENNY was unhurried early, raced eight wide out of the second turn and offered
no late rally. TRIPP A MATIC was allowed to settle early, raced six wide out of the second turn and flattened out. IZA DADDY raced in mid pack early, went
five wide through the second turn and retreated.
