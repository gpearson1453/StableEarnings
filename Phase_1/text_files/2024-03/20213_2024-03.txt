Footnotes
DIXIE PENNY settled off the pace and the inside, angled four wide turning for home, challenged on the outside in upper stretch, gained the advantage and
held the runner up safe late. WINYAH BAY fell back to trail after the start, also was four wide out of the turn when beginning to rally, steered toward the
inside and lodged a willingly rally just off the rail to annex the place. ABBY THE BULL DAWG broke slowly, moved up to mid pack by the turn, two to three
wide out of the turn, shifted out a bit further when straightened for home, also was going well at the end. VARTON hustled early to make the early
advantage, set the pace in the two path, continued to hold the advantage into the stretch then began to weaken when headed by the winner nearing
midstretch. WEST SIDE GIRL in mid pack outside, three to four wide through the turn, continued one paced through the lane. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL
lacked speed just off the rail, in traffic along the inside late in the bend, failed to rally when clear for the drive. LICHITA chased the early leader inside,
steered out three wide turning for home then backed up through the lane. SHANIAH staged a steady retreat while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
VIGANO off a step slow, lacked early foot, four to five wide when advancing into the stretch, got out a bit more upper stretch, steadily drifted in the final
furlong, bumped with DELUCA and put that rival in tight with a sixteenth to run, up in the final strides. ARTWELL within striking distance three wide,
continued to race forwardly in the three path into the far turn, outside bid into the lane, drifted out under a left handed crop with a furlong to run bothering
DELUCA as bit, was straightened, led late, caught in the closing strides. THE HEIGHTS raced in the second flight while just off the inside, continued to stalk
,the middle half in the two path, got through entering the stretch, challenged inside the lead pack with a sixteenth remaining, not enough in the late going,
clear of the others. DELUCA off step slow, raced back, moved out, four wide advance second turn, slight bother when ARTWELL drifted out midstretch, was
then bumped and put in tight by VIGANO soon after, finished up evenly after recovering. SHARP STICK broke well, dueled up front along the inside,
continued to vie upper stretch then faltered in the final furlong. CAPTIVE AUDIENCE off a step slow, in some traffic when a bit rank into the first turn, moved
inside, saved ground to no avail, in lacking a closing kick. DARVESH settled in mid pack, four to three wide into the first turn, three wide onto the
backstretch, remained three wide through the second turn, failed to muster a rally. AUDEN lacked speed, four to five wide exiting the turn, remained back.
SAFE BET dueled up front while off the inside, gave way. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF
FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DELUCA AGASINT BOTH ARTWELL AND VIGANO FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRECH, THE LATTER WAS

the stretch, brush, closed with good resolve to be up in time. ELUSIVE TARGET settled off the pace while saving ground, continued inside second turn,
moved out a bit for room into the stretch, challenged late between foes, outfinished. ROMAN CENTURIAN off a step slow, raced back and off the inside,
four to five wide and between horses in the stretch, brushed with the winner with a furlong to run, also was outkicked in the late going while between. BEER
CHASER away in good order, set a pressured pace inside, shook clear in to the lane, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, folded
late while closest to the inside of the first flight at the wire. TAPSASIONAL behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, had little
for the drive. SEARCH ENGINE pressured the pace while off the inside, came three wide when chasing the leader into the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
MOLLY OF STRATFORD in mid pack early off the inside, advanced three to four wide into a striking position turning for home, challenged when
straightened for home, kicked well clear under steady handling. DANCE MY WAY in the main group while inside the winner, moved closer toward the inside
in some traffic late turn, came three wide for the drive, no match for the winner late while persevering for the second spot. PLEASINGLY broke on top,
narrowly set the pace inside, dueled out of the turn, proved stubborn for the runner up position. DIFFERENTLY pressed the issue up front along the inside,
dueled into the lane, weakened through the lane. PINK CHIMES bit reluctant to load, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, improved inside of
horses into the stretch, no real threat. BODI ODI one paced outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a significant closing response. LATIFAH within
striking distance, three wide into the stretch, tired. BABAS GAL broke back, raced between horses far turn, came four wide for the drive, lacked a closing
kick to finish up evenly. FIRST DIAMOND off a step slow, trailed for a half toward the inside, passed some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. I
BE GONE forwardly placed up the backstretch three wide and between horses, floated four wide into the lane, tired. COSMIC CHIC forwardly placed four
wide, continued outside through the turn, gave way in the drive. BENT HALO broke through the gate, broke back, four wide late in the turn, remained back.

Footnotes
SUMMORYA never far back off the inside, moved closer three wide late in the turn, challenged between horses past the furlong marker, proved best under
firm handling. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN raced back off the pace out in the strip, advanced four wide through the turn, challenged outside the winner with a
furlong to run, held stubbornly to the wire, clearly second best. COROMANDEL raced with the first group outside, showed the way into the turn, shook clear
a furlong out, held a smaller advantage over the top two with a furlong to run, faltered, narrowly gained the nod for the show. SMARTY'S ANGEL broke out,
bumped, raced back, swung six wide out of the turn, lodged a belated rally down the middle of the strip, narrowly missed the show. MIRACLE SHOES away
well toward the inside, pressed the issue along the inside into the turn, gradually weakened the final quarter. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE in the second flight while
between horses early, in traffic, steadied with a half mile remaining, one paced through the turn after recovering, has little for the stretch run. BE MY
HUCKLEBERRY broke in, brushed, raced forwardly along the inside, gave way. KITIARA pinched back at the break to be away slowly, moved outside, four
wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. DIXIE GIRL TO in mid pack off the inside, three wide and in some traffic through the turn, also lacked a
kick in the drive. PAT'S GAL tired while racing toward the inside. THURSDAY MORNING off the pace early, in traffic, shuffled back into the turn, remained
back in failing to recover. BOOTLEGGING GIRL fell back to trail, was never involved.

Footnotes
HAPPYMAC broke on top set the pace inside, was given a breather early in the turn, shrugged off a mild bid turning into the stretch, maintained daylight to
the wire under confident handling and an intermittent right handed crop. ROMAN GIANT in the second flight while racing off the inside, came in the two path
for the drive, rallied willingly from between horses to earn the place. BOLDISH broke out, last away, raced b ack and along the inside, steered out for the
drive, rallied belatedly to earn the show, not a threat to the top two. SQUARE DEAL within striking distance while racing three wide, came up empty for the
stretch run to finish up evenly. MUST BE LOVE prompted the winner from the outside, briefly tried that one from the outside turning for home, weakened.
AWESOME FAMILY went one paced while along the inside. MORNING SNOW lacked speed while racing off the inside, failed to muster a rally when called
on in the drive. MYSTERY MAN in tight just after the start to break back, four to three wide into the stretch, tired. EASY BIG BOY made little impact while
racing along the inside. BLAZEN ROAD lacked speed, four to five wide late in the turn, trailed in.

Footnotes
BOOGIE BODE allowed the pace to go early while off the inside, dropped to the rail when beginning to advance late in the final turn, inside rally, well clear
at the end. LIFE ON THE NILE with the early pace while three wide, took over backstretch, shook clear far turn, offered little resistance to the winner past
the furlong marker while outside that one, no match, saved the place. UNSTABLE PRINCE void of speed, between horses into the lane, staged a mild rally
to be clear for the show, getting to the runner up. CONTRABANDISTA back early inside, continued to save ground second bend, moved out a bit for room
into the lane, split foes and improved position. HUMOR ME NOW off a step slow, lacked speed, moved out to race four wide through the final turn, went
evenly through the stretch. HARD TO COME BY in mid pack while three wide through the first turn, moved inside for the run through the second bend,
improved slightly while not a serious threat. ASSUMPTION fell well back after the start, continued to lag the middle half, picked off some tiring rivals after the
issue had been decided. TRAFFIC BOSS four wide into the first turn, remained back in failing to threaten. ABSOLUTE COURAGE dueled early between
horses, chased the runner up the middle half then gave way in the drive. STAR NATION was never close. WORK ORDER set or forced the early pace
inside, fell back then stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
THERESASILVERLININ close from the start, three wide into the turn, took over, cleared the other speed and dropped to the inside late in the bend,
shrugged off runner up, kicked clear. LADY DREAMER in the second flight up the backstretch three wide, chased the winner turn, briefly launched a bid
outside that one entering the stretch, could not keep up in the run to the wire, clearly second best. DEMI hesitated at the break, raced back, in some traffic
turning for home, late rally to annex the show. CODE FOR SUCCESS in mid pack outside early, three to four wide through the turn, displayed some mild
interest to improve position down the stretch, no real threat. SWEET MOTHER MARY lacked speed off the inside, three wide into the lane, also displayed
some belated energy to better her position. TWIRLING TIGRESS forwardly placed early, 3-4w into the lane, gradually weakened. COLLECTED GLORY off
a step slow, raced well back for a half, in traffic into the lane lacking clear room, picked off a couple of faltering foes when clear. SHANGHAI EXPRESS tired
after a half inside. WINGS FROM ABOVE broke on top, set the early pace just off the inside, gave way when headed by the winner midway on the turn.
VELIKIY in the second flight along the inside, gave way in the drive, trailed home.

Footnotes
FROST FREE broke very sharp, quickly sprinted clear, in hand through the turn, stayed clear through the lane under a steady right handed crop the final
furlong. CATS BY FIVE in the second flight along the inside, continued to chased the winner into and through the stretch, could do little with that one
through the lane, clearly second best. RISK IT chased in the second group outside the runner up, three wide into the lane, finished up best ofx the rest.
KNICKS STORM turned in an even effort in the two path. HENRO lacked speed outside, three to four wide through the turn, failed to rally,. ANDY'S CANDY
off a step slow, failed to menace inside. LEO SPRINGS off a step slow, trailed throughout in saving ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL forwardly placed early toward the inside, moved out, asked along late turn, four wide into the stretch, closed with good resolve to
kick down the leader in the waning strides. OCEAN BIRD broke sharp, quickly sprinted clear, shrugged off a mild bid late in the turn, well clear again with a
furlong to run, nailed in the final strides. ZONGS IRISH FROST forwardly placed in the second flight toward the inside, lacked a closing punch in the final
furlong to finish up best of the rest. PREDICTING in mid pack just off the inside, two path and in some traffic late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch
in also lacked a closing kick. PNEUMA back off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat.
BIG BOLT chased the runner up in the three path, moved a bit closer late turn, tired in the drive. KAT'N CHROME went one paced throughout while racing
three wide. SHE'S MO FANCY off a step slow, remained back despite picking off a couple of faltering rivals. ALAMO weakened while racing along the
inside. BABE IN THE WOODS remained back throughout in lacking a closing response. FIRST CLASS GIRL tired after racing four wide through the turn.
