Footnotes
THE FURMANATOR dueled between rivals, took over nearing the quarter pole then edged away through the stretch. WICKED LADY saved ground off the
pace, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but weakened. BE WATER prompted the pace inside and continued willingly to the finish. BOHEMIA BABE
was urged close up in the opening quarter then flattened out in the stretch. DUNE JUMPER raced extremely wide throughout then offered some late energy.
BULLET ON TAP hustled off the leaders four wide and retreated. NO MORE DIAMONDS dropped back extremely wide and was never a factor. NOW ACT
SURPRISED broke slowest, advanced inside then proved empty in the stretch. AZTEC BAY led narrowly outside in the opening quarter then faded on the
turn.

HIDE THE RANSOM chased on the inside, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, closed steadily outside and ran down the leader in deep
stretch. LAZARETTO dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, shook clear, dug in gamely and was caught late. EMPIRE'S SCORE dueled inside
for command, dueled on the turn, dug in, weakened and held for third. ZIP IT SCOTTY chased between rivals early on, then inside on the turn and finished
evenly. PRIMORDIAL FEAR was off a bit slow, raced off the pace with an inside trip and closed belatedly on the rail. AMIGOS GUITAR chased three wide,
chased on the turn and faded. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE raced off the rail and was outrun.

midstretch and continued gamely to hold the place. BAD BAD MR. BROWN vied between rivals early, dueled to midstretch and weakened. FREEDOM
EAGLE was taken up early, moved wide on the turn then flattened out late. WARRIOR TED lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and was no factor.
MISTER B flashed speed along the rail then was finished before half a mile. IRISH DEVIANT urged early, raced just off the pace inside then stopped.
HERO'S SPIRIT injured himself in the starting gate and was ordered a late scratch.
