Footnotes
MIWOMAN light bump start, four wide into the first turn when well off the pace, continued outside, three to four wide through the second bend when
advancing, outside bid upper stretch, long drive, wore down rival late. ROSE PARADE broke on top, set the pace while racing toward the inside, responded
when confronted in the second turn, disposed of that rival into the lane, responded when the winner challenged soon after, proved stubborn after a long
stretch battle, remained clear for the runner up spot. THORNY behind the pace in the second flight just off the inside, between horses into the far turn,
continued in traffic midway on that bend, had little for the top two when clear for the drive, well clear of the others. CHURCH SERVICE pressed the runner
up from the outside for five furlongs, tried that one through the second turn, weakened in the drive. TWO PRACTICAL five wide into the first turn when
lacking speed, three wide when still back into the far turn, angled in late in the final turn, improved a bit while not posing a serious threat. SPIRITUAL LADY
broke out, bumped with foe, settled in mid pack off the inside, continued one paced in the three path throughout. CHEYENNE MOON off a step slow, raced
back, moved out, four wide through the final turn, picked off a couple of faltering rivals. HAUNTED DREAM was finished early while racing in the two path.
RUBIA in the second flight for five furlongs inside, stopped second turn, quickly lost contact with the field to be distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
PRESSURE with the pace while widest in the run up the backstretch, vied four wide through the turn, held a slim advantage past the furlong marker, kicked
clear late. ASYMMETRIC also with the pace from the start, three wide and between horses into and through the turn, equal terms with the winner in
midstretch then could not match strides late while saving the place. CRAVENSWORTH lacked early foot toward the inside, two to three path when
advancing through the turn, continued to improve through the lane to be getting to the runner up. MEMES moved up to contest the pace along the inside,
continued to battle through upper stretch, faltered in the late going to lose a couple of positions. MO TAP with the pace while between horses, fell back into
the lane, continued to gradually weaken to the wire. IMPRESSOR last away, well back early, improved three wide turn, shifted to the outside in upper
stretch, flattened out a bit the final furlong. SMACKZILLA fell back to trail after the start, continued to race back through the turn, improved somewhat in the
drive while not posing a serious threat. IMMORAL lacked early foot outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. BORDINOS in mid pack off
the inside, weakened through the lane. STILL ON THE BOOKS broke back, was always outrun. COMMANDER REX in mid pack early inside, retreated
while continuing to save ground. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO back off the inside toward the rear, in some traffic late in the turn, fell further and further back.

Footnotes
NORTHERN CHILL restless in the gate, broke out, bothered rival, quickly straightened to set the pace inside, shook clear when straightened for home,
maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. COPPER ECHO away in good order, forwardly placed inside, boxed in late in the bend inside, got
through into the lane, could do little with the winner when clear, held sway for the place. CATALINA CRUSH bothered at the break to be away slowly, back
early, closer turn, traffic late in the bend, chased the runner up past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit late, narrowly gained the nod for the show.
NULLIFY in mid pack early off the inside, altered course outside to be six wide into the stretch, lost whip into lane, displayed some mild late interest while
being urged with a pair of goggles in his right hand, narrowly missed the show. CORKED pressed the issue up front while in the two path, came three wide
for the drive, weakened through the stretch. MOHAWK RIVER lacked early foot, fanned seven wide out of the turn, finished up evenly. MIRAGE fell well
back after the start to trail, continued to lag turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals, no real threat. LAST DIAMOND made little impact while racing three
wide. THANKS FRANK lacked speed, floated out seven wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. COMMANDER STORM prompted the issue up front
three to four wide for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RISING never far back while three wide through the first turn, stalked the leader in the run up the backstretch, engaged that one in the second
turn, shook clear and maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. ETHEREAL ROAD back off the pace just off the inside, continued back, angled
out four wide when advancing late in the final bend, rallied to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. SANTOS DUMONT settled in the
second flight three wide, inched a bit closer late in the final turn while remaining in the three path, lacked a further advance, narrowly gained the nod for the
show. ALEJANDRO void of speed, floated out five wide by ETHEREAL ROAD turning for home, flashed some belated interest down the middle of the strip.
CAN'T HUSH THIS in the second flight inside, saved ground to no avail. WINNEMAC AVENUE came out start, moved three wide, raced in the second flight
the middle half, came up empty for the stretch run. MACHINE GUN MAN broke on top, set the pace in the two path, briefly dueled with the winner into the
stretch then began to give way. continued to falter the final furlong. DECISION MAKER squeezed at the break, trailed most of the way in failing to make an
impact.

Footnotes
MAC DADDY TOO close up from the start, pressed the leader up the backstretch, moved to engage in the turn, dueled into the lane, put a head in front
upper stretch, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. ALPINE THUNDER balked at loading, in the second flight while outside, raced four wide
through the turn, slowly getting to the winner late, edged clear for the place. SHACKS WAY also in the second flight while between foes in the two path, set
down for the drive, lacked a late punch, nod for the show. SHADY EMPIRE took control after the start inside, continued to show the way through the turn,
began to gradually weaken when headed by the winner upper stretch, lost nod for show late. SUMMER IN MALIBU broke back, continued to lack speed
early, moved out, fanned six wide into the stretch, improved position down the middle of the strip. CREME DE LA CHROME in the second group behind the
two leaders three wide and between horses, came four wide for the drive, had little left for the run to the wire. TIGER DAD in mid pack and off the inside,
three to four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. CIRCLE BACK JACK broke back, raced off the inside, three wide into the stretch, improved position
while not a serious threat. COLT FICTION last away, never menaced inside. LATIN CASINO in mid pack while along the inside, faded. DEFLATER was
never a threat. LUV TO WIN staged a steady retreat off the inside.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S CAUSE back off the pace while out in the strip up the backstretch, raced four wide through the turn, roused when straightened for home, closed
with good resolve to be in time. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF dueled up front in the two path for a half, put the other speed away in upper stretch, could not
contain the winner, remained clear for the place. OUR BET off a step slow, raced back, came five wide out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to
nail down the show. GHOST BAYOU in mid pack while along the inside, two path into the lane, displayed some mild late interest. THE PRINCESS SAYS in
the second flight while racing three wide, lacked a closing response in the drive. PERILOUS LIFE fell back to trail after the start, three wide into the stretch,
passed some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SINGING EMMA forwardly placed in the two path, faded. FOREVER HOME dueled up front
along the inside, continued on equal terms with the runner up through the turn, first to blink into the stretch. COMMUNICATIONISKEY was finished early,
well back.

Footnotes
BOHEMIAN BO broke alertly, rated in the run up the backstretch while comfortably in front, continued to show the way turn, two path into the lane, plenty left
through the lane to hold the next two safe late. WILLOW CREEK ROAD behind the winner along the inside, continued to chase that one while along the rail
through the turn and into the stretch, could do little with that one stretch, long drive for the second spot, game. LOCHMOOR back off the early pace, knifed
closer three wide and between horses midway on the turn, lost some ground to the runner up into the lane, hooked up with that one inside the furlong
marker, dueled to the wire, outkicked for the place. NAVY SEAL last away, trailed up the backstretch, saved some ground turn, shifted out for the stretch
run, went evenly the final furlong. HIT SCENE pressed the winner from the outside for just under a half and gave way. KING PEANUT back off the pace and
the inside, floated out five wide late in the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. PEACE DOG remained back while racing just off the inside. MACHO
ROCCO raced in mid pack and off the rail, four wide late turn, backed up through the lane.

TIME FOR TRUTH broke forwardly, raced outside of considerable trouble into the first turn, pressed the leader from the outside up the backstretch, took
over turning for home, well clear a furlong out, enough left to hold the runner up safe in the late going,. WILLY D'S in tight between horses into the first turn,
carried out four wide soon after, moved closer before a half while remaining outside, fell back off the two leaders into the far turn, three wide through that
bend, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late while edging clear for the place. PAPPY'S REVENGE three wide through the first turn, mid pack
up the backstretch, asked along in the two path second turn, displayed some mild interest late from between horses while outkicked for the second spot.
AWESOME ROAD behind horses behind the pace when roughed and put in tight entering the first turn, checked, moved out three wide, continued back off
the pace, three wide again in the second bend, flashed some belated interest to improve position. ETHAN ENERGY off slow, moved up behind the pace
along the inside when steadied first turn, continued inside, saved ground again in the second bend, went evenly through the stretch. UNIVERSAL SOUND
second flight inside early, roughed, bounced into rail into the first turn, steadied and moved out, raced back then advanced four to five wide late in the
second turn, flattened out in the drive. GOOGOL JOKE angled in into the first turn when going for the lead setting off a chain reaction of interference,
cleared before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way when headed by the winner turning for home.
CONCENTRATION five wide into the first turn, trailed throughout and was never a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
INTO THE FIRST TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF AWESOME ROAD AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR INTERFERENCE, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
KANTEX off a bit slow, in the two path through the turn, dropped to the inside for the drive, rallied up the rail to be up in time. MOZINGO with the pace while
between foes, fell back off the runner up in upper stretch, came back to capture that one for the place late, unable to match the winner in the final strides.
CONNIE K away well, narrowly set the pace inside, continued to hold the advantage a furlong out while off the inside allowing the winner the rail, gave
ground grudgingly to that one and the runner up. KABOOM BABY lacked early foot off the inside, three to four wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally while
remaining out in the strip. COUNT IT ALL JOY vied up front four wide, continued outside through the turn, five wide into the lane when beginning to weaken,
continued to fade. HOT SPRINGS BLING back off the pace and the inside after breaking a step slow, two path through the turn, lacked a serious closing
response. RIVERCREST GIRL underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke back, raced outside, five wide into the lane, also lacked a closing kick.
SUMMER SHOES with the pace three wide and between horses for four furlongs, gave way in the drive. FLY LIKE THE WIND behind the first flight,
stopped through the lane and jogged in late.

Footnotes
LANDLORD pinballed at the break, moved up to race in midpack along the inside, steered out four wide turning for home, reeled in leader under confident
handling. NATORADE lacked speed while racing outside, floated out five wide by the winner exiting the turn, race on equal terms with that one in pursuit of
the leader past the furlong marker, also collared that rival late, no match for the winner in the final strides. CHAOS REIGNS broke alertly, dueled early
closest to the inside, shook clear in the turn, caved in late to be caught by the top two, remained well clear of the others. DANCIN ROCKET chased the
leader in the three path for a half, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. CHROME CANDY went one paced throughout while racing three
wide, also lacked a closing response. MY BROTHER MIKE lost irons at the break, raced well back after regaining them, saved ground turn, improved
position stretch without posing a threat. PERP WALK made little impact while racing off the inside. GUST OF WIND in some early traffic, moved up to race
in the second flight, weakened through the stretch. SCOTT CITY broke in, bumped, remained back. LAKESIDE RUMBLE was never a factor to be always
outrun. STATE SCHOOL SMART broke out, bumped with the winner, recovered to move up and press the pace, stopped after a half.
