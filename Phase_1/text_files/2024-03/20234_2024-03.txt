Footnotes
BIG ENGINE was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied against the rail into the final furlong and closed
strongly to blow by the embattled leading duo late and prevail. PRINTRACK showed speed then contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on
the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dueled outside of BOURBON'S HOPE in the drive and gamely defeated that foe for the place while overtaken by
the winner. BOURBON'S HOPE moved up outside the five-eighths pole to contest the lead on the inside of a rival, vied near the rail on the turn, came off
the inside into upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the finish and just missed the place while clear for the show. NOLO CONTESTO moved up while
urged along, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and
lacked the needed response. CAN'T BEAT ME raced just off the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HORN OF PLENTY was taken up briefly by the rider at the start but broke with the field, was urged
along towards the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
MYSARIA pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, brushed with the runner-up while taking the lead in upper stretch, fought
outside that opponent into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. SOLOSHOT was hustled to the front, set the pace under some
pressure to the outside, vied inside a foe in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage while brushing with the winner in upper stretch, battled with that foe
into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the place. DORTH'S SOL DANCER broke out at the start, was urged along while just off the
pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed
response while able to get the show. TAVIN bumped with a rival at the start and was last away, tracked the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SPEIGHTS DANCE bumped with a rival at the start, settled between horses, was eased back near the
five-eighths pole then moved in, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty.

Footnotes
DISARMED moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, spun three wide into
upper stretch, responded gamely to multiple challengers in the drive and determinedly prevailed under strong urging. COWAN moved up under urging then
tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, made a bid inside the furlong marker, fought with
multiple opponents while between horses to the finish and missed while just able to get the place. THRILL OF IT was last to commence, raced at the rear
under urging, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, gained to make a bid inside the furlong marker, fought with foes to the finish
and just missed the place while able to get the show. SECRET RULES raced just off the pace, brushed with an opponent near the nine-sixteenths pole, was
checked while pinched back between horses leaving the backstretch and lost position, went around most of the turn in the two path then angled four wide,
came six wide into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and gained late for the last
spot in the superfecta. SAFFA'S DAY raced just off the pace, brushed with a rival near the nine-sixteenths, was taken in hand late on the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, waited behind the leader coming to the quarter-pole, found room into upper stretch, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker,
fought inside foes into the final sixteenth and was outfinished.

Footnotes
HAZON was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, rallied to get the lead at the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drew away under a
drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. CAVENDISH showed speed then contested the pace on the outside, vied in the
two path on the turn, moved to a solo advantage near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole then moved out in upper
stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. PHANTOM JEWEL veered out at the start and was last away, raced on the outside under urging,
went five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while along for the show. LEVEL UP showed speed then contested the pace on the inside of
rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. DUDLEY DICKERSON was
urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. A LISTER chased the pace, went three wide on the turn and came up empty.
PINE ALLEY showed speed between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and retreated. SHAMROCK SHAKE
was urged at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

SWEET BROWN SUGAR tracked the pace on the outside then in the five path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead into upper
stretch, shook clear coming to the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. SOHANA brushed with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the
inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. THIRTEEN
RED FLAGS was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get
the show. BROWN SUGA BABE was urged along near the back, went two then three wide early on the turn then angled five wide, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. CITY BLOCKS broke out and brushed with a foe, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no
factor. SCARLET'S DREAM was well placed down the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and came up empty. MY PERFECT MISTAKE contested the
pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back approaching the quarter-pole and tired.

KARA PARA bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, came through inside foes to take the lead at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA prompted the pace on the outside of the
leader, droppped back some late on the backstretch, chased while moving from the three path to the five path on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch
and willingly earned the place. BELLA PRINCIPESSA jostled with a foe early, stalked the pace on the outside, chased while moving from four to six wide on
the turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and also finished willingly but missed the place while able to get the show. SHIGEKO jostled with a foe early then
steadied in tight quarters coming to the seven-eighths pole, was urged three then two wide on the turn, dropped to the rail near the quarter-pole and lacked
the needed kick. STARRY MIDNIGHT was well placed towards the front, chased while moving from the rail to the four path on the turn and tired.
FREDDYMO FACTOR bumped with a foe at the start, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two then three path on the turn, was headed at the
quarter-pole and gave way. LAVON was bumped on both sides at the start, settled near the back, was urged along in the two to four path on the turn and
failed to respond. ICE LOVE broke a step slow, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
AWESOME GLO went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the three path on the turn, responded well when asked for
his best in upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. DANCING LIANA broke in and a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went two
to three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved for the place. KHALI'S STORM tracked the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths,
chased in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was outfinished then lost the place but was clear for
the show. EAST HARBOR had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled off the pace, was coaxed along late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn
and lacked the needed response. ALOTTA JAYS was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and
came up empty.
