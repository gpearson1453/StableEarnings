Footnotes
ALL HALLOWS broke out and made light contact with GETAWAY CHARM, straightened then won the race to the first turn, led through moderate fractions
with some light pressure from that same foe in the early stages, slipped away from the field passing the three-furlong pole, then opened up when roused in
the stretch and cruised to an easy victory. AFTER MY OWN HEART veered out after the break and made some contact with BLUE BREEZE then was up
with the early leaders going into the first bend, ceded the lead, then settled mid-pack inside to the far turn, made steady forward progress through the turn,
tipped out to the two path to make a run at the eventual winner, could not match strides but finished well clear of the next horse. INFINITE LOVE was
allowed to settle into stride from the break, then advanced three to four wide around the turn, was in a tracking position to the outside of AFTER MY OWN
HEART for the run down the backstretch, went three wide through the far turn and four wide into the stretch, was kept to task and outfinished the rest to gain
the third spot.. FRESNO CHILE raced near the rear of the field through the first half, went into a drive from the nine-sixteenths pole, did not respond, was
under heavy pressure by the quarter pole and had little to offer in the stretch. BLUE BREEZE trailed the field through the first half-mile, launched a bid from
the five-sixteenths pole, swung six wide into the stretch, flattened out and did not improve. GETAWAY CHARM took a light bump from ALL HALLOWS at
the break but was otherwise away in good order, went three wide through the first turn and stalked that rival to the far turn then was unable to quicken when
that one went on with it passing the three-furlong marker and was no factor from that point.

Footnotes
NORTHERN ROSE allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground along the first turn then shifted out a path into the backstretch run, tracked the
decent pace to the half-mile marker, was taken outside of rivals into the second turn and gained ground three to four wide at the quarter marker, responded
to urging into upper stretch and loomed at the furlong pole, took a narrow lead into the final sixteenth and outfinished the runner-up in deep stretch to
prevail. KERRYGOLD LADY away from the gate in good order, vied for the early lead then ceded to BOURBON GLAZE along the first turn, stalked that
runner through decent fractions along the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, came in tight and waited for racing room at the quarter pole,
continued to encounter traffic into upper stretch, split rivals at the furlong marker and battled for the lead into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in the final
strides and was clear of the rest for second. HAPPY IS forwardly placed leaving the start, rated just off of the early pace and tracked two to three wide into
the backstretch run, well placed nearing the half-mile pole, mounted a two to three wide bid along the second turn and vied for the lead into the stretch,
battled with BOURBON GLAZE to the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish. MATCHLESS allowed to
settle away from the start, went two to three wide into the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the second
turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, found her best stride late and just missed for third. RHONDA'S COOKIN well
placed in the early running, stalked the pace from the inside heading into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the second turn, tipped two wide
into the stretch, closed into the final sixteenth but needed more. BOURBON GLAZE crowded between rivals leaving the start and was a step slow to begin,
prominent into the first turn, assumed command three wide and set the pace into the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead heading to the half-mile marker
and set decent fractions into the far turn, showed the way to the quarter pole, came under pressure into upper stretch and dug in at the furlong marker,
could not keep pace into the late stages and faded in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION raced between horses for the early lead, took command passing the half mile marker, met a challenge from JERRY JEFF WALKER
near the quarter pole, maintained a slight lead over that game rival as they dueled the length of the stretch and prevailed in a driving finish. JERRY JEFF
WALKER exchanged bumps with BRONY BOY after the start but was quick into stride and raced as the outside horse of a trio contesting the early lead,
was left to press the issue from the half when SCHOCHOH dropped out of it, pulled even with CONTINENTAL UNION at the quarter pole, battled gamely
with that rival to the but was unable to reel him in. AWESOME DUDE off a bit slow away from the gate, went three to four wide down the backstretch,
advanced to be with the leaders passing the half-mile pole, could not go on with the top pair but continued to run on to gain and hold the third spot.
SCHOCHOH was inside of three horses contesting the early pace, was content to let CONTINENTAL UNION go on with it from the half-mile pole, tried to
rebid on the far turn but could not keep up, finished evenly and was passed for third in mid-stretch. CARSON'S LEGACY was close up but at the back of the
main group racing inside to the turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch run but did not have the needed response finishing one-paced to the wire.
BRONY BOY exchanged bumps with JERRY JEFF WALKER after the break, then was outrun in the early going, trailed well behind to the turn and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the early pace from a two wide position into the backstretch run, chased the decent pace
to the half-mile pole, was roused into the second turn and vied for the lead two wide and between runners at the quarter marker, was confronted by
PRINCESA DEL TIGRE into upper stretch and raced on even terms with that rival heading to the furlong grounds, dueled into the final sixteenth, held a
narrow advantage into deep stretch and determinedly lasted in the final strides. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE settled just off of the early pace, raced inside of MY
YAMMY LADY into the first turn and floated that rival leaving the seven-furlong pole, was guided to the three path into the backstretch run and tracked the
decent pace while widest nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the second turn and loomed at the quarter pole, raced on even terms with
TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL into upper stretch and battled that rival to the furlong marker, dueled gamely into the final sixteenth, just missed for the win at the
finish and was well clear of the rest for place honors. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) broke sharply and vied for the early lead away from the gate, ceded the front
to CALLHERCONTESSA and tracked that runner from a ground saving position into the backstretch, well placed while saving ground nearing the half-mile
pole, saved all of the ground into the far turn then waited for racing room while behind rivals at the quarter pole, shifted three wide into upper stretch and
improved position at the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held well for third. MY YAMMY LADY unhurried leaving the start, was
floated three to four wide along the first turn, recovered and settled in the two path into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile pole while not
far back, guided two to three wide into the second turn, gained ground at the quarter marker and swung four wide for the drive, continued her bid while
widest at the furlong pole, could not sustain her run into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and missed for third. CALLHERCONTESSA sent
leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, controlled the pace through the backstretch run and set decent fractions
nearing the half-mile pole, came under pressure into the second turn and led to the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch and gave way in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
BROOKYS GAL came away in good order and was content to sit behind and let the pace scenario play out, stayed in the clear down the backstretch and
went three to four wide through the turn while making a forward move, responded when set down at the top of the stretch, finished strong and won the bob
at the wire in blanket finish. GREATFUL ATTITUDE broke outward at the start and made contact with OUTER SUNSET, had one horse beaten down the
backstretch then advanced while saving ground through the turn, tipped out to the two path for the stretch run, finished well but came out on the short end of
a tight photo . OUTER SUNSET took a light bump from GREATFUL ATTITUDE at the break, tracked the leading pair to the turn, gained steadily around the
bend, bid three wide into the stretch, was between horses as five of them fanned across the track at the top of the stretch, kept on willingly under steady
handling and intermittent urging just missed. SUPER ELLIE was slow to begin, fell far behind in the early going, saved ground and made up some ground
through the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, raced erratically but put in a big finish and came up just a head short. IRISH PRANCER ducked in at the
start but sprinted clear and set quick fractions to the turn, had three challengers fanned out across the track at the quarter pole, dug in and held a short lead
a the three-sixteenths pole then weakened before the furlong pole. MIRAGE CODE stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, stalked IRISH PRANCER
while racing in the two path to the far turn, moved to challenge that one at the quarter pole with two other challengers to the outside, gave way readily at the
top of the stretch and came up empty late.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST rated just off of the early pace, settled in the two path along the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, tracked the modest
pace approaching the half-mile marker and was taken outside of rivals into the far turn, chased three to four wide heading to the quarter pole, roused into
upper stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong grounds, took a narrow advantage at mid-stretch and battled CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS into the final
sixteenth, dug in into deep stretch and held in a drive in the final strides for a determined win. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) allowed to settle in the early going
while never far back, was caught a bit wide into the first turn, shifted to the two path and was unhurried into the backstretch run, content to trail approaching
the half-mile pole, was guided three to four wide into the second turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, asked for run five wide into the stretch and
made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and surged into deep stretch, missed for the win at the finish and won the nod
on the wire for place honors. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS prominent leaving the start, stalked the early pace outside of runners and went two to three wide
into the backstretch run, attended to the modest pace heading to the half-mile pole then chased the pacesetter two wide into the far turn, vied between rivals
into upper stretch and battled for the lead approaching the furlong pole, fought ECOLOGIST into the final sixteenth, was gallantly bested in deep stretch and
just missed for second at the finish, while holding safely for third. CHIEF JACKSON forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace from a
ground saving position, well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the pacesetter approaching the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into the
second turn, came in tight, checked and was boxed in at the quarter pole, found room into upper stretch and ran evenly while within aim nearing the furlong
marker, could not find the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked. BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and assumed command away from the
start, showed the way into the first turn and set modest fractions into the backstretch run, dictated terms into the second turn, battled while under pressure
into upper stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. J T'S WATCH bobbled leaving the start and was
off a step slowly, settled just off of the early pace and raced a bit in tight into the first turn, was guided three wide into the backstretch run and tracked the
modest pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased four to five wide into the second turn, swung six wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong
grounds and did not threaten in the final stages.

Footnotes
BROADWAY TIGER veered out at the break but managed to avoid contact, then was hustled and grabbed the early lead pressed briefly by CHAMAVILLE
and LISA'S ANGEL through the first furlong, opened up at the nine-sixteenths pole and led the field through the turn, always traveling well, was roused at
the top of the stretch and responded to steady handling and intermittent urging to win clear. ROSE OF JERICHO broke out at the start and bumped with
CHAMAVILLE, had to steady and dropped far behind the field, regained contact passing the half-mile pole, got a rail run through the turn, responded when
set down in the stretch but was no match for the winner. EYELIGHT steadied after the break and was slow to get going, made a forward move through the
turn three wide, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but lugged in and raced on the wrong lead until deep stretch but was still able to hold third.
CHAMAVILLE stumbled at the start then was bumped by ROSE OF JERICHO but managed to contest the early pace racing between horses, was prompted
to hold position when BROADWAY TIGER opened up on the turn, then was beset by challengers on both sides near the five-sixteenths pole, held ground to
the top of the stretch then weakened. LISA'S ANGEL raced three wide contesting the pace through the initial furlong, then ceded the lead to BROADWAY
TIGER, came under a ride and started to lose ground racing between horses on the turn, tipped out three wide and was outrun down the stretch.

Footnotes
RUNNIN UTE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the fast pace from the outside, was well placed into the turn and stalked the leading trio four
wide nearing the quarter marker, maintained a four wide path into the stretch and chased GRUBAUER to the furlong grounds, closed determinedly into the
final sixteenth, wore down GRUBAUER in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM forwardly placed leaving the start, took
back and settled off of the fast early pace, went four wide into the turn and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, chased four wide into upper
stretch, angled out and continued to advance at the furlong pole, responded to urging and closed fast into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and just
missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure place honors. GRUBAUER forwardly placed in the early running, chased the fast pace three wide
heading to the half-mile marker, pressed three to four wide into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, loomed into upper stretch, took command
and kicked clear at the furlong pole, was kept to firm urging while leading into the final sixteenth, was all out in deep stretch and was tagged for the win and
place, while holding safely for the show. DELIAN LEAGUE broke in at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed and was guided three wide into the
turn, was roused three wide and between rivals into the stretch, advanced at the furlong grounds and closed willingly in deep stretch. BRAVO RAGAZZO
away in good order, rated off of the fast early pace and went two wide into the turn, maintained a two wide path into the stretch and gained ground at the
furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth and showed good late interest. NAFTIS hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early running
and pressed the solid pace approaching the half-mile marker, contested the quick pace between runners into the turn and drifted out a bit nearing the
quarter marker, steadied at the top of the lane to avoid a drifting rival and chased to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and
faded. NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK hopped at the start and was off slowly, allowed to settle in the early running, improved position four to five wide along the turn
and went widest into the stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but could not threaten the leaders in deep stretch. PARTY WITH PADDY showed good
speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace approaching the half-mile marker, carved out fast fractions while pressured
to the quarter pole, drifted out a path into upper stretch and was overtaken heading to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and
tired. WAITINGATTHEBAR was void of early speed, lost position into the turn and did not factor.
