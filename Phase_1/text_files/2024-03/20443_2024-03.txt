Footnotes
HOT ROD RUMBLE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the advantage coming to the three-eighths pole, kicked clear in
upper stretch and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride to the finish. MOVING PICTURES chased the pace from third on the outside, went around
the turn in the four path, spun six wide into upper stretch, had the rider lose his crop outside the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place. FACE
ABARRIO was coaxed to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage nearing the three-eighths
pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. FIGHT FIERCELY dropped back while in tight between foes at the start, was hard
ridden at the rear, traveled around the turn in the three path and was no factor. GOLD IN THEM HILLS was restless in the gate, settled while coaxed along,
moved from the rail to the three path under stronger encouragement on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole
and lacked the needed response.

ECHO IN ETERNITY broke in at the start and was corrected, dueled from the two path with EASTERN STAR to her inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied coming in and bumping her main pace rival just outside the eighth pole before taking command a
furlong out, dug in inching away to the finish to prevail. SHE'S A NATURAL chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors in the late stages. EASTERN STAR coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of ECHO IN ETERNITY,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was bumped just outside the eighth pole before
yielding the front at that station, then weakened in the late going while safely along for the show honors. HAPPY'S SMILE chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, kept on one paced to the finish. AUTUMN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
CHATEAU was hustled to the front, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, inched clear in the two path on the turn, was roused outside the
quarter-pole, responded well under steady urging in the stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held sway under strong urging. TALKIN
PHAROAH stumbled at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the stretch but
missed while willingly earning the place. GRAYWING was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. HIGH HEAT was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the five
path, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. HORN OF PLENTY broke out then tossed his head briefly then dropped back,
was urged along near the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. CAN'T BEAT ME was urged along near the back, rounded the turn in the
two path and was no factor.

the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught in the late stages to the finish. SHASI chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting bumped by PAUCILOQUENT a furlong out, then kicked on belatedly to secure
the show honors. PROPER GRAMMAR chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outfinished. PAUCILOQUENT chased just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide
into upper stretch, bumped SHASI when drifting in weakening a furlong out, then tired to the finish. DANCE WITH ME BABE dueled two to three wide with
ARMY OF THOUGHTS to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. TWO
REDHEADS chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and was eased through the final furlong when
trailing throughout.

MAGICAL WAYS went around the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path under urging on the far
turn, took the advantage inside the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the stretch, responded well in the drive and held under strong urging.
MACALLAN was sent hard from the gate, raced inside on the first turn, came out onto the backstretch, showed the way off the rail while inside of a foe, vied
in the two path under urging on the far turn, was headed inside the three-eighths pole, fought on determinedly in the stretch but missed while able to get the
place. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from three
to five wide on the far turn, gained six wide into the stretch, chased outside while looming a threat into the final furlong but flattened out and was out-kicked
while clear for the show. MR. RIPPLE bumped with a rival at the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged
along late on the backstretch, chased four wide on the final turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. SHIPSATIONAL bumped with an opponent at the
start, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled at the back, was urged while four to six wide on the far turn, drifted inward inside the furlong marker
and lacked the needed response. CENTAVO was last to commence then urged early, went two to three wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. CHEEKY TICO tugged hard on the bit while under snug restraint in the three path going around the opening bend, tracked the pace
on the inside of a rival, was urged along late on the backstretch then dropped in, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
TRADE SECRET got bumped at the start by VINTAGE, who broke outwards, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader advancing to prompt
that same rival to the outside, got carried out as that foe drifted and swung nine wide into upper stretch, closed outside to issue a challenge through the final
furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. SISTER LINDA broke out at the start forcing MORE MANGO to check when pinched back against pressure
from GRINGOTTS, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and inherited the lead when
VINTAGE got out near the quarter pole, dug in under a drive under lone threat to the outside and was nailed in the final strides while well clear for the place
honors. VEGAS WEEKEND chased four then three wide in aim of the leader, got floated out nine wide into upper stretch as that foe got out near the quarter
pole, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. GRINGOTTS broke in at the start forcing MORE MANGO to check out when pinched between
foes, chased five wide down the backstretch before tucking along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. VINTAGE broke out at the start bumping TRADE SECRET, showed the way in hand along the inside under
some pressure from a pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and began to get out through the latter portion of the turn carrying those two prompting
rivals outwards with her, swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch forcing them nine wide, drifted out straightened away an additional path or two,
displaced from the front, continued under a drive to the finish weakening to the end, then got pulled up with aid of an outrider and was subsequently vanned
off. MORE MANGO got pinched out between foes and was checked at the start conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing midway, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.

CLEVER FOREVER went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, made a bid coming to
the five-sixteenths pole, took over outside the quarter-pole then shook clear into the stretch, responded well under the crop into the final furlong, drew away
while kept to the task under a brisk hand-ride until about forty yards from the finish then was placed under lighter encouragement while much the best.
HORSE BE WITH YOU was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole,
chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. NOBLE HUNTSMAN broke a half-step slow, went four wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, moved in near the five-eighths pole, was urged three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response while best of the
rest. AULA raced in the three path on the first turn, moved up with seven furlongs to run, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on
the far turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and tired. OCTOBER BLISS brushed the outside of the gate and was off a half-step slow, saved ground
while well placed off the pace, chased on the far turn and came up empty. PROVISION went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. SUPREME BEING broke a half-step slow, angled in at the rear, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was
urged while inside to the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.
