Footnotes
BRICKTOWN BROWN stalked the pace, ridden along three wide near the three eighths pole and prevailed late under all out pressure. PREACHER was off
a step slow, rushed up between into the firs turn, dug in four deep in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. PAYNTER'S BOY was allowed to settle
early, moved up five to six wide and closed in well late. LARCH raced mid pack early, was five wide around the far turn and made a good late bid.
SCREENPLAY was unhurried early, raced two to three wide and had no response. CHARMING CHARLIE had an inside run and never was a factor.
PARLAY PETE set a pressured early pace near the rail and faded. LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE failed to sustain a bid.

inside run and finished willingly to the wire. THATSAFACTJACK showed good early speed and faltered near the eighth pole. ARTHURIAN was bumped at
the start, raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch, shifted out a bit late and had no late rally. SLIM SLOW SLIDER was off slowly, raced
four to five wide and had no late rally. TIME MACHINE was forwardly placed two deep and gave way. LODE OF BLARNEY failed to respond.
