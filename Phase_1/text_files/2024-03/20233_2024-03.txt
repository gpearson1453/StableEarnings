Footnotes
COLBALOAF quick to the lead, ran off to a humongous lead into the far turn, stayed well clear in the stretch and to the wire. COUNTY COURT raced far
back to the stretch, rallied along late to be best of rest. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) broke a bit tardy from gate with no realistic chance going into the far turn and
ran on for show spot. NOT SO EASY never threatened throughout. FASTBYTE raced along evenly throughout with no response when needed.
SECRETARY OF WAR through early, never factored and outrun. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) good position to far turn, used up and dropped back. MID ATLANTIC
awkward start from gate, always far back. LUCKYINKENTUCKY never close throughout. CAROM chased monster to the half, gave way readily. ZERO TO
ONEHUNDRED chased monster to far turn, shortened stride in the stretch. the
