Footnotes
DUDLEY DICKERSON tracked the leaders down the backside, circled four wide on the far turn to take command turning for home and drew away down the
lane as much best. BROKENHEARTED stalked the pace while racing three wide throughout, rallied on the turn to take a brief lead nearing the quarter pole,
dug-in gamely but was no match for the winner while tiring through the stretch. BRADY unhurried early to be off the pace and rallied mildly in the lane to be
along for the show. SILENT MODE set a pressured pace form the gate to midway on the final bend and weakened turning for home. R ROOSTER pressed
the pace from between rivals through the first turn, continued to press from between to the quarter pole and tired coming home. SIRGONZO restless in the
gate, galloped away when the doors opened to be the trailer and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DROSSELMOON stalked the pace from three wide to midway on the turn, rallied three wide turning for home and steadily advanced to overtake the
pace-setter in deep stretch in a determined drive. MARTINKELLY sped to the lead from the gate, opened a clear advantage on the turn, maintained that
lead in mid-stretch and was caught by the winner late in a good effort. DEE BO well placed throughout tracking the leader, lost position on the bend, cut the
corner turning for home and rallied willingly along the rail. KAZ MUNNINGS unhurried in the early going to trail, rallied four wide on the turn to loom in upper
stretch and failed to get passed rivals in the lane. GANDY DANCING went one-paced never posing a threat. JUST GOT STARTED bumped inside and
outside rivals leaving the gate, raced up the rail to track the pace down the backside and failed to respond when called upon.

CELTIC REVIVAL pressed the early pace, took command on the turn, opened a clear advanntage and was never challenged in the stretch. UPTOWN
SERAPHINA stalked the pace through the turn, rallied turning for home and finished well to be clearly second best. DISCO DAISY set an early pressured
pace, could not go with the winner when challenged on the bend and kept-on down the lane to hold the show. LADYNESS unhurried early to be near the
rear of the field, angled out wide for the stretch run and closed well belatedly. AUGIE'S GIRL tracked the leaders to upper stretch and made a mild bid in the
lane. GLASS STAR reserved off the pace early, made a five wide rally turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. AUDIT COMMITTEE was never a
serious threat. WIN FOR LAILA failed to menace. SIMPLE JUSTICE trailed as a non-factor.

Footnotes
DUST BUNNY unhurried early to be near the rear of the pack, commenced a long drive midway on the turn, angled six wide for the drive and closed well to
be going away in deep stretch. FREYDIS tracked the leaders into the turn, circled four wide with an early bid, wore the pacesetter down inside the eighth
pole and could not hold the winner off. MOONSHINE WARRIOR prompted the early pace, lost position on the turn and re-rallied up the fence in the lane to
get the show. FIREBALL EXPRESS set the pace under steady pressure through the turn, battled to mid-stretch and weakened late. CATCH THE KITTEN
broke wide leaving the gate, flashed early speed, settled to a stalking position down the backside, loomed up on the turn and flattened out coming home. I
CAME TO DANCE failed to menace. SWEEPING PASSION was never a threat. LIAM'S KISS contended early on while racing up the rail and faded on the
turn.

MEET ME AT MUNDIS unhurried early to trail, commenced long steady advance entering the turn to circle the field six wide and finsihed well to be clear at
the wire. GENGHIS reserved off the early pace, rallied in upper stretch, waited for racing room in mid-stretch, split rivals willingly when the opening
appeared and closed well. GAGETOWN tracked the leaders to the top of the lane, rallied down the stretch but could not gain on the winner and was
outkicked late for the place. AGGRANDIZE sped up the fence to duel on the lead to the top of the lane and weakened through the drive. UNCLE DAR
pressed the pace from two wide to upper stretch and tired. YES SIR ROBERT showed brief speed to be prominent for a quarter and came up empty.

MALIBU'S BOSS MAN settled off the dueling pacesetters, rallied four wide to engage the leader in mid-stretch, dueled through the lane and got the bob on
the wire. PRETORIAN GOLD prompted the pace from three wide to the top of the lane, shook off the pacesetters in upper stretch, responded when
challenged by the winner and just missed in a game effort. WORK FROM HOME reserved off the pace to midway on the turn and closed with a grinding
rally to be along for the show. RIGATONI ALA VODKA unhurried to be near the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the lane. BAG OF GOLD pressed
the pace from between rivals to the top of the stretch and weakened in the drive. TACTICAL HUMOR set a pressured pace from the fence and gave way
leaving the quarter pole. VOLODYMYR was not a factor.

Footnotes
LADRO DI FICHI reserved in mid-pack to the turn, split rivals while rallying on the turn, angled in to cut the corner and won in a determined drive in a well
handled ride. MAGIC GLASS tracked the leaders in the turn, rallied four wide and made a steady advance down the outside through the lane. SANSA
ARIEL set a pressured pace, responded when called upon turning for home, battled through the lane and was out-finsihed late in the lane. STEPHANIE MY
LOVE well placed into the turn, made a threatening bid nearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally. KAZ MUSIC slow early to be near the rear
and showed some late interest with a mild stretch rally. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the lane. GET A GRIP
MARILYN chased the pace through the turn and lacked a closing response. UNFETTERED DIVA was not a threat. NAIL POLISH showed brief speed to
press the early pace and came up empty.

Footnotes
MELODIA tracked the leaders in the pocket down the backside, rallied on the turn, tipped out for the stretch drive, dueled with the runner-up down the lane
and prevailed in the final strides. CAGED PIXIE set a pressured pace throughout, shook off the presser turning for home, was quickly engaged by the
winner, dug-in battling to the wire but was out -nodded on the line. AMI'S LINK unhurried early, mounted a rally coming home with a belated bid to be best of
the rest. CAR LADY slow early to trail the field for five-eighths and made a mild raly up the fence to hit the board. LOVE IS STRONG stalked the pace to the
head of the lane and flattened out. JOLENE JOLENE reserved off the pace while well placed down the backside and lacked a closing response when called
upon into the final turn. CRICKET WEST pressed the pace for three-quarters and gave way in the lane. MISS LOYALTY raced near the rear of the field but
in contention to the final bend, dropped back through the turn and was not a factor.
