Footnotes
J. B. BOOKS took back off of the decent early pace, raced two wide into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, came in a bit tight
nearing the top of the lane and shifted three wide for the drive, rallied and came within aim at mid-stretch, vied for the lead past the furlong marker and took
command into the final sixteenth, kept the oncoming runner-up at bay in deep stretch and determinedly held in a drive to prevail. DRUM BUNNY stalked the
decent early pace from an outside position, raced three wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, swung four wide for the drive, rallied while
widest into the final furlong, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and held clearly for place honors. BURAQ'S REFLECTION was
forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the decent pace into the turn, kept close attendance to the pace while two wide at the quarter marker,
chased the pacesetter into the stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the final sixteenth and held well for third in the late stages. BOURBON DANCER
tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, saved ground into the turn, waited behind runners at the quarter marker then continued to experience
traffic into the stretch, shifted out at mid-stretch, found room past the furlong marker and could not muster the needed response in deep stretch. SPINNIN
PISTOLS sent to assume command away from the start, set a decent pace to the quarter marker, led into the stretch and dug in while under pressure at the
furlong marker, was overtaken in the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. DADS DREAM close up to the decent early pace, saved ground into the
turn and lost position approaching the quarter marker, lacked a response into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DEO broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, set moderate
fractions while well handled to the half-mile pole, kicked to a clear lead into the second turn, drew off into the stretch and was hand urged in the late stages
to prevail as much the best. UPRIGHT prominent leaving the start, ceded the early lead to DEO and stalked that rival into the first turn, was well placed into
the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile pole, lost ground to DEO approaching the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in
the stretch drive and stayed on well into the late stages to be second best. REEF CITY settled just off of the early pace, was caught wide into the first turn
and raced four to five wide into the backstretch run, was unhurried while not far back approaching the half-mile pole, went two wide into the far turn and
chased to the quarter marker, shifted widest into the stretch, needed more in the final furlong and held well in deep stretch for the show honors. THE FUSS
forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the pace three to four wide along the first turn, raced widest into the backstretch run, chased four wide into the
second turn, could not keep pace with the leaders into the stretch and was outfinished for third in the final sixteenth. MACLEAN'S RHYME a bit slow away
from the start, was allowed to settle while never far back, saved ground into the backstretch run, raced a bit greenly heading to the half-mile marker and
maintained an inside path into the far turn, trailed into the stretch did not offer a rally in the final stages.

Footnotes
SATANTA was away from the start in good order, took back off of the solid pace and settled while not far back in the early stages, was guided outside of
runners into the turn and raced four wide to the quarter marker, was asked for run into upper stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, closed
determinedly into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and edged away at the finish to prove best. THUNDER OF ZION was crowded and
bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was off a half-step slowly, recovered and vied for the early lead, assumed command and took a narrow
advantage to the half-mile marker, kicked clear into the turn and set a fast pace to the quarter pole, led into the stretch and kept to task to the furlong
marker, met the bid of SATANTA into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the determined winner in deep stretch and held well in the end for second.
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE prominent away from the start, came under an early hold and tracked the solid pace from the inside, was taken to the outside
approaching the turn and chased three wide to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit three wide to the furlong grounds, was outkicked by the top pair into the final
sixteenth and was well clear at the finish for third. LUCKY LAD broke out at the start and made contact with a neighboring rival, vied for the early lead with
THUNDER OF ZION and pressed inside of that rival heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the turn and chased the fast pace approaching the
quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MANY SILVER BELLS broke well but was kept off the pace and in tracking position while under a light hold early on, pulled into contention through the turn
and came into the stretch with dead aim on HOT CAKE, struggled to get by that stubborn foe to deep stretch, finally gained the advantage inside the
sixteenth and just held. BOLD ENCOUNTER raced in the middle of the strung out field, saved ground and advanced into contention through the turn, came
up the rail, finished willingly and just missed. HOT CAKE broke best and set a solid pace with HALLISAR pressing the issue to the inside, opened up length
or two on the field through the turn then responded when set down at the top of the stretch, was challenged by MANY SILVER BELLS to the outside, drifted
out a bit in the late stages, brushed with the winner, finished gamely but could not hold on in the final yards. BROTHER O' BRIEN hit the gate at the start
and was away a bit awkwardly, lacked early speed and saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, found his best stride late and encountered
traffic into deep stretch. HALLISAR was quick to begin and attended the pace to the inside of HOT CAKE through the early stages, dropped back a bit going
into the turn, then attempted to re-bid between from the five-sixteenths pole alongside MANY SILVER BELLS who was making a run to the outside,
weakened early in the stretch, could not keep up late and was not persevered with late. ONE BOLD BID was not asked for speed from the break and was
soon far behind the field racing about three off the rail with BROTHER O'BRIEN to the inside, continued to race wide through the turn and into the stretch
but was never a threat.

Footnotes
STRAIT OF GEORGIA showed good speed away from the start, assumed command into the first turn and set the pace while off of the rail into the
backstretch run, carved out moderate fractions while setting the pace to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the second turn and battled with EFFECTIVE
GIG into upper stretch, shook free from that rival and was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, dug in gamely while under pressure in deep stretch
and lasted for the win at the finish. DARK MYSTERY was allowed to settle away from the start, raced two to three wide into the backstretch run and tracked
the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn, was roused four wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker,
closed fast while widest into the final sixteenth and surged in the final strides, just missed for the win at the finish and won the nod for second over his
stablemate. MADE THE TEAM hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and settled two wide into the first turn, was content to track the
moderate pace to the half-mile marker and saved ground into the far turn, was asked for run into the stretch and improved position at the furlong grounds,
closed willingly into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and was just edged for second at the finish, while holding safely in the end for third.
WARRENS CANDY MAN was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the moderate early pace while under a snug hold, raced keenly into the
backstretch run and remained under a hold approaching the half-mile pole, chased two to three wide into the far turn, maintained a three wide path into the
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, drifted in a bit inside of the sixteenth-marker and crowded GORDY'S BOY, rallied into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished. GORDY'S BOY hustled away from the start and was prominent in the early stages, ceded the lead to STRAIT OF GEORGIA and stalked that
runner while saving ground into the first turn, raced close up to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and chased to
the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, encountered traffic while between rivals into the final sixteenth and could not
muster the needed late response. WRONG SPOT unhurried away from the start, maintained an outside path into the first turn and raced three to four wide
into the backstretch run, was content to track the moderate pace while widest approaching the half-mile pole, chased two wide to the quarter marker, swung
four wide for the drive and showed good late interest, while unable to threaten in the final sixteenth. EFFECTIVE GIG sent leaving the start, was forwardly
placed into the first turn and stalked the pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run, advanced into the backstretch and prompted the moderate
pace to the half-mile pole, pressed STRAIT OF GEORGIA into the far turn and battled that rival for the lead into the stretch, lost ground past mid-stretch,
chased into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch.

the final sixteenth, could not reel in his stablemate at the finish and held well in the end for second. OUR BOLD PRINCE a bit slow away from the start, was

and came in tight nearing the quarter pole, was boxed in into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and was
up in the final strides to earn show honors. ALEXANDER'S DREAM was away in good order and vied for the early lead, ceded the advantage to WAR

Footnotes
ANN broke well but ceded the lead, grabbed a spot on the rail, and let the pace scenario play out in front, was given the cue to go on with three furlongs to
run, quickly inhaled the leaders three wide, opened up in the stretch and easily held. HANG ON was hustled from the break and gained the inside track and
the lead before the first turn, was shadowed by LOVELY BRIDE for a six furlongs, left that foe behind at the top of the stretch, tried in vain to hold off ANN
but kept on under steady handling and was able to hang on for second. BELLA ROSINA raced mid-pack under light restraint through the first turn, then
dropped back a bit and was only racing ahead of the two stragglers down the backstretch, went into a drive from the half-mile pole, followed the path of ANN
through the far turn, chased that rival into the stretch, could not match strides, finished well under intermittent urging but could not pass HANG ON for
second. IMA KEEN ICE tracked well behind the early leaders and was just to the outside of ANN for the first half mile, could not keep up when that one
quickened away on the turn but saved ground, kept to task and finished best of the also-rans. MY MOTORHOME checked hard going into the first turn then
had only HARRY'S BIG DREAM beaten early on, raced in tandem with that rival well behind the field to the far turn, went three to four wide into the stretch
and improved a bit once in the clear. SANTALUZ DREAM tracked three wide and a length or two behind the dueling leaders to the turn, remained wide
through the far turn, started to struggle to keep up after passing the three furlong marker and had nothing to offer in the stretch. HARRY'S BIG DREAM was
last away then moved quickly over to the rail, but showed little. LOVELY BRIDE pressed just to the outside of HANG ON with those two well clear of the
rest, hung in there for six furlongs then tired and faded to last down the stretch.
