Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY prominent from the start, shuffled back a bit from between horses late backstretch, moved out three wide into the turn, challenged outside
the leader late in the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch and drew out under steady handling. KOALA broke well while outside, angled in a bit to put
some outside pressure on the winner with a half mile to run, offered brief resistance to that one when challenged exiting the turn, proved no match in the
drive, remained clear for the place. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN lacked early foot off the inside, raced in some traffic into the turn, dropped in a bit in the turn,
staged a mild rally for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. AWESOME VIEW pressed the issue up front along the inside for a half and began to
weaken. INVALUABLE went one paced outside in lacking a closing kick. Z ZS RED fell back to trail after the start, raced off the inside turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while never a threat through the lane. COST A FORTUNE off a step slow, was used to move up to mid pack, had little for the drive.
MISS WINDY SLEW tired while racing off the inside.

NATURAL TOUCH broke alertly, narrowly set the pace between foes early, vied through the turn in the two path, edged away steadily through the lane
under firm handling. STREET PAINTER raced in some early traffic behind the pace, bothered, moved closer four wide through the turn, could not match
strides with the winner through the stretch, held sway for the place. ARDEN AR broke out and lost right iron to be away a bit slowly, regained that iron
before a half, raced five wide through the turn, finished up willingly while remaining well out in the strip. KANTIRUN pressed the pace while racing in the
three path for a half, began to gradually weaken turning for home. SOPHIE'S STAR back off the pace and the inside, raced between horses into the lane in
the two path, improved position upper stretch then flattened out a bit late. WILD CHEROKEE came in early, forwardly placed up the backstretch between
horses, had little for the drive to finish up evenly. SARAH IN THE HOUSE bumped at the start to be away slowly, raced three wide through the turn, also
lacked a closing response. HONEY PAT bothered early when put in tight, steadied, moved out, five wide late in the turn, also failed to rally. SOUTHERN
SPEIGHT sandwiched at the start to be away slowly, raced back and off the rail, did not menace. TEKANA in tight along the rail the opening furlong,
checked up up, fell back, picked off a rival or two into the lane then faded. TWO BELLS broke in, flashed brief speed early along the inside, stopped into the
turn, distanced after losing contact with the field stretch, jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN UP THE
BACKSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ATOMIC TONE off the early pace outside, advanced into a challenging position four wide through the turn, outside bid into the stretch, drove clear.
STOMPING HOTROD pressed the issue off the inside, challenged between foes and inside the winner turning for home, proved no match for that one late,
clearly second best. BLACK STORM in mid pack while racing just off the inside, staged a mild rally from between horses to annex the show, not a threat to
the top two. UNDER THE GUN chased the early leader in the two path, began to weaken late in the turn, continued to fade final furlong. REEF'S DESTINY
in mid pack off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. VIOLENT GIGI lacked early speed, raced
four wide into the turn, angled in a bit to the in the two path exiting, no real threat. BABA'S BOY off a step slow, void of speed for a half, picked off some
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. D TWO fell back to trail after the start, four wide through the turn, also passing tiring rivals while not a factor.
DRILL'S LI'L MAN in the second flight inside, gave way while continuing to save ground. PRESS SNOOZE was finished early while racing off the inside.
CREEKMORE broke sharp, soon sprinted clear, set the pace for a half then stopped when headed into the stretch.

Footnotes
IMPEL prompted the pace off the inside, continued to stalk in hand up the backstretch, took over in the second turn, drew out steadily down the lane under
her our own courage to win ridden out. MERASOL SUGAR four wide into the first turn, within striking distance the middle half, 3w into lane, proved no match
for the winner in the drive, remained clear for the place. PUN INTENDED settled off the pace and the inside, three wide and in some traffic into the far turn,
roused for the drive, slowly gaining for the place. TANYA SHOWERS off a step slow, trailed early, raced four wide through the final turn, closer upper
stretch, outkicked for the show late. LOOKSTER lacked early foot, steered four wide turning for home, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, finished up evenly
after being straightened. CANDY OAK raced briefly forward, stopped after a half, jogged in well back. HAYEK sprinted clear just after the break, set the
pace for over five furlongs, stopped when headed by the winner far turn and also jogged in well beaten.

Footnotes
FASHION IDOL pressed early off the inside, dueled the middle half, shook clear into the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being
kept to task. BUMP IN THE NIGHT within striking distance along the inside, shuffled back when in tight along the rail into the far turn, regathered, advanced
while continuing to save ground through the second bend, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. DOMINA lacked early
foot while four wide through much of the first turn, continued outside, advanced four wide through the second bend, closest to the winner past the furlong
marker, caught for the second spot. DR. WOODS MIRACLE last away void of speed off the inside, rallied four wide out of the final turn, not enough late for
the show. GRACEFUL MOON settled off the pace and the inside, four wide through the second turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve
position, no real threat. AMOUREUX five wide into the first turn, four wide exiting, moved closer before a half, chased the winner through the second turn
then weakened in the drive. ERUMPENT turned in an even effort inside, lacked closing response. CATTY CRUISE in the second flight while off the inside,
had little left for the drive. RAETASTIC raced in mid pack while in the three path, was finished after half. RED SUNSHINE fell back after the start, lacked
speed, failed to threaten. GLOBAL RISK broke on top, set the pace toward the rail, stopped when headed by the winner far turn. LIL' BIT OF CHROME was
never a factor.

Footnotes
SHE BE SHEEHAN prompted the early pace in the three path through the first turn, continued to prompt the winner the next half mild, bid, took over turning
for home, clear late, just lasted. ROYAL LAUGHTER lacked speed off the inside early, moved closer in the second bend just off the rail, tipped out three
wide into the lane, lugged in when moving on the winner nearing the furlong marker, stalled, late push, just missed. MARCO SUNSET cleared in the two
path the opening quarter, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace far turn along the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner
turning for home while also failing to match the runner up, saved the show late. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD raced in mid pack well out in the strip in the four
path first turn, continued outside, four wide again second turn, went one paced through the lane. SALSALITA VERDE in the second flight outside, four wide
into the stretch, lacked the needed closing response in finishing up evenly. FEARLESS KRISTIE saved ground in the second flight, came up empty for the
drive. I'M SO FUNNY raced off the pace toward the inside, failed to muster a response in the drive. DIRTY FLIRT off a bit slow, remained back. DREAMFUL
broke back, lagged well back throughout, distanced after losing contact with the field through the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN) off a step slow, moved up inside to race behind the first flight up the backstretch, dueled into and through upper stretch,
kicked strongly clear the final furlong. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN broke on top, cleared early in the two path, allowed the winner the inside early in the turn,
dueled outside that one until a furlong remained then proved no match. VIOLENT RIVER lacked early foot, raced three wide through the turn, turned in a
belated rally to annex the show, not a threat to the top pair. KINGMAKER back off the pace well off the inside, raced four wide through the turn, five wide
into the lane when moving a bit closer, went evenly late to lose the show. LOOK SHARP balked at loading, broke with the field, lacked speed out toward the
middle of the strip, five wide turn, was also found lacking in the late going to finish up evenly. DAY JO forwardly placed and four wide into the turn, three
wide exiting, had little for the run to the wire. KANT CONQUER ME fell back to trail after the start, made little impact while improving slightly. STREAKIN
DEACON staged a steady retreat while racing off the inside. MILLCREEK ROAD remained back in failing to threaten. MO ANGELL pressed the issue early
from between rivals, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
HAPPY IS A CHOICE outrun in the early going, steered out and challenged five wide turning for home, vied past the furlong marker while still widest of the
first flight, edging away late under steady handling. EASY ACTION with the early pace, fell back off the leader late backstretch, chased that one into the
turn, moved up along side then took over by late in the bend, vied past the furlong marker between rivals, gave ground grudgingly to the winner. SQUIRE
CREEK forwardly placed early inside, moved out a bit and challenged between horses exiting the turn, vied past the furlong marker inside the top two, could
not match those two to the wire, lasted for the show. LIFE IS HARD void of early foot, four wide through the turn, lodged a belated rally to improve position.
TOP GUNNER in mid pack toward the inside early, behind traffic off the inside late in the turn, angled in a bit for the drive, lacked a response. ECHO AGAIN
within striking distance, angled out four wide turning into the stretch, also came up empty. FRAT PACK went one paced while three wide in lacking a bid.
SWIFT AS I AM broke back and failed to menace. GOLDEN HORNET sprinted clear the opening furlong, set the pace for almost four furlongs then gave
way when headed by the runner up late in the turn. VULCAN in mid pack early, shuffled back in some traffic before a quarter then gave way in the turn to
trail home.

Footnotes
NGALA closest to the leader out in the strip, bid in the three path turning for home, kicked clear under steady handling. RANGE LIFE forwardly placed along
the inside for a half, steered out sharply to be four wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. DENADA off a step slow, void of
early foot, three wide into the lane, lodged a belated and willing rally to annex the show. PRINCIPAL ANITA off a step slow, back off the pace outside, four
wide through much of the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. ADAMANTLY back off the pace inside, moved out a bit in the run through
the turn, also bettered position without menacing. TIZ A STRATEGY in mid pack in the run up the backstretch, angled in steadily through the turn, failed to
rally. KOKOMO STARLET broke sharp, soon clear, set the pace for over a half until headed by the winner into the stretch, folded. TEXAS SEQUOIA fell
back to trail after the start, three wide through much of the turn while back, passed tiring rivals. BEE BRANCH in the second flight early, faded. DRIVING
settled off the pace three wide for a half, backed up through the stretch. DERBY DAY GOLD finished early, trailed home.
