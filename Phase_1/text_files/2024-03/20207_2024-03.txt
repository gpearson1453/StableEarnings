Footnotes
TRAVAILLE laid close up inside of the leaders while a path off of the inner rail, moved forward to bid inside of the pace setter in upper stretch, then drew
clear while drifting out. HURRICANE LASSIE broke a bit inwardly, settled off of the pace along the inside and ran on to gain place nearing the wire. LITTLE
BLAZE set the pace in the three path, drifted outwardly while getting headed by an inner bidder nearing midstretch, then continued to lug while tiring and
was caught for place in the closing stages. FIRST LOVE pressed the leader from the four path but gave way in upper stretch. JUNIORS JOANIE chased in
the three path and lacked a bid. BOLD EXAGGERATION leaned inwardly at the start, dropped back quickly soon after, then showed little and was eased
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
PI YO PRINCESS broke a bit inwardly, rated at the rear along the inside, rallied tipping two wide turning for home, sustained progress to bid at the sixteenth
pole and drew clear. MARY JACK set a clear pace in the two path, widened her margin approaching the far turn, came under rousing in upper stretch, then
drifted out while getting caught in the final sixteenth. SIMPLE PLEASURE laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the fie path around the far turn and ran on
mildly. FOUR PRINCESSES settled off of the pace along the inside, advanced to gain place at the three furlong pole, but lost that position to an outer bidder
entering the lane, chased into the final furlong and yielded. CATHERINE BLAZE raced at the rear in the three to five path, then in the four path around the
far turn and failed to factor. BEYOND THE HYPE tracked in the two path, was urged in pursuit in the two to three path around the far turn and faded. DRE
ME LESS stalked in the five path but faded into the far turn. SHE'S A BIG STAR stalked in the four path and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
WARDY showed the way in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, met that foe's challenge turning for home, repelled that rival in upper stretch,
shook free and held sway. J T'S IMAGINATION pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, bid turning for home, but was turned away in upper
stretch and chased willingly to remain clear of the rest. HIGH ENOUGH was forced out by an inner rival and squarely bumped an outer foe at the start,
lacked early speed along the inside, advanced position approaching the half mile pole then offered a rail grind to vie for show with an outer rival in
midstretch and held that position. TIZZY INDY bumped with an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, shfited out to the six path in
upper stretch, ran on to vie for show into the final furlong but was kept at bay. SMOOTHDINI took firm contact from an inner foe at the start, then made little
impact from the four path. ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased the top pair around the far turn and
faded. KINGSCOTE came out at the start, then laid off of the pace along the inside, faded into the far turn and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
STAR READY set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, repelled that bidder in upper stretch and held sway. LAST OF THE
PAST bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside and ran on to gain place in the shadow of the wire. BELLAMY
BROTHER stalked along the inside, bid outside of the leader turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, yielded and lost place at the wire.
MINE YOUR BIZ lacked speed in the four path, advanced in the five to six path around the far turn and ran on mildly. BIG TAP BABY bumped with an outer
rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, improved in the three path around the far turn, entered the lane in the four path and flattened out.
WILD FIST trailed in the three path, tipped to the four path turning for home and moved up. A TRUE TARGET bumped with an inner rival at the start,
pursued from midpack tucking from the five to three path around the first turn, chased from the two path around the far turn and weakened. QUEENIE'S
LEROY lacked speed in the three to two path and made little impact. KEV MAN bobbled at the start, stalked in the three path and between horses early on,
then weakened around the far turn. RENATI bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path but weakened into the final bend.

Footnotes
DIXIE FARMER stalked in the four path, bid turning for home and drove clear entering midstretch. ENTITLEMENT settled off of the pace three wide, shifted
to the six path into the far turn and ran on to reach place late. STARSNMOTION vied along the inside, led around the far turn as an outer foe loomed a
danger, proved no match for that one nearing midstretch, lugged out severely through the final furlong and lost place to an inner bidder late. CZAR'S
BALLERINA laid off of the pace along the inside, improved to chase the leaders turning for home, tipped to the four path entering the lane but lacked a bid.
MI LIA trailed in the two path and improved position in upper stretch. SIKARA SIKARA tracked along the inside, moved out down the backstretch, came
under urging drifting out to the four to five path turning for home and failed to factor. LEAD ME laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then made
little impact. DADDY HEY DADDY vied for the lead in the three path but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. LIGHTENING MO broke out at
the start, tracked in the three path, moved out to the five path approaching the far turn and faded around that bend.

HERD IMMUNITY was brushed and put to a bit of crowded quarters among foes at the start, trailed around the turn, then rallied up the rail to offer a late bid
and forged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. MIDNIGHT FIRE showed the way two wide, built a clear margin around the turn, held sway into deep
stretch but was caught by an inner bidder at the wire. SILVER WINGS was a bit restless in the starting gate, raced off of the pace in the three path and
between horses, moved out to the five to six path entering upper stretch and rallied belatedly. BERTIE'S GALAXY chased from midpack four wide and
between horses, chased in upper stretch, but lugged in while hanging on his left lead at the furlong grounds and flattened out. PREMIUM stalked three wide,
chased in upper stretch, got outkicked between horses in midstretch and gave way. DREAMER'S DISEASE prompted along the inside, failed to sustain
pressure and chased into the turn, then yielded between horses on his left lead. VERB pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted out five wide entering
upper stretch but lacked a kick. PRADO'S PRIORITY laid off of the pace caught five wide, floated to the seven path at the top of the stretch and was outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
BIG TO DO bumped with an inner rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, met an outer challenge entering the lane, shook free of that drifting bidder
passing the three sixteenths pole and held sway. SPECIAL DISPATCH took light contact from an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside, took aim
outside of the leader and from the three path turning for home, bid entering the lane, but was turned away while drifting out passing the three sixteenths
pole, kept on well flopping back to his left lead nearing the final sixteenth and was second best. FEAR OF UNION brushed an outer foe at the start trailed
along the inside, moved out of last approaching the half mile pole, saved ground around the far turn, then ran on mildly to improve past outer rivals.
SAGITTARIUS broke a bit outwardly, tracked from the four path, chased from the three path around the far turn then lacked a bid. CELESTIAL JOY (GB)
bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to four path, drifted to the six path entering upper stretch and failed to factor.
MONOLITH lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. ROCKSTAR RED stalked in the three path, chased around the far turn, got floated to the
four path nearing the lane and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
COUNTRY ANGEL broke through the gate pre-race as an outer rival was hesitant to load, pursued from midpack along the inside, rallied in the three path
hanging on her left lead to bid at the sixteenth pole, led soon after and held from an outer bidder. SPARKLE CITY laid off of the pace in the three to four
path, rallied to offer a late bid but missed. MALLORY'S OCEAN was hesitant to load, then broke slow, lacked speed in the three path and rallied between
horses to reach show late. CAIRO CHARM stalked outside of the leader, bid entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch, but was caught at the sixteenth pole
and gave way. CHUCHI lacked speed along the inside and improved position. HIGHLANDER'S EDGE tracked in the three to two path, shifted to the four
path in upper stretch and lacked a bid while getting outkicked between horses in the final furlong. GEMMY failed to menace from the four to five path.
MALLORY UNBRIDLED was no factor. KRAZY KATIE set a clear pace, but was headed entering the lane and stopped. OUR BOSS LADY brushed the
inner stall door and broke multiple lengths slow, then was outrun throughout.
