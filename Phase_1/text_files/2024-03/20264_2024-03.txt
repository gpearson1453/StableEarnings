Footnotes
KEEN HEIR stalked the pace, bid for the lead between horses turning for home, gained command in upper stretch, drew off under urging, remained on his
left and drifted out in the drive. FOUND MY BALL stalked the pace down the backstretch, eased out entering the far turn, was fanned four wide turning for
home and offered a slight rally. KYSTONE , never far back off the rail down the backstretch and on the far turn, raced inside horses in the stretch and
passed tired ones. COOL PAPA G showed speed near the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and gave way. TEXTHELEGEND lacked speed, raced
near the inner rail the far turn and failed to menace inside horses. ORTH stumbled at the break, swung out turning for home and failed to rally. ABSOLUTE
UNIT , in the four path down the backstretch, disputed the pace to the stretch and gave way.

dead heat with that one. WEALTH N HEALTH bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace outside horses down the backstretch, bid for the lead
outside QUEENS EFFORT on the turn then battled that one through the lane. HARBOR THUNDER , four wide on the turn, lugged in near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
DIRT FLIRT , patiently rated inside horses, saved ground on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch, swept to command inside the sixteenth pole then
drew clear. LOOPY , clear soon after the break, set the pace, was still well clear in mid stretch, drifted out and willingly held the place. OLIVIA'S CHOICE
(IRE) , along the rail on both turns, angled out approaching the stretch and rallied. GYPSY WIFE lacked speed inside horses, swung outside in mid stretch
and passed tired horses. LEMON DROP LADY chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened in the drive. MAGAZINE , in range between horses into the
far turn, floated wide turning for home and lacked a rally. HOLY ZAGS , wide the far turn, failed to rally. GUARDING ELK CAMP was not a factor. RIVETING
SPIRIT , in range four deep leaving the backstretch, weakened. CHIC SAMARAI chased the pace and gave way in upper stretch.
