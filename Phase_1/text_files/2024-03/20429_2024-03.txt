Footnotes
COLBALOAF was quick away from the gate while, in full command throughout with a breather at the half and coasted to the wire as tons the best.
BLUEGRASS PARKWAY had a tardy start from inside, ran on far turn, kept on for place. EPIMYTHIUM off rail chase with an even effort for the show spot at
the wire. GRACEFUL KITTEN chased monster to the stretch, weakened in the final furlong. COMMAND CENTRAL showed no speed from outside with no
response when needed. NOT YET CHARLIE always trailed throughout.

far turn, dueled in the stretch, stayed gamely to the wire but nailed late. MO SENSE saved ground to quarter pole, angled out into stretch for the show spot.
FORTUNE BOUND no speed to the half, leveled off from far turn, evenly in the stretch and just missed the show spot. RESILIENT BEAUTY chasing leader
to the half, could not keep up weakened late. SILENT REVENGE pinched back at the start, never in contention, evenly stretch. I GOTTA BOLT off rail run to
far turn while through at the half, faded back. CRYSTAL SNOW sprinted to the front, cleared to the half, dueled far turn empty.
