Footnotes
SHESPUN pressed the early leader two deep from the outside and finished well to be well clear under a steady hand ride. SWEET N SALTY stalked the
pace three deep, moved up in the lane and was clearly second best. SMOKIN MOTION dropped back early off the early going, raced three to four wide and
never was a serious threat. TENSAS CLEAR set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded. GOSPEL GORGEOUS was off slowly, void early speed
and never menaced. EXHI LIL DARLIN ran for purse money only as it was not a scratched horse, dropped back early, raced four to five wide around the far
turn and raced far back to never threaten.

SCARLET POSITION stalked the pace from the outside of foes, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear late under strong
pressure. IRON LOTUS was away alert, tracked the early leader two deep and kept on well late to finish second best. HEY ROXY was allowed to settle
early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and moved up late to improve position. LIGHTNING HART was sent along from the inside to take a clear early
lead and weakened nearing the eighth pole. FACESTER raced mid pack early, was four to five wide around the far turn and never threatened while racing
from the far outside. SMOKING GUITAR dropped back early, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. APRETTYLULABY was
allowed to settle early, saved ground and never was a factor. TWO ANGELS rated along under a hold from the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
DEN'S DYNASTY pressed the early leader two deep, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. STRAIGHT AHEAD was off slowly, raced far back
after the poor start early, advanced through the far turn, raced wide into the upper stretch, surged late and missed in a game effort. PONZA showed good
early foot along the inside and gave way to the top pair grudgingly. HE'S ALL EARS stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and flattened out in the drive. RED MOUNTAIN dropped back to race mid pack early, saved ground around the far turn into the stretch and raced even with
no closing run. DETERMINED LOVER raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no late rally. ISAIDWHATISAID took up at the break, raced near
the back after the poor start, raced five deep around the far turn and never threatened. STORMSACOMIN stalked the pace from the outside of rivals and
faded. GOSPEL FOREST threw his at the break and never threatened.

Footnotes
OKIE SMOKE settled off the early going to race with the second flight, advanced along the inside around the far turn, continued with a rail bid in the and
lane edged clear under strong handling. IN BOND WE TRUST was allowed to settle mid pack, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and kept on
gamely to the wire while racing from the outside. LA BATALLA pressed the early leader two deep, was four wide in the lane and kept on willingly to the wire.
MISSING CODE void of early speed, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up late to improve position. QUALITY BLASTOFF was off slowly,
swung eight wide into the lane moved up but had not enough. TOUCHDOWN OKLAHOMA stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn and
weakened a bit in the drive. DA SOLITARIO set pressured early pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. HE'S A ROCK was allowed to
settle and failed to respond. LUCKY MCCOY raced two to three wide and lacked a bid. C B'S FLAT OUT was hustled along from the outside and faded.
