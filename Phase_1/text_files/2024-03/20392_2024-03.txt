first turn, kept on to far turn while blocked inside, eased around the crowd and rallied on gamely in the stretch run. TERRITORIALITY speed to the front,
stayed well to deep stretch, outkicked late. ALWAYS DREAM BIG r aced along evenly with no response when needed in stretch. PUT THE CRAZY AWAY
off rail run to far turn with a gradual fade in the stretch run. SPRAT never reached contention. SNAP JUDGEMENT bit tardy outside, showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
JUANITA'S EXPRESS sat in a good spot to far turn, lacked room to quarter pole angled out smoothly with a good effort to wire and prevail. HAIG POINT
chased pace off rail to the half, kept on gamely, outfinished. DRIFTWOOD swiftly to the front, clear to far turn, dug in stretch but weakened late MALTHAEL
off rail run to far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch to wire. COUNTY COURT outside run to far turn with mild improvement. NOT SO EASY never a menace
throughout. LUCKYINKENTUCKY saved ground to no avail throughout. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) had a slow start and always back. SMOKEY LEE never
threatened. VIOLIN MAKER tried to keep up for three quarter, gave in the stretch run.

Footnotes
POLSTER sat in perfect position to the stretch, rallied on off rail under stout handling to go clear. MOHTAFIL outside run past quarter pole, rallied on nicely
for the place position. LOU'S LEGACY had an inside run with an even effort for the show spot. LEVANTER antsy in the gate with an awkward start, rallied
into the stretch to improve late. PAVED IN GOLD quick inside speed to front, led to deep stretch, headed and weakened. ACCIDENT no speed from outside
to turn, moved up from quarter pole to wire. FRENCH BREAD off rail run to stretch never far back with no response. TIGER'S LEGACY dueled to turn with
nothing left and faltered back through the stretch run. TAPIT'S TALE slow into stride with little to show thereafter. C V SHACKLES close up inside to the
turn, gave in readily through the stretch. WHERE'S JACK never menaced throughout. WARRING THUNDER tried to keep to the turn with a steady fade in
the stretch. PER THE HORSE RRACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, LEVANTER HAS BEEN DQ'D FROM 4TH TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE
TEST PER RULING ECM2024-133.
