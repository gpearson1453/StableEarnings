PURE ELEGANCE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole
and kicked clear in the lane. BOY IS SHE A LADY raced off the pace on the outside early, continued around the bend in the two path, launched a bid
entering the stretch, switched inside to gain ground between horses and chased the winner home from there. COUNTLESS DREAMS tracked the pace
setters on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the lane. CALENDULA raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and was outkicked in the stretch. MIGHTY GIN GIN opened up on the field racing up the
backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the bend and weakened in the final furlong. LA CHICA LATERAL stalked the leader on the
outside through the opening quarter, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
REAL MIKEY raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around
the far turn and kicked clear in the lane. SUBTLE SENORITA was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the three path early, settled off the pace on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and improved position in the stretch. LUCKY IN LOVE veered out leaving the
gate, trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, swung out to the five path coming around the second bend and improved position
from there. LIVELY REMARK raced in the two and three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside,
navigated the far bend from the three path and finished evenly. FIRELANE hopped up mildly leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, pressed the pace
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. LIBERTALIA led the way from the three path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the three path and tired in the lane. FORTUNATA raced in the four path around
the first turn, stalled the leader on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far bend and continued to fade in the
stretch.

Footnotes
SEQUIN LADY brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three
path, kicked clear in the lane and held that margin to the wire. PERFECTLY GOLDEN tracked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter,
navigated the bend from the four path and improved position in the lane but could not catch the winner. TRUE ATKA raced off the pace up the backstretch,
came around the turn in the three path and improved position in the lane. FOREVER UNCAPTURED dueled on the inside through the early going,
continued to battle from the two path coming around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. DEL REY DOLLY dueled between horses up the
backstretch, dropped back while racing in the four path around the bend and continued to fade from there. VILLAGE QUEEN brushed with the horse to her
outside at the start, stalked the leader on the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and tired in the lane. MISTY GALE trailed the field
throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
