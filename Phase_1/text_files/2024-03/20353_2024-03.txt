Footnotes
BUMP IN THE NIGHT outrun in the early going, began to advance three wide late in the final turn, lugged in under a right handed crop in upper stretch,
steered out, outside bid inside the furlong marker, wore that rival down to gain the nod at the wire. VALERIE BLUE in the second flight early off the inside,
moved on the two leaders late in the final turn, three wide into the lane, took over, responded when the winner came alongside with less than a furlong
remaining, proved stubborn to the end. GOGO BOBBYJO sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way onto and up the backstretch, responded when
challenged midway the final turn, gradually weakened through the lane, comfortably saved the show,. CRY IF I WANT TO broke out to push out SHEZA
SHENANIGAN, was straightened, chased the leader in the three path, remained closest to that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, challenged soon
after to gain the advantage then faltered from between horses past the furlong marker. SHEZA SHENANIGAN pushed out to be away slowly, trailed off the
inside, four wide into the stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. DIXIE RAG was finished after a half while racing off the
inside. CATALINA SUNRISE in the second flight early along the inside, stopped after a half, finished far back and jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH UPPER STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SINGING EMMA prompted the early issue in the three path, closer into the turn, challenged on the outside turning for home, briefly put a head in front
between calls upper stretch, headed a furlong out,. regained the advantage and proved best in determined fashion. DISTORTED SECRETS off the early
pace and the inside, moved closer in the two path late backstretch, fell back into the turn, moved out 3w, rebid in upper stretch, led a furlong out and hung.
CADEAU DE PAIX back off the pace three wide, swung four wide into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick. SASSY SAGEY broke
back, dropped inside soon after, saved ground through the lane and never threatened. CHASING SHADOWS walked out of the gate to spot the field several
lengths, remained sluggish into the turn, picked off a single tiring rivals while not a factor. WILLOW MOON broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch
inside, stopped when headed by the winner turning for home.

Footnotes
D TWO away in good order, closest to the leader off the inside, advanced on that one under confident handling second turn, dueled into the lane, put that
rival away past the furlong marker as the runner up was challenging from the outside, held that one at bay under steady handling. GALACTIC EMPIRE
within striking distance off the inside, crept closer in the three path turning for home, challenged outside the winner nearing the furlong grounds but could not
get by to be outfinished. DEVOTED TO YOU broke on top, clear early, continued to set the pace up the backstretch through some soft fractions, responded
and dueled inside the winner through the latter portion of the final turn then could not keep up when straightened for home, saved the show. PROMISING
SHOES went one paced throughout while racing three wide. GEORGIA DEPUTY fell back to trail after the start, dropped inside when called on for run late
in the final turn, could manage only an even finish. AWESOME FAMILY remained back in lacking a rally. FOREVER COOL broke a step slow, five wide
through most of the first turn, had nothing for the drive. NOMOREMRNICEGUY also off a step slow, four wide through the first turn, saved ground through
the second bend, faded.

Footnotes
RADICAL RIGHT forwardly placed three wide, challenged between late in the turn, closer in the three to four path into the lane losing ground to the leaders,
outside bid with less than a furlong remaining, fully extended to prove narrowly best. I'M WIDE AWAKE broke out, prompted the leader from the outside,
challenged that rival from the outside turning for home, took over, briefly clear a furlong out, proved stubborn late to miss. GO WEST unruly in the post
parade, raced in the second flight toward the inside, in some traffic late turn, angled in a sixteenth out to tighten up BUMP IN THE NIGHT and was then
slowly gaining late. ACCIDENTAL HERO off a step slow, raced back in trailing early, two path into the stretch, lacked room a sixteenth out then finished up
evenly. COUNT DE MONET broke on top, set the pace along the inside for a half, weakened when headed by the runner up entering the stretch. FRIAR
LAURENCE hit the gate to be off slow, remained back in failing to threaten. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK in mid pack early outside, four wide through the turn,
faded down the stretch.

COST BASIS set or forced the pace three wide, dueled into lane, vied between foes past the furlong marker, dug in late to hold off the runner up with both
riders continuing to ride well past the wire. BOLDISH off the pace while in the two path second turn, continued to lack speed up the backstretch, began to
advance while dropping to the rail second turn, steered out three wide into the stretch, late bid outside the winner, outfinished in the late going while edging
clear for the place. CHARTER OAK with the pace along the inside onto the backstretch, dueled inside the winner second turn, continued to vie while closest
to the inside of the first flight inside the furlong grounds, weakened and was unable to match the top pair late, remained well clear of the others.
CALIFORNIA SWING shuffled back start, asked along second turn, raced four to five wide into the lane, remained well out in the strip, went evenly the final
furlong in lacking a closing punch. SQUARE DEAL forwardly placed off the inside, four wide through the final turn, had little left for the stretch run. EL
FRANCO forwardly placed off the inside, three wide into the stretch, weakened in the run to the wire. BELLA'S PRAYER saved ground to no avail. EASY
BIG BOY broke out and slowly, four wide through the first turn, began to give way while five wide into the second bend.

Footnotes
CONCEPT broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, shook clear into the lane, drew out through the stretch under steady
handling. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY broke in a tangle to spot the field a few lengths, remained back in the run up the backstretch, swung out five wide when
advancing into the stretch, rallied for the place midtrack while not a threat to the winner. CACTUS within striking distance well out in the strip, four wide
through the turn, chased the winner through upper stretch and past the furlong marker, no match for that one, outkicked for the place. INDULGE in mid pack
early while outside, five to six wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing kick. RAVEN'S NEST saved ground to no avail in an even effort. CAPTAIN JACK
pressed the winner from the outside for a half then faltered through the stretch. HOT TICKET off a bit slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ARCHIE THE GIZA never far back, advanced to challenge three wide second turn, gained the advantage past the furlong marker, drifted out a bit late but
held the runner up safe in the waning strides. SUN THUNDER unhurried early, angled in to save some ground first turn, continued to save some ground in
the second turn, steered out into the lane, late run at the winner to finish willingly and miss. ALEXANDER HELIOS in the second flight early off the i9nside,
took over backstretch, showed the way through the second turn, grudgingly yielded to the winner inside the furlong marker, no match for the runner up late,
comfortably saved the show. GUIDED ARROW pressed the issue early, dueled the middle half, began to weaken into the far turn. NAMESAKE off a step
slow, void of speed while four wide first turn, continued outside and was four wide again through the second bend, no real threat. CITY LEGEND settled off
the pace and the inside, in some traffic to lose slight position into the final turn, four wide through much of that bend, one paced through the lane in lacking a
closing kick. MAGNA TAP void of speed while off the inside, lacked a serious closing response. NULLARBOR set or forced the pace early just off the inside,
gave way three wide far turn, continued to weaken through the stretch. HARLEEZY remained back to be always outrun. RIVALRY four wide through the first
when forwardly placed, continued four wide into the far bend and gave way soon after. B MINOR settled off the early pace, stopped after five furlongs,
distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
ZAMBEZI pressed the issue off the inside, ranged up to challenge turning for home, took over, drew out steadily through the lane without feeling the crop to
win ridden out. PLAUSIBLE DENILE lacked speed, steered out sharply five wide turning for home, set down, finished willingly to be clearly second best.
MEDIA MOGUL moved up to race in the second flight early, angled 3w into lane, altered course in upper stretch toward the inside, mild interest to be clear
for the show. CODE FIVE showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to set a pressured pace by the winner turn, began to weaken
when headed by that one entering the stretch. MO'S TREASURE forwardly placed four wide up the backstretch, remained within a striking position while
three wide through the turn, tired in the drive. AXTON failed to menace while racing inside. FLYING HOUDINI in mid pack off the inside, was beginning to
tire when five wide out of the turn, continued to falter through the lane. MY UNCLE LEON off slow, void of speed, five wide entering the stretch, remained
back.

Footnotes
MR WORKS four wide when behind the first flight in the first turn, closer before a half, challenged three wide second turn, shook clear into the lane and
maintained daylight to the wire while drifting a bit under steady handling. OUTLAW RUN settled off the pace along the inside early, steered out four wide
when beginning to advance second turn, continued willingly to be well clear of the others while unable to get to the winner. ALL GREEN LIGHTS in mid pack
when bothered and carried out seven wide into the first turn, settled the middle half, advanced in traffic late 2nd turn, steered out 5w, closest to the top two a
furlong out and then flattened to the wire while holding the show. SECRET STRATEGY broke back, void of speed toward the inside, continued back up the
backstretch, steered out three wide in some traffic turning for home, modest late interest to be gaining for the show. HARD LUCK HENRY settled off the
early pace inside, two to three path second turn, continued one paced through the lane in lacking a closing kick. DOUBLECHECK took up across the first
flight's heels into the first turn, rank through that bend after recovering, four to five wide second turn, improved slightly late with some mild interest. MORE
MONEY MO off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack while off the inside first turn, three wide through the second turn, finished up evenly. GENTLE
BEN forwardly placed while three wide early, tired from those efforts. UNNECESSARY TRICKS fell back to trail, continued to lag for six furlongs, picked off
a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BRADFORD five wide into the first turn when with the first flight, cleared all but one rival to duel up
the backstretch, alternated up front the next three furlongs and gave way. SPEAKING LOUD broke on top, dueled up front along the inside and stopped far
turn.
