coaxed in the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. HOMER JONES bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was

start, stalked in the four path, was roused early around the far turn, bid from the three path into the stretch, but evened out late. SUGAR IT'S ELI bumped
between foes at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, swung from the six path into the lane, but got

the lead passing the quarter, and yielded along the inside down the lane. BAILAMOS got pinched at the start, trailed in the four path and did not threaten.
EXCLUSIVE DANCER broke out and bumped an outer foe, then steadied into the first turn, raced wellback in the three path and never threatened. GO GO

Footnotes
GRAND JOURNEY set the pace inside, came under a nudge going into the far turn, was challenged passing the quarter, dug in while dueling with an outer
foe in the two path down the lane, bumped that foe around the sixteenth, and held off another late charging outer foe to win. GLIDING AFLEET stalked in
the two path, but lost ground while being coaxed along from the rail rounding the far turn, swung out to the four path at the top of the lane, tipped out to the
six path while rallying inside the final furlong, and got up for place late. POUND GREEN tracked in the four path, bid under coaxing in the three path
approaching the quarter, dueled with the inner pacesetter down the stretch, got bumped by that foe around the sixteenth, hung, and got caught by an outer
foe to end up with show. ARTEMUS BRIDGE rated in the three path down the backside, fanned out to the six path turning into the stretch, but made no
impact. INFAMOUS COVERT hopped at the start, laid off the pace in the four path, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and did not threaten.
MY MAN VITO laid up close in the three path, came under a ride in the two path going into the far turn, but was empty at the top of the lane.

BONUS MOVE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a brisk hand ride. IRISH HEARTBEAT was bumped at the start and again about a sixteenth
of a mile into the race, saved ground in range, was no match for the winner but won the battle for the place. ROARING INDIAN bumped at the start, came in
and bumped IRISH HEARTBEAT into VICTORY ACHIEVED not long after the start, chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally and lost the battle
for the place. LAMCARO chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. URGE TO MERGE (IRE) pressed the winner in the three path
and weakened in the lane. VICTORY ACHIEVED was forced to check midway down the backstretch, saved ground and never threatened. GREAT LILO
played no factor while racing two wide. CRASH THE GATE was slammed at the start, raced three wide and had no bids. FORCEFUL came in and bumped
at the start, raced two wide and was never in contention. ENDLESS REIGN was bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. GALLANT
MISCHIEF was outrun inside. MISCHIEF EXPOSED was rank at the start, ducked in and slammed into CRASH THE GATE and trailed inside.

Footnotes
RO TOWN stalked the pace two wide, took over rounding the far turn, drew clear in midstretch and held clear under a drive. ELYSIAN FIELD saved ground
in range, made progress at the rail around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner through the stretch but was
second best. PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) was pinched back at the start, angled in entering the first turn, raced well back at the rail, waited for room around the
far turn and in upper stretch, split rivals in midstretch and finished well belatedly. BOSS LADY BAILEY settled off the early pace two wide, went four and five
wide around the far turn and ran on outside in the stretch. BIG BRASS BED bumped with OUR DOTSIE at the start, raced off the pace two wide and never
threatened. EUPHIMA (ARG) set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, was collared near the five-sixteenths
marker and weakened inside. LOVE HER LOTS chased the pace three wide and faded in the drive. IMPLOSION steadied along inside through the opening
quarter, continued to save ground around the far turn and lacked a rally. STEPHANIE'S CHARM was outrun inside. OUR DOTSIE was bumped at the start,
raced three wide and made little impact. QUEEN MACHA was hard held early, rushed up outside down the backstretch, took the lead near the three-eighths
pole then bore out around the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
SEDONA chased in the four path, merged inside and was cued into the turn, angled out to the five path turning into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong,
and got up in the final strides. NEAT TRICK prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed while three wide passing the three-eighths, ran on from the four
path into the stretch, briefly led inside the final sixteenth, but was caught in the final strides by an outer foe to place. ON COMMAND had a slow start,
stalked in the three path, split foes to take command and tipped to the two path going into the turn, was cued nearing the quarter, tipped out to the three
path entering the stretch, and dug in, but was caught by an outer pair in the final furlong to show. RELIABLE LADY stumbled badly at the start while
bumping with an outer foe, tracked in the five path, came under a ride from the four path early into the turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the lane,
and finished evenly. ASH WEDNESDAY set the pace in the two path, lost the lead to an outer foe and was roused along the inside going into the turn,
fought on turning into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. MARGAUX TREASURE bumped with an inner foe at the start and trailed throughout.

ST. PAT'S DAY set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a late drive. WIDE WEST (IRE) prompted the winner in the
three path, could not gain on that foe but lasted for the place. RUN FOR THE HILLS bobbled at the break, was pinched back not long after, made progress
three wide down the backstretch, angled into the two path entering the turn, advanced between rivals around the bend, angled four wide in upper stretch,
rallied through the lane and just missed second. STAR CANDY saved ground in range and was one-paced through the lane. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE)
raced off the pace two wide, was forced in entering the turn, saved ground from there and had a mild rally. QUALY was forced in and hit the rail entering the
turn, dropped back inside, swung widest in midstretch and had a belated rally under mild urging. STARSHIP NALA failed to menace while racing two wide.
IVORY MOON chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. MOON RAY (FR) chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the stretch. OH
DARLIN played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
CACCIATORE prompted the pace in the four path, took command in the three path midway around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, kicked away
from the three path in upper stretch, and held sway. HOLIDAY FANTASY chased inside, was driven from the rail around the turn, tipped out to the two path
entering the lane, and bumped an outer foe around the sixteenth while running on for place. MORGAN POINT tracked in the four path, was in tight midway
around the turn, tried lugging in while in the three path at the top of the lane, was corrected, got bumped around the sixteenth, but kept on for show.
ENSIGN PARKER set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead along the inside midway around the turn, and faded while drifting out down the lane.
CATTIN slowly broke in a tangle at the start, rated in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the
lane, got herded outward, and made no impact. MAUNA KEA BOUND stalked in the three path but weakened in the stretch. GAME BOY BENNY trailed in
the four path, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but did not threaten. BIRD WILDCAT broke out at the start, raced off the pace in the five
path but was no menace.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DIAMOND saved ground off the pace, edged closer two wide between foes around the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, closed outside
and was up late. FREDO pressed the pace two wide, dueled two wide around the far turn, edged ahead leaving the eighth pole but could not quite stave off
the winner. NATE THE GREAT rated up close two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, ran on between foes and gained the show while in tight late. SIR
LONDON staked the pace inside, briefly angled out in upper stretch, angled back in near the eighth pole and finished evenly. O CAPTAIN raced off the pace
two wide and had a mild rally. TORIGO had his head turned at the start, trailed inside, moved up four wide around the far turn, shifted eight wide in upper
stretch and rallied belatedly. WHAT SAY THEE saved ground in midpack and was blocked through almost all of the stretch run. SCRAMBLE raced off the
pace inside, made progress in upper stretch but was blocked throughout the final furlong. HAKKIMI (CHI) failed to menace while racing three wide.
WEYHILL ROAD played no factor while racing four wide. BOHEMIAN BOY set the pace along the rail and tired in the stretch. GOOD MEDICINE was outrun
inside.

SASSY PRINCESS laid up close in the three path, was roused to bid rounding the far turn, and inched ahead of the inner pacesetter down the lane.
MIZOULA (IRE) showed the way around the first turn to lead the contenders from the two path into the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn,
kicked on from the two path while being challenged turning into the stretch, but was edged out by an outer foe to place. SPINNING CLASS stalked in the
two path, was roused from the rail midway around the far turn, drifted out to the six path in upper stretch, but kept on to hold show. MAMA BELLA broke out

eight path at the top of the lane, but could not threaten. GOSSIPER got bumped by an inner foe going into the first turn causing the rider to lose an iron, but

between foes early before ducking out suddenly going into the first turn causing her to clip heels while bumping with an outer foe and losing the rider,
