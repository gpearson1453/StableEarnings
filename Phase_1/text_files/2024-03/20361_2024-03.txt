Footnotes
DARKROOM laid off of the pace in the three to four path, rallied to bid outside of the leading pair in the final sixteenth and drove past. COMMITTEE OF
ONE brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the three path under mild coaxing around the turn, slowly progressed on the leader to bid entering the
final sixteenth as an outer rallying-rival menaced and got outkicked while edging place. SCAT FREE showed the way a bit off the inside, held sway through
midstretch but was collared at the sixteenth pole and bested by an outer pair. GABARRA tracked along the inside, but lacked a bid. COIN MINER broke a
step slow and brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear in the four to five path and made little impact.

Footnotes
JILLY'S WEST was bumped and pushed outwardly by an inner foe at the start, rushed forward to show the way, built a clear margin approaching the turn,
and widened under mild urging. RUTH OF JUDAH was bumped by an outer rival before having her hind heels clipped by her inner stablemate soon after the
start, stalked forwardly along the inside, pursued the clear leader from the two path around the bend, then chased that one home to be second best.
CHROME RACER broke a step slow and was forced outwardly by an inner foe causing her to clip the hind heels of her outer stablemate and bobble soon
after the start, trailed early on, advanced in the five path into the turn, maneuvered down to the four path entering the lane and sustained a rally to edge
show at the sixteenth pole. MRS. SPEAKER broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked in the four path, gained show in upper stretch but lost
that position to an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole. MORO MAESTRO transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, lacked early
speed, trailed in the two path around the turn then surpassed tiring rivals. ALTAR GIRL came out soon after the start, raced off of the pace in the two path,
crept closer swinging from the three path to the six path entering the lane, but failed to factor. HIGHER NOTE broke out and bumped a rival at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside and gave way. STRAIGHT MEADOW prompted in the three path, but chased the clearing leader approaching the
turn and folded around it.

GOD OF WINE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, dueled with an outer rival around the first turn, rated and stalked along the inside down the
backstretch, allowed an outer rival to make first run into the far turn, got briefly shuffled back behind the pace setter leaving the three furlong pole before
slipping inside of that one passing the five sixteenths marker, quickly gained and tipped to bid outside of the new leader in upper stretch, gained command
entering the final furlong and drew off. SAGITTARIUS stalked along the inside, bid outside of the pace setter nearing the three furlong pole, drew clear
turning for home, but was collared by an outer bidder in upper stretch, proved no match at the furlong grounds and was second best. REGIMENTAL tracked
in the four path, crept closer under urging around the far turn, but leveled off while getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch and ran on mlldly.
THREE POINT STRUT broke a step slow and was taken in hand at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, then in the three path around the far
turn before shifting to the five path entering the lane, but failed to menace. ROCKSTAR RED hopped at the start, lacked speed in the three to two path,
inched closer into the far turn, but emptied out and failed to factor. COWBOY CAUSE lagged behind around both turns then moved up. PAPA JOJO dueled
for the lead with an inner rival, showed the way down the backstretch, but was headed by an outer rival leaving the three furlong pole and stopped through
the lane. EL PAJARO LOCO leaned into an outer rival and took up at the start, then got outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
RUN DREAMING set a pressured pace along the inside, braced for an outer challenge spinning for home in the two path, fended off that rival while drifting
out man paths through the lane, flopped back to his left lead while continuing to lug out and as an inner foe menaced at the sixteenth pole, yet held between
horses. BRIELLE EVANGELINE was briefly antsy in the starting gate, then hopped when the gates sprung and was off slow, trailed into the turn, picked up
stride saving ground turning for home, then sustained a rail rally to bid inside of the lugging leader in the final sixteenth but just missed. EUROSTORM
pressed three wide, bid outside of the leader and from the three path nearing the lane, but was herded out many paths by that one through the lane, failed
to gain even terms while kept at bay and lost place to an inner bidder late. DAISY DE ORO tracked along the inside, steadied lacking rail room passing the
five sixteenths pole, tipped out before shifting from the three to four path passing the quarter pole and willingly chased the leaders home. TARKINGTON
GIRL pursued from off of the pace three wide and between horses, entering the lane in the four path, moved further out nearing midstretch and failed to
menace while one paced. COUNTRY BELLE raced off of the pace two wide and between horses into the turn, then failed to factor. MISS NIMBUS bumped
with an outer rival at the start, stalked four wide, but floated to the six path entering the lane and tired hanging on her left lead. DESPEIGHTFUL bumped
with an inner foe leaving the gates, raced off of the pace in the five to seven path, lugged inwardly in midstretch and made little impact. NOWNOWDANCER
prompted two wide and between horses into the turn, chased around the bend, but weakened turning for home and caved. THE RIDER OF EUROSTORM
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE LANE. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REVIEWING THE SAME INFRACTION; RUN DREAMING WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

HOORAY AUSTIN tracked two wide, shifted to the four path into the turn, took aim outside of the new leader in upper stretch, bid before wrestling an
advantage at the sixteenth pole and inched clear. ALICIA'S KID brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked close up along the inside, bid outside of the
leader and in the three path turning for home, led in upper stretch as an outer rival menaced, but was bested by that bidder at the sixteenth pole and held
place. SEVEN SCENTS laid off of the pace in the two path, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch and edged show at the sixteenth pole. TRIPPER
JOHN brushed with an inner foe at the start, showed the way in the four path, tucked to the two path into the turn, met an outer challenge turning for home,
got headed entering the lane and gave way. ROBO pursued from the three path and got outrun.

TAKEOVER FIFTYFOUR stalked three wide, sustained slow progress to bid at the sixteenth pole, led at the juncture and held sway. CANAL ST. CUPID
settled off of the pace tucking to the inside into the first turn, shfited out to the five path with five furlongs to go, came under urging around the far turn, yet
rallied outside of rivals in the final furlong to gain place nearing the wire. BOLIE showed the way along the inside, shook free of an outer presser entering
upper stretch, but was caught at the sixteenth pole and lost place late. RED ROCK SOLUTION tracked along the inside, chased under urging around the far
turn and ran on evenly. KEV MAN pressed outside of the leader, but failed to sustain pressure entering upper stretch and yielded between horses in the late
stages. A TRUE TARGET laid off of the pace in the three path, then saved ground around the far turn, but to no avail. TEMPLE OF PEACE bumped with an
outer foe leaving the gates, pursued from midpack in the two path, lacked progress despite coaxing in the three path around the far turn and failed to
menace. MIDLAND KID broke a step slow and steadied back at the start, then was outrun in the two path. KAH NIGH bumped with an inner rival at the start,
pursued from the two path before tucking to the inside entering the backstretch, but was through early. TIZNOW TOM broke multiple lengths behind the field
and showed little.

Footnotes
FREDDIE BY A NOSE bumped an inner rival at the start, settled well back in the two path, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied to reel in the
leader at the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. BET ON BOBBY showed the way in the two path, cleared and shifted ground outwardly in upper stretch, but
offered little resistance to an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole and held place. JOE T transferred stout contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the
start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path in midstretch, then stayed on late but needed more to gain place. RISING KOTO STAR
bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, then sustained a rail chase but lacked a bid. OVER PAID took simultaneous bumps from rivals
on both sides at the start, pressed the leader from the three path, chased that one in upper stretch and yielded between horses. LOUDTHUNDRHEVYRAIN
took firm contact from an outer rival and steadied at the start, trailed in the four to six path and moved up late. GATSBY'S FORTUNE broke in and squarely
bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, chased them under strong urging from the five path around the turn and faded. COOL
RIDE pursued from the two path, but lacked a bid and weakened.

Footnotes
STEAL ME OVER bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path before tipping to the five path into the turn, inched closer to bid
five wide entering the lane, dueled with an inner co-bidder thereafter and prevailed. STEPHANIE'S MARIA stalked in the four to three path, bid four wide
and between horses entering the lane, dueled with an outer counterpart thereafter but missed. UNKNOWN CALLER was bumped by an outer rival before
brushing an inner foe at the start, raced close up along the inside, stalked from the pocket around the turn, slipped through to offer a rail bid entering the
lane, but chased an outer dueling pair in the final furlong and kept on. SWEET GUITAR laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper
stretch and moved up between horses nearing midstretch. AMERICAN CHICK was brushed by an outer rival soon after the start, raced at the rear in the
three path, moved out to the seven path in upper stretch and improved position. DARK SKYER prompted the leader from the three path, bumped with that
one while bidding among foes entering the lane, but faded passing the three sixteenths pole. GIGI'S LUV bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced off of
the pace in the six path, shfited to the eight path in upper stretch and failed to factor. OUR INDIAN GIRL broke inwardly and was slow to recover, lacked
early speed, advanced under urging in the seven path around the turn, but emptied out in upper stretch and weakened. TRUTHRDAAR led in the two path
as an outer rival prompted, but bumped that one just before getting headed by bidders on both sides entering the lane and weakened.
