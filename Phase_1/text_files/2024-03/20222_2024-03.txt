Footnotes
JUST BECAUSE pursued from midpack along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, bid passing the three sixteenths pole, dueled
while being herded outwardly by his counterpart through midstretch, stood his ground causing the battle to straighten course entering the final sixteenth,
then forged an advantage and prevailed. CAJUN BLAST dueled for the lead with an inner rival into the turn, cleared that faltering foe at the three furlong
pole, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering the final three sixteenths, drifted out clinging to an advantage through midstretch, but was bested in the
final sixteenth. MY TENNIS SHOES broke a step slow, raced at the rear in the two path, improved inside of rivals entering the lane before shifting to the five
path in upper stretch and ran on well in pursuit of the dueling leaders. TALK OF THE TOWN came out a step slow, laid off of the pace in the five to four path
into the turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. FOE stalked in the two path, moved to the four path to avoid a troubled foe at the
three furlong pole, but only managed to chase in upper stretch, shifted inside of the drifting leader in midstretch but flattened out. LARRY'S LUNCHBOX was
off half a beat slow, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, shifted to the five path turning for home, entered the lane in the six path and
failed to factor between horses. MO HAWK MAN dueled for the lead along the inside, steadied to avoid from bearing out at the three furlong pole, faltered
between horses shortly after, then recovered mildly but lacked a re-rally. PALMISANO tracked in the five path, yielded getting floated to the six path around
the turn, then faded drifting to the seven path entering the lane.

Footnotes
GAMER NATE set the pace along the inside, drew away from an outer prompting foe in upper stretch and drove clear. THE SPEEDY ONE lunged in and
brushed the gate while breaking slowly, settled off of the pace in the three path, took closer order before tracking along the inside and behind the leaders
turning for home, tipped out to the four path at the furlong grounds, ran on to duel for place in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed. RAZOR CREST
prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, failed to sustain pressure in upper stretch, dueled with an outer bidder for place in the final sixteenth
but was bested via a photo finish. SAINT GABRIEL broke outwardly yet was clear of his most immediate rival, tracked along the inside, gave way into the far
turn, yet kept on to reclaim a minor share. REGATTA BAY stalked the top pair from the three to four path, but lacked a bid while getting floated to the five
path in midstretch, and gave way. VEGA STAR drifted in at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, lacked progress in the five path around the far turn
and made little impact. KEE JEE trailed in the two path, shifted to the six path entering upper stretch but was outrun.

Footnotes
CUSTOM PUNCH set a pressured pace in the two path, edged clear in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. JUS EVELYN tracked along the inside,
gained place in upper stretch and ran on in pursuit of the clear leader to pull away from the rest. LADY ATHENA chased while forwardly placed in the five
path around the turn, then sustained pursuit and kept on willingly to edge show entering the final sixteenth. GIRL LIKES BLING chased from midpack two
wide, ran on to forge fourth at the sixteenth pole and held. BROADWAY STAR lacked speed two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, got put to a bit of
crowded quarters among foes at the furlong grounds and stayed on. USAIN D'ORO was bumped by an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide ad
between horses while taking the bend in the four path, then chased among foes through midstretch and yielded. GOLDEN COUGAR broke slowly but
avoided trouble from an inner rival by doing so, lacked speed two wide, improved in upper stretch but encountered traffic behind foes at the furlong grounds
and failed to menace thereafter. TENSAS LUCY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. R T'S CAJUN LADY veered out and bumped a rival at the
start, pressed the leader from the three path, but faded between horses entering the lane and folded among foes while drifting out at the furlong grounds.
STEEL GUITAR retreated to trail along the inside approaching the turn, shifted from the three path to the eight path in upper stretch and made little impact.
BAYOU BERTIE lost her hind footing when the gates sprung and broke many lengths slow, lacked speed outside of rivals, gained in the five to six path into
and around the turn, but emptied out in upper stretch. SECRETLY SWEET broke a bit out at the start, pursued from midpack in the five to four path into the
turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
SAENZ led from an inner presser around the first turn, drew clear of that one entering the far turn, built an open margin and held sway through the lane.
BAR TAP pursued from midpack in the three to four path, tracked from the three path around the far turn before drifting back to the four path entering the
lane, ran on to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but drifted in, bumped and put an inner rival to crowded quarters while edging place at the sixteenth pole,
drifted out and held that position. BLESSED ANNA tracked from the two path before shifting in entering the backstretch, chased up the rail to vie for place in
the final furlong, but missed. DESSERT FIRST laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted from the two to three path pursuing between horses in upper
stretch, but steadied when bumped and pinched by an outer rival reaching the sixteenth pole, and kept on. ZING laid off of the pace in the two to tour path,
tipped to the five path at the furlong grounds and moved up at the wire. YOLANDA WHO prompted inside of the leader and eventual winner, failed to sustain
pressure outside of the five sixteenths pole, chased from the two path turning for home, then weakened between horses at the sixteenth pole. J Z'S FIRST
lagged behind in the two to three path, cut the gap on the rest nearing the lane, but was blocked behind rivals through the final furlong. RAIN stalked in the
three path, but faded between horses approaching the far turn and weakened thereafter. THE RIDER OFDESSERT FIRST CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RUNNER-UP FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, BAR TAP WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
A G'S CHARLOTTE bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked behind the leaders and from the two path entering the backstretch, moved forward and
pressed outside of the pace setter and from the three path around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, drove clear nearing the furlong grounds, greenly flopped
back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth and held sway. SPEEDY DUDETTE set the pace along the inside, led from an outer bidder while taking the
far turn in the two path, but proved no match for that one entering midstretch, drifted out at the sixteenth pole and lasted for place between horses.
SPIRITED BEAUTY settled off of the pace in the two path, ran on in the three path to edge show in midstretch, but was herded outwardly many paths by a
drifting foe in the final sixteenth yet saved show at the wire. WORLD WAR leaned out at the start, saved ground towards the rear, awaited racing room
behind a foe turning for home, then ran on committing to an inside charge in the final furlong, but hung late and missed show. WHOLELOTTAMO bumped
with an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path, moved to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace. VALE MALE stalked in the three path
but gave way in the four path around the far turn. HIGHLY WICKED pursued from midpack in the four path and gave way turning for home in the five path.

Footnotes
SPEEDY TRAVELER was floated and brushed an outer rival at the start, set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure around the turn,
inched clear in upper stretch, flopped leads in the final furlong as an outer foe took aim, drifted out in the closing stages and held sway. ERVADEAN
bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide, took aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, chased within striking range into the final sixteenth,
but was herded out late and needed more. GRACIE DIAMOND bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid close up along the inside, stalked around the
turn, then chased evenly along the rail. ROSE PALACE lacked speed along the inside, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and moved up. UNIFIED
ALLIANCE raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. ROCKETS SISTER prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, but drifted
to the four path entering the lane and weakened in upper stretch. AUNT BECCA pursued from midpack in the four path and tired. FIRED UP TIGER was
outrun in the five path.

Footnotes
JACK HAMMER stalked two wide, bid and gained an advantage turning for home, then drew off under a drive. BEHEMAH STAR laid off of the pace in the
two to four path, gained around the far turn to reach place and take aim on the new leader entering the lane, but failed to offer a challenge and held place.
WISE VERDICT tracked in the three path, got outmoved by an outer rival around the far turn and chased willingly through the lane. WHO TOOK THE
MONEY rated well back in the four to three path around the first turn, moved out to the five path around the far turn before fanning to the six path entering
the lane, and moved up. WOODS N WATER settled off of the pace in the three to four path, tipped to the five path entering the lane, ran on but failed to
menace. MANGUM tracked along the inside, but yielded into the far turn and failed to threaten. LANGS DAY trailed along the inside and made little impact.
BENOIT pursued from midpack in the two path, chased in the three path around the far turn and gave way. CALICOCO set a clear pace into the
backstretch, but was headed by an outer bidder turning for home and caved.

Footnotes
SHE'S COOL bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, moved out to surpass an inner foe while rallying into the final
furlong, sustained progress to issue an inside bid in the the final sixteenth and forged an advantage late. LADY HIPSTER took contact from an inner rival at
the start, tracked in the four path, came under urging before entering the lane in the five path, rallied to range up to the leader in the final sixteenth, vied with
a rail bidder through the closing stages but got outfinished. NEED A BIT OF LUCK broke a step slow, recovered to stalk from the two to three path around
the turn, bid outside of the leader at the three sixteenths pole while hanging on her left lead, gained control at the furlong grounds before changing over, but
yielded between bidders in the final sixteenth. ABSOLUTE MIRACLE prompted along the inside, but failed to sustain pressure after a quarter pole, chased
into and around the turn, then lacked a punch before gradually giving way. NOTICE ME TOO leaned out and brushed a foe at the start, showed the way two
wide, built a clear margin at the half mile pole, maintained an advantage before meeting an outer rival's challenge at the three sixteenths pole, but got
headed at the furlong grounds and weakened. LEMON LATTE broke a step slow, trailed in the three to four path around the turn and made little impact.
TORREY STREET pursued from midpack in the four path, came under urging in the two path around the turn then faded while hanging on her left lead.
FROSTY VI was brushed by an inner rival at the start and got outrun in the two to three path.

Footnotes
CAMARO Z tracked along the inside, brushed his way to force through and bid between the top pair while in tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole,
sparred with an outer foe through the final furlong and gamely clung to an advantage. COUNT DRACULA stalked outside of the pace setter, pressed that
one around the far turn, bid while getting brushed by a foe-splitting inner rival in upper stretch, dueled with that one through the late stages but missed.
ROCK'N A HALO pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses into the backstretch, chased from the four path around the far turn, drifted
out to the five path entering the lane and ran on willingly while drifting in and flopping back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth. YO DADDY laid off of
the pace in the four path, chased in the five path around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace. BEAR RIVER set the
pace in the two path, led from an outer presser around the far turn, but had his hind quarters brushed whlie inside of a pair of bidders at the three sixteenths
pole, got headed in midstretch and faded. GORILLA TREK trailed along the inside and got outrun.

BUDRO TALKING settled off of the pace along the inside, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied to reel in the leader in the shadow of the wire.
HIGHLAND CREEK bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair in upper stretch, bid and forged an
advantage at the furlong grounds, but was caught nearing the wire. BLUE CHEESE pressed two wide, vied down the backstretch, led narrowly around the
far turn and through upper stretch, but relinquished the advantage between horses at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole
and kept on to reclaim show at the wire. MYGLORYBEE bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival down
the backstretch, fought on gamely into the final furlong but yielded in the final seventy yards. PLAY MO stalked three deep, but gave way after getting
floated four wide in upper stretch. BALLINONABUDJET laid off of the pace in the three to four path, entered the lane in the five path and failed to factor. UP
N GONE trailed two wide early on and was outrun.
