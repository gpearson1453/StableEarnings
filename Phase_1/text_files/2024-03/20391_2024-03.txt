Footnotes
GHOSTSTRYDER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear in the lane and held that margin to the wire. MR JACK saved ground around the first turn, raced in
the middle of the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late.
JAY'S DELIGHT raced in the two path early, led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and weakened in the final furlong.
STRONGER TOGETHER raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, swung out to the four path coming around around the far turn and
never threatened. AWESOME PRINCE hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the two path, raced in tight quarters in upper stretch and faded from there.

a bid from the five path coming around the second turn and flattened out in the stretch. RECYCLE raced in the four path around the first turn, pressed the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still in the four path and tired in the stretch. SMILE BRYAN saved ground early,
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and was empty in the lane. ON THE
ENGINE raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and was never a factor.
