GAMER rowdy in the gate and had a terrible start, ran on with a gain at each pole throughout with an outside run to be along at the wire in spectacular
fashion to the finish. GOLDEN REIGN quick speed to the front, battled along to stretch could not hold off challenger and outgamed in the late stages.
ENGLISH CHALLENGE slow from the gate, well back to far turn, coming on too late. WRITE OFF JERRY good position to half three wide run far turn,
flattened out late. COMEDIC TIMING good position throughout with no response when needed. FAITHFUL KING tracking top two early on, leveled off with
kick in the stretch. PADDY'S HOUSE never menaced throughout. GUN RUSH pressed leader to far turn, used up and backed up in stretch. NICHOLAS
JONES failed to menace throughout.
