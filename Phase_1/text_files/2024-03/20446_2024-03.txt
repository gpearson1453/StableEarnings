TELLITTOTHEJUDGE stalked the pace, made a two to three wide bid around the far turn through the stretch and edged clear under strong handling. JUST
LUCK set a pressured early pace, collared near the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. SING CHARMER SING settled off the early going, raced
two wide between around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and rallied willingly to the wire. MISS ADDISYN K was coaxed along the inside and
finished evenly to the wire. ZIBBY TOO dropped back early, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. JOSIES SCORE was off slowly
and never menaced. JULIE JEAN stalked the pace from the outside and tired.

SAENGER STAR set a pressured early pace near the rail and held gamely under strong handling. WOKE JOKE was allowed to settle early, raced near the
rail past the three sixteenths pole, angled out and finished gamely to the wire. CRUISE TALK pressed two deep and kept on willingly to the wire. GOOD
GRACIOUS was bumped at the break, raced two to three wide and was even late. DANZONBY settled off the early pace, raced near the rail into the upper
stretch and had no late rally. SANCERRE broke awkwardly, raced five wide in the lane and never threatened. AFLEET DIVINE was coaxed along outside of
foes and faded. UNLIMITED GLORY was pulled up and walked off the track under his own power.
