Footnotes
DUNDIE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. GOLDEN SOMBRERO bumped with GETTA GO GO GO at the start, chased the pace four
wide, could not match strides with the winner in the lane but outfinished a foe for the place. MOTOWN PUNK prompted the winner in the three path, was no
match for that foe and held well enough for the show. BETTA GO GO GO was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled four wide in upper
stretch and lacked a rally,. VINICIO played no factor while racing three wide. BILLY'S EMPIRE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
WAR BEAT bumped with an outer foe at the start, showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was cued
while just off the rail midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, opened slightly passing the eighth pole, and held sway.
CURLIN'S KITTEN bumped with an outer foe then an inner foe at the start, trailed from the two path down the backstretch, was ridden from the four path
into the far turn, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. CHARGE OFF stalked in the four path, came under a ride while
three wide entering the far turn, floated out to the five at the top of the lane, but evened out for show. ZOZAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in
the three path, was coaxed in the five path early around the far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. CASPIAN SEA (GB)
tracked in the two path, was cued inside of foes early around the far turn, cut the corner turning into the stretch, but flattened. FOR THE CHIEF chased in
the four path, floated out to the six path around the far turn, and was no menace. DARING REASON prompted the pace in the three path but weakened
between foes turning into the stretch.

path, gained outside and just missed. HALSTYN ROSE pressed the pace in the three path, could not keep pace in upper stretch but kept on to gain the
show. CABOODLE chased the pace two wide and weakened in the final furlong. MAC TO MOORE had early speed inside, checked entering the turn, saved

Footnotes
UNRELENTLESS tracked in the two path, tipped to the rail while under a ride entering the turn, bid passing the quarter, took command while floating out to
the four path at the top of the stretch, and safely held off an outer foe. UMBRAL stalked in the four path, was coaxed in the three path midway around the
turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. SCOOTALOO showed the way in the four path before merging to the two path
going into the turn, was cued midway around the turn, but lost the lead turning into the stretch, and kept on to hold show. KHOZY COLBY trailed in the four
path, angled into the two path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. BLUEISH prompted the pace in the five path, bid under a nudge in
the three path around the turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. NAUGHTY FAVORS chased in the six path but weakened from the five path
turning into the lane. JUST TAKE NOTES raced of the pace from out in the seven path going into the turn and never menaced.

AMOR LEJANO (ARG) trailed outside, circled five wide around the turn, closed outside and was up late. ADIOS ASHER set a fast pace along the rail and
led until deep stretch. FROSTED FAITH raced off the pace four wide, rallied through the lane but was outkicked. UBIQUITOUS pressed the pace two wide
and weakened in the final furlong. VETERANS BEACH steadied early, was forced out entering the turn, chased the pace three wide around the bend and
lacked a rally. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR had early speed while in tight at the rail down the backstretch, chased inside around the turn and tired in the lane. NO
NAME DUDE checked repeatedly through the opening three furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO TOWN stalked in the four path, was cued from the three path into the far turn, bid passing the quarter, took the lead while floating out to the
five path entering the stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. TAP GOLD pulled from the three path around the first turn to set the pace down the
backstretch, came under a nudge in the two path going into the far turn, but lost the lead while tipping out to the three path at the top of the lane, hung on
his left lead, but just held place. SHANKAR tracked in the two path, had to wait around the far turn, was roused from the three path turning into the stretch,
and finished evenly for show. CAPTAIN ANTHONY trailed in the four path down the backside, moved up in the five path approaching the far turn, was
coaxed in the three path midway around the far turn, but did not factor from the five path in the stretch. DIAMOND COOL raced off the pace along the
inside, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, fanned out to the six path entering the stretch, but flattened. BOLD MAJESTIC broke slowly, rated in
the three path, tipped to the rail going into the far turn, but weakened along the inside in the stretch.

Footnotes
GILD THE LILY had early speed inside, settled back late on the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn, was forced out turning for home, rallied
outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. LATTE LIZZIE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead midway around the far turn, came in and
shut off a foe turning for home, lost the lead in upper stretch, fought back inside of that foe but was unable to resist the winner late. JESSAMINE HILL raced
off the pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid four deep rounding the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole
and weakened late. REDO raced off the pace two and three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed stretch rally. TAPE RUNNER
failed to menace while racing two wide. NO SHOW advanced three wide to the lead around the first turn, drew clear and angled in down the backstretch,
dueled inside of foes around the far turn, was shut off nearing the three-sixteenths pole, swerved out and was eased from there. GRACE GIVEN was outrun
inside. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF NO SHOW, LATTE LIZZIE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND
PLACED SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE.
