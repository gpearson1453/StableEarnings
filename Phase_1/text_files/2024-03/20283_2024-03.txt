Footnotes
UPSTART YANKEE settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and saved ground into the
far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and loomed at the furlong marker, closed four wide in deep stretch, was pressured to the wire by the runner-up and
lasted for the win at the finish. LAURA'S KIDOUGH allowed to settle away from the start, raced three wide into the backstretch run and was content to track
the modest pace to the half-mile pole, slipped to the inside and saved ground into the far turn, maintained an inside position into the stretch and was asked
for run nearing the furlong marker, shifted to the three path leaving the furlong grounds and split rivals into the final sixteenth, rallied in deep stretch and just
missed for the win. ACCLIDER prominent away from the start, went a bit wide into the first turn and stalked the early pace three wide into the backstretch
run, advanced into the backstretch and prompted the modest pace to the half-mile pole, pressed THANKS MAGGIO into the second turn and battled with
that rival into the stretch, took a narrow lead past the furlong marker and led into the final sixteenth, was caught in deep stretch by the oncoming top pair and
held safely at the finish for third. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) assumed command away from the start, was engaged by ACCLIDER into the backstretch run
and set prompted fractions to the half-mile marker, was pressed by that rival into the far turn and battled for the lead into the stretch, was overtaken past the
furlong marker, continued to fight into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. TALISKER BAY prominent away from the start, rated off of the early
pace and was never far back through the backstretch run, improved position three wide into the second turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. RESERVE PROOF keen in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run and settled while not far back approaching
the half-mile pole, was guided two wide into the second turn, shifted four wide for the drive and lacked a late response. WESTERN CAPE allowed to settle
while not far back, maintained an outside path into the second turn, swung widest for the drive and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
LISA'S ANGEL forwardly away from the start, took back and tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, chased two to three wide approaching the
quarter marker, swung five to six wide into the stretch and improved position at the furlong grounds, rallied while on the left lead into the final sixteenth, wore
down foes into deep stretch and won the nod on the wire to prevail in a good debut. ANN LOVES MARK showed good speed away from the start, assumed
command and set a pressured pace to the half-mile marker, set a disputed pace into the turn and carved out decent fractions to the quarter pole, shook free
into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, came under pressure at the sixteenth-marker, met the bid of LISA'S ANGEL into deep stretch
and just missed for the win at the finish, while holding safely for place honors. KEEPYOURPRANCEON allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground
into the turn, mounted an inside bid into the stretch and finished well into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in the late stages and was clear in
the end for third. ANISETTE squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was off slowly, rushed up to be forwardly placed in the early stages, saved
ground into the turn and chased the decent pace to the quarter pole, shifted three wide into upper stretch, needed more in the final furlong and was
outkicked in deep stretch. LOVELY JOSEPHINE stalked the decent early pace three deep, was well placed into the turn and chased two to three wide
approaching the quarter pole, shifted four wide for the drive and weakened. PURPLE MOUNTAIN showed good early speed, went up and pressed the
decent pace into the turn, contested the pace two wide to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

quarter marker, shifted four wide into upper stretch and raced widest while full of run approaching the furlong grounds, rallied and assumed command into
the final sixteenth, edged away in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. I AM AMADEO unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the turn and
improved position nearing the quarter pole, shifted three wide for the drive and loomed approaching the furlong marker, raced on even terms with GOTCHA
LOOKIN into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. SARK settled off of the decent early pace, raced two
wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, came in tight into upper stretch and advanced while navigating traffic approaching the furlong
grounds, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and ran on in deep stretch to secure show honors. GIANOLA took back off of the decent early pace, saved
ground into the turn and tracked the loose pacesetter approaching the quarter marker, improved position into upper stretch then became blocked nearing
the furlong pole, raced in tight into the final sixteenth and could not muster the needed response when asked in deep stretch. CHILEAN EXPRESS settled
off of the decent early pace, improved position three wide along the turn, loomed into upper stretch and took a narrow advantage at the furlong marker,
could not keep pace with oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. I CAN'T HEAR YOU prominent leaving the start, tracked the
decent early pace and raced closest to the loose pacesetter heading into the turn, chased two wide to the quarter pole, vied for the lead while between
runners into the stretch, could not muster the needed response into the final sixteenth and gave way. ATTA BOY LLOYD broke alertly and sped to the early
lead, set a decent pace while clear into the turn, controlled the pace while carving decent fractions nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure into

POINT AND SHOOT broke alertly then was rated off of the moderate early pace, was well positioned while three to four wide heading into the turn, raced
widest into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and got up in the final strides to prevail
in a blanket finish. MERRY BLUE squeezed at the start, was away slowly and was allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, chased into the turn
and gained ground two wide at the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch and continued her advance at the furlong marker, responded to urging
and came within aim into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while just earning the nod for place honors at the finish.
SOO BROOKLYN stalked the moderate early pace from between rivals, was well placed heading into the turn and attended to the pace two wide nearing
the quarter marker, chased SAHARA SUE into the stretch, drew to even terms with that rival leaving the furlong marker and battled into the final sixteenth,
took a slim lead in deep stretch, was caught by the oncoming top pair in the final strides and held clearly in the end for third in a game effort. SAHARA SUE
sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set the pace into the turn, dictated terms to the quarter marker while carving out moderate fractions,
kept to task into upper stretch and led to the furlong pole, met the bid of SOO BROOKLYN into the final sixteenth, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep
stretch and was outfinished. BOBBY'S GENIE rushed up in the early going, stalked the moderate pace while saving ground into the turn, lost ground along
the bend and chased to the quarter marker, saved ground into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, finished evenly into the final sixteenth and was
outkicked in deep stretch. GETAWAY CHARM settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, chased two wide to the quarter marker, maintained
that two wide path into the stretch and made a mild bid at the furlong pole, was gaining into the final sixteenth but could not threaten the leaders in deep
stretch. ACHROMATIC tracked the decent early pace from between runners, raced a bit in tight nearing the half-mile marker and was shuffled back at that
station, chased into the turn and trailed while three wide approaching the quarter pole, lacked a response in the stretch and did not factor.

YOU KIDDING ME forwardly placed away from the start, was floated four wide along the first turn, recovered and stalked the pace three wide into the
backstretch run, attended to the moderate pace approaching the half-mile pole, advanced into the far turn and pressed the pacesetter three wide heading to
the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch, took a slim lead at the furlong marker and dueled with LOADED MUSKET into the final sixteenth,
shook free of that rival in deep stretch, dug in in the final strides and held on for the win in a blanket finish. CANELITO allowed to settle away from the start,
raced two to three wide into the backstretch run and was content to track the pace to the half-mile marker, went two wide into the second turn then came in
tight and waited for racing room at the quarter marker, shifted five wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed fast while widest into
the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while just earning the nod for second. SENOR DEL CAMPO forwardly placed away
from the start, was a bit rank in the early stages and floated out a pair of rivals entering the first turn, settled and saved ground into the backstretch run, was
taken to the outside and tracked the moderate pace three to four wide heading to the half-mile pole, advanced four wide into the far turn, continued to make
headway into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win and place, while holding safely
in the end for show honors. KO SAMUI (IRE) took back away from the start, was floated three wide into the first turn, recovered and tracked the early pace
two wide into the backstretch run, was well placed while saving ground at the half-mile marker, maintained an inside path into the second turn and improved
position at the quarter marker, mounted an inside rally into the stretch and loomed at the furlong pole, battled while within aim of the lead into the final
sixteenth, needed more in deep stretch and was outfinished by the top three. LOADED MUSKET threw his head at the start and was off a step slowly, was
hustled to the front and set the pace into the first turn, showed the way while off of the rail entering the backstretch run and dictated terms while carving
moderate fractions to the half-mile pole, was pressured into the second turn by YOU KIDDING ME and met that rival's bid into the stretch, battled while all
out into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch. RICH GOLD allowed to settle away from the start, raced a bit in tight into the first turn and checked off
of heels leaving the seven-furlong pole, saved ground while unhurried into the backstretch run, went two to three wide into the far turn, swung six wide for
the stretch drive and offered a mild late rally. LYING GHOST broke alertly, ceded the early lead to LOADED MUSKET and stalked three wide into the first
turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, raced two wide into the second turn and improved
position at the quarter marker, came in tight into upper stretch and was blocked at the furlong grounds, could not find room into the final sixteenth and
weakened in deep stretch.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE broke well and raced at the head of the tracking group a couple of lengths behind the dueling leaders, moved three wide to
challenge for the lead passing the quarter pole, battled with DRIVER'S ED to mid-stretch, gained a short lead inside the furlong marker and held on to
prevail. DRIVER'S ED broke sharply and was pushed to the lead, dueled inside of ELCONDOR to the quarter pole, got the better of that rival in the stretch
but could not match strides with the winner in the late stages. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE was allowed to settle from the break and raced near the rear of the
field in the early stages, moved closer going into the turn, launched a four to five wide rally from the three furlong pole, came into the stretch five wide, rallied
and just held for third at the finish. NUESTRO ENGREIDO raced three to four wide through the early stages on the outside of the tracking group, remained
wide through the turn, tipped out to the five or six path into the stretch, closed willingly in the late stages and just missed for third. JERSEY BABE tracked
the pace from inside, waited behind horses on the turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but had trouble changing in the stretch run, flattened out
and finished evenly. SURPRISE FASHION was unprepared for the start, got off poorly and was slow into stride, chased the field for a half mile while saving
all the ground, had a mild late rally to gain a couple of positions but was unable to overcome the early trouble. ELCONDOR was hustled the front from the
gate, dueled outside of DRIVER'S ED for a half mile, then joined by MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE to the outside passing the quarter pole, gave way before
mid-stretch and was outfinished. DUPLICATION was up close with the tracking group racing between horses to the turn, began to struggle to keep up under
pressure passing the quarter pole and was outrun down the stretch.

Footnotes
REGAL REDWOOD broke outward and made light contact with CONEJO MALO, quickly recovered then was allowed to settle, tracked between horses just
behind the speed duel, bided time through the turn, tipped out to the three path for the stretch run, responded to steady handling with a strong finish and got
up in the final yards. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM broke best but was joined on the lead by PAKAS SECRET and STEVE'S BIG TICKET to the inside, pressed
the issue to turn then battled with the latter down the stretch, gained the advantage before the final furlong but could not hold back the winner in shadow of
the wire. HOT GOBLIN broke out at the start and made some light contact with GATO DE VEGAS, raced near the back of the tracking group early on,
launched a five wide rally through the far turn, put in a big late run down the middle of the track and was along in time to crack the top three. GATO DE
VEGAS raced up close to the leaders in the two path, became boxed in through the turn, waited for room, responded when set down in the stretch and
finished with some interest while never a serious threat. STEVE'S BIG TICKET broke a step slow but rushed into contention for the lead, dueled inside of
PAKAS SECRET and UNBRIDLED RHYTHM to the quarter pole, battled gamely to mid-stretch then was outfinished in the late stages. CONEJO MALO
raced close up while three to four wide down the backstretch, bid for the lead from the five-sixteenths pole, finished willingly but was outkicked in the stretch
and unable to improve position. PAKAS SECRET broke a step slow but rushed on the inside to join the early pace down the backstretch run, began to back
up before the three furlong marker and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. SEAVER WAY was off slowly, dropped far behind early and trailed
throughout.
