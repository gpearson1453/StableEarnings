Footnotes
ONE LUCKY BOY showed speed to move clear through the first turn about the two or three path, widened into the lane and held the margin under urging.
GOIN OWEN broke into the side of the gate to get away slowly, was angled five wide in the first turn, settled three wide nearest the winner going up the
backstretch and could not go with that one. TURN N BURN BOSS was along the inside and lacked a closing response. LITTLEJACKRABBIT bobbled at the
break, followed the pace along the inside and had no rally. DUTTON'S REVENGE followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. CHEAT CODE got
out into the first turn and was always back.

KISS RIDE GOODBYE moved up four wide to challenge going up the backstretch, dueled outside rivals through the far turn and edged away under steady
handling. TIZ HOPPIN stalked the pace three wide, moved five wide into the lane and rallied to gain the place but could not get to the winner. LONG
MONDAY showed speed out from the rail to contest the pace throughout and came up empty in the drive. DONNAS FINAL WORD moved with the winner
going up the backstretch to contest the lead between rivals, appeared in tight midway of the far turn and lost position in the drive. SABER QUEEN saved
ground and failed to mount a bid. COLD AS YOU lunged at the break and trailed.

NORA'S LEGACY settled back off the early pace four wide, rallied five wide in the far turn to come six wide into the lane closed with a good late run to be
going clear at the end. SWEETNESS TO stalked the pace four wide to rally through the far turn into the lane, gained the lead midstretch but could not
handle the winner. BREWSKY followed the pace along the inside to rally into the lane and gained the show. REMARKABLE CHARM moved up four and five
wide into the lane but could not get to the top ones. S C ANGEL showed the most speed to gain inside position, contested the lead into the lane but had
nothing left. READY TO GET LOUD broke outward, contested the early pace outside S C ANGEL and tired in the far turn. WITCHY WINDSOR was shuffled
back at the start and failed to threaten three wide. TOURIST LIKE ME tired three and four wide.
