Footnotes
SUDDENLY SEDUCTIVE never far back, advanced steadily in the five path, matched strides the length of the stretch two wide and proved best under right
handed urging. COMPASS POINT pressed the pace four then three wide and finished a game second in the six path. HE'S A SHOOTER away alertly, set a
pressured pace, drifted in from the four to the two path bumping LAUDA SPEED forcing that one into UNCLE EARL entering the turn, maintained a narrow
advantage inside rivals until mid stretch then was outfinished. LUCKY JUNIOR always within striking distance finished with good courage in the five path.
LAUDA SPEED vied for the early lead two wide, was bumped into UNCLE EARL and shut off by the leader causing his rider to check hard entering the turn
and lost momentum. UNCLE EARL bobbled at the start, rushed to contention along the inside soon thereafter, was bumped into the rail causing his rider to
check hard and skip out over the heels of LAUDA SPEED entering the turn, dropped out of it and jogged to the wire. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED HE'S A SHOOTER FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN AND PLACED HIM LAST.

YOU NAME IT stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn and into the stretch, made the lead near furlong marker and proved best by a
narrow margin under a strong hand ride. BONNIE'S BEST dueled for the lead two wide and finished second best in a game effort. ONE RICH KITTEN
battled for the lead along the inside until deep stretch then faded. C MORE PRIDE with the second flight inside, finished evenly in the four path. ARTIES
CRYPTONITE failed to menace. WAR MOON pressed the early pace three wide and was through after a half. ANGEL'S DESTINY was no factor. MY PINK

stretch and drew away under and energetic hand ride to win as much the best. COMPUTE THIS never far back, loomed boldly four wide through the turn
then was no match for the winner while clearly second bests. GOLD HONEY well placed, went evenly. KINDERHOOK pressed the pace along the inside
into the stretch then faded. MAY MAYHEM was no factor. SPUNKY ONE was no threat. KISSING MEDALS away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide into
