Footnotes
ANTONIOS MARK set a pressured early pace, raced four wide through the turn, took control stretch, kept on and held for the win. STILL IN THE TRAP was
void of any early speed, advanced nine wide, was gaining late and needed more ground. RISKY REVENGE raced in mid pack early, went five wide and
finished with a mild late rally. SAMBAS MARK pressed the early pace, raced three wide and weakened late. DELBERT TOO was taken back early, raced
eight wide out of the turn, angled in and finished belatedly. TUCUM was allowed to settle from between rivals and faded. MCMERCELUS was reserved
early from between rivals and flattened out. IZERIGHT was unhurried early, raced eight wide and offered no late rally. ROLL PENNY ROLL was up close
early from the inside and faded. STRAWBERRY WHISKY was void of any early speed, raced seven wide and was no factor. MONARCHOS DREAM was
not far back early from off the rail and was finished early.
