Footnotes
DODGEBALL showed good early foot from the inside and held well to prove best under steady pressure. RIGHT OF REFUSAL stalked the pace, had an
inside run and finished second best. QUALITY BOW dropped back early, moved up four to five wide and showed good late interest. MUSTANGMAGNA
stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. PLUM ROSE saved ground and moved up late. SWEETNESS TO forced seven
wide around the first turn, was five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. BLOOMING HILLS failed to respoond. REINA ACES raced six wide
around the first turn and never threatened. CAL'S GIRL raced five to six wide in the lane and lacked a bid. TAP THE HEART pressed two deep and tired
readily.
