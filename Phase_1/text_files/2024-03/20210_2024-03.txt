the left lead in the lane and weakened. MAS VINO set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded while getting out.
MUSTHAVEBEENLOVE was bumped at the start, steadied off heels near the five-eighths pole, chased the pace four and five wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
FLUID steadied into the first turn, tracked in the three path, was cued early around the far turn, bid from the five path turning into the stretch, and drew clear
in the final furlong. LITTLE MISS MUNNY bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off the pace in the four path, came under a ride going into the far turn,
fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and rallied for place. VAYESTA trailed along the inside down the backstretch, was stymied in the two
path rounding the far turn, swung out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and angled back into the two path while running on for show in the final
sixteenth. BANANA SPLIT bumped with an outer foe at the start, then steadied early into the first turn, stalked in the two path down the backside, bid
between foes while three wide turning into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. VANISHING WISH laid up close in the three path turning into the
backstretch, bid around the far turn, but faded from the two path down the lane. JOYFUL ELIZA (GB) rated in the three path but did not threaten. DIALITHIC
hopped at the start, showed the way around the first turn to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, was cued into the far turn, but yielded in the
stretch. NO VIOLENCE chased in the two path but backed up along the rail around the far turn.

EVANORA stalked in the three path, took command approaching the quarter, opened up under rousing in upper stretch, and held safely. OLIVIA'S
SPARKLE raced off the pace inside, was driven around the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but drifted outward thru the stretch while
running on for place. VINDICATE CHA CHA set the pace in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, but lost the lead before the quarter, drifted
outward down the lane, and was along for show. GOULDIAN trailed in the two path and never threatened. ELLAGIO tracked in the four path, fanned out to
the six path at the top of the stretch, but came up empty.

at the start, advanced from the four path in the opening furlong to set the pace while tipping into the two path going into the turn, was cued in the three path
at the top of the stretch, but faded on her left lead. MIGUEL'S BELLE prompted the pace between foes in the two path early but gaveway around the turn.

CONQUEST WARRIOR settled off the early pace two wide, angled to the rail late on the first turn, edged closer inside into the far turn, tipped two wide near
the three-eighths pole, moved to the front turning for home and readily drew off while ridden out. MERIT set the pace along the rail, was collared turning for
home and held for the place. RAGUEL prompted the pace two and three wide, could not keep pace with the winner late on the far turn but kept on through
the lane for a slice. NOMOS saved ground in range, checked midway around the first turn, raced off the pace inside, angled four wide early on the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. SECRET LOVER was outrun inside. TAPIT THREE TIMES chased the pace three wide and
faltered.

Footnotes
AXTHELM rated in the two path, was cued going into the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, rallied while tipping inwards, and was up in
the closing stages. MAMBA ON THREE bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was ridden into the turn, opened up approaching
the eighth pole, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. XY SPEED raced up close in the five path, was coaxed along while three wide around the turn,
and kept on for show. CITY MISCHIEF chased in the four path, was cued in the three path early around the turn, tipped out to the nine path in upper stretch,
and stayed on. HIGH LIMIT ROOM bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, had to wait in the two path around the turn,
and kept on from the five path down the lane. CAROTARI pressed in the four path, was ridden two wide around the turn, but was one paced.
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked inside, had to steady going into the turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch,
but failed to bid. JUDGE DAVIS raced towards the back of the pack in the four path, improved late, but was no factor. OMAHA CITY raced off the pace in
the six path and did not threaten from out in the ten path in the stretch. THAT'S RIGHT tracked in the six path, loomed four wide passing the quarter, but
weakened from the six path in the stretch. PREVALENCE raced wellback in the three path and never threatened. VACATION DANCE bumped with an inner
foe at the start, trailed inside early and never menaced.

CELTIC PRIDE set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of ARROGANCY through the lane and dug in to prevail. ARROGANCY pressed the pace two wide,
dueled outside of the winner through the lane, led late and lost the bob. THIRTY POUND TEST tracked the pace two and three wide, drifted out under
left-handed urging in upper stretch then lugged in under right-handed urging and gained late. ETENDRE chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed
rally. STAR OF THE BEAST failed to menace while racing three wide. DAVID'S SONGS was bumped at the start, checked near the half-mile pole and
never threatened while racing two wide. FORT CHARLES chased the pace two and three wide and tired after a half. MORAL AGENCY was bumped at the
start and trailed throughout.
