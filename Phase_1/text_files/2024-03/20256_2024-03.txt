Footnotes
FREEDOM SQUARE prompted inside of the pace setter, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage nearing the lane, inched free and held sway.
BARON OF THE NILE stalked outside of the top pair, lacked progress in upper stretch, yet ran on in the final furlong to gain place late. DROMAS set the
pace outside of a pressing foe, vied with that one around the far turn, got headed nearing the lane, kept on in pursuit through the final furlong but lost place
to an outer bidder in the late stages. BOLIVER tracked in the two path and chased evenly. GEMSTONE WARRIOR laid off of the pace in the four to three
path and failed to factor. LEGENDARY DRAGON trailed in the three path and made little impact. DATS TRUE LOVE lacked speed in the five to four path
around the first turn, but gave way saving ground around the far turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
GYPSY'S SOULMATE broke through the gate pre-race, prompted outside of the pace setter, forged an advantage while vying around the far turn and drew
off in upper stretch. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer prompter while getting headed around the far turn, yielded in
upper stretch and was caught at the wire to dead-heat for place. PLAY MASTER settled off of the pace in the two path, swung out to the six path entering
the lane, rallied hanging on his left lead to reach a dead-heat for place. MAIN DUDE tracked in the two path, chased between horses around the far turn but
failed to threaten. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order inside of foes down the backstretch, but only managed to
chase around the far turn and lacked a bid. JIMMIE'S HALO pursued from midpack along the inside, before shifting out to the four path in the early stages of
the backstretch, then lacked progress thereafter. HAIL THE CAT saved ground towards the rear to no avail. STONE ALLIANCE never got involved.
HOOSIER pursued from the four to five path and faded. SCORING DRIVE made little impact.

VETERANS DAY settled off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the seven to eight path in upper stretch, rallied to reel in the leader at the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. HEZA PRIORITY tracked from midpack two wide approaching the turn, shifted out and gained in the four to six path around the bend,
bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was caught by an outer challenger at the sixteenth pole. HOSTILE AFLEET lagged behind in the two path
into the turn, shifted out to the eight path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly to gain show late. WISE ANCHOR chased from midpack along the inside,
shifted outwardly in the final furlong and edged fourth from between horses nearing the wire. PRIZELESS stalked the leading pair from the three path, took
aim from the four path along with an outer rival entering the lane, but got outkicked in upper stretch, chased in the final furlong but lost show late. CARLOS
PUNCH vied for the lead two wide, led nearing the lane, but hung on his left lead, got bested in midstretch and weakened. ADIEU ACES tracked tucking
from the four path to the two path into the turn, chased in the three path in upper stretch and yielded between horses getting floated out into the final

Footnotes
SECOND OF JULY broke inwardly and on top, set a clear pace while well rationed and unchallenged, then widened under mild urging. HOODLUM stalked
from the two path, chased while taking aim on the clear leader around the far turn, but was no match for that one and well clear of the rest. MY BARILEY
laid off of the pace in the three path and improved between horses in midstretch. TELEPHONE TALKER pursued from midpack in the two path but lacked a
bid. BODE'S LIGHT broke outwardly, rushed forward to stalk from the four to three path around the first turn, but gave way around the far turn.
CALLINGINTHENIGHT laid off of the pace in the four path, but lacked a response to urging around the far turn, got floated to the five path entering the lane
and tired. HARD ATTACK was outrun in the three to five path. STATE OF THE UNION lacked speed along the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
RICKY BOBBY rated at the rear along the inside early on, moved out of last down the backstretch, advanced inside of foes turning for home, tipped to take
aim outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, sustained progress to bid at the sixteenth pole and edged past. HAROLD'S CLOUD pressed two wide,
prompted around the far turn, was kept at bay through midstretch, but got outkicked by an outer bidder entering the final sixteenth and forged place at the
wire. MY ROMEO LIMA was bumped by an inner rival at the start, showed the way along the inside, held sway from an outer presser to the sixteenth pole,
but was bested by a wider challenger leaving that station, yielded and lost place late. FLAWLESS RULER raced off of the pace in the three to four path,
lagged behind the rest around the far turn, then regained stride to rally inside of foes in upper stretch, claimed fourth at the furlong grounds and closed in on
the top trio. UXMAL steadied behind the leader when that one crossed over entering the first turn, tracked along the inside, chased two wide around the far
turn and faded. TEMPLE CITY RUN tracked two to three wide, chased around the far turn and gave way. JULIA'S WARRIOR broke out and bumped a rival
at the start, raced off of the pace hung in the four to five path around the first turn, then tired.

MUSICAL PRAYER stalked in three three path into the turn, ranged up to bid outside of the leader turning for home, gained an advantage entering the lane
and drove clear. RILEY JEAN transferred firm contact from an inner rival and squarely bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the four
to three path and between horses into the turn, shifted back to the four path entering the lane, pursued while flopping back to his left lead leaving the three
sixteenths pole, changed back to his right lead in midstretch and ran on to gain place in the closing stages. FIESTA BESTA showed the way along the
inside, met the eventual winner's challenge at the five sixteenths pole, got headed entering the lane, yielded and lost place late. GOLDYS LOCK stalked
close up in the two path before tucking behind the leader into the turn, but only managed to chase while reclaiming fourth in the final furlong. GRAPES FOR
ELOISE tracked along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses passing the three furlong pole, chased whlie delaying changing leads until
midstretch and yielded. MS. LILIBET laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. COLLIER broke out and firmly bumped a rival at the start,
lagged behind in the two path around the turn and and made little impact. ELLIPTIC was jostled by an inner rival after breaking a step slow, raced off of the
pace in the five to four path, got floated back to the five path entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
RANCH WATER was bumped between horses at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, saved ground advancing turning for home, smoothly
tipped to bid outside of the leader entering the lane, led into the final furlong and held sway. THE BOSS SOSS stalked three wide, chased in the four path
around the far turn, got outmoved by an inner bidder entering the lane yet ran on willingly thereafter. DUVEE set the pace along the inside, got headed by
an outer bidder in upper stretch, gave way and lasted for show. TAMBOURINE STAR took contact from an outer rival soon after the start, stalked along the
inside, chased close up in the three path and between horses turning for home, but was outmoved by an inner rival entering the lane and lacked a bid.
SONYA KNOWS BETTER leaned out to take firm contact from an outer rival at the start causing him to bump an inner foe and steady between horses in the
aftermath, rated well back along the inside, advanced down the backstretch, pursued from the three path around the far turn before swinging to the six path
into upper stretch, but leveled off. PESO PESADO lacked speed in the three path, entered the lane in the five path and moved up. DUDE DROP KID lacked
speed in the two path and failed to factor. COFFEE COUNTY chased from midpack in the three to two paths and gave way. JOEY'S GAME reared up and
hit the top of the starting gate when it sprung, then lagged behind and never got involved. EL DEAL ME ACES bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed
two wide but weakened between horses nearing the lane. TINCAN CAT pursed from midpack in the four path, but faded lugging to the five to seven path
around the far turn. MO CREDO laid off of the pace along the inside, moved out to the six path leaving the first turn, but was eased bearing wider around the
far turn, pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked off.

the wire and held. LUCKY ROMANCE brushed an outer rival and was off slow, trailed in the three path, swung to the six to seven path in upper stretch,
rallied to attempt a bid at the wire but came up short. SUCCESSFUL RUN chased forwardly in the three to two path into the turn, sustained pursuit in the
three path in upper stretch, closed in to bid along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth, vied late but got outfinished and nailed for place. FRIO RIVER
lacked speed along the inside, moved to the three path entering the lane, rallied before altering course to sustain progress among foes in the final sixteenth,
and reached fourth at the wire. RADICAL MISCHIEF dueled for the lead with an outer rival, gamely battled through midstretch, but was bested by wider
bidders leaving the sixteenth pole and yielded late. PED D'ORO broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two to four path and failed to menace. GLACIAL
POWER dueled for the lead with an inner rival, sustained the battle through midstretch but weakened between horses in the final sixteenth. LINZER was
brushed by an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two to three path, chased getting floated to the four path in upper stretch but yielded
between horses at the furlong grounds. LAST ATTACK tracked along the inside and weakened. PAINTED SUNDAY pursued from the four to six path and
weakened.

Footnotes
HE'S JUST LUCKY bumped an outer rival at the start, quickly opened up, widened under mild urging in upper stretch and was much the best. OUR
DETERMINATION chased the clear leader from the two path and was second best. GRAN CHICO was bumped between horses at the start, lacked speed
along the inside, then advanced between horses in midstretch. WICKED PUNCHES laid off of the pace in the two path, gained swinging to the five path
entering the lane but flattened out. JAYDE'S BANDIT bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path entering
the lane and moved up. NO MORE WORDS chased forwardly along the inside and faded. CAJUN CYCLONE raced forwardly tow wide and between horses
but weakened. MUNCLE broke a step slow and made little impact from the four path. CONNECTIQUE tracked three wide and weakened between horses in
upper stretch. ALLER VITE was bumped between horses at the start and got outrun in the five path. HENNESSY WILD pursued four wide and weakened.
