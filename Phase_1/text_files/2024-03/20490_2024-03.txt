of the stretch then kicked clear and held on. OPTIMAL TRIP was brushed at the start, was allowed to settle between rivals in the back flight, continued to
save ground on the turn from the inside, rallied in the upper stretch and could not catch the leader and was best for the place prize. FLEET OF HOOF broke
outwardly and bumped rival then led the way early while two wide, was over taken mid backstretch, then regained command heading into the turn, was in a
hard drive then gave way in the stretch. WORDS OF WISDOM was bumped at the start, was allowed to settle along the inside, then advanced on the turn
while passing up rivals, came out three wide, could not retain stride and flattened out in the end. AMERICAN CODE was allowed to settle while three wide,
then came out five wide leaving the bend to bid in the stretch and came up evenly. SHAMAYIM moved up along the inside to take the lead briefly heading
into the second half of the backstretch, lost command at the three eighths marker, maintained second position throughout the turn then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
MOLA MIA tracked the pace while two wide, then was charging up on the far turn to meet with inner rivals in the early stretch, then battled gamely and just
had more to be up in time to prevail. ITS MY MONEY TOO chased the pace from the inside in the the early furlongs, then gained command mid backstretch,
was met with two outer rivals leaving the far turn, vied grudgingly to keep the lead but was outkicked in the end and was second best. SHELL SHOCK
dueled from the two path into the first turn, then settled back on the backstretch, rebid on the far turn to battle between rivals heading into the stretch, rallied
gamely and was best for the show prize in the end. SANTANGELO raced towards the back of the field while two wide, then bid on the far turn to rally in the
early stretch and came up evenly in the end. POETIC UNION hopped at the start, was allowed to settle along the inside, then bid from the two path leaving
the far turn but it was too little too late. RUN WITT RUN dueled with an outer rival into the first turn, then settled back to second position in the late
backstretch, was in a mild drive on the far turn then flattened out in the home stretch. AUNT JANA trailed behind the field and was no factor.

Footnotes
HYPERION NORTH stalked the pace while two wide into the turn, then dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to spar with an inner rival in the final yards
then kick clear and was up in the final strides to prevail. SUMMER HELP set the pace from the inside, continued to lead throughout the turn, was confronted
by an outer rival in the early stretch to duel in the final furlong then was outkicked in the end. TEXAN FARMER raced in the middle of the field from the
inside, then inched up on the turn while three wide, rallied in the early stretch, lacked the winning bid and bested the rest of the field. FLAT OUT PERFECT
saved ground while racing at the back of the pack while two wide, then came out four wide leaving the bend to rally in the stretch but it was to no avail.
POSEIDONS WAVE was allowed to settle along the inside, then rallied leaving the far turn and came up empty in the end. KEEPMOVINGFORWARD was
unhurried early, then made a mild bid leaving the turn and never fired in the stretch. SPECIAL MEMORY stalked the pace from the inside, was in a hard
drive on the turn, was used up and weakened in the late stretch.

CLAY'S BLACK OPAL vied with inner foes heading into the turn, then continued to stalk the emerging leader from the three path on the turn, dug in
grudgingly in the stretch and was able to be up at the wire to prove best overall. CASTILLE prompted the pace early while four wide, then settled back on
the turn, drifted out six to seven wide heading into the stretch then closed willingly down the lane and just missed victory in the end. CLEAT pressed the
pace early from the inside, then steadied at the three eighths pole, regained stride on the turn to rally gamely in the early stretch, gained command in the
final furlong then was caught at the wire and was best for the show prize. RASSLER was bumped at the start, then vied between rivals, took command at
the top of the turn, maintained the lead in the early stretch under a gamely drive then was out finished by rivals on both sides in the end. DOSE'S DREAM
was unhurried early, then settled in the two path, rallied leaving the bend and into the stretch but it was not enough in the end. MY LITTLE PRINCE chased
the pace while two wide at an even pace throughout the early furlongs, then rallied in the upper stretch and needed more in the end. GOLD PRIZE was
allowed to settle while three wide, then bid from the inside on the turn and kept on down the lane but it was not enough in the end. WAVE AFTER WAVE
vied for the lead from the inside, continued to press the pace throughout the turn under a strong drive, was used up and gave way in the end. AMERICAN
WARRIOR was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack while two wide and came up empty in the end. CATCHEM IF YOU CAN chased the pace
from the inside under a steady drive then gave way leaving the bend.

Footnotes
DOC'S BOLERO raced close behind the leaders while four wide, then inched up on the turn from the three path, dug in gamely to duel with an inner rival in
the early stretch then kicked clear and held on well to prevail in the end. LET'S TIE ONE ON set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive headed into
the stretch, was challenged by an outer rival to duke it out in deep stretch then was outkicked in the end and was second best. JUST HANGIN RIDGE
pressed the pace from the three path early, continued to race closely behind the leader on the turn while two wide, menaced in the early stretch but could
not catch the leader in the end and held onto the show prize in the end. CAPTAINS COVE chased the pace while four wide into the turn, then rallied in the
early stretch and was closing under a gamely drive and just missed the show prize in the end. RICHARD'S TX BLING was allowed to settle while four wide
towards the back of the pack, then bid on the turn from the two path, drifted out seven to eight wide in the early stretch and came up empty in the end. RED
DRAW raced from the inside towards the back of the field, then bid on the turn and into the stretch but it was too little too late. VALDINA DREAMS chased
the pace while three wide under a strong drive, came out five wide leaving the turn to bid in the stretch then gave way in the end. HOLIDAY RUN chased the
pace from the inside, then bid briefly heading into the turn before fading in the final furlongs. CLIPPER COVE stalked the pace while two wide, was in tight
at the three eighths pole, settled back on the turn, re bid in the upper stretch and came up empty in the end. FANDO was no threat. SLIM JIMMY trailed at
the back of the field and failed to rally.

Footnotes
ALL COUNTRY led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was threatened by an outer rival at the quarter pole, kicked clear of that
rival in the early stretch and kept was to task till the end to prevail. NERKY ROSE saved ground in the early furlongs, then moved up steadily down the
backstretch while three wide, bid from the two path on the far turn then closed belatedly down the home stretch and hung in the end. WITHOUT A TRACE
raced a the back of the field throughout the first half, then bid on the far turn while two wide, angled in towards the rail in the early stretch and surged down
lane and was best for the show prize in the end. ONE LAST BID was allowed to settle along the inside, bid leaving the far turn, was cut off in the early
stretch, shifted out to the two path to make one last bid but it was too little too late. MR INSENSITIVE stalked the pace while two wide, then inched up on the
far turn to duel with the pace setter heading in the early stretch, could not retain bid and gave way in the end. GET RIPPED tracked the pace from the
inside, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch, was extinguished and gave way in the end.
