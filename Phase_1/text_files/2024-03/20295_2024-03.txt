Footnotes
JOE SHIESTY quick speed to front outside, stayed clear into the stretch and well handled to the wire. PERFECT PRANKSTER squeezed from the gate,
unhurried to the turn with a wide run in the stretch while coming on too late, might have been best today. ALWAYSINTOMISCHIEF no speed from inside to
the turn, rallied on stretch for third. SHAPE NOTE inside run to the turn, improved position in the stretch run. BARKSDALE bore in start, chased to turn,
could not go on in the stretch. SMOKEY SMOKEY inside chase to stretch, still game stretch, gave in late stretch. EKATI'S WAY bore in start, never
menaced throughout. FAMILY FACTOR awkward from the gate and never recovered. QUINCY RIDER outside run to the turn, could not keep up and faded
stretch run. BLAMEITONMYMOMMA good position to turn, still game into stretch, gave in readily. DUNPHY through after half and dropped back with little
resistance.

LOATHING good position throughout with a nice run for place no match. STONE'S THROW raced between horses to the turn, could not keep up and settled
for show. TALKSCHEAP no speed from the gate, raced well back to turn and improved position through the stretch run. EL CUERVO FELIS bit tardy from
the gate, unhurried to turn, ran to move up late. PARK PLACE speed inside to turn, clear into stretch, could not go on, faded. KELLEHER inside run to turn,
gave in through the stretch run. THIRTYEIGHT WISHES never menaced throughout. DON'T STOP could keep up from the turn, gave in readily into stretch.
CHITWOOD three wide chase to turn, weakened in the stretch.

wire. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE chased leader to far turn, headed that one into the stretch but could not go on to the wire. QUERIDINHA LECA had an inside
run to three eighths pole and emptied out into the stretch. VALENTINA DAY five wide run first turn to the lead, clear to far turn, dueled into the stretch and
