Footnotes
WODETON (FR) was squeezed at the start and was off a step slowly, rated off of the early pace while not far back, came in tight and checked entering the
first turn, settled and saved ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail approaching the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into far turn then
waited for racing room nearing the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, shifted three wide nearing the furlong pole and improved position at
mid-stretch, responded to urging and split rivals into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and held safely in a drive to prove best. J T'S
WATCH allowed to settle away from the start, maintained an outside path entering the first turn and was floated a bit at the seven-furlong pole, went three
wide into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, improved position three to four wide into the far turn, spun four wide into
upper stretch and loomed at the furlong grounds, took a narrow lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by WODETON in deep stretch and
held for second. BRONZE WARRIOR away in good order, ceded the early lead and stalked the pace into the first turn, tracked the loose pacesetter through
solid fractions approaching the half-mile pole, gained ground two wide into the far turn and drew to even terms with BOSS OF THEMOSS into upper stretch,
battled with that rival to the furlong grounds and held a narrow lead at mid-stretch, lost the lead to J T'S WATCH past mid-stretch, yielded to the top pair in
the final sixteenth and held safely at the finish for third. BOSS OF THEMOSS showed good speed away from the start and was sent to establish the early
lead, assumed command and drew to a clear advantage into the first turn, drew off along the backstretch run and set solid fractions to the half-mile pole,
had the margin diminished into the second turn but remained clear to the quarter pole, was confronted by BRONZE WARRIOR into the stretch and met that
rival's bid to the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch. BABY FRANKIE allowed to settle while never far back in
the early going, tracked the solid pace from a two wide path approaching the half-mile marker, gained ground two to three wide along the second turn, was
outkicked into the stretch and flattened out in the final stages.

Footnotes
VILLA NOVA was prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead to ALL HALLOWS and stalked that rival into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, went two wide into the second turn and gained ground on ALL HALLOWS nearing the quarter marker, chased into the stretch,
closed on ALL HALLOWS past the furlong grounds and gained command inside of the sixteenth-marker, edged away in deep stretch and held safely under
hand urging to prevail. ALL HALLOWS away in good order, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, drew off into the backstretch run
and set decent fractions approaching the half-mile marker, had the lead cut into entering the second turn but maintained a clear advantage nearing the
quarter pole, was set down for the drive and remained clear at mid-stretch, was overtaken into the final sixteenth and was best of the rest. BLUE BREEZE
settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground while unhurried through the backstretch run, maintained an inside
path into the second turn and improved position into upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and held for third at
the finish. INFINITE LOVE stumbled away from the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle and maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run,
was content to trail nearing the half-mile marker and was guided three wide into the far turn, made a steady gain while widest into the stretch, offered a mild
late rally and just missed for third at the finish. DADDY INDEED took back off of the early pace, went two wide into the first turn and was unhurried through
the backstretch run, maintained a two wide path into the second turn, was asked for run into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, lacked a
response in the final sixteenth and did not make an impact.

Footnotes
TEN THE SMART WAY showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn and set moderate
fractions into the backstretch run, was well handled while setting the pace approaching the half-mile pole, kicked to a clear lead into the second turn,
extended the lead into upper stretch, pulled away in the final furlong and was ridden out in deep stretch as much the best. HAPPY IS prominent away from
the start, stalked the pace into the first turn and saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained an inside path and was well placed approaching the
half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn and chased to the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the stretch and held well in the final stages to
secure place honors. MATCHLESS took back off of the early pace, came in a bit tight entering the first turn and raced two wide into the backstretch run,
tracked the modest pace nearing the half-mile pole, improved position three wide into the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lost ground at the
furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while well clear in the end for third. NORTHERN ROSE unhurried away
from the start, saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail approaching the half-mile marker, was outrun into the second turn and went two wide
nearing the quarter pole, lacked the needed response in the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final stages. JAZZY LOVE allowed to settle while never far
back in the early stages, raced three wide along the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the
half-mile marker, chased four wide into the second turn, came in a bit tight into upper stretch and gave way at the furlong marker, could not summon a
response in the final sixteenth and tired in the late stages. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) forwardly placed leaving the start, went two to three wide into the first
turn and stalked the early pace into the backstretch run, stalked the moderate pace while well positioned approaching the half-mile pole, chased TEN THE
SMART WAY into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
BROOKYS GAL broke well but was taken in hand and kept about two paths away from the rail down the backstretch, allowed the pace scenario to play out,
pulled closer through the turn still under some restraint, waited for room then angled out into the clear, turned for home in the four path, produced a bold
rally, caught CEE'S THE IMAGE near the sixteenth pole, and pulled ahead of that stubborn foe in the last jumps. CEE'S THE IMAGE gained the early lead
without being asked, led the field through the turn under a rating hold, was let loose approaching the five-sixteenths pole and repelled bids by GREATFUL
ATTITUDE and PRINCESS BELLE, opened up again when roused at the top of the stretch, then fought back gamely when BROOKYS GAL made her bid to
the outside and just failed to last. GREATFUL ATTITUDE got away slowly and was last down the backstretch, shifted to the outside and gradually advanced
to into contention by the turn, made a three wide sweeping move in a bid for the lead, was still three wide turning for home, finished willingly but could not
match strides with the top pair. OUTER SUNSET veered out after the break and made light contact with PRINCESS BELLE, then raced close up on the
inside of the tracking group through the early stages, got stuck behind horses racing on the rail through the turn then slipped through an opening along the
rail turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. PRINCESS BELLE got pinballed after the break but recovered and was up in the early pace mix early on,
raced between horses of a trio tracking the lone pacesetter CEE'S THE IMAGE, moved to challenge approaching the five-sixteenths pole along with
GREATFUL ATTITUDE to the outside, loomed a threat to the top of the stretch then flattened out. MUMBLES BROCKMAN shied from PRINCESS BELLE
after the start, got away a step slow then raced three wide into the turn, came under a ride from the five-sixteenths marker when trying go after the
pacesetter, was unable to keep up with the rest as they turned for home and was outrun to the wire.

REBALATION rated nicely off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn, was roused at the quarter pole and tipped three wide into upper stretch,
loomed at the furlong marker, took command into the final sixteenth and drove clear under mild hand urging in deep stretch. TESSA (GB) prominent away
from the start, ceded the early lead and stalked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, went up and pressed ELEGANT SWAY into the turn, was asked for
run into the stretch, took command and held a narrow advantage approaching the furlong pole, was collared by REBALATION nearing the sixteenth-marker,
could not keep pace with the winner into deep stretch and was second best. ELEGANT SWAY showed good speed away from the start, assumed early
command and set a solid pace to the half-mile marker, was pressured into the turn and carved out decent fractions nearing the quarter marker, lost the lead
into upper stretch and battled to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the top pair into the final sixteenth and held safely for third. CITY GLITTER
tracked the decent early pace from the outside, raced widest into the turn and chased four wide to the quarter marker, gave way into upper stretch and could
not muster a late response. RAFANELLI washy prior to the start, tracked the decent early pace from an inside position, chased two wide into the turn,
shifted three wide at the quarter pole and was outrun into upper stretch, lacked a response in the final furlong and came up empty in the late stages.
LADY'S SERMON chased the decent early pace from between rivals, was guided three wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, stopped in
upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

BABY KRISTEN broke sharply and was hustled to get the early lead, held sway with QUEEN MOLOTOV in close pursuit to the outside through the turn,
quickened on cue passing the quarter pole and opened up under urging turning into the stretch, had a little trouble keeping a straight course in the final
furlong and just held on. QUEEN MOLOTOV broke a beat slow but went quickly towards the front and was put in a stalking position just to the outside of
BABY KRISTEN, had that foe slip away a bit passing the quarter pole, then went into a drive and soldiered on under strong handling down the stretch, was
gaining in the final yards but came up short. ROUSING JEWEL broke well and was pushed to stay close to the leaders to the turn racing in the two path
then, angled to the rail for the run through the turn, came up the rail and finished well under intermittent urging but was not able to overtake the top pair.
BLUE WILDCAT broke well but raced at the rear of the compact field, took the rail position down the backstretch then switched to the outside before the
three furlong marker, swung three wide into the stretch but was unable to make an impact and chased the field home.

COWBOY KISSES broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set a decent pace to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the turn and showed the way to
the quarter pole, was confidently ridden into the stretch and drew clear at the furlong grounds, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and pulled away late
to be much the best. COUNT ASHER was crowded by a neighboring rival and was away slowly, rushed up from the outside and stalked the pace three wide
into the turn, gained ground approaching the quarter marker, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not keep
pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch to secure the place. LORD OF LIGHT away in good order, rated nicely off of the
decent early while never far back, was guided three to four wide into the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter pole, was asked for run into the stretch and
ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and missed for second at the finish, while earning the nod for third on the wire.
DRUMADOON showed speed away from the start and was prominent in the early running, stalked the decent pace to the half-mile pole and was well
positioned heading into the turn, attended to the pace two wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth
and was outfinished for the minor awards. BIG DIFFERENCE hustled to show early speed and chased the decent pace from the inside, saved ground into
the turn and lost position at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and gave way. DANZ TILL TEN unhurried away from the start,
trailed to the quarter marker and saved ground into the turn, waited for racing room at the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch and could not
muster a late response. SPLIT ACES broke out at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, chased the decent early pace from the second flight, went two
to three wide into the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch and came up empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes
VALIANT SON was hustled from the break but opted to let UNCLE JUAN set the pace, stalked two wide while always traveling well, set out to challenge that
foe approaching the five-sixteenths pole, took command at the top of the stretch, widened under steady handling and intermittent urging and drew off
despite racing on the wrong lead. DELIAN LEAGUE was a little slow to get going and lagged behind the leading trio early on, bided time behind the field for
the first quarter mile, then angled to the outside to set up a three wide bid through the turn, came into the stretch behind horses then dove to the inside,
finished well to gain second while no match for the winner. BRAVO RAGAZZO was outrun from the break then pressed to keep up while stuck three wide
down the backstretch, made a nice three wide bid from the three furlong pole in tandem with DELIAN LEAGUE ran on willingly under steady handling and
intermittent urging and just missed second while well clear of the next horse. PARTY WITH PADDY broke well and raced close up early while being a bit
hard to place, was put in tight just before the turn and made some contact with VALIANT SON, angled back to the inside for the run through the turn, got
stuck behind horses through the turn then was in tight and steadied at the three-sixteenths pole, lost momentum and was unable to recover. UNCLE JUAN
broke best and sped to and open lead, led the field through the turn, had several challengers by the quarter pole, held on well to mid-stretch then weakened
in the final furlong. WAITINGATTHEBAR broke behind the field then became rank and veered sharply to the outside, recovered and moved back into
contact with the rest, steadied slightly near the seven-sixteenths pole, tried to get back into the race under pressure but could not keep pace and was not
persevered with late.
