Footnotes
ANDY CANT showed early speed then contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside of a foe on the turn, shook clear in
the three path coming to the quarter-pole, spun four wide into upper stretch then was given a pop of a right-handed crop at the three-sixteenths, drew off
under one more pop of the crop into the final furlong, remained well clear under a strong hand-ride until the final strides then was put to lighter
encouragement while much the best. UNCLE EDDIE was urged along just off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, chased in the two path on the
turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, fought with NO SURRENDER for the place in the final furlong and determinedly earned that position while no
match for the winner. NO SURRENDER was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, moved out entering the main-track, chased four wide for
most of the turn then moved to the five path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled with UNCLE EDDIE in the final furlong for the place and just
missed that position while clear for the show. CROWN THAT SAINT brushed the inside of the gate and was last to commence while off about a half-step
slow, moved up under urging then pressed the leaders, dropped back around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and tired. NOBLE ONE dropped
well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and showed little. KING OF FRANCE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was off a half-step
slow, showed speed on the outside then contested the pace, vied in the three path for most of the turn then moved to the four path, dropped back between
horses outside the furlong marker and faded.

Footnotes
OCEAN GATEWAY pressed the pace on the far outside, vied in the four path on the turn, took a short lead near the quarter-pole, responded well under a
drive into the final furlong and edged clear under steady urging. BON ADIEU went to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied
inside to the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage near that pole, fought with the winner in upper stretch and was
outfinished while clear for the place. IN MY OPINION settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn and
lacked the needed kick while best of the rest. WHISTLER'S STYLE was urged along at the rear, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. TONED UP settled off the pace, was urged three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond. KID'S LAST LAUGH
broke awkwardly and was last to commence, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SARATOGA KISSES settled off the pace, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, saved ground while urged along on the turn, gained while cutting the
corner into the stretch, rallied to make a bid outside the furlong marker, drifted out some near that juncture, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole
and prevailed under strong urging. SPEIGHTFUL LILY bumped soundly with a foe at the start while also bumping with another opponent, was well placed in
third position, chased in the three path on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, led into the final furlong,
lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and missed while well clear for the place. SAIL WITH THE WIND showed speed then contested
the pace on the outside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, re-engaged the leader in the four path on the turn, took a short advantage outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and tired. REIGNING CHICK was coaxed along off the pace, brushed with a foe near the
eleven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty. CHASING DAYLIGHT bumped hard with a rival at the start then was hustled,
showed speed under urging, moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, was challenged while in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. FREDDYMO FACTOR was well placed just off the pace, brushed with a rival near the
eleven-sixteenths pole then moved out, shifted from three to five wide under urging on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. JSK
LUCKY'S PUSHPA brushed with a foe shortly after the start, was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn and capitulated. LADY FORTUNA
dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three wide for most of the turn, angled four then five wide late on that bend, moved inward in upper stretch
and was no factor. BELLA PRINCIPESSA bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside of a foe, was urged five then four wide on the turn and failed
to respond.
