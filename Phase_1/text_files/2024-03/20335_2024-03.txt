LUCKY GIN showed good early foot to set the early pace, dug in inside the three sixteenths pole and held game to prove best under strong handling.
GOSPEL SPEAR stalked the pace, made a four wide bid near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. BACK STREET BABY pressed three deep
and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DARETOCATCHLOVE prompt the early pace near the rail and weakened in the drive. I BILEVE stumbled at
the break, raced off the early going after the poor start, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. SCANDALOUS was off slowly,
saved ground and never threatened.
