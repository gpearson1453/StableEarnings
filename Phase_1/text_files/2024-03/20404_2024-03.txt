Footnotes
MATH MYSTERY showed the way from the gate and maintained a steady pace throughout before drawing off in the early stretch proving best in the end.
POET LAUREATE chased the pace while two wide, then gained second position on the turn, lacked the winning bid in the stretch and was best for the place
prizse in the end. GANGSTER RAP saved ground early before moving up and outside of rivals while three wide, rallied at the top of the stretch and closed
willingly in the end. EAGLE EXPRESS settled back along the inside and behind the field, then came out four wide leaving the bend and bid too little too late
in the stretch. TEXAS RED BEL chased the pace from the inside under a string drive throughout the early furlongs then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MONET'S DEVIL was nicely rated while two wide and between rivals, then came out four wide leaving the bend, dug in gamely mid stretch and surged to
the wire to be up just in time to prevail. MISTER K brushed rival, then set the pace from the inside, was over taken by an outer rival heading into the turn,
maintained a steady drive, then rallied in the early stretch to retake the lead, was under a hard drive before being caught at the wire and was second best.
REQUISITION was reserved behind the field early, then came out six wide leaving the bend and closed belatedly down the lane and was best for the show
prize. WEIRD YEAR chased the pace while four wide, then bid on the turn from the two path to rally in the upper stretch and kept on down the lane.
GENTLEMAN'S SECRET pressed the pace from the two path, gained command heading into the turn, was under hard drive entering the early stretch then
was over powered on rivals on both sides and gave way in the end. TEXAS TITAN chased the pace while five, then urged steadily on the turn while three
wide before giving way in the stretch. FLIP THE COIN JAN brushed rival, then chased the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout and needed
more in the end. CARPE EROS bid for the lead early while two wide before settling back between rivals, continued to chase the pace throughout the turn,
came up five wide to bid again but had nothing left and faded in the end.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE COURAGE was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn, tracked the pace from the inside, then inched up on the far turn to gain
command at the quarter pole, then drew off in the home stretch to prove best in the end. LEVY was well reserved along the inside in the middle on the field
in the early furlongs, maintained a steady drive on the far turn, came out three wide, rallied gamely to gain second position in the upper stretch, did not have
enough to catch the leader and was best for the place prize. TOP COP was unhurried early, then saved ground down the backstretch while racing behind
the field, came out four wide leaving the far bend and closed willingly down the stretch just missing the place position in the end. NORTHWIND bumped
rival, then prompted the pace from the two path into the backstretch, inched up to duel briefly, gained command heading into the far turn, then steadied at
the quarter pole, re gained stride and kept on down the home stretch. AWESOME CAJUN set the pace into the first turn from the inside, was met by an
outer rival to spar briefly at the half, lost the lead then continued to give way throughout the final furlongs. EUROROCKSTAR was bumped at the start, then
chased the pace mid pack and while three wide, rallied gamely on the far turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, could not retain stride and tired in the
end. HUMOR ME PLEASE settled along the inside and showed little.

VIEWERS DISCRETION raced closely behind the leader while two wide in the early furlongs, continued to track the pace between rivals down the
backstretch, then dug in gamely leaving the far turn to edge clear in the early stretch and held on well to the wire to succeed in the end. REBEL CONSORT
tracked the pace mid pack and while three wide down the backstretch, rallied on the far turn to gain second position mid stretch and was gaining ground but
it was not enough and was best for the place prize in the end. MIZ CALI led the way into the first turn to set the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
was in the clear on the far turn before being confronted by rivals from the outside in the early stretch and gave way in the end and maintained the show
prize. PAINTBRUSH hopped at the start, was allowed to settle in the three path in the back pack of rivals, then moved up in the late backstretch and into the
far turn while four wide, menaced in the early stretch but it was not enough in the end. TRIPLE FOUR was floated outwardly at the start, then settled along
the inside at the back in the early furlongs, remained at the back on the far turn before coming out four wide to bid in the home stretch but it was too little too
late. OH DOO DAH DAY was allowed to settle in the back pack while two wide, then bid on the far turn from the inside and came up evenly in the stretch.
LADY WITH A CAUSE tracked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then settled back on the far turn and lacked rallying in the home stretch. RUBY
THE DESTROYER was forwardly placed while three wide entering the first turn, then stalked the pace while two wide, was in a long drive on the far turn
while maintaining second position, was used up and tired in the home stretch.

AFFECTION battled with inner rivals into the turn, then sparred with the remaining rival on the turn, kicked clear at the quarter pole then pulled away down
the lane to prove best overall. CLIMB TO GLORY saved ground early, then moved up to split rivals on the turn, came out three wide and closed willingly
down the lane and was best for the place prize. CACTUS BLOSSOM was moving up steadily while four wide, then rallied on the turn and was closing well
while passing rivals down the lane and was best for the show prize. EXCLUSIVE ACCESS was shuffled back at the start, was unhurried early, then came
out six wide leaving the bend to rally in the stretch and was closing well despite prior circumstances. CONCEAL angled inward at the start, then chased the
pace from the inside in the middle of the field, continued to race at a moderate pace on the turn before bidding in the upper stretch and came up evenly in
the end. LONG SHOT LOUISE stalked the trio from the inside under a steady drive, then bid on the turn before giving way in the late stretch. ROYAL
LIAISON vied with outer rivals down the backstretch under a strong drive then gave way heading into the turn and lacked rallying in the late stretch.
VIOLENT VIOLET vied for the lead between rivals while in a hard drive, then continued to duel from the inside on the turn, was extinguished and tired in the
late stretch.

the place prize. COMES THE SUN chased the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn to gain second position on the turn, was out bid by an outer
rival in the late stretch and kept on for the show prize in the end. FLYING CAESAR was allowed to settle while two wide, then rallied leaving the bend and
was closing willingly down the lane. TOO INTIMIDATING stalked the leader while two wide, maintained second position throughout the turn, was in a long
drive before giving way in the end. RIPSTER broke outwardly then raced while two wide, then bid leaving the turn and came up evenly in the late stretch.

the back then bid on the turn from the inside and came up empty. TOO MUCH LONG LEGS chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace and
needed rally in the end. OBVIOUS CONCLUSION veered inwardly after the start, then trailed behind the field and was no menace in the end. TIGER MAN
