VOICE FROM ABOVE outside run to quarter pole, kept on gamely through stretch in a drive for the nod on the wire. FOURFIFTYSEVEN raced widest first
turn, came three wide past the quarter pole, stayed on strong in the final sixteenth but nailed at the wire. NOSHUGFORPOP no speed, loped along to far
turn, ran on into the stretch to finish gamely but just missed. GO MARGIE GO between horses to the front, led to deep stretch with a good effort. BETTE
DAVIS good position between horses to far turn, closed the gap in the stretch mildly. QUEEN'S NOTICE inside run to far turn, bottled up into stretch kept on
gamely to the wire with a rough trip. PAROLA SICURA pressed and dueled with leader to far turn, weakened stretch run. GIGI'S WORLD had no speed
from off rail and never menaced throughout.

bumping, raced off rail speed, pressured winner to stretch, good effort to wire. MIDNIGHT AMBITION inside run to the stretch, kept on in the drive for third
spot. PRINCE COLTON unhurried from inside to turn with a mild gain in the stretch run. MIGHTY LES raced along evenly with no response when needed
from the turn. STAR OF CAESAREA no speed from inside and never threatened. MILLARD A MAVERICK good position within striking distance to turn,
faded from turn. AL AMEEQ wide run to quarter pole never far back to stretch, gave in. ROPE A DOPE bothered start and squeezed back and never
contended throughout.

the final stages. PROUVER chasing leader throughout to no avail and settled for place spot, best of the rest. ESME inside run down the backstretch while
evenly along for third spot. NO TAPPIN OUT good position to half with a rush to quarter pole evened out. MISS GOODBAR no speed to far turn while
improving position in the stretch run. CALL ME TONI no speed to far turn and never threatened. AMAZON QUEEN antsy in gate, raced along evenly with no
late kick when needed. MALAWNIA raced between horses to the half and never contended. BABY GUNDIN shuffled back start, inside run to the half never
threatened. BUYBACK no speed to far turn and never in contention. LEUCADIA tracked leaders form off rail to the half with nothing left. POR UNA CABEZA
