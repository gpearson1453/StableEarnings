Footnotes
CANDY ON TOP bobbled away from the start but was off in good order, stalked the early pace from an outside position, advanced into the turn and pressed
the modest pace between rivals nearing the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into upper stretch, re-rallied and battled with SPARKLE SWEETLY
approaching the furlong marker, took command into the final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch to prove best. SPARKLE SWEETLY sent away from
the start, assumed command and set the pace approaching the half-mile pole, dictated terms while off of the rail into the turn, shook free of pressing rivals
into upper stretch, was re-engaged by CANDY ON TOP and battled that rival to the furlong marker, fought the winner into the final sixteenth, was outfinished
in deep stretch and held well in the end for place honors. ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) rated off of the early pace while never far back, improved position
four wide approaching the quarter marker, chased while widest into the stretch, could not muster the needed late response and was outkicked into the final
sixteenth, while holding safely for third. MAGIC WANDERER tracked the moderate pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and improved position
at the quarter pole, raced a bit in tight into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, could not sustain her run into the final sixteenth and flattened
out.

Footnotes
KERRYGOLD LADY rated nicely off of the decent early pace, was guided two wide and between rivals into the turn, stalked the pace to the quarter pole and
chased two wide into the stretch, responded to urging and took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, kicked to a clear lead in deep stretch and drew
away to prevail in the final stages. HARBOR'S ROSE sent to establish the early lead, set a contested pace into the turn, set the pace while off of the rail
heading to the quarter pole, drifted three wide and floated out DADDYS NINA into upper stretch, maintained a clear advantage while on the left lead
approaching the furlong grounds, was overtaken into the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for place honors. DADDYS NINA broke alertly, disputed
the decent early pace from the outside, pressed HARBOR'S ROSE into the turn and went three wide to the quarter marker, was floated four wide when that
rival drifted into upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker, weakened into the final sixteenth and held for third at the finish. AMANDA ROSE was forwardly
placed leaving the start, stalked the decent early pace three deep approaching the turn, maintained a three wide path into the turn and lost position at the
quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. SMOOVE AS SILK tracked the decent early
pace from the inside, was well placed into the turn and tracked the pace to the quarter marker, gave way into the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET was asked for speed away from the start and was prominent in the early running, shifted to the two path and stalked the decent pace
heading into the turn, went up and pressed MOB BOSS while two wide nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow
advantage at the furlong pole, shook free into the final sixteenth and drew away to prevail. MY DOMINATOR was away in good order, ceded the early lead
and tracked the decent pace to the half-mile pole, went three wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, loomed three wide into upper
stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, could not match strides with IMPERIAL HORNET into the final sixteenth and just held for second at the
finish. BLAZE OF DREAMS was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was off slowly, recovered and tracked the decent early pace from the
inside, improved position two to three wide along the turn then awaited racing room nearing the top of the stretch, angled out and gained ground at the
furlong pole, drifted out inside of the sixteenth marker, needed more into deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding clearly in the end for third.
TORPEDO AWAY tracked the decent early pace from the outside, was guided three to four wide into the turn and ran in pursuit to the quarter pole,
maintained a four wide path into the stretch and lacked a late response. IMPLICITLY hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, was allowed to settle
in the early running, raced three to four wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, was bothered
by BLAZE OF DREAMS inside of the sixteenth-marker when that rival drifted out, altered course into deep stretch and finished evenly. MOB BOSS showed
good early speed away from the start, assumed command and set a decent pace into the turn, was confronted by IMPERIAL HORNET into the bend and
was pressed by that rival to the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

GUIDE MY STEPS was unhurried away from the start and took back off of the decent early pace, improved position two wide into the turn then came in tight
approaching the quarter pole, was boxed in nearing the top of the stretch, dove to the inside and rallied at mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth
and drove clear in deep stretch. STYLISH DRESS forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace three deep approaching the half-mile
marker, improved position into the turn and chased three to four wide to the quarter pole, loomed into upper stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong
grounds, battled past mid-stretch then was crowded by BULLETPROOF TOO nearing the sixteenth-marker when that rival lugged out, was outkicked by the
winner in deep stretch and held for second at the finish. SMILINGATTHEMOON broke alertly, rated nicely off of the decent early pace and tracked from the
outside heading to the half-mile marker, was roused into the turn and gained ground four to five wide nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
closed willingly into the final sixteenth and missed for second, while earning the nod for third on the wire. BULLETPROOF TOO hustled away from the start,
assumed early command and sped to a clear lead heading to the half-mile marker, set the pace while off of the rail entering the turn, carved out moderate
fractions to the quarter marker then came under pressure into upper stretch, battled and held foes at bay to the furlong pole, lugged out into the final
sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. NICE ENCOUNTER crowded a bit by a neighboring rival leaving the start,
tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn then came in tight and waited for racing room at the quarter pole, maintained an
inside path into stretch, found room approaching the furlong grounds and was outkicked at mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and weakened.
JULIET'S KITCHEN prominent away from the start, raced close up to the decent pace heading into the turn, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter
marker and vied for the lead into upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. COURAGE OF BELLOCQ broke in at
the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide to the quarter pole and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
AUTISM PUZZLE was allowed to settle and track the pace to the outside of GRAMMY WINNER down the backstretch, was always traveling well,
responded when asked to challenge RAMATHORN for the lead approaching the quarter pole, hooked up with that foe in a duel down the stretch, pulled
away from the rest, gained the upper hand passing the sixteenth pole and won driving. RAMATHORN sprinted clear from the break, held sway through the
turn, met a challenge from AUTISM PUZZLE from the quarter pole, battled gamely to mid-stretch then weakened but was well clear of the next horse. ZEN
STATE broke outward and steadied slightly after the break, raced near the rear of the field in the early stages, came under a drive from the half-mile pole
but was not making up much ground on the rest through the turn, came into the stretch at the rear of the field but kept to task and found a good rhythm late
to out-finish the rest for the third spot. DIAMOND CONCERTO had to steady when ZEN STATE took his path at the break, spotted the field a few lengths
head start, was kept towards the outside in the three path, advanced while racing three wide through the turn, could not sustain his run into the final furlong
and flattened out late. HALF THROTTLE came away well from the inside, was briefly up with the tracking pair then dropped back before the turn, got
trapped behind horses while saving ground through the turn, lost position then came under a stiff drive up the rail in the stretch but did not respond.
GRAMMY WINNER came away well and chased the eventual winner to the turn, was passed by the rest of the field near the three furlong marker then had
little to offer in the stretch run.

Footnotes
NO SECRET broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn and set the pace while a bit off of the rail entering
the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the half-mile pole and was pressed into the second turn by LORD SHELDON, turned away that rival into the
stretch and kicked to a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drew away to prevail in the late stages. LORD
SHELDON forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, prompted the decent pace through the backstretch run,
advanced into the second turn and pressed NO SECRET while two to three wide approaching the quarter pole, was repelled by NO SECRET into the
stretch and chased that rival to the furlong marker, could not make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished the rest to secure place
honors. THREEBROTHERS prominent away from the start, was keen and a bit hard to place while close up entering the first turn, settled and stalked the
decent pace into the backstretch run, was well placed at the half-mile pole and saved ground into the second turn, raced within aim nearing the quarter
marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong pole, stayed on into the final sixteenth and held well in the end for third.
GRACEFUL MISCHIEF allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was content to track the decent pace approaching the
half-mile marker, was roused into the second turn, mounted a four to five wide bid at the quarter marker and continued that rally while widest into the stretch,
could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. PASS THE BATON hopped at the start and was off a step slowly,
recovered and stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, was well positioned into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace between rivals
nearing the half-mile pole, was guided three to four wide into the second turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. BID ON THE PRIZE was slow into stride away from the start, unhurried in the early stages and saved ground into the
backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, lost contact with the rest into the second turn and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
LA PRIMER ESTRELLA sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a moderate pace to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the turn by
LITTLE LILIANA and held that foe at bay into upper stretch, shook free nearing the furlong marker, kept to task and led into the final sixteenth, responded to
firm urging and dug in while all out in deep stretch, was challenged late by the oncoming runner-up and gamely lasted for the win at the finish. LITTLE
LILIANA prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace and kept close attendance to LA PRIMER ESTRELLA entering the turn, pressed the
moderate pace two wide approaching the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into upper stretch to LA PRIMER ESTRELLA and chased that rival to the
furlong grounds, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in the final strides and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. TIZ A TIGER
allowed to settle away from the start, maintained an outside path into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive,
closed willingly and was up in the final strides for third. ROSES R BLUE tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, gained ground three wide at the
quarter marker, battled while near the front approaching mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed on the wire for third. LILA AT THE
BEACH was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the moderate early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn then came in tight at the
quarter marker, was blocked into upper stretch and raced in traffic past the furlong grounds, remained stuck behind runners into the final sixteenth and could
not recover in deep stretch. SWEET LAYLA RAE tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, was guided two wide into the turn, came in tight
approaching the quarter marker and was boxed in into upper stretch, navigated traffic while within aim at the furlong marker, remained blocked into the final
sixteenth and could not recover in deep stretch.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION broke well then settled on the rail in hand behind the pace, was pushed to get closer after passing the half-mile pole then had to idle
while boxed in through the turn, dove to an open lane the rail as the field turned for home, finished strongly under intermittent urging and won the photo in a
three horse blanket finish. WARRENS CANDY MAN broke sharply and settled into a three wide tracking position, responded to strong handling while
making a sweeping move on the turn, continued to run on willingly under steady handling down the stretch and just missed in a driving finish. AWESOME
DUDE was a little slow into stride but shifted to the outside then made steady forward progress down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid through the
turn from the three furlong pole, continued to gain steadily down the middle of the track and just missed in a blanket finish at the wire. OH GREAT (IRE) was
bothered then bumped a couple of times by LOLO PANIOLO after the break, then steadied slightly when put in tight during the run down the backstretch,
dropped back to mid-pack, became boxed in through the turn, angled out into the clear approaching the eighth pole and surged when clear but was along
too late. SCHOCHOH broke well and bid for the lead from the start, was joined to the outside by HIGH PRESS, dueled that one through the turn and into the
stretch, got the better of the rival near the furlong grounds but tired late from earlier efforts and was unable to hold off a host of closers in the final stages.
HIGH PRESS bobbled at the start, then rushed up to join SCHOCHOH on the lead, dueled to the outside of that rival through the turn, took a short lead past
the three furlong marker, battled the resurgent foe to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong. LOLO PANIOLO broke outward at the start, bothering
OH GREAT (IRE) then bumped with that rival twice in the early running while becoming a bit rank, dropped back to be well behind the rest, chased through
the turn and into the stretch and was never a threat.
