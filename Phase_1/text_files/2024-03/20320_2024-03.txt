Footnotes
KING ADROCK sent to contest pace along the rail, took command and headed into the turn holding the rail, continued to lead into the lane, shook clear and
held gamely. CATBERNAY chased leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, took aim three wide in the lane and made mild
improvement while being a clear second best. ASANO'S BACK off slow and kept in hand in the rear of the field, continued to trail on the turn, prompted and
responded heading into the lane, kept under mild urging while rallying for a non threatening third place. FACTS MATTER chased leader in between rivals on
the backstretch, continued in between on the turn, kept on but failed to improve in the lane. ABADON stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch,
continued to save ground through the turn and into the lane, show some promise in upper stretch before failing to improve. BIG CREEK stalked pace three
wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and came up empty in the lane.
