Footnotes
FAINOR'S FILETS , well placed in the clear and off of a dueling trio heading towards the turn, edged closer under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths
then circled four wide into the lane, sustained under left then right handed asks, reeled in the leader with about seventy yards remaining, took control late
and edged away at the wire. KAPADOKYA vied three deep early on while under some rating, moved clear around the turn, opened up under a drive in mid
stretch, kept on with effort but just could not withstand the winner's charge. SUN STREAMING , bumped soon after the break, regrouped and was urged
along off the pace, swung out near mid stretch and closed steadily. FLOGE came in at the break and bumped with SUN STREAMING, lagged off the rail,
circled five wide into the lane then found her best stride too late. KAPATUDE vied between rivals early, stayed on towards the rail to force the issue around
the turn, kept on with effort as the leader got away in mid stretch then flattened out a bit late. UNIVERSAL DESIGN , off slow after bobbling, regrouped and
drafted in towards the rail nearing the turn, eased out bit for the drive, shifted back, edged up behind rivals leaving mid stretch, awaited room soon after then
finished up willingly between foes. SOPHIA'S ROSE was sent up to the inside of the leaders and vied, eased back a bit nearing the turn, angled out, came
back with a three wide run approaching the stretch, gave willing pursuit past mid stretch then faded. WAIT FOR TOMORROW was through early.

JOE THE JET hugged the inner rail, disputed the early pace, went clear entering the stretch, was challenged in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously to
prevail. UNDER THE OVERPASS , eased outside near the five eighths pole, advanced three wide leaving the turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and was
out finished. IMAGINIZED , in hand waiting for room along the inner rail around the turn, had nice opening along the rail through the stretch and retreated.
CORONATION TIME raced in the two path around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. ERIC'S GIFT broke slowly, traveled the
turn four wide and was no factor. PENTATONIC disputed the early pace outside the winner and faltered in upper stretch. DISCO PREACHER broke slowly,
was a forward factor three wide on the turn and faltered in upper stretch. HUNDRED PROOF raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung very wide in
upper stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
MATTITUDE moved up and engaged BANDITS WARRIOR from her outside leaving the five eighths, poked a head in front nearing the turn, shook clear of
mid turn, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. HONOR THE TRUTH , under a ride from the start, found herself far back
after a quarter mile, saved ground past the five sixteenths, came out for the drive, gathered steam in mid stretch, split rivals inside the sixteenth pole and
finished strong. SISTER SUPREAM , three deep early, shifted out five wide for the drive, moved up inside the furlong grounds, flattened out late but
managed to save the show. GOLDEN CAN rated forwardly while saving ground, saw the leaders get away past the three eighths, came out to be three wide
in upper stretch, advanced past the furlong grounds, failed to sustain late and faded. BANDITS WARRIOR sped to the early lead and secured the inside,
was headed near the half mile, stayed on to force the issue to upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. A GIRL NAMED JAC , between foes early,
dropped back around the turn, angled out and came up empty.

FORMAL ORDER saved ground around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up at the finish. CLUBMAN stalked the pace,
advanced in the two path to take the lead leaving the turn and gave way grudgingly. ROCKY DICE , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch,
remained inside horses there after and passed tired ones. TATE bumped with LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE at the start causing his rider to lose her irons, which
she never recovered. TATE then drifted seven wide turning for home and passed tired rivals. BAHAMA CHANNEL circled the turn, was five deep entering
the stretch and failed to sustain the move. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE , bumped at the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn and weakened. HELMS DEEP
sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and gave way. ANTIPOISON , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, faltered.

CYNERGY'S ELECTRA tracked outside rivals, moved up and bid three deep leaving the far turn, vied under rating past the five sixteenths, responded and
took over entering the lane, opened up under a strong hand ride in mid stretch, continued under hand urging past the sixteenth pole then was geared down
late. LETITGOTOVOICEMAIL edged up three deep past the three eighths and stalked the embattled leaders, shifted out five wide for the drive, churned on
and nabbed the place through the final yards. FIVECOMMATWO rated forwardly early while saving ground, came under a ride pursuing the dueling trio past
the five sixteenths, got through along the rail in upper stretch but flattened out very late. CANDY ARCADE , three wide prompting the early pace, bid
between foes near the three eighths, battled on between runners to the head of the lane, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded. GLASS STAR sped
clear early and set the pace just off the inside, was joined by rivals to her outside leaving the far turn, battled into the lane, drifted out while chasing past mid
stretch and weakened. GOOD STORY eased out while in range into the turn, chased two wide between runners mid turn, could not quicken with the leaders
in upper stretch and faded. OUT OF LUCK , brushed at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground and lacked a rally. FORGOTTEN GIFT broke a
step slow and towards the inside brushing OUT OF LUCK, steadied soon after, chased outside a rival mid turn, swung well wide for the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
HAY CHIEF lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, moved to the two path in mid stretch in order to pass SUPREME LAW,
was taken back to the inner rail near the sixteenth pole then closed determinedly to get up at the finish. TOPS THE CHART set a pressured pace in the two
path around the turn, gained a clear lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly to just miss. JEOPARDY JAMES raced along the inner rail on the turn,
eased out approaching the stretch, swung to the four path entering the lane and rallied. BRILLIANT ICE advanced three deep leaving the turn, had aim on
the lead in upper stretch and tired late. ARMANDO R , outrun to the stretch, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. SUPREME
LAW , a forward factor along the inner rail, prompted the pace to mid stretch and weakened. NORTH HIGHLAND , a forward factor along the inner rail on
the turn, drifted out leaving the bend and gave way. IT'S VIPER was outrun. UP AGAINST IT , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in
upper stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE sped to command, set a pressured pace towards the inside, clung to the advantage past mid stretch, drifted out under left handed
asks in deep stretch and grimly prevailed. FREEZE THE FIRE prompted the pace outside the winner, applied more pressure into the lane, dueled past the
furlong grounds, wandered outward from left handed encouragement inside the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but just could not get past. GREAT
HEAVENS , inside rivals nearing the half, took closer order of the embattled leaders when angling out past the five sixteenths, shifted out with pursuit
through the lane but only slowly gained. HELDISH edged up three deep heading to the half and stalked the top pair, was under pressure four wide into the
lane, shifted in some but failed to muster up a serious response. MIDNIGHT RENEGADE dropped off the early pace, raced three wide mid turn, angled five
wide for the drive and offered a belated response. HEMP , between runners early, shifted in with pursuit around the turn and faded. PORCH SWING , off the
pace while saving ground, eased out for the drive and lacked a bid. MOSLER TIME , off last when breaking awkwardly, was outrun.

PATTY CAKES broke slowly, raced along the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out to two path entering the stretch, gained the lead inside JUMP INTO
THE FIRE approaching the eighth pole then drew away under urging. JUMP INTO THE FIRE chased the pace, gained a two wide lead leaving the turn,
drifted out in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. GOLD MEDAL ANNA bore out leaving the starting gate, lacked speed in the two path around the
turn, swung to the six path near the eighth pole and rallied late. CONTINENTALCONGRES , forced out by GOLD MEDAL ANNA leaving the starting gate,
advanced outside horses to loom in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn
and was never a factor. KNICKERSINATWIST raced in the two path on the turn, swung four wide turning for home and gave way. CHICKIENESS showed
speed along the inner rail, lost the lead turning for home and steadily retreated through the stretch. DATE NIGHT KISSES , well off the inner rail down the
backstretch, dropped back entering the stretch.

Footnotes
STOP THE CAP settled off the contested pace while removed from the inside, circled five wide with momentum into the lane, leveled off under strong
handling in mid stretch, took command outside LINDALOVESGOLD heading to the sixteenth marker and drew clear. HAINT BLUE , off the pace while
saving some ground, was under a ride mid turn, eased out soon into the stretch, advanced between runners near the sixteenth marker and churned on to
nab the place inside of BLACK ICE. BLACK ICE rated three wide spying the dueling leaders, moved up and took on LINDALOVESGOLD approaching the
stretch, failed to quicken with that one soon into the lane, stayed on with willing pursuit past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final yards.
LINDALOVESGOLD , away alertly, disputed the early pace outside PEPPERMINT CLASS, got the better of that one mid turn then handled an outside bid
from BLACK ICE nearing the lane, kicked away after being set down, remained clear past mid stretch, could not withstand the winner's charge soon after
then weakened. ESSAOUIRA broke outward, corrected and moved up towards the inside, was under a hearty ride pursuing past the three eighths to little
avail, angled out and gave way. PEPPERMINT CLASS was sent up to the inside of a rival leaving the chute and contested the pace, remained a presence
to upper stretch then weakened.
