OUTSIDE THE LAW attended the early pace from inside, vied for the lead into and on the turn, took charge in upper stretch, was clear by mid-stretch under
urging and extended the margin. BEYOND AWESOME dueled outside the eventual winner going about three wide into upper stretch, was no match for that
one but clearly second best. GRACIE'S A TIGER raced outside at the rear going three wide on the turn, was not a threat. COCKTAIL SLIPPERS broke a
step slowly, chased in behind racing off the rail, dropped back on the turn, failed to rally.

LIGHTED VESSEL stalked from outside, moved five wide to challenge making a bid at the quarter pole, forged clear in the stretch, reportedly lost the whip
late. ICE STORM switched out and advanced two to three wide into and on the turn, came out five to seven wide in upper stretch, finished with interest to be
clearly second best. MAESTOSO quickly moved to the lead, set the pace from off the rail about four wide with outside pressure, was overtaken past the
quarter pole and weakened gradually through the lane. CASH'S CAT chased from inside, lacked the needed late kick. BARON'S SONG moved out from
four to six wide on the turn, came out further in the stretch, needed more. RANGER JOE pressed briefly, soon dropped back heading into the turn, lacked
the needed response. LITTLE AXE SOUL broke a step slowly, lost the path at the start, was outpaced.

Footnotes
U CAN DO U had the very early lead then stalked just off the new leader while kept quite wide, moved closer heading into the turn still four to five deep, bid
at the five-sixteenths, had a narrow lead while drifting seven wide into upper stretch, moved clear, held sway. SURROUNDEDBYANGELS bobbled slightly
at the break, stalked from outside going five to six wide on the turn, was floated eight wide into upper stretch racing just off the flank of the eventual winner,
was no match for that one but second best. CAUTION CARDINAL broke a step slowly and was outpaced early, swung nine wide into the stretch, was
gaining late. TRACK ROBBER moved forward inside to take the lead after the opening furlong, dictated terms into the turn, came out a bit leaving that bend,
continued just in behind the new leader till late then faltered. DON JUAN BUBBA chased from mid-pack outside five to six wide on the turn, floated nine
wide for the drive, kept on evenly. SARAH'S BIG BANG chased from in behind mid-pack racing three to five wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch.
ARIZONA DAVIN shifted in racing about three wide on the turn and off the pace, ran on mildly. KAE GAE broke a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, made an
early advance three to four wide between foes, evened out in the stretch. BIG MOONIE broke a bit awkwardly, was toward the rear off the rail and never
near enough to threaten. CRYPTO CONSPIRACY showed brief speed vying for the very early lead but outsprinted, continued to chase on the turn racing
just off the rail, faltered and faded in the stretch. ARIZONA SUMMER shifted in, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BONITA DIXIE was forwardly-positioned in pursuit of the leader from between runners early then continuing outside four to five wide, bid while lugging out
coming to the furlong marker, forged clear. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE settled at the back, was forced wide leaving the turn fanning seven deep into upper
stretch and finished with late interest. OUT OF STARS settled off the pace, went about four to five wide through much of the turn, kept on in the stretch.
JESSICA BLAH BLAH moved clear to set the pace from off the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, faltered and faded. HAUGHTY KITTY chased from
between runners, went three to four wide, dropped back, failed to rally. FLATTER ME ZEN chased from inside, lacked the needed late kick. CAT ON THE
RUN chased from near inside but off the rail and went evenly making no bid. OLD WEST chased from outside about five to six wide early, steadily dropped
back on the turn while shifting in, eased through the stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
BIG SCOTT DADDY was prominent early racing up close stalking from outside, bid four wide coming to the quarter pole, was clear by the top of the stretch,
widened. CATS GOTTA CHANCE settled off the pace and in about the three path into the turn, angled eight wide at the top of the stretch, gained late
outside to secure the place while no threat to the winner. HONKY TONK HERO chased early, dropped back two to three wide, angled seven wide at the top
of the stretch and showed good late effort. LIL MIRACLE MAN chased from inside, encouraged past the five-sixteenths and within striking distance coming
to the top of the stretch, flattened out. RHODIUM RUNNER went four then five wide on the turn not too far off the leaders and continued evnely. UPPER
ROOM was caught outside a runner five to six deep on the turn into upper stretch and ran evenly. BRICKHOUSE saved ground to no avail while racing
one-paced. TAINO HOUSE moved forward between runners to a clear lead, set the pace from off the rail, faltered and faded. TRACK BOUND chased from
off the inside and was not a threat. ITS BIG fanned ten wide into the stretch and was not a threat. CHAOKOON chased to the turn, dropped back three to
four wide on that bend, came up empty.

Footnotes
EAST RAND stalked from between runners early while kept wide about three to five deep, began to move approaching the quarter pole five wide, took
charge about mid-stretch and forged clear late. FRISCO KID had the early lead shifting in to the two path entering the first turn, was soon overtaken and
attended pressing from inside, regained control about the seven-sixteenths, was in charge turning for home, overtaken about mid-stretch and outkicked.
BROOKYS TAPIT settled mid-pack near but off the rail, shifted six wide turning into upper stretch, finished with mild late energy. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL
stalked from outside the second flight about four to six wide in the early going, fanned seven deep turning for home, needed more. PARTYOFSIXTEEN
settled outside at the back, fanned eight deep into upper stretch, showed mild late interest. UPO saved ground but was not a threat. EMPEROR'S CHOICE
moved forward outside shifting in three deep on the first turn, took a narrow lead and forced the pace up the backstretch, faded. MARKSMAN ON TARGET
tracked from inside the second flight, failed to rally. PERFECT COME BACK raced mostly three to five wide off the pace and failed to rally. BEROLIJEAN
(FR) broke just a step slowly, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
LETTHERAINSETTLEIT stalked from outside, advanced on the far turn five wide making a bid past the five-sixteenths and taking the lead, drew away in the
stretch. FALSELY ACCUSED tracked from inside, saved ground ground, drifted out the final sixteenth, was no match but second best. RACE HOME settled
outside off the leaders, shifted seven wide turning for home, kept on but needed more. BIGFOOT CITY was urged clear, set the pace from off the rail,
weakened. GRAY MAGICIAN stalked from off the inside, shifted six wide into the stretch, needed more. FLY NIGHTLY raced outside at the rear mostly in
the four to five paths through both turns, failed to threaten. MY MAN BIGGIE failed to threaten while racing near the inside.

Footnotes
IF YOU WANT IT settled off the pace near the inside, angled out about six deep at the top of the stretch brushing a rival, surged late to prevail. MIDNIGHT
FROST pressed early then took the lead forcing the issue two to three wide, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked. LADY LANA had the early lead
inside just off the rail then ceded that content to track, came out in the stretch, kept on. FLIPLIT settled at the back near the inside, improved position. SHES
GOT THE POWER was bumped at the break, settled outside at the back, came out a bit further seeking room at the top of the stretch then altered back
inwards, ran on. MERINO WOOL shifted in early, tracked in behind, was close two to three wide on the far turn and asked for more at the quarter pole,
faded. CRIMINAL RECORD was fractious in the gate, bumped a rival at the start, gained forward position stalking about three to four wide faded in the
stretch. FOLK HERO switched out, raced four to six wide on the turns, tired.
