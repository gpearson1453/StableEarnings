Footnotes
MAHINA unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside at the back, ran into traffic at the five-sixteenths pole and tipped two wide and went between rivals,
cut back inside leaving the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed well under the right hand and overhauled the runner-up in deep stretch. SPRING
MAGIC took control early along the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, roused past the five-sixteenths pole, remained unchallenged with a furlong left
to run, confronted by MAHINA at the sixteenth pole, yielded to the winner and saved second. IN YOUR FACE settled outside a rival at the back, had to
pause behind rivals at the five-sixteenths pole before moving out to the three path, steadied trying to avoid a fallen rider into the stretch, steered out in the
lane and finished well. DENDERA had to take up behind GRAZED MY HEART early, climbed two wide then along the inside on the first turn, chased two
wide on the second bend, finished well through the drive but got edged for third. GRAZED MY HEART broke well then took a stalking position in the two
path, moved inside early on the far turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, chased within striking distance into the final furlong but could not find the
needed late kick. CONTROL FUNCTION rated along the inside, dropped back under asking on the far turn and faded in the lane. QUARIA THUNDER
chased three then two wide around the first turn, traveled three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took a bad step at the quarter pole, took up and tried to alter
to avoid fallen rider into the stretch, came to a stop at the top of the lane and walked off. SHE'S A JOKER tracked in the two path, got floated to the three
path then slipped and fell at the quarter pole and walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT BETWEEN GRAZED MY
HEART AND SHE'S A JOKER AT THE QUARTER POLE AND RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SUGAR FISH stalked the leaders from outside, bid four then three deep on the turn, took over approaching the stretch, kicked clear at the top of the lane
and powered away under urging. PETITE ANGE vied for command inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, could not kick on with
SUGAR FISH entering the lane and stayed on to best the rest. UR IN TROUBLE was up close inside the leaders early then chased leaving the backstretch,
saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the stretch and gained third. PACE LANE bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, went up to fight for the
lead between rivals, battled head to head with rivals on both sides through the turn, then folded in the stretch. QUEEN GIRVIN vied three deep up the
backstretch and onto the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders three wide with a quarter mile remaining and tired in the lane. MISS ALLURE broke slow
and bumped with inner rival, began to climb shortly after chasing at the back then moved in behind the leaders quickly, went two wide into the turn, started
to weaken under urging around the bend, moved to the inside approaching the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
DISCO BALL bobbled at the start, pressed the pace from between rivals then dueled up the backstretch, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, put
away inner rival midway around the bend and held well under a drive through the lane. TOP GUN TOMMY pressed the pace three deep to the turn, chased
three then two wide around the bend, chased after the winner willingly through the lane but had to settle for second best. THE LITTLE H MAN lagged behind
early well off the rail, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the inside then came back out leaving the bend and was along for the show.
MASTERMIND attended the pace four deep up the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide on the turn and came up empty in the lane. GOOD VIBES
ONLY set the pace under pressure from outer rivals then dueled at the half-mile pole, lost command early on the turn, lost touch with the winner midway
around the bend and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) off slow to begin, trailed on the inside down the hill, angled out approaching the dirt crossing, rallied widest in the lane and
proved best in the last sixteenth. SPEED LANE off a bit slow to start, stalked in-hand behind the leaders, rounded the bend two to three wide, tipped four
wide across the dirt, challenged the leader with a furlong remaining but got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. BENEDICT CANYON was hard to load
prior to the start, vied three deep down the hill, inched ahead in upper stretch, lost command past the eighth pole and flattened to third. CARMEN MIRANDA
vied between rivals down the hill and fought to upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. PRINCESS BETTINA battled for the lead inside a pair
of rivals, yielded in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
EIGHT CLAP chased the top pair under coaxing up the backstretch, rounded the bend four then three wide, challenged from outside entering the lane, put a
head in front at the eight pole, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and held safely. PETESOLDFASHIONED chased under coaxing two wide leaving the
backstretch, moved to the rail on the turn, angled out in the lane and closed well but ran out of time. AUTISM PUZZLE chased outside a rival early, round
the bend two to three wide and finished evenly in the final furlong. DES DOIGTS dueled from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, put away inner rival
leaving the turn but was immediately confronted by the winner after, lost command at the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages.
LETTHELIQUORTALK dueled inside DES DOIGTS up the backstretch and around the turn, could not keep up approaching the stretch and gave way in the
lane. SALSATION broke well but lacked early speed and dropped far back, saved ground through the turn and was never a factor.

PROMISSIO bobbled leaving the gate, settled three deep early, roused three then two wide on the far turn, drew alongside the runner-up in midstretch and
drove past. WHEN HEROES FLY stalked three then two wide early, went three deep into the far turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared into the
stretch, challenged by PROMISSIO approaching the sixteenth pole and could not fend off that rival. BOUND TO SUCCEED broke well, stalked in the two
path then along the rail, tipped out in upper stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC traveled two wide off the pace early,
went outside a rival on the backstretch, lacked room behind SINFUL KING and bumped with PROMISSIO past the three-eighths pole, chased three then
two wide around the bend and kept on for a minor award. MONGOLIAN MAX raced in mid-pack along the rail then got put in tight late on the first turn, got
put in tight again earl on the far turn then got shuffled back, angled to the inside around that bend, fought on through the lane but could not threaten.
CITADINO dueled for the lead from inside, cleared briefly at the three-eighths pole but was soon challenged by WHEN HEROES FLY shortly after,
relinquished the lead to that rival, chased into the stretch and weakened. WRONG DIRECTION was off a bit slow, tucked inside at the back, tipped four
wide on the far turn and was never a factor. SINFUL KING dueled from outside early, drifted out a bit on the first turn, continued to fight up the backstretch,
dropped back on the far turn and gave way.

TIZZY TWISTER stalked three deep early, asked three then two wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drew off in the final furlong. SAND TO
SEA off alertly, cleared the field and moved inside, took pressure from rivals on the far turn, inched clear again when roused and put to right handed urging
leaving the bend, challenged again in upper stretch, relinquished the lead to TIZZY TWISTER and churned on to hold second. ABHITA stalked four deep
into the first turn then shifted to the three path leaving the bend, moved inside on the backstretch, tipped three wide around the far turn while chasing in
range but flattened out in the late stages. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE raced up close outside the pacesetter, applied pressure at the three-eighths pole, could
not keep up around the far turn and weakened down the lane. SWEET HELLO broke a step slow, chased behind a rival in the four path approaching the first
turn then shifted five wide around that rival, moved into range still widest up the backstretch, rounded the far turn four wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
FORMIDABLE MAN was closest in pursuit from the two path through the early stages, bid from outside approaching the five-sixteenths pole, took over with
a quarter mile remaining, put away inner rival midstretch and drew away late. MOONLIT SONATA traveled two wide outside a rival early, angled four wide
on the far turn, moved out further in the lane and rallied to gain second. EL REY REY moved inside while chasing off the pace then began to pull early,
continued to tug the rider along on the backstretch, had to pause when running up on heels at the three-eighths pole which cost him some ground, hugged
the rail through the far turn, tipped out at the eighth pole, finished willingly between runners and got up for third. BETTER THAN GOLD showed good early
speed to establish the front, set the pace along the rail to the far turn, confronted by FORMIDABLE MAN near the five-sixteenths pole, lost command at the
quarter pole, fought on to midstretch, then faltered in the late stages and got edged for second and third. UNCLE TRULY settled outside a rival out of range,
moved into striking distance three deep on the backstretch, bid three wide at the quarter pole, fought to the eighth pole then flattened in the late.
RASTAMAN VIBE tracked the speed from inside, tipped two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, chased between through the lane and could not summon the
needed late kick. BANDWAGON settled along the inside, chased between rivals on the backstretch, ridden along on the far turn, spun three wide into the
lane and could not rally. GOLD FOOT broke a step slow, raced near the back on the inside then moved into the two path, advanced four deep leaving the
backstretch, chased three then four deep on the far turn and weakened down the lane. MIGHTY KAI broke a step slow, trailed along the inside early,
remained at the back while driven two wide into the stretch and could not make an impact.
