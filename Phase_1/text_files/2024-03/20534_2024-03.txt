Footnotes
AA BURNING OASIS was nicely rated while four wide, then angled inward to bid on the turn, then dueled with an inner rival in the early stretch, then kicked
clear under a strong drive to prevail in the end. WMA MADJIC SLIPPERS pressed the pace into the turn while two wide, continued to bid between rivals,
was in tight then steadied on the turn, shifted out to the three path and regained stride in the early stretch and was improving in the end. AA HOT ASSETS
was bumped at the start, then moved up eagerly while splitting rivals to bid from the inside on the turn, met with an outer rival in the early stretch to duel
gamely then was out kicked and was best for the show prize. WMA WILD AND SWEET was unhurried early, then urged eagerly on the turn and came up
flat in the stretch. WMA PLAYTIME drifted out at the start and bumped rival, then raced along the inside at the back and showed little. WMA ORION led the
way from the gate briefly then stopped. WMA NASH RAMBLER bid for the lead while three wide, took command into the turn, then continued to drift out
while giving way in the end.

Footnotes
RUMPUS stalked the pace while two wide under a steady drive, then edge clear in the late stretch and held on well to succeed in the end. TAY TAY'S
BABY chased the pace from the inside, then bid leaving the turn to surge down the lane while splitting rivals and continued to close willingly and tied for the
place prize in the end. SWANAGE chased the pace while three wide, then rallied leaving the bend and closed well and was up for the place prize in the end.
A ROZE AND WINE showed the way from the inside into the turn, was in a long drive in the early stretch then was out finished by outer rivals in the end. MY
BABYS GONE tailed behind the field early, then bid leaving the turn while drifting out four to five wide but it was too little too late. WA WA WEE WA raced in
the middle of the field, then bid briefly from the two path on the turn before giving way in the stretch. STAN'S GOLDEN PATH stalked the pace from the
inside under a hard drive, then flattened out in the late stretch.

EAST COAST COWGIRL tracked the leader while two wide under steady drive, then dug in gamely in the late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail.
ANNA UP led the way from the inside, cleared the turn, continued to hold command down the late stretch under a gamely rally then was caught at the wire.
CATHERINE BLAZE saved ground in the early furlongs, then found the best stride in the late stretch and was closing well in the end and was up for the
show prize. MISCHIEF ANGEL chased the pace from the inside, menaced leaving the turn and could not catch leader in the early stretch, then gave way in
the end. PURRFECT MOON raced at the back of the pack, then angled out six wide leaving the turn to rally mildly in the stretch but it was not enough in the
end. CAPETOWN CANDY was allowed to settle while three wide, bid leaving the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. JUST ADORABLE was unhurried
early, was allowed to settle in the two path, then bid leaving the turn and made no impact in the end. SUMMEROSA stalked the pace while two wide while in
a hard drive, was used up on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

CASINO QUEEN bid from the inside to lead the way into the turn, then drew clear in the late stretch and held sway to prove best in the end. SUMMER
LIGHTNING was bumped at the start, then stalked the pace while three wide, rallied leaving the turn to gain second position in the early stretch, lacked the
winning bid and held onto the place prize in the end. BECKY'S TATTOO broke outwardly and bumped rival, then pursued the pace from the inside, came
out three wide leaving the bend and closed willingly down the lane and just missed the place prize in the end. MRS. KRINKLES was bumped at the start,
then settled along the inside, made a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty. GET OUT TONIGHT pressed the leader into the turn under a strong
drive then lacked rallying in the stretch.

the far turn to take command in the early stretch, maintained a gamely bid then was caught at the wire and was second best. CREDIT RATING was nicely
rate while four wide and outside of rivals in the early furlong, then inched up on the far turn to menace in the early stretch, lugged in at the eighth pole,
disrupting rival then kept on down the lane. KING ARTHUR RIDGE saved ground in the early furlongs while racing while two wide, then rallied on the far
turn, came out four wide continued to bid down the stretch but it was not enough in the end. MORO MAFIA stalked the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, menaced in the early stretch, was in tight, then steadied at the eighth pole and continued to bid
mildly down the lane. SPARRA led the way from the inside to set the pace down the backstretch, was confronted by an outer foe on the far turn to spar
briefly then gave way heading into the home stretch. INFINITE MORO was allowed to settle along the inside and was no threat. SILVER AND GOLD raced
at the back of the pack early, then bid while four wide on the far turn and was no menace. TEXAS CLUBMAN stalked the pace from the inside in the early
stages then faded on the far turn and lacked rallying in the home stretch. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference in the home stretch,
