and prevailed. TEQUILA TIME set a clear early pace, went three wide into the turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed. STORMIN
FAST tracked the early pace, raced five wide and finished evenly late. RIO CUTIE was unhurried early, raced three wide and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
E BAR SCOUT set a pressured pace, raced three wide through the turn, opened up and was best today. HOLOTTALUTE tracked the early pace, raced six
wide through the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. LIL MISS CASSIE pressed the early pace from between rivals and gave way. RESTLESS
MOVER was allowed to settle early from off the rail and weakened late. RUNNING FOR GRACE was outrun early, raced six wide through the turn angled
out and offered no late rally. I GET STORMED raced in mid pack early, went five wide and flattened out. STORMY DAME was allowed to settle early, raced
seven wide, drifted in and was tired late. WILEO PROCEED was reserved early from the inside angled out and was empty. OUR ISLAND GIRL was void of
any early speed, raced eight wide out of the turn and never fired.
