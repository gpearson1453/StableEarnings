and responded gamely to get up at the wire. FACTS MATTER bumped by outside rival at the start, chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch,
continued two wide on the turn, launched bid four wide into the lane and rallied well, but outclosed by inside rival. BEING BLESSED away cleanly, chased
pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, launched bid slightly off the rail, gamely kept on and earned third.
CATBERNAY away best, sent clear on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered lane in the lead, dug in and had a narrow advantage passing
the sixteenth, succumbed late in a game try. RUNAWAY WYWY away well, stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn,
eased out five wide into the stretch, asked and failed to improve and finished evenly. SIR LAUGHALOT broke out three paths at the start, stalked pace three
