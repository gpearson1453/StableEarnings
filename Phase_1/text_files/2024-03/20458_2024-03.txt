settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the lane.
RITZ ON BROADWAY raced in the three path around the first bend, settled off the ace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
still in the three path and made no bid. QUEEN AIKO raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far
