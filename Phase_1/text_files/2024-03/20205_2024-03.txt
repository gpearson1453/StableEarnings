SNAPPIN BUTTONS broke a beat slow, chased three wide advancing on the leader through the latter portion of the turn to take command swinging four
then three wide into upper stretch, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. TROUBLED LUCK chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. LA DECENTE
chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, improved position to
secure the show honors. WAR TERMINATRIX chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
tired. MAMBAGIGI led briefly early on then chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE coaxed from the gate, established the front after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under

Footnotes
HONORARY DEGREE brushed with a foe at the start, was taken in hand then rated early before settling off the pace, shifted from three to four wide early
on the turn, was roused behind the leading trio, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead approaching the sixteenth-pole and proved best
under good handling. STRIKING SPEED brushed with a rival at the start, moved up then tracked the pace on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was
asked near the five-sixteenths, made a bid into upper stretch, gained the lead around the three-sixteenths, led until outside the sixteenth-pole then was
overtaken while able to get the place. SWIFT TAP was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid with a half-mile to run,
vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong,
dropped back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the show. HEIR PORT angled in while going to the front, showed the way down
the backstretch, was challenged near the half-mile pole, vied inside under urging on the turn, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole, dropped back
into the final furlong and tired. JOKER BOY dropped well behind while ridden along, went around the turn in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
UPSIDE POTENTIAL showed the way early on just off the inside under a light hold, had VENGE advance outside and was displaced from the front just
inside half a mile to run, chased just off the inside through the turn advancing on the leader through the latter portion of the turn and swung four wide into
upper stretch, took back the front just inside the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive to prevail. VENGE chased three to four wide early on down the
backstretch before advancing on the leader to seize command just inside the half mile pole, cleared that rival and tucked to the inside nearing three furlongs
to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch under challenge to the outside, yielded the front just inside the
three-sixteenths, ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. LE BAR bobbled at the break, came under coaxing and chased three wide
down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered
up a mild bid. BADGE OF WAR stumbled at the start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. CLASSIC KINGDOM chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and tired. KING OF FRANCE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide
into upper stretch and tired. GOLD 'N' SCARLET showed brief speed along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in retreat, swung four wide

NATURAL HARBOR was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the four path on the
turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths pole, responded well under heavy pressure in the stretch and held gamely. BORLETTI (IRE) was taken in
hand when the pacesetter crossed in front early then came under coaxing, went three wide under strong urging on the turn, was driven five wide into the
stretch, moved in while chasing outside the furlong marker, gained to make a bid inside of two foes outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with those rivals to the
finish and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL had his head-turned at the start and was off slow, spotted the front
several lengths, climbed some while angling out near the five-eighths pole, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid
outside the sixteenth-pole, battled outside of the top two to the finish and just missed while clear for the show. CAPITAL CONQUEST was urged along off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed response. UNCLE GEORGE broke out then was corrected
by the rider, moved in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to his inside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in
upper stretch and tired. KANT BEAT THE ROCK was ridden along towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to rally. RETURN THE
RING was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, drew even late on the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn and
capitulated.

a foe, shook away from that rival in the two path on the far turn, responded well when roused into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop near the
furlong marker and held under strong urging. MACALLAN raced between foes in the two path through the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along
between foes late on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the final turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and finished with good courage for the
place. SYSTEMIC CHANGE went four wide on the first turn, was coaxed along early on the backstretch, settled on the outside, chased four wide on the far
turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was outfinished then lost the place while clear for the show. BEYOND BEST was hustled from the
gate, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside under urging, chased in the three path on the far turn and tired. CENTAVO brushed
with a rival at the start, was taken up when the rider fell back in the saddle shortly thereafter, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was
roused while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, rallied outside to loom a threat into upper stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and came
up empty. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE broke out then brushed with a rival, pulled while placed under a vigorous hold early, raced inside on the first turn, settled
on the backstretch, was roused near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KUCHAR moved out into the first turn, traveled around that bend in the four path, settled just off the pace, chased three to four wide on the far turn, gained
to make a bid in upper stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging.
LEADING CONTENDER went around the opening turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the far turn, chased
into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. ROCCO STRONG raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace, made a
bid near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two to three path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while just able to get
the show. NO BURN went to the front, saved ground on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was guided with extra left-rein pressure near
the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path while asked on the far turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and weakened. I AM THE LAW was hustled
from the gate, went five wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three then two wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. ALTERNATE REALITY dropped from the six path to the three path on the first turn, settled near the back, moved from the two path to
the four path on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. DEE JAY broke a step slow, went six then five wide on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the four to five path on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and tired. MYSTIC NIGHT dropped back
between horses after the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, lagged at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the far turn and was pulled up
then walked off.
