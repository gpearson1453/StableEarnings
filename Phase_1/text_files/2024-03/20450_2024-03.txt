Footnotes
ACE NINE NINE assumed the early lead, moved to the inner rail on the first turn, remained along the rail and pulled away through the stretch under a hand
ride. CLUBMAN , a forward factor along the inner rail on both turns, eased out approaching the stretch and was best of the others. MUSICAL HEART , three
wide both turns, chased the winner and weakened through the stretch. FORMAL ORDER , never a factor, fell back through the stretch. GALATIANS chased
the winner racing in the two path inside horses for six furlongs then faltered. CAVALRY COMMAND hoped at the break, was rank approaching the first turn,
angled out, circled both turns four deep and dropped back in the stretch.

Footnotes
STEELE MONEY broke outward bumping WORKIN ON A DREAM then came back in and bounced around with LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE, regrouped and
settled off of a contested early pace while saving some ground, edged up in the two path heading to the turn, worked between foes mid turn the bid between
runners approaching the stretch, emerged in a duel to the inside of WORKIN ON A DREAM leaving the quarter pole, battled on near even terms as those
two separated from the field, took control under left handed asks inside the sixteenth marker then edged away while drifting out. WORKIN ON A DREAM ,
bumped with the winner leaving the gate, rated back off the leaders early on while well off the inside, progressed five deep past the five eighths, dropped in
edged closer near the three eighths, bid three deep to be on near even terms into the stretch, sparred outside the winner from the quarter pole to deep
stretch then gave way grudgingly while floated out a bit. EVENT PARTY , away in good order and flashed some speed, was under a ride leaving the chute
pursuing the dueling leaders, remained under a hearty ride around the turn, edged up a bit three wide nearing the stretch and churned on without really
threatening. HAPPY UNION settled well back early on and saved some ground, gathered some momentum mid turn, swung six wide for the drive and
mustered up a mild rally. GRAND MANNER dueled two wide outside KABOB through the backstretch and into the turn, shook clear mid turn, was engaged
by the top pair nearing the lane, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. KABOD was sent up to the inside of rivals leaving the chute and joined
GRAND MANNER for the lead, battled inside that one to the half mile marker, failed to quicken past the three eighths, faded then was angled out in the
drive. FOOD FOODIE settled off the pace while saving ground, remained inside past mid stretch, eased out and came up empty. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE ,
four wide between runners chasing the early leaders, steadied when in tight leaving the far turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
CAROLO RAPIDO stalked the pace while hugging the inner rail for six furlongs, moved to the two path approaching the stretch, took the lead outside
INTREPID'S LEGACY near the sixteenth pole then drew clear. INTREPID'S LEGACY , right to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail entering the first
turn, rated nicely on the lead, was set down in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. NO FOOLIN MO , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace outside
horses down the backstretch, moved up three wide on the far turn, chased the pace to upper stretch and gave way. WORK HARD , slow start, three wide
both turns, drifted in in upper stretch, was brushed by VILALUZ in mid stretch and gave way along the rail. VILALUZ , no factor, swung four wide at the head
of the stretch and brushed WORK HARD when lugging in near the eighth pole. WITHOUT PRETENCE chased the pace outside INTREPID'S LEGACY and
gave way on the far turn. THIELEN broke sluggishly then trailed.

CALL ANOTHER PLAY , a bit keen behind the leaders and steadied around the first turn, regrouped and rated while saving ground, gained under coaxing
leaving the far turn, eased out and moved up past the five sixteenths, engaged PRINCESS MAYFAIR four wide from the outside in upper stretch, forged
clear under strong handling in mid stretch, eagerly widened from there and was geared down in the final yards. PRINCESS MAYFAIR took over at once
despite a brush, handled some outside pressure around the first turn and into the backstretch, shook clear and set a rated pace off the inside, widened a bit
into the far turn, was called upon three wide when taken on into the stretch, could not keep up with the winner in mid stretch but kept on willingly enough the
hold down the place. I'M A CUTIE PIE broke a step slow, regrouped and rated off the inside, angled three wide soon into the backstretch, advanced four
wide outside the winner past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase past the three sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving the furlong grounds, switched to her left
lead late and faded. PERFECTLY WICKED brushed with an outer rival at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, moved to the inside of a foe
past the five sixteenths, eased out for the drive, churned on but failed to seriously menace. BATTLING TIME , unhurried early, raced three wide leaving the
far turn, shifted wider for the drive but lacked a solid run. IRISH RAGE rated forwardly around the first turn, dropped back a bit and raced between runners
heading to the half mile marker, dropped in around the final turn to chase, failed to go on past the five sixteenths and faded'. SALTY GIRL prompted the
pace outside PRINCESS MAYFAIR around the first turn and into the backstretch, stayed on as that one cleared leaving the three quarter, stalked into the
far turn, lacked a punch while under a ride past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
CARVELLIAN QUEST stalked the pace three deep around the turn, gained the lead outside IRISH WARLOCK near the eighth pole then drove clear. IRISH
WARLOCK prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and failed to hold off the winner in a sharp effort. DIAMOND
HEIST raced between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones while failing to be a threat to the top pair. GUAPONESS sprinted to the early lead, set the
pace along the inner rail and gave way in the stretch run. THATAWAY swung to the four path in upper stretch and came up empty. PRACTICAL SENSE
lacked speed, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. WEST STAR stayed along the inner rail around the turn and was no factor.
TRASH TALKIN LARRY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun. ROAN FOR THE ROSE broke slowly and was wide around the turn. THE
GREAT GAZOO retreated.

NOT THISTIMERANDY chased the pace in the two path between horses around the turn, gained command inside horses approaching the eighth pole then
drew out under steady urging. CORONATION TIME lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. I HAD ENOUGH bore
in on rivals leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, angled out at the head of the stretch, moved back towards the inside and had a slight rally.
PENTATONIC , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. KICK STARTNESS , bumped and in tight quarters at the start, raced
forwardly in the three path around the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. ESTIMATOR ZIGGY , bumped and in tight
quarters at the start passed tired horses late. DISCO PREACHER , four wide on the turn, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and came up empty.
LANDSLIDE IS HOME bore out on horses leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in the three path on the turn and faltered. GALACTIC GLORY sped to
the early lead, hugged the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
BRZINA stalked the loose leader in the early going in hand, advanced willingly late on the turn while getting floated wide, was bumped in upper stretch while
bidding for the lead, took charge and forged clear under urging. NINJA ABARRIO bumped a rival at the start, settled at the rear, advanced outside foes
three to four wide early on the turn moving in to the two path late on that bend, made a mild brief bid inside runners in upper stretch but was no match for
the winner. MIDSUMMERS EVE shifted in heading up the backstretch pursuing from mid-pack near but just off the rail, kept on but was one-paced.
HIDEWRIGHT AWAY was bumped at the break, soon sped clear setting the tempo from near the inside, drifted out leaving the turn, bumped a rival in upper
stretch, weakened and lost show late. MAJOR HOULIHAN exchanged a bump soon after the start, raced off the pace inside, swung six wide turning for
home, ran on with mild late interest. FLOWERDEW settled off the pace, was in just a bit tight early, shifted in and entered upper stretch inside, ran on
evenly but made no bid. THE HAUNTED ROOM exchanged a bump soon after the start, was in tight behind and between runners up the backstretch,
swung seven wide into upper stretch, tired. SWEET HEIDELBERG was bumped into a rival at the start, chased briefly three wide mid-pack into the turn then
retreated.

Footnotes
PLAY HARDER bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was keen early under a tight hold racing in tight quarters in behind the leaders and inside a rival, was
bumped by that foe past the nine-sixteenths, shifted out five wide leaving the turn seeking clear room then moved out a further path, bid near the eighth
pole, took a narrow lead and held the nearest challenger at bay. CATAHOULA MOON advanced outside foes four to five wide on the turn, fanned seven
wide into the stretch, bid near the furlong grounds, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. SQUARE SLICE exchanged light bumps at the
start, raced off the pace near the inside, cut the corner and advanced past rivals inside in the stretch. PRADO ROAD exchanged light contact at the start,
was urged forward to set the early pace from off the rail, engaged by an inside foe and dueled with that one into the turn, took command leaving the bend
turning for home but lacked the needed late kick. NANCY MADE MY DAY was close up outside the second flight, asked for more coming to the quarter pole
four wide, floated six wide into upper stretch and was in tight between runners, weakened. NEIL TO THE KING was outsprinted early, raced outside foes
three deep into the turn, swung seven wide for the drive, failed to menace. HAD TO HAVE HIM was keen inside just off the leader, moved forward to a
narrow lead after the opening quarter to force the issue, dueled into the turn, came up empty. EL DIVINO NINO bobbled slightly at the start, chased from
between runners in the second flight, bumped a foe past the nine-sixteenths, faded.

DISPUTED CLAIM broke in just a bit, was urged clear, set the pace, challenged past the five-sixteenths, headed in upper- to mid-stretch, dug in to retake a
narrow lead and held sway gamely. DOLICE VITA stalked the winner from outside two to three wide, encouraged past the five-sixteenths, bid at the quarter
pole, put a short head in front briefly in upper stretch, was outfinished. PORCH SWING shifted in entering the first turn content to track in behind not far off
the leaders, bided time on the far turn, was guided out coming past the quarter pole, ran on. SPORTS EDITOR stalked from outside mostly three to four
wide, needed more. JARDANI unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung six wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly. MASTER OF NONE shifted in early, settled
off the pace inside on or just off the rail, was two wide on the far turn, came out at the top of the stretch, needed more. MARYLAND MOON settled outside a
foe two to four wide through the early going, shifted in saving ground on the rail through the far turn, came out for the drive but altered back in, failed to rally.

Footnotes
MO TOUGH pressed from between then forced the pace up the backstretch with a narrow lead, continued to tussle into the second turn, put away the inside
foe but faced a new outside challenger from the five-sixteenths, dueled with that one then drew clear under urging and held safe. LOOKING FOR WATER
settled outside off the pace racing two to three wide early, moved while coming out four deep turning for home, kept on and was second best. OJITOS
BELLOS stalked from just outside about three to four deep, bid past the three-eighths, dueled briefly, flattened out in the drive. OUT OF LUCK rated in
behind the leaders near the rail up the backstretch, came out a bit for the stretch run but failed to rally. TITIAN TYRANT was urged forward at the break to
the lead, set the early pace under pressure, continued to press the new leader up the backstretch into the second turn, came up empty.
