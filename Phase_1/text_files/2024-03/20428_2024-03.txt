Footnotes
DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV, off a beat slow when lunging, quickly recovered and edged up well off the rail into the first turn, moved up five to six wide
outside the leading pair to join the fray past the five eighths, emerged in a duel outside METAROSE leaving the quarter pole, held a slim lead battling past
mid stretch, failed to switch to her correct lead but dug in under right handed asks to prevail. METAROSE grabbed command soon after the break, set the
pace three to four wide, handled outside pressure from the half, dueled, ceded the lead near mid stretch then fought on gamely to just miss. ORATORY
GLORY prompted the pace in the four path outside METAROSE, challenged between foes into the far turn, dueled to the quarter pole, failed to kick on soon
into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
A THOUSAND DREAMS , in range and off the inside, edged up into the far turn, bid three wide and inside the leader soon into the lane, spurted clear under
a drive leaving mid stretch then was all out to prevail. SPRING SPINNING , five wide to contention into the backstretch, stalked under coaxing into the far
turn, remained well wide under a hearty ride ranging up past the five sixteenths, straightened away well out in the track and steadily gained. BEA MISCHIEF
moved clear early, set the pace off the inside, drifted out some when engaged near the quarter pole, ceded command to the winner past the three
sixteenths, stayed on with effort to deep stretch then weakened. HIGH FASHION LADY dropped well off the early pace, was under a ride leaving the far
turn, edged up three wide into the stretch, shifted in and flattened out late. MIDNIGHT SUSI chased the early pace, angled out into the far turn then was
pushed along, raced four wide into the stretch and had belated action. SEE YOU AT THE TOP chased the pace, failed to go on past the five sixteenths,
saved ground into the stretch and tired. REALREALGOOD was outrun.

Footnotes
TWELVE STARS drifted out at the break, corrected and stalked six to seven wide outside rivals, bid four deep past the five sixteenths, dueled six to seven
wide outside BLESSED ANGEL in upper stretch, shook clear near the sixteenth marker then widened under a steady hand ride. EMILY SMILES , five to six
wide early, chased the dueling leaders mid turn, raced four wide into the stretch, angled in near the sixteenth marker and finished with good energy to nab
the place to the inside of BLESSED ANGEL. BLESSED ANGEL dueled four wide on a slim lead between runners, came out a path battling inside the winner
in upper stretch, fought on past mid stretch then faded late. SWEET SONNY , five wide forcing the pace, sparred between foes past the five sixteenths,
failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and weakened. WE ALL AGREE was sent hard and gained a slim lead early, ceded into the turn, vied three wide
inside foes around the turn then weakened in the drive. LARIMAR tracked the dueling leaders, was under asking mid turn, dropped inside and gave way.

Footnotes
ARREST, snugly in hand saving ground stalking the dueling leaders, eased out near the five sixteenths, brushed with READY TO STORM when working his
way between rivals into the lane, responded when asked, forged to command leaving mid stretch and drew out under a drive. LEGALLY REDDY vied
outside a rival, held a slim lead around the final turn, briefly went clear in upper stretch, failed to fend off the winner's charge but kept on with effort to be well
clear of the rest. THE RONALD settled in the clear, took closer order into the far turn, saved ground within range past the five sixteenths, eased out for the
drive and churned on. READY TO STORM stalked between foes, was nudged along to maintain a forward spot past the three eighths, eased out to be four
wide nearing the lane, exchanged a light brush with the winner, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. UNCLE JUJU sped to the front then drifted
out a bit entering the first turn, dueled to the inside of LEGALLY REDDY through the backstretch and second turn, stayed on to upper stretch then gave
way. MALMO , a bit reluctant to load, settled off the pace about four wide and lacked a serious response. MANDELA EFFECT , three deep stalking the
dueling leaders, was under pressure four wide leaving the far turn and tired. AX 'S SHORE , off the pace, angled wide for the drive but failed to rally.

Footnotes
EYES FOR GOLD , five wide outside runners leaving the far turn, ranged up into the stretch, closed determinedly under pressure, engaged KO OLINA past
the furlong grounds, wrested command inside the sixteenth marker and was edging away at the wire. KO OLINA sped to the front and set the pace off the
inside, held a clear lead under a drive past the three sixteenths, dug in when collared inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. COCKTAIL
PRINCESS , four wide between runners near the three eighths, pursued two wide into the stretch and offered a mild response. CHARMANT E advanced
inside into the turn and prompted the pace, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. TOBY'S CANDY , unruly behind the gate, settled well wide off the early
pace, circled five wide into the lane, made a mild run while on her left lead in mid stretch then flattened out. ZOE'S PRIDE broke slowly, circled six wide into
the stretch but lacked a significant run. KIRA FEVER chased between foes, steadied when in tight leaving the far turn and faded. MICKEY DOBBS flashed
speed, ceded to an outer rival, chased three wide between runners leaving the three eighths then weakened.

Footnotes
COASTAL KID rated four to five wide in the clear and in range of dueling quartet into the turn, took closer order past the five sixteenths, straightened away
about seven wide, sustained a grinding run through the final furlong, got up between rivals in the final strides and prevailed. MEDIMPACT settled off the
duelers, came five into the lane, shifted extremely wide past the three sixteenths, closed gamely outside a host of rivals and nabbed the place. BRADY BOY
, four deep disputing the pace, battled six wide outside a rival in upper stretch, battled between runners in deep stretch and kept on willingly. KID AZTECA
advanced inside a rival around the turn, bid three wide between foes nearing mid stretch to battle on near even terms, fought on to deep stretch then gave
way grudgingly. JIN TONG , sluggish from the gate, settled well back off the contested pace, saved ground into the lane, slipped through along the rail in
mid stretch and kept on with effort. MEANT FOR ME battled three wide between foes and held a slim lead around the turn, was guided to the five path
dueling inside a foe into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then faded. SAULS CALL dueled inside a trio of rivals into and around the turn, raced two wide
in upper stretch and weakened through the last eighth. STONE CARVER disputed the early pace three wide between horses, failed to quicken with the
leaders nearing the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
LUCKY VEGAS , with the pace five wide between runners nearing the half mile pole, dueled between runners mid turn, took over outside SASSY
TINKERBELL in mid stretch then eagerly drew out while kept to task. SASSY TINKERBELL disputed the pace with five rivals to her outside heading to the
half, held a slim lead inside foes mid turn, battled three to four wide inside the winner from the quarter pole to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and saved
the place. GETAWAY DAY stalked the early six way scramble, angled five wide into the lane and offered a mild response. BITCOIN BURGLAR , two wide
between runners early, chased around the turn, came back towards the rail in mid stretch then faded. BETSY IS THE CODE , three wide between rivals
contesting the early pace, chased two to three wide in upper stretch and came up empty. DIVINE GIFT , six deep heading to the half, forced the issue four
to five wide outside runners around the turn, chased inside a runner in upper stretch then weakened. DOOZY drafted back off the heated early pace, came
five wide for the drive but failed to uncork a run. SWIVEL HIPS steadied at the start and was outrun. HARBOR LASS , with the pace four wide between
runners, was shuffled back out of tight quarters into the turn, regrouped to chase around the turn then tired.
