Footnotes
RONIC was bumped between horses at the start, vied three deep around the first turn, built a clear margin tucking to the two path approaching the far turn
and inched further away under little-to-no urging. GHOST COWBOY broke out and jostled an outer rival at the start, tracked in the two path, bid inside of
rivals for place turning for home and edged that position in midstretch. CHARLIE'S CREED stalked along the inside early on, was urged while within striking
range three wide around the far turn, but lost place to an inner bidder while chasing in midstretch. CARLOS'S MAMA was bumped between horses at the
start, pursued from midpack in the three path and failed to threaten. VORTEX was jostled by an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, settled off of the
pace two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, yet shifted to the four path at the three sixteenths pole and moved up. JOHNNNY'S GAME vied
inside of the eventual winner, chased that clearing foe into the far turn, but yielded between horses nearing the lane. IZEONDEC bounced off an outer rival
into an inner foe and steadied back at the start, then saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. ADMIRAL AFLEET broke a step slow, lacked speed four
to two wide and made little impact. COME ON COME ON bumped an inner rival upon leaving the gates, trailed while pulling in the three path around the first
turn, moved out of last in the four path into the far turn but tired soon after.

Footnotes
KAHALA inherited forward position after outer rivals were troubled at the start, showed the way along the inside, stalked an outer prompter approaching the
nine sixteenths pole, tipped out and rebid in the three path along with an outer presser into the far turn, led entering the lane and inched clear.
CLARESTOWN was bumped by inner rivals at the start, stalked in the four path, moved to press the top pair entering the far turn, but failed to keep pace
with the clearing leader in upper stretch and fended off an inner bidder for place. SIVAKO was bumped between rivals, put to crowded quarters, pinched
and steadied back at the start, pursued from off of the pace in the three to tow path, bid for place in midstretch, but lugged outwardly in the final furlong, was
corrected without making contact with an outer foe nearing the final sixteenth, but lugged again leaving that marker and was denied place. SUMMER
LOVER saved ground off of the pace to no avail. Z Z'S PRINCE broke out and bothered multiple outer rivals at the start, trailed along the inside, swung out
to the five path entering the lane and was outrun. MICROPHONE (IRE) transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, prompted two
wide, led down the backstretch, but was collared by an outer pair at the three furlong pole and caved in upper stretch.

CHARCO set the pace inside of a pressing foe while pulling away from the rest nearing the lane, drew clear of that one in upper stretch and lasted late.
REVERENT pursued from midpack along the inside, rallied to take aim outside of the clear and tiring leader in the final sixteenth, closed in but ran out of
ground. DEAL WITH HIM pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, tipped five wide entering the lane, stayed on willingly to gain show
entering the final sixteenth, flopped leads and gained late but needed more. TOTALLY ADDICTED broke multiple lengths slow, trailed along the inside,
shfited out to the six path in midstretch and offered a belated kick. OLDER AND WISER broke slowly, lacked speed in the two the two path and improved
inside of rivals. HALF A BUCK chased forwardly placed in the two path but lacked a bid. CIGAR VAN pressed outside of the pace setter while clear of the
rest around the bend, but faded in upper stretch. OURPERFECTPRINCE tracked in the three path but yielded between horses. MR. BUTCH WOMBLE
lacked speed in the three path and made little impact. STAR REDEMPTION laid off of the pace in the five path and faded. KIT KAT KIDD tracked four wide
and weakened.

Footnotes
RACY BILLE stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, vied around the far turn, drew off in upper stretch and widened under a drive. MARVINS'
POSSE pursued from midpack in the four path, tracked in the three path turning for home, chased the clear leader while vying for place with an outer foe in
the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed. STEAUXLIT settled off of the pace two to three wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, ran on to bid for
place entering the final sixteenth, but hung late and missed that position. SLICK AND FAST stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and gave
way. SHAWN'S SOLVING showed the way, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, proved no match for that one in upper stretch and folded.
PUNCHIE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SKINNY BOBBY pursued from midpack in the two to three path around the first turn, then faded
around the far turn. IN A BIND trailed three wide early on, but was done early and started to ease around the far turn.

Footnotes
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU stalked the top pair from the two to three path, bid three deep with three furlongs to go, assumed command in upper stretch and
drew off. MISS HARMONIC raced at the rear in the two to three path early on, advanced into the far turn, sustained progress shifting from the four to five
path in upper stretch and ran on to reach place at the sixteenth pole. TEMPTING LADY brushed with an inner rival at the start, pressed outside of the
leader, bid along with an outer rival with three furlongs to go, proved no match for her outer counterpart in upper stretch, yielded and saved show. BLUE
VORTEX brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two to three path, then pursued mildly but was denied show. GREYHOUND STATION
showed the way, met a pair of outer challenges at the three furlong pole and weakened entering the lane. ELODINE made little impact. FASTA LAVISTA
BABY laid off of the pace along the inside and faded.
