headed by MISS TENA MARIE nearing the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling. MISS TENA MARIE saved ground while being close up
early, slipped through entering the stretch, gain a slight lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to match strides with the winner late in a game try. RUN
BAMBI RUN stumbled slightly at the start, then was prominently placed while racing four-wide and finished well for third in a steady effort. ALEXANDRA'S
SONG was reluctant to load, then vied with ALLOTROPE for the lead to the stretch from along the outside and weakened. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SEQUAYA was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. GABRIELLA ATTACK saved ground while being unhurried and was not a factor.

AUNT STELLA prompted the pace set by COOKIN ROSES, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and drifted in while drawing clear late.
COOKIN ROSES saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole, angled out at the sixteenth pole and held on well for
second. GO STORMIN GIRL saved ground while being forwardly place, angled out for room nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. HELEN
MAE'S SONG steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole while in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole dropping back, then angled out to come
three-wide into the stretch and finished willingly. LOONA LUV saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride and lacked a rally when asked. TAP N
TWINE was carried out slightly by HELEN MAE'S SONG nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and failed to threaten. SHEZA HOOT dropped back early and
was not a factor.

held on well for third. GALLANT BUCK dueled for the lead into the stretch and weakened slightly late. KINGSWOOD saved ground while being allowed to
settle, steadied leaving the quarter pole when MEDAL OF FACT came in then angled out and finished willingly when clear. BOISE was reserved off the
pace, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. MEDAL OF FACT showed early speed while racing two-wide, came in leaving the
quarter pole and tired. UNCAPTURED PULSE settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and was not a factor.

CASH FEVER stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up three-wide to take the lead entering the stretch and quickly drew clear. TWIRLING ROSES was
unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. VALIANT WEST was reserved off the early paced, came three-wide entering the
stretch then split rivals during the drive and finished in a mild rally. ELI'S PROMISE dueled with RIVZONAROLL for the lead from along the outside to the
stretch and weakened late. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR was allowed to settle early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. RIVZONAROLL
dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and tired. LARRY THE POET was in tight and shuffled back from along the inside nearing the half
mile pole then came eight-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC saved ground while dropping back early and was
not a factor. DUST DANCER settled in the middle of the field, came six-wide into the stretch and gave way late.

DAVIDIC LINE saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win with something left. GLOBAL EMPIRE prompted the issue from the outset and finished
well for the place in a steady effort. COUSVINNYSACANUCK was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bid
approaching the eighth pole but lacked the needed late response. BEEALEA dropped back after breaking a step slow then was unhurried, came six-wide
into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS was in tight and shuffled back on the first turn then raced three-wide and finished
willingly. C F V WICKED RED was forwardly placed while racing four-wide and weakened. SUPER WISE saved ground while racing in the middle of the
field, slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch and then faltered during the drive. KNIGHT'S CROSS was in tight between horses on the first turn
and shuffled back then raced five-wide and lacked a rally. SEMINOLE BEACH prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired. ROGUE ELEMENT
dropped back early and failed to threaten. SCAT SHACK saved ground while being allowed to settle and gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
FAST N HAPPY was prominently placed while racing four-wide, moved up to take the lead leaving the eighth pole and edged clear late. ALDORA was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take a slight lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner in a good effort.
BEAUTY OF THE NILE was fractious in the gate then saved ground while racing close up to the leaders, angled on to come three-wide into the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. CALL ME PENNY saved ground while being allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. DI'S SURPRISE
dueled for the lead with CREME DE CASSIS from along the outside into the stretch and weakened. CREME DE CASSIS broke out then dueled for the lead
to the stretch from along the inside and tired. PACIFIC VIEW saved ground while being reserved off the pace, angled out nearing the eighth pole and
showed some interest late. SUPER CHRISTIE steadied from between horses early then raced three-wide and was not a factor. CITY SHACK raced
four-wide and failed to threaten. ABSOLUTE MIRACLE saved ground while racing in the middle of the field but lacked a rally. BERNAR MOSA steadied
shortly after the start from between horses, then was carried out nearing the three-eighths pole by JOYZELLA and was unable to recover. JOYZELLA drifted
out nearing the three-eighths pole and gave way.
