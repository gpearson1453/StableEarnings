Footnotes
AVA'S UNCLE BILLY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. SORORITY PRANK chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. AIR FORCE CROSS
coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and kept on to procure the show
honors. COMPUTE IT grew detached at the tail of the field when devoid of speed early on, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing midway on the
turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. LANDAUER coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. THE DELAWARE BOYZ chased three wide coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, offered up a mild bid swinging four to five wide at the head of the stretch, then weakened in the drive.

late on the backstretch, chased in the five path on the turn, gained to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, drifted in into the final sixteenth and
proved best under steady urging. NINETEEN OYSTERS was urged along on the outside, went around most of the turn in the six path, tucked into the four
path outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, chased outside in the final furlong and willingly got up for the place. ANTHRACITE veered in at
the start then bumped soundly with an opponent, was well positioned down the backstretch, went three wide while asked on the turn, pursued the leader
while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and lost the place late while able to get the show. STOP THE SPREAD bumped hard with a rival at the start
while also making contact with another foe, moved up to get the lead just before the eleven-sixteenths pole, vied in the two path while inside of a rival on the
turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths and was outfinished. UNION LIGHTS bumped with a foe while
last away, was urged along near the back, moved up late on the backstretch, drafted inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then cut the corner
into the stretch, paused while awaiting room inside the three-sixteenths, found room outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. NEWPORT
BRIDGE moved out early while showing speed, disputed the pace, vied in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back
into the final furlong and tired.

MOONLIT WEEKEND chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to take command near the sixteenth pole, then edged away to the finish. STEPPIN' HAWK showed the way in hand three then two wide down the
backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged away to the
eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth marker, ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. TERESA broke out at the
start filling the space left vacant by MONTAUK MYSTIQUE, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MONTAUK MYSTIQUE grew fractious and tossed her head at the start getting away last and conceding four to
five lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased five then four wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. UKRAINIAN PRINCESS coaxed from the gate, chased three then two

Footnotes
FLIP'S DREAM was forwardly placed on the outside in the second flight, was asked while moving from three to five wide on the turn, rallied to the lead into
upper stretch, drifted in while moving clear outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. MUGSY FURY broke in at the start,
was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved closer near the five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely
secured the place. A LISTER was ridden along towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the four path, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick while able to get a share of the show. CALL BOB bobbled at the start but broke with the field, bumped with an opponent while showing early
speed, set the pace on the outside of a foe, lost the advantage near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the four path on the turn and weakened while able to hold a
share of third. TWIRLING VINE broke in at the start, was taken under a hold early, dropped back leaving the chute then came under urging, moved from the
two path to the four path on the turn, advanced closer near the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive
and came up empty. Z DANCER bumped with a foe while showing early speed, pressed the pace on the inside of that rival, took the advantage near the
nine-sixteenths, vied in the three then two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths pole under urging, lost the advantage in the three path into upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and tired. SAKA SHOCKA moved out early while taken under a snug hold, raced inside of a rival in the
second flight while given some rein, dropped in late on the backstretch, chased inside to the two path on the turn, moved to the three path outside the
quarter-pole then spun four wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

COLLECTED SPECIAL established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and safe to prevail.
IN A MINUTE bobbled at the break recovering outwards into PERLIANO, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along
second best. LI'L LANG chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BLACK ALMIGHTY chased four then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. BADLANDS RULER broke in at the start
bumping PERLIANO, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, angled six wide into
upper stretch and made no headway. SOLO IN PARIS broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked five wide into the turn and waited as PERLIANO got out in front and tucked three wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued
three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PERLIANO got bumped at the start by IN A MINUTE who recovered from a bobble, then got bumped by
BADLANDS RULER breaking inwards, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, got out into the turn despite a firm left hand grip by the rider to be
five wide at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch under coaxing, offered little and was eased home through the final furlong to the
finish.

Footnotes
MUDVILLE NINE was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, rallied to make a bid in upper stretch, took the lead
outside the furlong marker and edged clear under steady urging. SIN NOMBRE broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped from the three
path to the rail on the turn, moved to the two path while in dead-aim of the leaders in upper stretch, chased while in crowded quarters into the final furlong,
altered to the outside nearing the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. UNCLE GEORGE chased the pace on the outside then in the three path
on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished then was caught for the place while able to get the
show. ROYAL KING broke in then was hustled, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn,
lost the advantage in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and tired. BARGAINING POWER was hustled from the gate, showed speed then chased the
pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FLASHY ALEX
leaned out and hit the gate and was off a step slow, raced at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. GRAND AGAIN chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide
on the turn and capitulated.

OLYMPIC DREAMS coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure through the presence
of TABEGUACHE to the outside, tucked inside into the far turn and came under increased pressure and was placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths in
response, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat through the length of the stretch holding stubbornly and gamely to the finish to
prevail. TABEGUACHE forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside four paths off the rail down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path into the far turn, increased the pressure on the leader through the bend coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the length of the stretch to the finish fighting on game, but was ultimately denied to the
end. GUNTOWN coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide through the first turn before chasing five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on under a drive to

Footnotes
VICTORIOUS WAVE bumped with a rival at the start while brushing with another foe, chased the pace, drafted in the two path for most of the turn, shifted
three then four wide late on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, fought outside foes into the final furlong then
edged clear under steady urging. BUSTIN SHOUT was taken up while bumped on both sides at the start, raced off the pace under urging, dropped back
near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly to just get the place.
SEVEN NATION ARMY broke in then brushed with a foe, was taken in hand when a rival crossed in front early, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid
in the four path on the turn, battled between foes under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished then lost the place while able to get the show.
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF came in early and cut in front of opponents, pressed the pace on the outside, took the advantage leaving the backstretch, vied in
the three path on the turn, fought between horses into the final furlong and tired. AMUNDSON had his path taken early, dropped back then was coaxed
along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MISTER J T broke out and bumped with a foe, set
the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the lead lead leaving the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path,
battled into the final furlong and weakened. JEMOGRAPHY bobbled at the start then was hustled, was taken up when shut-off by the outside opponent
early, raced near the rear, went four wide on the turn and was no factor.
