Footnotes
TEMPEST gave chase and challenged toward the quarter pole, took the nod two deep midway on the turn, raced clear mid-stretch and widened under
steady handling. PAPA DON rated the pace well off the rail, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, gave up the nod at the rail midway on the
turn and dropped back mid-stretch, but held on for second. COURT TUDOR broke a step slow then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn, eased out
nearing mid-stretch and finished well. BRAVE SAND RIDER gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and showed little in the lane. BUFF'S
CAT became anxious in the gate then lunged at the break and was not a factor. Per Stewards ruling # 60, Tempest has been disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
GABRIEL'S WING stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, came between
horses toward mid-stretch and dueled for the lead in the final yards. CAPE LOOKOUT raced well back off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in to take second under the wire. MASAI MAN rated the pace inside, came
under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was steadily handled leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. SUE
LOVES BARBADOS saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced close two deep on the far turn, but flattened stride later
yards. NOTION TO TAPIT ducked out and made sharp contact with Mud Bug leaving the gate then saved ground, gave chase approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and finished well to close the gap. TAPIO raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and showed little in the lane. BUSTIN PIETRE raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase
past the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the four path on the far turn. HIS ROYAL G stalked the early pace two deep, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. MUD BUG was bumped off stride at the break and saved ground.

ESPRESSO stalked off the rail then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, took the lead entering the stretch and dug in
determinedly to eke out the nod over the game challenge of ROBBIELIKESHIM, who rated the pace inside, came under pressured at the three eighths pole
and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met entering the stretch but dug in gamely to the finish. STROLLINGINTHEWIND was pinched
back at the start then saved ground racing well back, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along
to take third inside the sixteenth pole. MY BOY CLYDE rounded the opening turn about the three path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn, left the turn outside and passed some rivals. SUMMONING DENIS ducked in at the break
then settled off the rail the opening turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but flattened stride on the far turn. RED HOT TODDY saved ground, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. SCARE DEM settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path on the far turn. PAPA LINGUINE ducked out leaving the gate then settled in the three path the first turn,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded in the four path on the far turn.

LIGHTNIN RUNNER took over immediately and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, cleared MOONLIT SHADOW at
the quarter pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. The latter stalked off the rail then challenged toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back at

VISBY was bumped outward and into NONESUCH GIRL leaving the gate then pressured the pace and took the nod approaching the quarter pole,
contested the edge three wide on the turn, was bumped entering the stretch but dug in determinedly to edge away late. The latter was bumped leaving the
gate then pressured the pace while between horses, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail through the turn, drifted outward and made contact with
Visby entering the stretch but dug in gamely to late yards before relenting. CAST YOUR NET was hustled to contention, checked at the rail midway on the
turn then flattened the final sixteenth. VIENNA'S TWIRL contested the pace through the backstretch but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and
faded in the three path on the turn. KIMSFAVORITESTORM pressured the pace inside but steadied at the rail nearing the five sixteenths pole and faded
through the turn. STORMIN' ANNA broke outward and made contact with Visby, gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path. The Stewards
reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Visby for alleged interference in the vicinity of the quarter pole, lodged by the rider of Nonesuch
Girl.
