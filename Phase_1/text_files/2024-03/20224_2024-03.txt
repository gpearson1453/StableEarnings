Footnotes
TO SPEIGHT HER showed good speed away from the start and assumed command of the early running, set a fast pace while pressured into the turn,
carved out solid fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew away while in hand at the furlong marker, drew off under
mild urging into the final sixteenth and prevailed as much the best. HE'S INIT TO WINIT broke out at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to
settle in the early running while not far back, improved position two wide into the turn then angled four wide for the drive, was no match for the winner in the
final furlong and was best of the rest. HAVAKASH READY showed good speed away from the start and pressed the fast early pace, kept close attendance
to the pacesetter while two wide into the turn, could not match strides with TO SPEIGHT HER into upper stretch, gave way into the final sixteenth and just
held for third at the finish. DRUMADOON tracked the fast early pace while three wide, maintained that three wide path into the turn and lost position at the
quarter marker, chased into the stretch and passed tiring rivals inside of the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and missed for third at the
finish. GOOD FOCUS tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, raced between rivals into the turn and chased two to three wide approaching the
quarter marker, lost ground approaching mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. FORDY G broke a step slowly away from the start, rushed into
contention in the early going and chased the fast pace from the inside, maintained an inside path to the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and tired
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CHURCH HARBOR was away in good order and was prominent in the early running, stalked the moderate pace two wide into the backstretch run, was well
placed approaching the half-mile marker and stalked VENOM two wide into the far turn, was roused into the stretch and battled with VENOM to the furlong
pole, took command at mid-stretch and was kept to task under firm urging to the sixteenth-marker, dug in while under pressure into deep stretch and gamely
lasted for the win at the finish. LOVE OF THE SPORT settled while not far back off of the early pace, raced two wide into the backstretch run and tracked
the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, gained ground three wide into the second turn, swung four wide for the stretch drive and continued his
bid at the furlong pole, responded to urging and closed well into the final sixteenth, pressured CHURCH HARBOR in deep stretch and just missed for the
win at the finish, while besting the rest. WINTER SOLDIER bobbled at the start and was slow into stride away from the gate, was unhurried in the early
going and saved ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker and improved position two wide into the far turn, shifted three
wide for the drive and advanced at the furlong grounds, was outkicked into the final sixteenth, finished evenly and was clear in the end for show honors.
BALLROOM PRINCE allowed to settle while not far back early on, saved ground into the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile
pole, maintained an inside path into the far turn and lost position at the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and lacked a late response. VENOM broke
through the gate prior to the start, showed speed away from the gate and assumed early command, set moderate fractions while controlling the pace
approaching the half-mile marker, showed the way while clear into the second turn, was confronted into the stretch by CHURCH HARBOR and met that bid
to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way.

Footnotes
YOU GO GIRL tracked just behind and to the outside of SONG OF SHADOWS, moved to challenge near the five-sixteenths pole, met no resistance from
that rival but then shook off a bid from MAGIC CHROME, opened up in mid-stretch and won clear. READY TO GIG broke out at the start and caused a
chain reaction to the outer posts, tracked mid-pack behind the leaders, stayed to the inside through the turn then got boxed in from the five-sixteenths pole,
found room as the field turned into the stretch and responded to strong handling to get into the second spot while no match for the winner. STRANGE
ADDICTION was floated out at the start by the horse to the inside, then raced at the rear of the fairly compact field, moved closer heading into the turn, bid
three wide around the turn then swung out to the five path for the stretch run, finished with some interest and managed to grab a minor award in the last
jumps. MAGIC CHROME broke outward at the start trying to avoid contact with READY TO GIG to the inside, then brushed and carried STRANGE
ADDICTION out in turn, raced two deep a couple of lengths behind the pacesetters, launched a bid from the three furlong pole then loomed three wide into
the stretch with YOU GO GIRL, flattened out in mid-stretch and was outrun in the late stages. SONG OF SHADOWS broke alertly and was hustled to the
lead, was allowed to dictate the early pace, was challenged near the five-sixteenths pole by YOU GO GIRL, had no response, tired and was no factor down
the lane.

Footnotes
ICONIC SKY sent to show early speed, engaged with REDSTWIRLINGDANCER in the early running and prompted that rival through solid fractions heading
into the turn, pressed the fast pace two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled with REDSTWIRLINGDANCER into the stretch and drew to even
terms past the furlong marker, determinedly wore down the game runner-up in the final sixteenth and drew clear in deep stretch to prove best.
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a pressured early pace and carved out solid fractions while
prompted to the quarter pole, battled with ICONIC SKY into the stretch and kept that rival at bay approaching the furlong pole, battled while on even terms
into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by ICONIC SKY in deep stretch and was second best. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN allowed to settle away from the start
while not far back, was guided two to three wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker while between rivals, ran evenly to mid-stretch, split foes
inside of the furlong pole and rallied into the final sixteenth, could not impact the top pair at the finish and was clear in the end for show honors. CANAM
GAL a bit antsy prior to the start, was away in good order and rated nicely off of the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and improved
position four wide at the quarter marker, swung widest for the drive and offered a mild rally in the late stages. A ROUSING BABE tracked the solid early
pace three deep and between rivals, gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, swung three to four wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch,
could not muster the needed late response and flattened out in the final sixteenth. WESTWARD BREEZE tracked the solid early pace from between
runners, saved ground into the turn and chased the fast pace to the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and made a mild bid at the
furlong pole, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened. TURA LURA chased the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into
the turn and lost position at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a response in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ZEUS' WAR rated nicely off of the solid early pace, tracked from the inside and was well positioned heading into the turn, was roused approaching the
quarter marker and angled three wide for the stretch drive, loomed into the stretch and took command past the furlong marker, was kept to task under
right-handed urging into the final sixteenth and drove clear to prevail. SHARONA'S WILD BOY prominent away from the start, stalked the solid early pace
then advanced to press the pace heading into the turn, overtook COWBOY CHARLIE nearing the quarter pole and assumed command into the stretch, was
collared by ZEUS' WAR at the furlong grounds, outkicked by the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. TALBOT BAY allowed to settle away
from the start, was roused four wide along the turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not impact the top pair
in the final sixteenth and rallied to be clear for show honors at the finish. SUPER BILL away from the start in good order and was forwardly placed to begin,
came in tight in the early running and was shuffled back heading to the half-mile marker, was steered to the outside and chased the fast pace into the turn,
drifted out a bit along the bend and raced three to four wide to the quarter pole, gave way into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. COWBOY
CHARLIE showed good speed leaving the start, assumed command and set a pressured pace to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the turn by
SHARONA'S WILD BOY and lost the lead to that rival approaching the quarter pole, chased into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and
faded. RUNKERRY was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the solid early pace from between runners, lost ground into the turn and chased three
to four wide approaching the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
POUR ON THE COLE came away well but was content to let the pace scenario play out, settled mid-pack along the rail, responded when asked to pick up
the pace passing the half-mile marker, had to wait for room on the far turn, split horses at the three-sixteenth pole, took command under steady handling
and intermittent urging and won clear. DESERT DUDE was first into the turn without having to be asked, then was allowed to dictate pedestrian fractions,
took the field to the far turn under very little pressure, had something in reserve when set down at the top of the stretch, opened up a clear lead and
outfinished all but the winner. BUENISIMO was off a step slow then hustled into the early mix through the first turn, raced between horses in the tracking
group down the backstretch, became boxed in through the far turn while looking to make a bid, swung out four wide for the stretch run and finished evenly.
WALKING BOSS took up slightly after the start then trailed through the first turn, bided time still last through the last turn while saving some ground, dove to
the rail for racing room in mid-stretch and finished with some late interest but was too late. JERRY JEFF WALKER got caught three wide into the clubhouse
turn, then raced near the back of the back down the backstretch while still out in the middle of the track, tried to launch a rally on the far turn but was caught
five wide into the stretch, ran on under strong handling but could not make any impact in the late stages. CARSON'S LEGACY raced close up while three
wide throughout, did not respond when set down at the five sixteenths pole and was unable to improve position down the stretch. MY SUNSHINE floated
two to three wide through the first turn then took up a stalking position behind DESERT DUDE, was content to let that one dictate the pace while remaining
a length or two behind through the first half mile, then held that position through the far turn, came under a ride near the quarter pole and was unable to
keep up from there.

DULAS (IRE) allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the backstretch run and was content to track the moderate pace to the half-mile pole,
was roused into the far turn and mounted a five wide bid at the quarter pole, loomed into upper stretch, took command at the furlong marker and drew to a
clear lead into the final sixteenth, drew away into deep stretch was hand urged to the finish. LAW ABIDING broke alertly and assumed command away from
the start, showed the way into the first turn and set a moderate pace into the backstretch run, was pressed into the second turn by AMERICA GREAT and
shook free of that rival into upper stretch, was overtaken by DULAS approaching the furlong pole, could not match strides with the winner into the final
sixteenth and held clearly in the end for second. AMERICA GREAT prominent away from the start, stalked the pace two wide into the first turn, kept
attendance to the moderate pace along the backstretch run and advanced to press LAW ABIDING into the second turn, was repelled into upper stretch and

moderate pace to the half-mile marker, chased into the far turn then came in tight while four wide approaching the quarter pole, maintained a four wide path
into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong grounds, finished evenly into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. GROSS PROFIT

neighboring rival, was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace three wide along the first turn, maintained a three wide path into the
backstretch run and raced close up to the moderate pace nearing the half-mile marker, raced three wide into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter

Footnotes
HIGH INFLATION was very quick from the gate, cleared the field before a half-furlong was run, set solid fractions while under a rating hold and being
chased a length or two back by MAX'S MAXINE, had a something left when set down in the stretch and held that rival at bay to the wire. MAX'S MAXINE
broke well but was outsprinted to the lead by HIGH INFLATION, made a couple of runs at that foe but had each one turned back, kept on well chased that
rival throughout, could not threaten but pulled clear of the rest in the end. ALMOST GOT LUCKY chased the pace three wide while up close to the turn, bid
three wide around the turn, had some trouble changing leads turning into the stretch, was kept to task and was able to grab the third spot in the final yards.
STREET TIGER chased the pace from up close while holding the inside path, loomed a threat turning for home but flattened out and got outfinished for the
third spot. SUSIE CRU broke well but was not fast enough to challenge for the early lead, settled into a staking position four wide down the backstretch,
went into a long drive from the seven-sixteenths pole came five wide into the stretch but was unable to make an impact. HAPPY CHAPPY hit the inside of
the gate at the break, then became rank in the initial stages, lost momentum and dropped far behind the field, was put into a drive from the half-mile pole,
rallied three wide through the turn then swung six wide into the stretch but could not improve position. WHAT'S IN A NAME was off slowly and spotted the
field a head start, rushed up to regain contact with the field but was in chase mode at that point, came under a ride with three furlongs to go, was unable to
mount a rally and trailed the field to the finish. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, STREET TIGER HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A
POSITIVE TEST.
