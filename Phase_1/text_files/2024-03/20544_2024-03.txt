Footnotes
RIGHT HAND RYDER sent to establish the early lead, was well handled while setting decent fractions approaching the half-mile marker, led into the far turn
and held a clear lead at the quarter pole, extended the lead into the stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task late to hold sway.
HELEN'S SUN tracked the decent pace three wide into the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn, closed well
into the final furlong, was gaining into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was second best. TWELVE VOLT allowed to settle
while never far back, went two wide into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, improved position two to three wide nearing the
quarter pole, shifted to the inside into upper stretch and was asked for run at the furlong marker, could not impact the top pair into the final sixteenth and
closed to secure show honors in the final strides. PRECEDENT LUKE forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace two wide into the
backstretch run, chased into the second turn and came two wide to the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was
outfinished for third. HALF THROTTLE off a bit slowly leaving the start, was allowed to settle in the early running and saved ground into the first turn,
maintained a ground saved position while not far back nearing the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, could not keep pace into the
stretch and tired in the final furlong. MANY SILVER BELLS forwardly placed in the early running, went four wide into the first turn and tracked the pace into
the backstretch run, was well placed while widest nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid into the second turn, could not sustain that run into
the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S GENIE rated off of the solid early pace, tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker and was well placed into the turn, gained
ground nearing the quarter marker, tipped three wide and was asked for run into the stretch, chased SILENT BEAUTY to the furlong marker, rallied and
came within aim nearing the final sixteenth, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and prevailed in the final strides for a determined win. SILENT
BEAUTY away in good order, showed good speed leaving the start and established the early lead, was engaged by SAHARA SUE and contested solid
fractions with that rival heading to the half-mile pole, dueled into the turn and disputed the quick pace two wide at the quarter marker, took command into
upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, confronted by BOBBY'S GENIE nearing the sixteenth-pole, met that rival's bid into deep
stretch, was bested in the final strides and well clear of the rest for place honors. SOO BROOKLYN allowed to settle away from the start, improved position
into the turn and chased two to three wide heading to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed into
the final sixteenth, could not impact the leading pair at the finish and was clear in the end for third. TIGERIZE rated off of the solid early pace, guided two to
three wide into the turn and trailed to the quarter pole, swung widest into the stretch and found her best stride late. GENTLE JULIA broke alertly, took back
off of the solid early pace and tracked from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. SAHARA SUE hustled away
from the start, engaged with SILENT BEAUTY in the early going and contested the pace with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the turn
and disputed solid fractions approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace into upper stretch and lost position at the furlong pole, lacked a response
in the late stages and tired.

ADIOS NICANOR broke a step slowly leaving the start and was unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the turn and was roused nearing the quarter
pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch, tipped two wide nearing the furlong pole and chased EN TU HONOR BRO to mid-stretch, rallied and
confronted that rival nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled the stubborn runner-up into deep stretch, wore down EN TU HONOR BRO in the final strides and
won the nod at the wire to determinedly prevail. EN TU HONOR BRO broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set a solid pace while prompted to the
half-mile marker, kicked clear into the turn and carved out fast fractions approaching the quarter pole, maintained a clear lead into the lane and was kept to
task at mid-stretch, was confronted by ADIOS NICANOR nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that rival's bid and battled to deep stretch, was bested in the
final strides and held safely in the end for second. COOLWIND was leaning at the start, hit the gate and was away slowly, lacked early speed, was guided
three wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position while widest at the furlong marker,
closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the leading pair at the finish and was clear of the rest for third. ENJOY THE MOMENT chased the
quick early pace outside of rivals, ran in pursuit four wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, maintained a four wide path into the stretch
and could not muster the needed late response. ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the quick early pace and chased

Footnotes
LITTLE LILIANA prominent leaving the start, rated off of the early pace and tracked to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the turn and
gained ground at the quarter pole, went four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded to urging and bid between rivals into the
final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and determinedly held in the final strides to prevail. TIZ A TIGER settled off of the early pace while never far
back, was taken outside of rivals and raced four to five wide to the quarter pole, maintained a wide path into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong
marker, rallied into the final sixteenth and vied for the lead into deep stretch, was denied for the win at the finish and was up in time to secure place honors.
CRY ME A RUNNER away in good order, vied for the early lead then ceded the front to BOB'S VAI and stalked that runner to the half-mile marker, chased
two wide into the turn and attended to the moderate pace nearing the quarter pole, roused into the stretch, advanced and vied for the lead at the furlong
marker, took a slim advantage past mid-stretch, Orozco lost his crop nearing the sixteenth-pole, battled inside of a pair of rivals into deep stretch and was
bested in the final strides in a good effort. BOB'S VAI prominent away from the start, vied for the early lead then assumed command nearing the half-mile
marker, set moderate fractions while controlling the pace heading to the quarter pole, came under pressure into the stretch and kept foes at bay
approaching the furlong marker, could not hold off oncoming rivals into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. FEISTY ELLA hard to load prior to the start,
broke out then took up at the start and was away slowly from the gate, lacked early speed, was guided two to three wide into the turn and trailed to the
quarter pole, gained ground at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth but could not threaten the leaders in the late stages. YODERANDO
allowed to settle while never far back, saved ground into the turn, made a mild advance at the furlong marker and finished evenly in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, maintained a two wide path into the turn and chased the quick pace nearing the
quarter pole, encountered traffic past the quarter marker and ran in tight quarters into upper stretch, split rivals at the furlong pole and took command into
the final sixteenth, responded to urging into deep stretch and edged away in the final strides for a determined win. IMPLICITLY unhurried in the early stages,
was guided three wide into the turn and trailed to the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and rallied while widest at the furlong marker, finished
well into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held safely for place honors. AMANOFMYSTATURE tracked the fast early pace
from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and chased HAY JUAN to the quarter pole, tipped three wide into the stretch and bid between rivals at the
furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and was clear at the finish for third. MY DOMINATOR rated off of the fast early pace, saved ground
into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out.
HAY JUAN hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set a fast pace heading to the half-mile marker, extended the lead into the turn and
controlled the pace approaching the quarter pole, held a clear lead into the stretch, was getting weary at the furlong marker and was overtaken past
mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch. COWBOY KISSES broke alertly, ceded the early lead to HAY JUAN and
tracked that runner through quick fractions heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter pole,
ran in pursuit to mid-stretch and lacked a response in the late stages while running a bit erratically.

Footnotes
LORD SHELDON came away from the gate in good order and was allowed to settle into stride, stalked the lone pacesetter DEO to the far turn, never far
back, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole, battled that stubborn foe to mid-stretch, took command and just held off THREEBROTHERS at the line in
a driving finish. THREEBROTHERS broke awkwardly towards the inside at the break and made contact wtih LAURA'S KIDOUGH, then was taken in hand
but still pulled towards the front of the pack, got floated wide into the first turn by DEO, then settled into a stalking position in the three path for the run down
the backstretch, was given the cue to go on with three furlongs to run, responded, loomed three wide at the top of the stretch, was kept to task down the
stretch, found best stride late and was gaining on the eventual winner but ran out of time. LAURA'S KIDOUGH broke outward at the break and mutually
bumped with THREE BROTHERS, then steadied going into the first turn passing the seven-eighths pole when put in tight between horses settled near the
back of the tracking group in the early stages, advanced racing up the rail down the backstretch, remained inside through the far turn, was set down
approaching the quarter pole, kept on under heavy pressure and got the nod for third. DEO broke well and inherited the early lead, was first to the turn and
then was allowed to set moderate fractions while being stalked by LORD SHELDON, continued to lead he field through the far turn, then quickened the
pace, had something left for the stretch run, held that foe at bay to mid-stretch then weakened. UPSTART YANKEE was allowed to settled, raced near the
rear of the field, went three wide through the first turn, remained out there for the backstretch run, was put into a drive with three furlongs to run, swung out
to the five path for the stretch run, finished with some interest but could not make an impact. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF walked out of the gate and was a little
slow to get going, trailed the field to the far turn, stayed to the inside then swung three wide into the stretch, came under heavy pressure approaching the
three-sixteenths pole and had only a mild response, did not lose ground but was unable to improve.

Footnotes
BIG SPIN took light bumps on both sides at the break then was not asked for speed, moved over to the two path before the turn, was content to trail well
behind the pace to the halfway point, made a sweeping move four wide around the far turn to gain contention, rallied down the stretch under steady handling
and got up in the last jump. QUALITY CAT was pulling hard and a little hard to place from the break, tracked inside as part of the tracking group well behind
the pace through the early stages, moved up to challenge the leader at the half mile pole, kept to the inside through the far turn and found a huge hole to
run through into the stretch, held a brief lead mid-stretch, battled on gamely but could not hold off the winner at the wire. KO SAMUI (IRE) unhurried and
raced far behind the pack for the first half-mile racing along the rail, started a sustained bid from the half-mile pole, moved out a path in the middle of the far
turn, had to wait for room from the five-sixteenths then dove towards the rail, found room at the three-sixteenths pole, finished willingly under steady
handling but came up short. STRAIT OF GEORGIA raced outside of the trio tracking well behind the pace set by BIG DON'S SMILING, went up with the
others to ramp up the pressure at the half mile marker, continued to advance three wide through the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, raced
between horses in the charge to the finish but was outfinished. BIG DON'S SMILING broke out and bothered YOU KIDDING ME at the start but sprinted to
the lead and opened up a clear lead early, tried to slow the pace down and was joined by a host of pursuers near the half-mile marker but was able to
re-break, opened up again near the quarter pole, came under heavy pressure at the top of the stretch, was beset by challengers on both sides, battled
gamely but was spent from earlier efforts. YOU KIDDING ME was off a bit slowly when BIG DON'T SMILING came over after the break, tracked two wide
through the first turn, was part of a trio tracking behind the runaway leader BIG DON'S SMILING, then advanced to put pressure on that one near the
half-mile marker with the others in close attendance, started to struggle to keep up with the pace quickened with three furlongs to run, dropped back to last
before the stretch and finished well behind the rest.
