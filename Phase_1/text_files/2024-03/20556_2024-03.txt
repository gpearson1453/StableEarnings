SILENT SUNDAY was allowed to settle early, advanced into the far turn, swung six wide into the upper stretch and surged up under strong handling while
racing from the outside. SOULMATE set a pressured early pace along the inside, dug in late and finished gamely to the wire. TIZ OF THEE stalked the
pace, made a four to wide bid in the lane and was outkicked. CHAMBERS BAY stumbled at the break, raced off the pace after the poor start, made a good
rail bid through the upper stretch and flattened out late with no final bid. JOE PHILLIPS had an awkward start, made an inside move near the quarter pole
and weakened a bit through the drive. AKAMAI dropped back early, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. KENTUCKY COOL settled off
the early, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. MAJOR WAGER was off a step slow, rushed up to press two deep and

Footnotes
ARMY OFFICER dropped back to race mid pack early, made a three wide bid through the far turn and finished well to prove best under all out pressure.
LOU'S LEGACY settled off the early going, made a four to five wide bid in the stretch and rallied late for the place position. PHREDDIE MAC stalked the
pace, raced near the inside around the far turn into the lane, was two deep in the drive to have an inside run and finished willingly to the wire.
CONTEMPLATION rated along the inside under a hold and weakened through the drive. AMERICAN MEMORIES showed good early foot to set the early
pace along the inside, met bid near the three eighths pole and faded. SAND PIPES was off slowly, unhurried early on, raced five to six wide into the upper
stretch and never threatened. TWO BEERS BY TEN tracked two path and gave way. AUSTIN STRONG raced far back and trailed.

mid-stages, hustled along four wide late on the final turn, sustained bid through the lane and got up late for show. ENGLISH CHALLENGE got pinched back
at the start and remained reserved through the backstretch, picked up the tempo mid-way around the final turn, angled inside in upper stretch and got edged
for show. VALUE ENGINEERING raced off the pace, urged for response around the final turn, angled in a sixteenth out, gained position then ran on evenly.

the lane and drew clear. SHARPER GAL raced near midpack, made a move four wide late on the turn, hustled along five wide at the head of the lane,
gained close position and just lasted for place. SHE'S ALWAYS ROSIE tracked the early pace, rode the rail around the turn, raced in striking distance a
furlong out and stayed on with response. CITY OF GLITTER raced in range, hustled three wide around the turn, held a slim lead a furlong out then flattened
late. BOLT ON THE ROCKS was off a step slow at the start, wait along the rail entering the turn, tipped two wide past the quarter pole, hustled along three
deep in the final furlong and ran on evenly in final stages. PLEASESTOPTALKING rated through early stages, rode the rail around the turn, shifted four then
three wide in the lane and had a mild improve. MORNING MIRACLE set the early pace, continued on top into upper stretch then tired leaving the eighth
pole. KITTEN'S TEMPER raced off the pace, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ROSE ALABAMA was forwardly placed racing just off
