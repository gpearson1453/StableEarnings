Footnotes
GILES reserved off the pace down the backside, idled on the far turn losing some ground, circled six wide to the clear, made a steady advance down the
outside and found his best stride late in the drive to just get up in time. KLAATU set a pressured pace throughout, dueled through the turn and down the
lane, finally disposed of the pace presser in deep stretch to open an advantage only to be caught in the final stride by the winner. ONLYATTHESHOE
dueled on the pace from the inside from midway on the first turn through mid-stretch and was outkicked inside the final sixteenth in a game effort. JACK'S
ADVANTAGE stalked the leaders in striking distance the entire trip and finished evenly down the lane unable to close ground. KING SOCIAL broke outward
to be well wide into the first turn, continued to be wide around the first bend, moved up to striking distance down the backside and flattened out on the final
turn.

SPIRIT OF SEATTLE set a well rated pace through the turn, responded when called upon turning for home, widened the advantage to a clear lead and
kept-on unchallenged. MEXITEXAFORNIA prompted the pace to midway on the turn, failed to gain on the pacesetter when driven and finished as a clear
second best. ENJOY THE CRACKEN unhurried early to trail and rallied mildly in the lane to be along for the show. HEY HEY GOODBYE went evenly as a
non-threat. BLAZIANO chased the leaders for a half and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL M stalked the pace to the quarter pole, angled five wide at the head of the lane, took command at the eighth pole and cleared off. EXTRA
CRAFTY tracked the leaders from the inside to the top of the stretch, tried to split the two pacesetters in upper stretch, was shut off when SUPER SCAMP
came out and APPALACHIAN SPIRIT came in closing the opening, took up up off heels, angled out and finished willingly to be gaining late. APPALACHIAN
SPIRIT pressed the pace to midway on the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, kept on down the lane while drifting in and was outkicked late in the
drive. SUPER SCAMP hustled up the rail leaving the chute to set a pressured pace, dueled to upper stretch, drifted well out down the lane shutting off the
runner-up and weakened down the lane. WHATDID I BUY well placed in striking distance down the backside while four wide, made a mild bid approaching
the turn and failed to sustain the rally.

PERFETTO broke alertly to be the leader into the first turn, settled into a stalking position when straightening out down the backside, rallied on the far turn to
engage the pacesetter turning for home, quickly took control and drew off down the lane as much best. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL pulled to the lead around the
first turn while racing four wide, set the pace through the final turn, had no answer when challenged by the winner but kept-on well to hold the place. LUCKY
JUNIOR reserved off the pace to the far turn, rallied on the bend to close to a striking position and flattened out down the lane finishing evenly.
RUBINSTEIN tracked the leaders down the backside and lacked a closing bid when called upon. SECRET LIFE STYLE trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
CRYPTO COPY stalked the pacestter through the turn, was called upon nearing the quarter pole, rallied steadily down the stretch and wore his rival down in
the final sixteeenth. MISTER MOBIL well rated while setting the pace on a comfortable lead, maintained the advantage to the head of the stretch, dug-in
down the lane and was out-finished late in the drive in a good effort. VISUAL MISSION reserved off the leaders to the quarter pole and mounted a mild bid
in the stretch to pick up the show. DOUGS MORNING PICK tracked the leaders through the turn and lacked a closing response. STONE COLD CAT was
not a threat. RED HOT POWER well placed in striking distance on the bend and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
CAVALETTO prompted the early pace to the turn, rallied four wide between rivals under a drive to battle with the runner-up down the lane and prevailed,
pulling away near the wire. MAILS HERE reserved off the early pace, made a five wide bid while still under a hold to take the lead leaving the quarter pole,
dueled with the winner the length of the stretch and was out-finished in the final yards. NOAH MY BABY set the pace down the backside, had no answer
when engaged by the top pair on the turn and kept-on willingly to hold the show. EL SORDO trailed into the turn and found his best stride late to show
interest down the stretch. PLAYING BALL pressed the pace for three-eighths from between rivals and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
NEECHI unhurried early on to be near the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn while closing ground to the leaders, angled six wide turning for home
and prevailed in a determined drive. EXACTITUDE set the pace on a well measured lead, repelled the first challenger in the turn to be clear on the lead in
upper stretch and could not hold off the fast closing winner. IN TROUBLED WATERS stalked the pace to the turn, rallied on the bend to loom at the quarter
pole and failed to sustain his rally down the lane. CROSSED UP trailed most of the way and never posed a threat. CONSTITUTIONALIST broke awkwardly
to be last away, rushed up to press the pace down the backside and flattened out turning for home.

HIDDEN ACCESS set the pace on a well rated comfortable lead, repelled the challenge on the turn and held the closer safe while drifting in through the
lane. KNOCK WOOD tracked the pace down the backside, saved ground while dropping back to the top of the lane and rallied from the inside in upper
stretch, shifted out to avoid the pacesetter while not impeded and finished well without gaining on the winner. PAINT THE TOWN reserved off the pace to be
well off the leaders into the far turn and made up ground late. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied on the bend to loom
anearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the bid. MONSTER HUNTER trailed the entire trip never posing a threat.
