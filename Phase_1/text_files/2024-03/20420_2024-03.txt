Footnotes
LAWLESS TIMES stalked from the four to two path tucking behind the leaders around the first turn, loomed a danger awaiting room around the far turn,
decisively split the top pair entering the lane, and inched clear while drifting about. WALKSONWATER pressed three wide, chased under urging around the
far turn, got floated three wide entering the lane, yet ran on to edge place in the final furlong. RUSTY'S SUNRISE was bumped by an outer rival at the start,
showed the way along the inside while vying with an outer rival around both turns, disposed of his counterpart as the eventual winner bid entering the lane,
got bested by that one in upper stretch and slowly gave way. CHAPELLETE leaned in and bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path, moved
out of last before shifting to the five path nearing the furlong grounds and surpassed a tiring rival. AWREE vied two wide, but yielded between horses getting
floated three wide entering the lane. CLEARLY CREEPS broke a step slow, tracked in the five to four path around the first turn, but faded into the far turn
and was done early.

Footnotes
JET ROCKET showed the way inside of a pair of prompting rivals into and around the turn, shook clear entering the lane and drew off under a drive. MOION
bumped with an inner rival early on, prompted the pace three deep, vied with five sixteenths to go, but proved no match for the leader entering the lane and
lasted for place. SPARKLE CITY bumped with an outer foe early on, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, claimed show after tipping to the
four path entering the lane and chased thereafter while flopping leads. RADIANT REBEL broke slowly, laid off of the pace tucking from the five path to the
three path into the turn, tipped to the four path and between horses entering the lane and stayed on. CHUCHI was bumped by rivals on either side soon
after the start, raced at the rear along the inside, altered course to the three path passing the three sixteenths pole and improved between horses.
MALLORY'S OCEAN chased along the inside and failed to menace. D'BUSKER was brushed by an inner foe at the start, chased four wide, but floated to
the five path entering the lane and faded. SECRETLY SWEET brushed an outer rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, but weakened
nearing the lane.

furlong grounds, but got outkicked and edged place. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD prompted three deep, wrestled a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but met
a pair of outer challenges at the furlong grounds, proved no match for his widest confronter soon after and gradually yielded place. CAPTAIN COOL tracked
along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, chased between horses and dead heated for fourth. CREW DRAGON settled off of the pace in the
three path, shifted four wide nearing midstretch and moved up to dead heat for fourth. PLANE TALK sparred for the lead with a pair of outer rivals, but gave
way entering the final furlong. INTO THE SUNRISE vied for the lead two wide and between horses but faded nearing the furlong grounds. CURLY JACK
was outrun along the inside.

OLIVIA G settled off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, steadied behind foes nearing the three furlong pole, awaited racing room
dedicating to an inside run turning for home, managed to slip through entering upper stretch to offer a bid and drew clear at the furlong grounds.
DREWSILLA vied inside of a pair of foes around the first turn before rating back to stalk down the backstretch, tipped to take aim on the leader from the
three path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch along with an rail rival, but was outkicked by that one in midstretch and remained clear of the rest. MO
SMOKING tracked the leading trio from the two path, pursued between horses down the backstretch, shifted outside of them and to the five path at the three
furlong pole and ran on while one paced. SHELLI'S ANGEL broke a step slow and was taken in hand at the start, trailed along the inside, pursued from the
six path around the far turn then surpassed tiring rivals for a minor share. R T'S GEM vied two wide and between horses, showed the way inside of foes
while a path off of the inside into the far turn, but was headed between bidders in upper stretch and weakened. SMART IZZY pursued from midpack in the
four path, advanced approaching the far turn, but faded between horses entering the lane. SHES A LUCKY REBEL rushed to vie for the lead in the four
path, prompted the leader from the three path into the far turn, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
IMABOUTAGO (IRE) set a clear pace in the two path, widened well in hand in upper stretch and was kept to task while beggining to tire in the late stages.
TIPSY RUNNER was bumped between horses and put to crowded quarters at the start, raced at the rear in the two path into the turn, advanced shifting four
wide and floating out an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, then rallied to edge place in the final sixteenth. INTERMITTENT FAST tracked along the
inside, easily tipped off the rail in upper stretch, ran on to gain place from an inner foe in the final furlong but was caught by an outer bidder in the late
stages. SHARE THE BLESSING bumped an outer rival at the start laid off of the pace moving to the inside into the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch,
ran on mildly between horses in the final furlong but was outkicked for show. REAGAN'S FLAME chased from the three path, failed to sustain position
around the turn, got floated five wide in upper stretch and continued to give way. COPPER EM broke in and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from
midpack in the four path, got floated to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. INTEGRATED DESIGN stalked along the inside, chased in upper
stretch and weakened to outer foes in the final furlong. BLUE HEAVENLY lacked speed in the five path and made little impact. FLEET FROST was bumped
between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, retreated to trail entering the turn and was outrun thereafter.

GHENT set the pace inside of a prompting rival, shook free in upper stretch and held sway. SIR LIAM prompted outside of the eventual winner, failed to
maintain pressure in upper stretch, yet sustained a chase but was kept at bay. SEEKING SAWYER broke outwardly, chased in the three to four path, then
stayed on belatedly, gained show at the sixteenth pole and narrowed the gap on the leading pair. FIRST CLASS HARLOW broke outwardly, raced at the
rear in the four to five path into the turn, then shifted inwardly in the lane and stayed on. QUARRYMEN stalked the leading pair from the three path, but only
managed to chase in upper stretch and lacked a bid before weakening in the final furlong. VOYANT laid off of the pace in the four to five path and tired.
GRACIOUS KAT showed little along the inside.

Footnotes
NIGHT OUT steadied along the inside behind the leaders into the first turn, moved to stalk two wide around that bend pursued from the three path around
the far turn, bid in the four path and outside of the new leader in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds and held sway. SPECIAL DISPATCH laid off
of the pace in the four to two path around the first turn, pursued in the three path around the far turn before swinging to the five path entering upper stretch,
rallied flopping back to his left lead in midstretch, took aim on the leader in the final furlong but was only second best. SUGAR HOOK pursued from midpack
two to four wide around the first turn, then ran on between horses into the final furlong and edged show from an inner rival late. JUSTIFREAK pressed the
leader from the three path entering the backstretch, bid in the two path turning for home, led narrowly entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder
in upper stretch, yielded and relinquished show late. KING MENDELSSOHN saved ground off of the pace, paused behind a rival turning for home, then
sustained a mild chase through the lane. CARTHAGE CAJUN stalked along the inside, chased two wide entering the lane and faded. MIGHT AS WELL
showed the way tucking from the four path to the two path around the first turn, saved ground leading from an outer bidder turning for home, but was
headed by that one entering the lane and weakened. NOBLE EAGLE pursued from midpack along the inside into the first turn, but steadied while tugging
two to three wide and between horses around that bend, retreated before saving ground well back around the far turn, shifted off the inside entering the lane
and failed to factor. MAGICAL ROAD hesitated and spotted the rest multiple lengths behind the rest at the start, then was outrun along the inside.
COURAGEOUS CUPID got rank when put to crowded quarters among foes in the early stages and steadied hard, trailed in the three path around the first
turn and showed little.

Footnotes
GOBOT stalked in the three to four path, bid in upper stretch and edged past. FAMILY CREED set the pace, built a clear margin into the far turn but was
headed at the furlong grounds and held place. IDE LIKE HAWAII stalked along the inside, took aim in the three path and between horses in upper stretch,
ran on to bid for place while hanging on his left lead but was turned away. TRUE CRIMSON pursued from midpack in the four to two path around the first
turn, then from the three path before tipping to the four path into upper stretch, and stayed on. SKINNY BOBBY saved ground in midpack but to no avail.
CHIEF KIMOSABI pursued from off of the pace in the three to five path and failed to menace. CARLOS'S MAMA trailed and moved up in the lane.
PERFECT STRIKE lacked speed in the four path and between horses, saved ground around the far turn and faded. STAR READY pressed outside of the
leader and weakened into the far turn. LITTLE WARRIOR lacked speed hung in the six to five path early on and made little impact. OUR HEATSEEKER laid
well back long the inside, then in the four path and between horses around the far turn but never got involved.
