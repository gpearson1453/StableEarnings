Footnotes
ARTISTIC VISION pressed the early leader from the inside, angled out three deep and edged clear late under strong handling. LIGHTNING HART showed
good early foot to the early pace two deep, challenged into the upper stretch and kept on well to be second best. LICHITA chased the pace from the outside,
raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. PATSY R was allowed to settle early, had an inside run and not enough in the drive.
MARIAH'S CANDY stalked the pace, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. SCARLET POSITION dropped back early, saved
ground through the far turn and lacked a bid.

prevailed under strong handling. GOSPEL MUSKETEER was off a step slow, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole but couldn't get by in the drive in
a game effort. ONCE UPON A DREAM stalked the pace, raced four to five wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire while racing from the outside.
WIN FOR FUN stalked the pace, was near the rail past the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. DEL MOON showed good early speed along the
inside and gave way.

SWEET MEDICINE stalked the pace, saved ground and finished well to draw off and be well clear under steady pressure. JUST A IRISH LAD was allowed
to settle early, made a three wide move near the quarter pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. LIARS CLUB showed good early speed along the
inside and weakened. VANGILDER was off slowly, trailed early on, was five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. LEGIONARY lost ground to
race back and never threatened. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE stalked the pace three deep and tired readily.
