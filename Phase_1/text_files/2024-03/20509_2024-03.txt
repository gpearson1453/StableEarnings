GRAY ROYALITY stalked the pacesetters down the backside while well in hand, steadily gained ground on the far turn under a drive, engaged the leader
midway down the lane and pulled clear in deep stretch. MISS FUSSY PANTS set a well rated pace to the final turn, responded when challenged turning for
home and finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner. PRANCIPANTS tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied four wide on the turn and
could not close ground on the top pair. MAGESTAL BASTIDA trailed most of the way and passed a tired rival down the lane. UNCAPTURED FAITH
pressed the pace down the backside and gave way on the final bend.

MY TWO JAKES prompted the pace through the turn, engaged the pacesetter in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and prevailed in the final strides.
HALO EFFECT set a well rated pace, responded when challenged turning for home, battled down the stretch and was out-finished nearing the wire in a
game effort. TITEBLUEJEANS tracked the leaders in striking distance to midway down the lane, found his best stride late to be gaining on the top pair in
deep stretch. DEE'S KY WILDCAT went evenly without impact. STARLITESLEW contended in the early going and steadily gave way.

READ THE ROOM taken in hand leaving the gate, angled to the outside in the clear for the run down the backside, circled five wide to challenge turning for
home, dueled through the lane and won the bob. SMALL SAILOR tracked the leaders from the inside through the turn, saved ground cutting the corner to
engage the leaders at the top of the lane, battled down the stretch and just missed at the wire. WHEN IN ROME set the pace to the quarter pole, responded
in upper stretch and weakened inside the eighth pole while holding the show. MIGHTY PELE showed brief speed to prompt the early pace and faded on the
turn. INSACIABLE PRINCE trailed most of the way as a non-factor. OUTSLEWTHEM prominent down the backside, rallied on the turn to threaten nearing
the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally, flattening out in the lane.

EPICUREAN set the pace on a well rated lead, opened a clear advantage on the turn and held sway in the drive. DATTTSAFANCYFOX reserved off the
pace to midway on the turn, commenced a steady advance from the inside saving ground and kept on in the lane to be steadily cutting into the winner's
advantage. SHEISTHEHERO tracked the pacesetter through the turn while racing five wide and made a mild bid in the stretch to be along for the show.
LOADED ONCE MORE stalked the leader to the top of the lane and wekened in the drive. CHARGINA trailed throughout and never proved to be a factor.

Footnotes
MY BROTHER CAM settled off the pace down the backside, split rivals in an early bid around the turn, angled out at the quarter pole to engage the leader in
upper stretch, took command nearing the eighth pole, drifted in through the lane and prevailed in the stretch drive. SMASH prompted the pace to be
prominent throughout, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken by the winner in mid-stretch and kept-on willingly down the lane while being
herded by the clear leader. ICE BLAST trailed the field through the final turn and found best stride late to mount a belated rally in the stretch. RUNAWAY
HARRY set the pace under pressure down the backside, continued to duel on the lead to upper stretch and gradually gave way. BOBBY'S GIFT broke
awkwardly, raced mid-pack and continued one-paced failing to menace. STRIKE THE TOP raced near the rear of the field throughout and passed tiring
rivals in the stretch. FUEGO CALIENTE stalked the paceto the far turn, made a four wide bid into the turn and flattened out. BLAME IT ON EDDIE tracked
the leaders from the inside entering the backside, made an early bid to lead after a half mile and came up empty. THE RIDER OF SMASH CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.
