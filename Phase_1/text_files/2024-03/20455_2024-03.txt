the pace while three wide, then bid on the far turn while coming out five wide and came up evenly in the stretch. UPTOWN GOLDENGOODS chased the
pace while two wide and between rivals in the early furlongs, then made mild bid on the far turn before giving way in the home stretch. JULIE'S PASSION

Footnotes
CATO'S LADY was nicely rated along the inside while stalking the leader into the turn, then gained command in the upper stretch and drew clear in the late
stretch to prevail in the end. WATCH THIS MUNNY was allowed to settle along the inside, then circled seven wide leaving the bend and was gaining ground
in the late stretch and was best for the place prize. ROZEY CHEEKS bid for the lead early before settling back to chase the pace from the three path, then
menaced leaving the turn, lacked the winning bid and kept on for the show prize. WAVING BYE chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, then
bid leaving the turn and needed more in the end. TOOTIE chased the pace while two wide under a steady drive and needed more in the stretch. CRYSTAL
CRESCENT was bumped on both sides then raced at the back of the field while two wide, bid while five wide on the turn before flattening out in the late
stretch. KELLEY SAID READY broke inwardly and bumped rival, then led the way along the inside, was in a long drive leaving the bend before being over
powered by rivals on both sides and gave way in the end. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA broke outwardly and bumped rival, then stalked the pace from the two,
was in a hard drive throughout the turn, was used up and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAST ATTACK stalked the pace while three wide in the early furlongs, then moved up to battle with inner rivals at the top of the far turn, gained command
leaving the bend and held on well down the lane to prevail in the end. MACHO GRANDE stalked the pace from the inside, remained well rated on the far
turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch and was closing in on the leader in the late stretch but it wasn't enough and was best for second place. DINERO DE
LA CASA steadied heading into the first turn, then chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, rallied leaving the far and closed well for the show
prize in the end. BISHOP CREEK saved ground early, then urged eagerly on the far turn, came out four wide and was closing well down the lane but it was
too late in the end. STRUCTURED was allowed to settle while two wide, then from the inside on the far turn then rallied too little too late in the stretch.
HOLD MY BEER BRO chased the pace while three wide at a moderate pace, then bid leaving the far turn before flattening out in the late stretch.
TOOLITTLETOOLATE led the way into the first to set the pace down the backstretch, was met with outer rivals on the far turn to battle it out, was
extinguished and weakened in the late stretch. PHILANTHROPER raced in the middle of the pace while two wide, then bid from the inside on the far turn
and came up empty in the end. SKI CAT stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to vie for the lead between rivals,
was in a hard drive then stopped in the late stretch. THE OX settled along the inside and failed to rally. TEXANO HERO was rank throughout the first turn,
then faded after the half and walked off.
