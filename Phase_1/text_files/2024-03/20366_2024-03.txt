MAGICAL MONARCH sped to the early lead, opened up on the backstretch, remained along the inner rail and was kept under pressured in the drive.
SURFBOARD raced in the two path outside ASCENDANCE and weakened through the stretch. ASCENDANCE , near the inner rail throughout, gave way
the final furlong. TUBTIMSIAM , three wide the first turn, failed to menace and steadily retreated through the stretch. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD was
outrun. FULL PROOF hugged the inner rail on the far turn, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) , four then three wide prompting outside CASINO TRICKS, moved alongside mid turn, dueled, gained a slim lead inside the three
sixteenths, lost the advantage a sixteenth out, battled back under solid handling and got back up in the final jumps. CASINO TRICKS was nudged clear
early, set the pace off the inside, was joined leaving the three eighths, stayed on after being headed in upper stretch, fought back to gain a short lead past
the sixteenth pole, fought gamely but just wasn't quite good enough. WEST STAR drafted back off the early pace, was under pressure saving ground
around the turn, stayed inside for the drive and closed willingly. RASCALLY REBEL , three deep chasing the leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted five
wide for the drive, raced on his left lead and finished evenly. GREAT DAYS AHEAD drafted inward when edging up past the half, saved ground chasing the
embattled leaders mid turn, eased out a path with aim in upper stretch, lacked a punch past the sixteenths marker then faded. ALIFEROUS , urged along
soon after the break, moved up between runners past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide while in range in upper stretch, failed to kick on past mid stretch
and gave way. LUV YA BYE BYE stumbled at the break, recovered and rushed up soon after to be in a stalking spot off the rail, steadied as GREAT DAYS
AHEAD was angled in past the half, dropped back mid turn then swung well wide for the drive.

Footnotes
GOODBYE NOTE , right to the front, raced well off the rail down the backstretch, moved inward entering the far turn and drew off in the drive while under
encouragement. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE hugged the inner rail and was caught in narrow quarters mid way on the far turn, remained along the rail
through the stretch and finished gamely. DAVYJONZ bore in on rivals leaving the starting gate, raced near the rail on the far turn, swung to the three path
turning for home and flattened out. BRADY BEAR was bumped and placed in tight quarters after hopping at the break, advanced three wide on the far turn
and weakened between horses in the stretch run. GLASS OF COURAGE , kept outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide and gave
way. ALBERT FINNIGAN , steadied when bumped and forced in by DAVYJONZ leaving the starting gate, was no factor.

Footnotes
THENCOMEMORNING quickly went clear then set a rated pace towards the inside, responded when asked in upper stretch, held a large lead past mid
stretch, wandered outward despite right handed asks then maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire. EARLEY ROSE saved ground, was pushed
along past the five sixteenths, remained towards the inner rail into the lane, advanced to the inside of NEVER DONE leaving mid stretch and churned on
willingly to gain the place. NEVER DONE , a bit awkward from the gate, edged up four deep into and around the first turn, emerged as the closest pursuer
through the backstretch turn, came under a hustling ride past the three eighths, entered the lane three wide and faded. SHE SO COOL lagged back, saved
ground into the stretch and failed to menace. BRIEF , three wide between foes into the first turn, steadied back off foes leaving the seven eighths, was
under asking three wide into the far turn, lacked a punch nearing the stretch and faded. HAZELMOOR BEACH , two wide between foes early, faltered
leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
BUMP N RUN , four then three wide under rating and stalking the pace, edged up in hand mid turn, moved to engage the leader soon into the lane, gained a
slim lead between runners past the three sixteenths, emerged in a battle to the inside of THREE OVER DEUCES nearing the sixteenth pole, kept on
determinedly under left handed asks and narrowly prevailed. THREES OVER DEUCES , brushed at the break, settled outside rivals while not too far back,
ranged up four wide into the lane, came in a bit under right handed urging near the three sixteenths, had his rider drop the left rein when switching sticks in
mid stretch, recovered to duel outside BUMP N RUN through the final sixteenth, kept on gamely and just missed. OURNATIONONPARADE , between
runners near the half, was under a ride saving some ground past the five sixteenths, swung out in the drive, churned on and just nabbed the show. NO
CENTS broke a step slow, quickly recovered and reached a stalking spot towards the rail, chased behind the leading trio past three sixteenths, shifted out
late and kept on with interest. SWILL stumbled at the break, recovered and moved up to the inside of KARAN'S NOTION to take command heading to the
half, set the pace just off the inside, was joined by the winner into the stretch, battled inside foes past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. KARAN'S
NOTION , hustled from the gate to gain an early lead, ceded to an inner rival past the five eighths, forced the issue to the three eighths then dropped back.

mile and gave way through the stretch. CHAMPAGNE DANCE sprinted to the early lead, saved ground around the turn disputing the pace, weakened and
swung outside in mid stretch. JOYFUL KITTEN raced along the inner rail, was done on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
MARGIN OF AIR , four wide into the first turn, dropped in a bit and shadowed the leader through the backstretch run, moved to engage leaving the far turn,
poked a head in front after six furlongs, went clear soon after, responded to firm asking in upper stretch then steadily pulled away while kept to task and
drifting out. UNDER THE RADAR , pinched back at the break, regrouped and raced well back leaving the three quarter pole, came under a ride saving
ground into the far turn, advanced inside a foe then angled out, circled five wide into the stretch, leveled off to his best stride leaving mid stretch and gained
the place. JOLLY BY GOLLY , a bit keen saving ground behind the leaders around the first turn, settled down to stalk while saving ground through the
backstretch run, came under a ride near the five sixteenths, got through along the rail to have aim in upper stretch, chased past mid stretch then faded.
CROSSLAND stalked outside a rival, was under urging past the five sixteenths, came three wide for the drive and weakened. SAGRADA RAY , bumped at
the break then settled in the clear, was put to a ride around the final turn, raced three wide giving chase into the stretch and weakened. CAPONE , three
wide to the lead into the first turn, set the pace off the inside, took pressure exiting the far turn, failed to contain the winner past the five sixteenths, stayed on
to upper stretch then surrendered. SHELLBACK , bumped at the start, was outrun.

Footnotes
NO MORE MASK showed speed in the two path between horses down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn setting a pressured pace, remained along
the inner rail through the stretch and prevailed under smooth, steady handling. TWEET AWAY ROBIN reared at the break, rushed up outside horses down
the backstretch, circled th turn four wide and passed a tired rival late. FANCY PRINCESS , three wide, prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened
through the stretch. MATOULA lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn, through the stretch and passed a tired foe. I HAVE COURAGE , outrun,
stayed along the inner rail on the turn and swung wide in upper stretch. LUNITA hugged the inner rail around the turn and gave way.
