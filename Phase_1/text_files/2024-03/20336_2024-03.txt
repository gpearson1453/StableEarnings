Footnotes
ZOOM ERIN prompted outside of the pace setter, steadied while pulling around the first turn, led and assumed command leaving the half mile pole, drew off
around the far turn and widened under a drive through the lane. RYAN'S GRACE trailed in the four to two path around the first turn, shifted out around the
far turn before fanning to the seven path in upper stretch, then moved up to reach place late. SWIZZLECITY was slow into stride, settled off of the pace in
the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, ran on to claim place in the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder soon after. INDY
LOVER saved ground in pursuit off of the pace, but lacked a response to urging in the two path around the far turn and failed to menace. BE BO showed the
way inside of the eventual winner entering the backstretch, but proved no match for that one while losing place with seven sixteenths to go, sustained a
chase turning for home to regain place in upper stretch, but shifted off the rail and tired between horses in the final sixteenth. LADY SHYLOCK tracked in
the three path, gained place at the seven sixteenths pole, chased the clear leader while not threatening around the far turn and weakened between horses
through the lane.

Footnotes
LILY'S CREED broke a touch inwardly, dictated terms showing the way along the inside, opened up traveling well in hand around the far turn, then was
driven in upper stretch and held sway safely. MACEE stalked in the three path, tugged while asked to tip inside of an outwardly-bearing inner foe around the
first turn, continued stalking pursuit outside of the winner down the backstretch, but chased while failing to keep pace with that one around the far turn, then
remained clear of show. PLANTS AND BIRDS raced at the rear in the four path and moved up between horses late. FREEFORM took contact from rivals on
both sides at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. SECRET MELODY shied inwardly from an outer rival at the start, tracked
shifting from the two path to the five path entering the backstretch, pursued from the four path approaching the far turn, but chased while drifting back to the
four path turning for home, and weakened outside of foes. STAR'S DREAM bumped an inner rival at the at the start, tucked from the four to two path while
off of the pace around the first turn, then saved ground around the far turn but to no avail. MS. PRIESTLY bumped an outer foe at the start, prompted
outside of the leader into the first turn, but bore to the four path around that turn, faded between horses shortly after, was done early and eased through the
lane.

CCED FOR STEPH bumped with an inner foe at the start, led from an inner prompter into the turn, drew away from an outer bidder in upper stretch and
widened under a drive. LOYAL TO THE CHIEF bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the three path, ranged up to striking distance nearing the
lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, yielded while hanging on his left lead yet just lasted for place. BLESS D'SOUTH lagged behind
along the inside into the turn, picked up stride shifting to the six path entering the lane and rallied outside of foes to miss reaching place at the wire. ADDI
BUG tracked in the four path, but lacked a bid while chasing through the lane and lost show late. CRYPTO BRAVE laid off of the pace in the three to four
path but lacked a rally. MRS. NECAISE chased along the inside and steadily faded turning for home. WHY WAIT prompted inside of the eventual winner
into the turn, but failed to sustain prossure turning for home and gave way. STOP SHOP N DROP broke slowly, lacked speed in the five path and got
outrun.

Footnotes
BELLA CRUELLA showed the way along the inside, shook free of pursuers entering the lane and held sway from an outer bidder. JOCASTA was bumped
between horses leaving the gates and took back soon after, trailed in the two to three paths before swinging to the six path entering the lane, rallied to gain
place and take aim on the clear leader at the furlong grounds, gradually closed in but was kept at bay through the late stages. BERLAINE stalked along the
inside, smoothly took aim outside of the clearing leader entering the lane, but was outkicked for place by an outer rival in midstretch and held show from an
inner bidder. ANSWER THE CALL bumped an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the two to three path and between horses into the first turn,
checked to tuck inside of her inner counterpart approaching the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, ran on with a rail charge to bid for show, but
missed that position. CORA'S LEGACY stalked two wide, but faded between horses after getting floated three wide entering the lane. ON THE NILE
pursued from midpack along the inside, moved out to the two path around the first turn, chased between horses down the backstretch, then faded.
DANCING NANCY bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked from the four to three path, got floated back to the four path entering the lane and weakened
between horses.

NORTHERNREFLECTION pursued from midpack along the inside, gained place tipping out to take aim on the leader from the three path in upper stretch,
bid at the furlong grounds, wrestled command at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. GALLANT STAR head his headed turned inwardly when the gates
sprung and was brushed by an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, shifted in to offer a rail rally in the final furlong and edged place late.
AND FIFTY set a clear pace around both turns, but was caught by an outer bidder in the final furlong, weakened yet saved show at the wire. HOT LE ROY
bumped an inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the four to three path, chased under urging in the four path around the far turn before fanning to
the six path entering the lane, and stayed on to miss reaching show. UNFATHOMED raced forwardly along the inside, but brushed with an outer rival while
steadying into the first turn, shifted out to the four path while rank around that opening bend, pursued around the far turn then sustained an even chase
through the lane. ZONG TOUGH bumped an outer foe at the start, steadied while brushing with an inner rival into the first turn, recovered to stalk the clear
leader from the three path, chased that one from the two path around the far turn, but yielded between horses after getting floated to the four path in upper
stretch. PINCH ME A PENNY steadied when bumped between horses and put to crowded quarters at the start, got a bit keen well back along the inside in
the opening stages, then saved ground to no avail. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER brushed an inner rival at the start, then trailed throughout.

FREEBURN led from an outer vying rival around the turn, drove clear of that one leaving the quarter pole, drew off and was put to hand with a sixteenth to
go. LUYV pressed outside of the top pair, chased them drifting to the four to five path turning for home, kept on to claim place nearing midstretch, drifted out
subtly in the final furlong and was second best. DAT GUITAR tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out to the three path entering upper stretch and
sustained pursuit while one paced. LOUISIANA LIBERTY laid off of the in the four to six path, improved position to gain show in midstretch, but flattened out
and was bested by an inner bidder late. CANKTON'S COWGIRL vied outside of the eventual winner, but weakened in upper stretch. DANCE LIL DARLING
was put to crowded quarters and steadied back at the start, trailed in the two to three path and got outrun.

Footnotes
CAPER'S HOOLEY brushed with an inner foe at the start, set a clear pace around the turn and held well. RUNAWAY JOKE broke out before being quickly
corrected at the start, tracked in the four path, claimed place nearing the lane, but only managed to chase the clear leader through the final furlong and
lasted for place. MAP TO THE STARS broke a step slow and was bumped between horses at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, moved out
to the four path and between horses in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for show along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, dueled and clung to that
position while closing on on place late. TAKETHEFIFTH brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked forwardly early on but steadied after getting bumped
by an inner rival at the nine sixteenths pole, recovered off of the pace in the three path and between horses into the turn, tipped to he five path in upper
stretch, stayed on to bid for show along with an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, sparred for that position but missed. HERO WORSHIP was a bit hesitant to
load, then stalked in the three path and between horses around the turn, but gave way nearing midstretch. BALTIMORE HEART was bumped between
horses at the start, checked slightly to maneuver inside of a troubled rival passing the nine sixteenths pole, saved ground off of the pace around the bend,
but to no avail. BRONTE DIEM was tough to load, then lunged into the inner stall door, got rank and bumped an inner rival at the start, then steadied when
an outer foe crossed over soon after, trailed in the two to three path, moved to the five path in upper stretch and failed to threaten between horses.
LUCCHESI laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted out to the six to seven path in upper stretch but made little impact. DIAMOND LORD bumped an
outer rival at the start, chased forwardly along the inside, bumped an outer foe to pursue from the two path at the nine sixteenths pole, chased around the
turn, but weakened through the final furlong hanging on his left lead.
