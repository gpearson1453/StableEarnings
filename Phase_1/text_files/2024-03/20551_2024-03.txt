Footnotes
ESCAPOLOGIST broke back, dropped to the inside first turn, moved closer after half, continued to save ground second turn, roused in upper stretch, lodged
a rail bid inside the leader, dueled, proved best in a determined effort. U. S. ARMY moved up to take control soon after the start, set the pace while under
restraint, shrugged off a a couple of foes turning for home, allowed the winner the inside past the furlong marker, outdueled late, well clear of the others.
CAN'T HUSH THIS stalked the pace three wide, moved closer late in the second turn, lacked a winning punch through the lane. PATS PROPERTY
prompted the leader for three quarters off the inside, lodged a brief bid between horses late in the final bend, also failed to follow through. ACCIDENTAL
HERO within striking distance early, fell back before a half, angled four wide into the lane, lacked a rally. ETHEREAL ROAD of a bit slow, lacked speed,
floated out five wide turning for home, also failed to produce a closing response.

Footnotes
TASK angled to the inside late first turn, saved ground into the far turn, steered back out three wide late in that bend, bid, dueled, edged clear latge.
BURLSWORTH moved out while closest to the leader, closed on that one late in the final turn, bid between horses, put a head in front entering the stretch,
dueled to the wire inside the winner, could not match that one late, clearly second best. PEARCY ROAD lacked early foot off the inside, three wide through
the final turn, staged a mild rally while proving no match for the top two. SECRET STRATEGY off a step slow, raced well back for six furlongs, displayed
some modest late interest to improve position. OUTLAW RUN in mid pack and three wide first turn, moved inside second turn, went evenly through the lane.
CRABTREE off a step slow, saved ground to no avail. BRADFORD main body while toward the inside, continued inside and also had nothing for the drive.
YOUNG JONESBORO tired while racing four wide for most of the way. TURQUOISE BLUE broke on top, got clear first turn, continued to set the pace, gave
way turning for home. EMPYREAL SHADOW very wide first turn, continued far out in the strip, pulled up through that bend, vanned off.

Footnotes
GOULD'S GOLD in the second flight while off the inside, moved out a bit and came four wide for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time.
WANTS N NEEDS moved up to race with the pace while three wide and between foes, continued to vie through the turn, held a narrow advantage upper
stretch and past the furlong marker, continued to hold a narrow lead lane, nailed in the final strides. RUN JALEN RUN away in good order, set or forced the
pace along the inside, remained on equal terms with the winner and runner up into the stretch, remained stubborn until late, saved the show. COACH JIMI D
broke alertly, also was with the pace between horses, two path into the stretch, gradually weakened the final furlong. BROWNSTONE lacked speed along
the inside, failed to seriously menace. HANDSOME HERB hesitated at the break, trailed early as a result, lodged a mild middle move three wide late in the
turn, flattened out through the stretch. JESTER SANG with the pace while racing four wide, gave way in the drive. STRAIT RUSH off a step slow, remained
back while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
STRAVA allowed the pace to go early while in the two path through the first turn, advanced into contention three wide through the second bend, book over
into the lane, clear past the furlong marker, enough left to last. ALEJANDRO last away, raced back off the pace, began to move far turn, came four wide into
the stretch to lose some ground, lodged a late challenge outside the winner, missed. TAPSASIONAL prompted the issue from the outside early, vied
between horses into the lane, lost some position past midstretch, came back for the show while not a threat to the top pair. TAHOE RUN sprinted clear to
set the early pace toward the inside, continued to show the way second turn, weakened when headed by the winner entering the stretch. TRIDENT HIT
saved ground when off the pace inside, continued one paced through the second turn inside, came up empty for the stretch run. DASH ATTACK moved
closer along the inside before a half, remained within striking distance through the second turn, had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
UNDER THE PALMS never far back off the inside, crept closer three wide in the far turn, dueled into the stretch in the two path, continued to battle on past
the furlong marker, edging clear late. HAPPY TALK last away, continued to lack speed early, closer in the two path when asked late in the second turn,
moved out a bit and continued willingly to be getting to the winner late while up for the place. BONAQUA sprinted clear to set the pace inside, continued to
show the way into the far turn, responded when the winner came calling turning for home, dueled through upper stretch, yielded late, caught for the place
final strides. XENA chased the leader for about six furlongs in the two path and weakened. TAP THE CHAMPAGNE void of speed off the rail, three wide
into the lane, not a real threat. WHO'S TICKET in traffic through the first turn when slow to settle along the inside, was finished after half. DEFINING JOY
forwardly placed for a half, steadily faded thereafter.

Footnotes
BOURBON BASH in mid pack early along the inside, accelerated and moved closer late in the turn, squeezed through a narrow opening turning for home
exchanging several bumps with early leader CLEAR THE AIR, vied with that one and another vial past the furlong marker, kicked clear late. JUILLIARD off
the early pace just off the rail, inside rally to finish up willingly and be in time for the place. SHOPPER'S REVENGE off a step slow, lacked speed for a half,
steered out three wide, belated rally to gain the show. LATE NITE RADIO void of speed along the inside, roused into the lane, shifted out when straightened
for home, improved position with some modest late interest. I'M WIDE AWAKE in the second flight while racing off the inside, moved closer four wide turning
for home, flattened out in the drive. ROCKING ROCKET pressed the issue up front off the inside, lodged a three wide bid in the turn, held a narrow
advantage between calls into the stretch, faltered. CLEAR THE AIR broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane when exchanging
bumps turning into the stretch, weakened. FLYING HOUDINI broke back, was not involved while racing in the two path. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN EXITING THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

MILITANT forwardly placed inside, pulled in some traffic first turn, remained within striking distance, toward the inside, two path second turn, set down,
closed with good energy, split foes to be pulling away end. DAILY GRIND prompted the leader from the outside, inched closer then challenged between
horses late in the final turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. STRONSINO
forwardly placed three wide from the start, challenged on the outside late in the second turn, vied through upper stretch, not enough in the late going for the
place. RIYADH MOON broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, responded when challenged late in the final turn, battled on through midstretch then
weakened the final furlong. DJANGO void of speed while just off the inside first turn, continued back, three to four wide when making a mild advance in the
second turn, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. ELKO COUNTY in mid pack while racing inside, one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. MO
EL GRANDE off a step slow, trailed after a half, improved into the stretch then went flat late. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN broke back, lacked speed, lodged a
middle move while five wide into the far turn, faltered in the drive. P J'S SONG off a step slow, raced in mid pack while outside, dropped inside when
beginning to weaken second turn, continued to tire stretch. AK SAR BEN DERBY stopped after a half, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
PROVE WORTHY lacked speed just off the inside early, continued back in the run up the backstretch, began to more far turn, angled out five wide while
between horses, continued to rally upper stretch, bid with less than a furlong remaining, came in to help impede MEDIA MOGUL late, edged away late
under firm handling. INEXORABLE void of speed, continued back the middle half, knifed out four wide and between horses turning for home, shifted out a
bit for room inside the furlong marker and finished willingly between foes to be up for the place. UNDERHILL'S TAB closest to the leader off the rail, closer
then challenged between horses into the lane, fell back off the leader a bit then stayed on to gain the nod for the place. KING RUSSELL broke back, lacked
speed inside, worked way out to be four wide exiting the final turn, roused, was advancing in traffic when forced to steady when impeded a sixteenth out,
recovered but was too late for the show. MEDIA MOGUL behind the pace off the inside, closer three wide late in the final turn, challenged on the outside
soon after, gained the advantage, lugged in when showing the way past the furlong marker, lugged out to tighten up MEDIA MOGUL with a sixteenth
remaining and then weakened. ELUSIVE TARGET four wide when off the pace into the first turn, raced back, fanned six wide into the stretch, displayed
some late interest while widest at the wire. CAPTIVATING BOY broke on top, two to three wide first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch,
briefly responded when challenged turning for home then faltered. TEN DAYS LATER off a step slow, failed to menace while saving ground throughout.
DOCTOR NASH in the second flight inside, moved out when still within striking distance to be in the three path turning for home, had nothing left. NIP N
TUCK tired after racing four wide through both turns. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

FROSTED GRACE in the second flight while off the inside, continued to stalk the dueling leaders in the three path up the backstretch, moved to challenge
late in the final turn, dueled through upper stretch and past the furlong marker under steady handling. SILVER PROSPECTOR dueled up front in the two
path, briefly garnered a larger advantage far turn, engaged with the winner for a second duel into the stretch, gave ground grudgingly. NAUTICAL STAR
bothered along the inside into the first turn, bided time up the backstretch, steered out three wide turning for home, along for the show while not picking up
any ground on the top two. DENINGTON last away, trailed while racing off the inside, three to four wide second turn, improved slightly without posing a
serious threat. MIDNIGHT RISING came in, rank first turn, in the second flight toward the inside, came up empty when the real running began turning for
home. LAST SAMURAI moved up to duel inside, alternated up front up the backstretch, first to blink far turn, continued to back up through the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BAND tracked the two leaders while off the inside, came three wide for the drive, roused for the drive, kicked down the leader late from the
outside while showing good resolve. DADDYSRUBY broke on top despite bumping with ROYAL SPA, dueled up front while off the inside, salted the other
speed away to be clear into the lane, continued to hold a daylight advantage until late, failed to contain the winner while holding the place in the final strides.
ROYAL SPA off a step slow, remained devoid of speed for a half, in the two path turning for home, set down, made a good run through some traffic to annex
the show. LEELOO lacked speed while just off the inside, moved out and was four wide exiting the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest while widest
through the lane. HOOSIER PHILLY in the second fight outside, three to four wide through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick.
ZEITLOS raced in mid pack toward the inside, had little for the drive. TRAVERSE remained back while saving ground through the turn. MUCHO MACHO
GIRL moved up to duel inside the runner up, alternated with that one into the turn, weakened midway on the bend, continued to fade through the stretch.

Footnotes
THORPEDO ANNA away in good order, stalked the pace from an outside position and three wide through the first turn, continued to lurk in the run up the
backstretch, moved to challenge while remaining in the three path final turn under confident handling, gained the advantage into the lane, drew clear with
authority while only being shown a left handed crop to win ridden out. WEST OMAHA settled off the pace and the inside, let out a notch and cruised up
closer four wide turning for home, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, remained comfortably clear for the second spot. TAPIT JENALLIE
lacked early foot while outside, remained well out in the strip into the far turn, four to five wide into the stretch, along for the show late while not a threat to
the top two. ALL THINGS GO off a step slow, raced back while bothered a bit early, moved closer before a half from between horses, remained in the
second flight through the final turn, went evenly through the stretch. RECHARGE broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn along the
inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, yielded to the winner entering the stretch and weakened. BA DEE YAH settled behind the pace along the inside,
continued to save ground in the second flight through the second turn, came up empty for the drive. LEMON MUFFIN lacked speed, continued to race near
the back up the backstretch, dropped to the inside for the second turn, managed little in the way of a response. MY MANE SQUEEZE unruly in the gate
prior to the start, broke back, trailed early, picked off a rival or two while never making an impact. CANDY AISLE pressed the early leader in the two path,
moved with the winner inside that one to challenge second turn, readily gave way through the stretch. IN JUST MY HEELS was finished after a half and
trailed home.

Footnotes
MUTH slipped at the start while breaking forwardly, prominent through the first turn three wide, pressed the issue early backstretch, dueled late backstretch
and into the far turn, disposed of that foe turning for home and kicked well clear under steady handling. JUST STEEL forwardly placed while four wide
through the first turn, continued to race within striking distance in the second flight outside, moved slightly closer to the winner briefly midway on the final
turn, could do little more with that one through the lane, clearly second best. MYSTIK DAN in mid pack outside in the first turn, slight bother and carried out
four wide onto the backstretch, made a mild advance while four wide in the second bend, stalled a bit in the drive but managed to be up late for the show, no
match for the top two. TIMBERLAKE made an early move from between horses to show the way onto the backstretch, dueled inside the winner into the far
turn, first to blink exiting that bend, continued to gradually weaken in the run to the wire, lost the show late. INFORMED PATRIOT in mid pack and three
wide through the first turn, moved out and was four wide early in the far turn, lacked a closing punch in the drive. LIBERAL ARTS back off the early pace
while between horses into the first turn, very rank late in that bend, got out to bother a pair of outer rivals, two to four wide second turn, evenly through the
stretch. TIME FOR TRUTH bumped at the start, set the early pace inside the winner, fell back in the second flight, weakened through the lane. IMPERIAL
GUN void of speed while four wide and keen into the first turn, bothered, carried out by LIBERAL ARTS onto the backstretch, continued back, four to five
wide again into the stretch, failed to rally. WILL TAKE IT last away, moved up a bit toward the inside to mid pack, failed to make an impact thereafter.
DIMATIC bumped at the break, raced in some traffic first turn, gave way in the second bend. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
RUN THROUGH THE FIRST TURN, LIBERAL ARTS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED EIGHTH.FROM SIXTH.

Footnotes
XYLOPHONE off a step slow, raced back early, advanced four to five wide through the final turn, continued willingly while widest down the lane to be up in
time. LET'S DUET off a step slow, trailed well back inside, continued to save ground through the final turn, in some traffic late in that bend, steered out
around a tiring rival, dropped back inside and continued to rally up the inside to be in time for the place. THESTRAL settled off the pace and the inside,
moved closer three to four wide late second turn to challenge into the stretch, showed the way past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two.
ABSINTHE forwardly placed while off the inside, four wide into the far turn, challenged three wide midway on that bend, vied into and through upper stretch
between horses, kicked in the late going. WILDWOOD BYE unhurried early while saving ground, continued inside, angled out four wide turning into the
stretch, improved upper, flattened out to lose a couple of positions late. MALIBU SMART lacked speed, three wide through the second turn, improved
position upper stretch, saw that improvement stall late while still gaining some ground on the first flight. SISTER KISSES broke alertly, narrowly set the pace
along the inside, gave way in the drive. BLAME DAY dueled up front while off the inside, also faltered through the stretch. FAITH ALONE raced in mid pack,
while three wide through the first turn, continued back, carried out three wide by the runner up late in the final turn, lacked a rally. ESME off a step slow,
remained back. HUNTLEIGH forwardly placed early outside, gave way after a half, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.
