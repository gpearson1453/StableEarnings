Footnotes
LIPS SAY BLISS with pace from the start, set a pressured set of fractions along the inside, shook off nearest pursuer late in the final turn then held the
runner up safe late in a determined effort. TRIGGER HAPPY in the second flight off the inside, closer three wide second turn, chased the winner past the
furlong marker, closed the gap on that one a bit in the run to the wire but was still outkicked in the end. RECKER POINT settled off the pace inside,
continued to track in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, steered out to be three wide into the stretch, mild interest to be clear of the rest. LUNA
VIEJA in mid pack while off the inside, three to four wide into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. DANCE SOME MO last to
leave, raced five wide into the first turn, pressed the winner up the backstretch and into the far turn off the inside, weakened in the drive. WHAT'S UP DOC
fell back to trail after the start, remained back and was never involved. RAM off the pace and the inside, four to five wide second turn, backed up through the
stretch.

Footnotes
PATTON'S TIZZY broke alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside, asked into the lane, edged clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late
under continued steady handling. KISSOFTHENILE prompted the pace while three wide, crept closer with a quarter remaining, fell back off the winner past
the furlong marker,. narrowed the gap late, held sway for the place. SUNDAY SPIRIT four wide into the far turn, continued outside while falling back a bit,
lost some ground to the winner into the lane, getting back to that one and runner up late with some late interest. STREAKIN DEACON lacked early foot,
moved closer in some traffic in the two path late turn, continued toward the inside, went evenly to the wire. MONEYSTRIKE pressed the winner from
between horses for a half, weakened turning for home. BET ALL THE GOLD moved up inside after the start, stalled, shuffled back into the far turn, went
evenly thereafter after losing that position. SWIFT KEY off the pace and the inside, three to four wide early in the turn, failed to rally. BERRYVILLE BULLET
remained back in lacking a closing response. IT'S A RAINY DAY off a step slow, was always outrun.

HOLDING PATTERN off a step slow, void of speed off the inside, came five wide for the drive, closed full of run down the middle of the strip to win going
away. STOMPING HOTROD forwardly placed up the backstretch between horses, challenged through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, could not
contain the winner, narrowly held the place. YOU VEE CEE forwardly placed inside while beside the runner up, fell back off that one turning for home,
coming back on that same rival late while also not a match for the winner. ALLO ENRY off the pace outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting,
improved position through the stretch. CAMPISI moved up along the inside after breaking a step slow, came in the two path for the drive, went evenly to the
wire. REEF'S DESTINY void of speed inside, continued to save ground turn, altered course for room a furlong out and improved slightly. MARVELOUS
THUNDER bumped at the break, recovered to race forwardly and four wide into and through most of the turn, tired through the stretch. HERITAGE PARK

Footnotes
PENS STREET settled off the pace toward the inside, two path backstretch, shuffled back a bit to lose position far turn, idled along late in that bend, came
three wide into the lane, shifted out a bit for room past the furlong marker then closed with good resolve to be up in time. START SINGING forwardly placed
while four wide through the first turn, prompted the issue up the backstretch, made an early move to assume command late backstretch, clear into the lane
and past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. BIG BAD DIVA in the second flight off the inside, angled in a bit late in the
second turn, chased the runner up past the furlong marker, slowly getting to that one late for the second spot while also unable to match the winner late.
LANTERN'S CANDY in mid pack outside, four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second bend, came up empty for the
drive. HASHTAG WINNER saved ground while off the pace in the first turn, two to three wide through the second bend, also lacked a closing punch down
the lane. MY MY last to leave, continued to lag for six furlongs toward the inside, swung out five wide exiting the final turn, improved position by passing
mostly tiring rivals. SHE BE SHEEHAN vied early through much of the first turn, fell back after a half and was finished. RIGHT TRAPPE lacked speed,
improved position with a five wide move far turn, four wide into the lane then backed up in the run to the wire. UNDECODED away in good order, set or
forced the pace four five furlongs, began to weaken when headed by the runner up late backstretch.

Footnotes
ABBY THE BULL DAWG bothered at the break to be away slowly, well back early outside, four wide into the turn, split foes in the three path three furlongs
out, swung out five wide for the drive, closed with good energy to kick down the leader late. AWESOME BIRDIE with the lead pack while four wide up the
backstretch, four wide into the turn, challenged five wide leaving, took over when straightened for home, clear late but could not contain the winner. BALL
GOWN in mid pack early, came three wide for the drive, shifted out a bit around some traffic, belated rally to be clear for the show. WINYAH BAY broke a
step slow, void of speed, rail trip through the turn, steered out and improved through traffic. IZEONPOINT hesitated at the break, far back for a half inside,
two path into the lane, angled out for room past the furlong maker, also bettered her position late. INVALUABLE in mid pack and in the two path, continued
evenly through the stretch in lacking a significant closing response. DOCS SEVEN with the pace while three wide, continued to do battle inside the runner
up through upper stretch then folded the final furlong. MIA BABY broke out to bother three outer rivals, settled in the second flight inside, tired through the
stretch. SHE DAZZLE with the pace in the two path for five furlongs, also gave in the final eighth. KOALA showed the way for a half along the inside,
faltered entering the stretch. SHANIAH bothered at the break, moved up to race in the main body while four wide, steady fade after a half. TENACIOUS
LADY also bothered at the start, raced three to five wide through the turn, retreated stretch.

PROMISES TO DANCE in the second flight early while four wide, came three wide and between foes into the stretch, chased the leader past the furlong
marker, challenged that one late from the outside, gained the advantage then gained the nod over the rallying runner up. SHANGHAI EXPRESS fell well
back after the start, moved outside, fours to five wide turning for home, rallied down the middle of the strip to finish up willingly, narrowly missed.
LOFTHOUSE off the pace while racing inside, steered out four wide turning for home, roused when straightened for home, within striking distance a furlong
out, lacked a winning punch late between horses. WINGS FROM ABOVE broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set an uncontested pace for a half, remained
clear past the furlong marker, folded late. H. T. XENA broke back while bothered slightly, angled out four wide turning for home, improved slightly while not a
seriokus threat. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS back off the pace, in some traffic three wide late in the turn, lacked the necessary response when clear for the
drive. BUG A BOO off a step slow, trailed early, improved position a bit while never a serious threat. DIVA TREVA in the second flight for a half along the
inside, had little left for the stretch run. SHE'S BULLETPROOF in the second flight while between horses, weakened through the stretch. KEEPMEINTHE
MOMENT also in the second group while between horses, stopped late in the turn, finished far back.

Footnotes
ST ANDREWS lacked early foot while four wide first turn, three wide into the far turn,advanced four to five wide late in that bend, challenged into the stretch,
put a head in front nearing the furlong marker and was edging away late under steady handling.;. MOTOWN MUSIC settled in mid pack while also four wide
through the opening bend, moved toward the front four wide and inside the winner turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker then could not keep up,
clearly second best. LYKAN lacked speed as well, continued back into the far turn, steered five wide into the lane, staged a belated rally to be up for the
show. SEARCH ENGINE in mid pack while just off the inside, asked along in the three path into the lane, mild late interest to improve position a bit, no real
threat. PERFECT FLIGHT forwardly placed just off the inside, moved to challenge and vied between horses far turn, weakened in the drive. ICARUS last
away, raced well back, passed some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. HOME RUN TRICK broke on top, allowed the leader to go early
prompted that one for five furlongs, ranged up to challenge three wide early second turn, put a head in front soon after, vied into the stretch and faltered.
CHAPEL BARN moved up to clear before a quarter, set the pace inside, briefly responded when challenged second turn, then gave way exiting the final
turn. STORMY PATTERN forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, shortened stride and was pulled up far turn, vanned off.

BEN FRANKLIN off a bit slow, void of speed off the inside, four wide through the final turn when beginning to advanced, rallied strongly down the short
stretch run to be well clear at the end. MEGAN'S HONOR stalked the pace while racing off the inside, ranged up to challenge the two leaders in the three
path far turn, showed the way into the lane, clear nearing the furlong marker then proved no match for the winner late, lasted for the place. INEXORABLE off
a step slow with the winner, void of speed, three wide advance second turn, getting to the runner up late. CABALLO FELIZ closest to the early leader after
breaking in good order, moved up to duel outside that one before a half, vied between horses second turn when the runner up came calling, gradually
weakened through the stretch. BEN DIESEL settled off the early pace toward the inside, raced in the second flight three wide in the second bend, came up
empty for the stretch run. SPEIGHTSVILLE broke alertly, clear early, vied along the inside the middle half, faltered in the drive. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK
remained back throughout in lacking a rally. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE in mid pack outside, gave way while four to five wide second turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
LADY MOSCATO forwardly placed up the backstretch while covered up into the turn, patiently handled through the bend, tipped out two then three wide
under clever handling turning for home, engaged the leader from the outside nearing the furlong marker, wore that rival down under firm handling. SHE
CALLED broke well, vied outside, dueled into and through the turn off the inside, garnered a larger advantage when straightened for home, gave ground
grudgingly to the winner to the wire, well clear for the runner up spot. ALICIT INTENTION void of speed, advanced inside late in the turn, proved no match
for the top two, in time for the show. SHEKNOWS away in good order, contested the pace from the outset toward the inside, continued on equal terms with
the runner up through the turn, first to blink in upper stretch. WAMPUS KITTEN off a step slow, advanced four wide through the turn, failed to sustain that
gain through the lane to finish up evenly. THE BIG CALHOUNA forwardly placed in some traffic early, shuffled back in tight quarters entering the turn,
bothered late in the turn when still surrounded, one paced after recovering through the stretch. SHE'S IT in mid pack and three wide, lacked a closing
response. LITHE SPIRIT main body three wide, shuffled back into the turn, did not recover in failing to rally. OUTWORK MOM off a step slow, remained
back while five to four wide through the turn.
