Footnotes
ANNA'S GOT STYLE was well placed early towards the inside, moved out and made a three wide bid on the turn and quickly drew clear, then was give one
pop left handed nearing the furlong marker and was well clear and then was ridden out to prove much the best. LUCKY LINUS chased the early pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn, then won the battle for the place award while finishing willingly. EASTER BET tracked the early pace and made a mild bid
four wide on the turn, ran on to the wire but was out-kicked for the place award, clearly bested rest. RESTRIKE was reserved early, three wide on the turn
and came five wide into the lane and improved in the lane. MAGIC RUSH was settled early and two wide on the turn and had no rally. PROM KNIGHT was
settled early on the inside and weakened. GREAT KISSER was away alertly and set the pace on the inside and faltered. DREAMINGABOUTTIME was off a
step slow and raced four wide on the turn and tired.
