Footnotes
SHERKALI (IRE) went to the front of the field with ICE BAR early in the race, held a steady pace, assumed the lead after the fifth fence, maintained the lead
throughout the remainder of the race, jumped the last fence in tandem with KING OF TSAVO (GB) and pulled away in the stretch for the win. KING OF
TSAVO (GB) began the race midpack, moved to place position after the fifth fence, maintained position through the ninth, challenged the leader at the top of
the stretch, but finished second best. BLESS BLESS started well behind the leader, gained ground by the fifth fence, maintained position, but was unable to
bid for better placing. JUULSTONE ran out the back of the field, lost ground after tripping over a fallen horse after the seventh fence but made a bid in the
stretch to gain position to fourth place. MR JEFFERSON rated early, kept a steady pace, gained ground approaching the final fence, but had no rally in the
stretch. GO TAKE CHARGE ran out the back of the field, bobbled on landing after the fifth fence to lose ground, and was never a factor. I AM FORTUNATA
(IRE) started midpack, advanced on the leaders after the fifth fence, then fell at the seventh and walked off. ICE BAR went to an early lead, relinquished the
lead before the sixth fence, fell at the seventh and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE BY MR
JEFFERSON WITH ICE BAR OVER THE SEVENTH FENCE. FOLLOWING THE REVIEW, MR JEFFERSON WAS DISQUALIFIED AND DEEMED
UNPLACED.

dueled in the stretch to prevail at the wire. SNOW GEESE was off slowly, ran off the pace, gained ground to challenge the leader after the seventh fence,
assumed the lead after the ninth, entered the stretch in the lead, and dueled with FEELING FESTIVE (IRE) to just miss. CUPPATEAMAN (IRE) maintained
a steady position midpack throughout the race, had no rally in the stretch and held position for show. IRELANDS CALL (GB) kept pace with the early leader,
took command after the first fence, held position through the ninth fence, faded, had no stretch rally, and was eased home. ST. JOHN'S ran out the back,
was no factor, tired, pulled up before the last fence and walked off. GIANTSBANE was off slowly, gained ground to midpack after five fences, faded and lost
ground after the seventh fence, tired, pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
ABAAN settled to the back of the field early, gained ground on the leader 5/8 from home, pressed the pace after the eighth fence, challenged the leader at
the final fence, and rallied in the stretch for the win. THE HERO NEXT DOOR (IRE) took command early, maintained the lead through nine fences, was
challenged by ABAAN before the last, entered the stretch just ahead of the challenger but could not hold off the rival and settled for second best.
L'IMPERATOR (FR) started off the pace, gained position to stalk the leader after the fourth fence, lost position to ABAAN after the seventh, rallied before
the last to gain ground on the leader but was unable to pass rivals and finished for show. NEOTROPIC kept pace with the leader through the first 1/2 mile,
eased off the pace at 1 mile, lost ground after the seventh fence, attempted to rally after the eighth but continued to lose ground and was eased home in the
stretch.
