Footnotes
BLINGO dueled briefly from the inside after the break, then inched away to lead the pack into the turn, was threatened by incoming rivals in the early
stretch, but dug in and shook clear to prove best in the end. HARD GOLD chased the pace while two wide, was moving up on the turn to bid from the four
path entering the stretch and was gaining ground in the stretch and was second best. MY FAVORITE SONG chased the pace from the inside at an even
pace throughout while holding third position and needed more in the late stretch. INFINITE MORO saved ground behind the field, then came out three wide
leaving the turn and was gaining mildly in the stretch. G E H GIANTS WAY bid for the lead while two wide, continued to press the pace under a strong drive
throughout the turn and into the stretch, then flattened out in the stretch. PROUD TO SERVE race at the back of the pack while two wide, swung seven wide
leaving the bend and was no menace.

Footnotes
STORM MAN bumped rival at the start, sped to the inside and led the way from wire to wire under a confident drive to prove best over all. COWBOY
BRODY was well rated in the middle of pack while two to three wide, then urged eagerly on the far turn and was gaining ground in the end but it wasn't
enough to catch STORM MAN. MR INSENSITIVE bumped outer rival at the start, then reserved ground at the back of the field, rallied leaving the far turn
while four wide, drifted out in late stretch while bumping rival then finished strong for the show prize. ONE LAST BID settled inside in the early furlongs, then
menace leaving the far turn while coming up five wide was bumped and floated out in the late stretch and missed the show prize in the end. GWYNETH'S
MALIBU raced in the middle of the field from the inside under a steady drive, then bid on the far turn before giving way in the final yards. GET RIPPED
chased the pace from the inside into the first turn, then continued to stalk the leader into the far turn, was in a long drive then flattened out in the home
stretch. BOBULINSKI was rank heading into the first turn, then trailed behind the field and was no rally.

Footnotes
DOCS DUTY prompted the pace while two wide, continued to stalk the leader into the early stretch, then dug in gamely, shifted inward and slipped by the
pace setter and was up in time to prevail. QUAIL set the pace from the inside, was able to hold onto the lead leaving the far turn and into the early stretch,
then was over powered by DOCS DUTY from the inside and was second best in the end. DREAM TIME raced while three wide in the middle of the pack,
then rallied leaving the bend and closed well in the lane for the show prize. CONNOR TALKSTRASH chased the pace while two wide, then rallied in the
upper stretch and was gaining mildly just missing the show prize. PROFESSIONAL GRADE broke outward and bumped rival, then chased the pace from
the inside at an even pace throughout and needed more in the end. FIRST CAPE settled in the two path, then bid from the inside in the late stretch but it
was too late. CAT CODE chased the pace while three wide, then menaced on the turn before flattening out in the late stretch. THE OX was bumped hard at
the start then lost chance.

AXEL STEEL was away well to face off with MY LITTLE PRINCE down the backstretch, then remained in close along the rail throughout the turn, found
more in the early stretch and drew clear to claim victory in the end. MY LITTLE PRINCE battled with AXEL STEEL into the turn, inched away to lead the way
into the early stretch, was challenged again by said rival from the inside, fought grudgingly then was outkicked in the final yards and was second best.
SAINT PIO stalked the pace while three wide, remained in contention on the turn, menaced gamely in the early stretch but it was not enough and was best
for the show prize. STAND FOR FREEDOM chased the leaders from the inside into the turn, then bid in the late stretch but it was not enough. BREW
CREW chased the pace in the two path, bid on the turn and came up empty in the end. CADDO FOX was unhurried early and no threat. LANGUAGE
BARRIER stalked the pace while two wide, then faded on the turn, eased across the wire.

then rallied leaving the turn, could not find winning stride and was best for the show prize in the end. BRINGONTHEBUBBLY stalked the pace from the two

and gave way in the late stretch. DULCE AMANECER YG was bumped at the start, then settled inside and passed a tired foe in the stretch. IMMA GOING

to no avail. RICHARD'S TX BLING settled in the three path, then bid leaving the turn and was no threat. SLIM JIMMY was bumped at the start, was allowed
to settle inside, then bid leaving the turn and had no impact in the end. FANDO broke inwardly at the start and bumped rival, then stalked the pace in the
early furlongs before settling back on the turn, rebid in the upper stretch and came up empty. HOLIDAY RUN set the pace from the inside into the turn, was
hard used and weakened in the stretch. EAGLEFORD was bumped on both sides, then chased the pace briefly from the inside then faded in the heading
into the turn and had no final bid.

Footnotes
CONTOUR under a steady drive stalked the leader while two wide in the early furlongs, then moved up to spar grudgingly on the far turn and into the early
stretch, then kicked clear and held on well to the wire. KENTUCKY ANGEL was allowed to settle along the inside in the early furlongs, continued to save
ground down the backstretch, came out seven wide leaving the far bend, and was gaining ground eagerly in the home stretch and missed by a nose in the
end. KRIK TAK chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to rally in the early stretch, could not find room and was best
for the show prize in the end. CHAINSAW CITY laid of the pace while three wide in the early furlongs, then attempted to bid for the lead under a gamely
drive on the far turn, did not have enough and finished under a strong drive just missing third place. BLUE HEAVENLY raced towards the back of the field
while two wide, then rallied leaving the far turn and was closing willingly just missing the show prize in the end. MIDNIGHT LADY drifted out five wide
heading into the first turn, then settled inside behind the field and was no threat. SPEAK SOFTLY set the pace into the first turn, was in a long drive before
being met with an outside rival on the far turn, was used up and weakened in the home stretch.
