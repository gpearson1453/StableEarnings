Footnotes
FLOWER CAT dueled for the lead with an outer rival, inched free at the furlong grounds before meeting a wider challenge entering the final sixteenth, and
held firm. SAILOR CHOW stalked in the two to three path, took aim in the four path entering the lane, offered a grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth pole
but was kept at bay. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, ran on while delaying
changing leads until the sixteenth pole and edged show late. MARK THE MOOSE tracked along the inside, then only managed to chase through the lane.
SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, entered the lane in the three path, began to yield while hanging on his left
lead as an outer rival menaced in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds but weakened shortly after. SHUT UP MAN laid off of the pace in the
three path and made little impact. WAR RON was last away, trailed in the two to three path and got outrun.

Footnotes
BAYOU JAM laid off of the pace in the three path, chased advancing between horses into the far turn, shifted in to aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch,
sustained grinding progress and edged past in the shadow of the wire. FIELD OF VISION stalked two wide, ranged up in the three to four path turning for
home to bid nearing the lane, vied while being kept at bay into deep stretch, got outkicked by a rail bidder nearing the wire and forged place via a tight
photo. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY set the pace along the inside, drifted to the three path as an outer rival issued a challenge nearing the lane, clung to an
advantage into the final sixteenth, but was bested by a rail bidder late and lost place at the wire. ARCTIC ROSE broke a step slow, tracked in the four path,
was roused in pursuit around the far turn and gave way. UNANIMOUSLY broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three to four path, then the five path around
the far turn and failed to factor. SCHNELL tracked along the inside, but faded around the far turn and was eased through the lane. COACH KENNY lacked
speed along the inside, lost touch with the rest of the field down the backstretch and showed litttle.

ATHENS MOON stalked along the inside, loomed a danger shifting outside of the leader entering upper stretch, bid and assumed command at the three
sixteenths pole, drew off under mild urging in midstretch and was put to hand with a sixteenth to go. UNDER SURVEILLANCE pursued from midpack along
the inside, shifted to the two to three path around the far turn before swinging to the six path in midstretch, and ran on to edge place in the closing stages.
MR MIDWAY set the pace along the inside, but was no match for an outer bidder passing the three sixteenths pole, dug in for place in the final furlong but
was bested by an outer challenger approaching the wire. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES pursued from midpack three wide, shifted to the five path entering upper
stretch, progressed mildly to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay and outkicked for show in the final sixteenth. BECAUSE THE NIGHT
tracked two wide and between horses, then along the inside around the far turn, chased and lacked a bid. GLUCKSTADT stalked two wide, but yielded
between horses when floated three wide entering upper stretch. LIQUID ADDICTION (IRE) laid off of the pace towards the inside, shifted to the six path in
upper stretch and failed to factor. LITTLE ROCKY broke a beat slow, trailed around both turns and was outrun. SERGEANT RECKLESS laid off of the pace
four wide and tired.

MIDNIGHT RAID stalked three wide, bid in upper stretch and vied before edging clear in the final sixteenth. LAUGHINALLTHEWAY set the pace inside of a
prompting foe, vied with that one around the far turn, got headed as a wider bidder joined the fray in upper stretch and gamely fought on through the final
furlong to reclaim place. SINGLE RULER laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked two wide and between horses down the backstretch, chased behind
the leading trio into midstretch, altered course outwardly in the final furlong and ran on to reach show late. GILDED CRAKEN prompted outside of the pace
setter, vied into and around the far turn, forged a narrow advantage as an outer rival issued a challenge in upper stretch, dueled between horses into
midstretch, but was bested by his outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole and yielded between foes. KOLOMIO tracked along the inside, but got rank under
restraint at the seven furlong pole, steadied repeatedly until settling passing the three quarter pole, but faded turning for home. WHAT'S UP DOC laid off of
the pace three wide and got outrun.

SHARE THE BLESSING saved ground well back, rallied along the rail to bid at the sixteenth pole, edged ahead and held sway. KIMBER SPICE tracked
along the inside, moved to the two path around the turn, brushed her way out to the seven path for clear sailing in upper stretch, then rallied to reach place
at the wire. VELVET KISSES showed the way in the two path, held sway in the three path through upper stretch, but was headed by an inner bidder at the
sixteenth pole and got caught for place at the wire. STAR ANISE stalked in the five path, pressed three deep while in the four path around the turn, but
failed to sustain presser in the five path in upper stretch, kept on in pursuit but was outkicked in the final furlong and lacked a bid. WINE AND WAVES
pursued from midpack in the three path, got brushed out to the eight path in upper stretch and only offered a mild kick. MRS. KATZ stalked in the four path
and between horses, moved to press the leader from the three path into the turn, chased getting floated to the four path in upper stretch and yielded late.
MYIYLA broke a beat slow, trailed three wide, the moved up willingly under little urging. LYRICAL PARDON chased forwardly in the three to two path into
the turn, but lacked a bid and gave way. MARTYNAS' JOY raced well back two wide and between horses into the turn and made little impact. MARYS
WINE laid off of the pace in the three to five path and faded.

SWEET SHILD O MINE set a clear pace and padded her margin under a drive in upper stretch. GRAND LOVE stalked the clear leader from the two path,
failed to threaten that one from the three path and saved place from inner bidders at the wire. TIPSY TAMMY snagged the outer stall door with her hind
quarters upon leaving the gates, pursued from midpack in the four path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, then stayed on between horses to miss reaching
place. HUNTLEIGH saved ground at the rear, then rallied along the rail to miss show. WUPKAR tracked in the three path, floated to the four path entering
the lane, then only managed to chase before yielding late. COEXIST broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path, split foes three wide in upper stretch,
shifted out and bumped a rival inside the final three sixteenths and failed to threaten. BROKEN HEARTS BAY lacked speed three wide, fanned out to the
seven path entering upper stretch and failed to factor. HAYUNEVANO laid off of the pace in the five path, got bumped by an inner rival passing the three
sixteenths pole and gave way. THISONEISFORYOU chased along the inside, then faded before weakening between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PORT TOWNSEND tracked in the three path, tipped to the four path entering the lane, chased the clearing leader through midstretch, closed in late to bid
inside the final sixteenth and drove past in the closing strides. ROYAL FLOWER pressed two wide, bid in the three path entering the lane, drove clear in
upper stretch, but was reeled in by an outer bidder approaching the wire. EMPIRES PRINCESS settled off of the pace two wide, moved out to the three to
four path in upper stretch and stayed on to gain show in the final sixteenth. FIRING BULLETS rated well back two to three wide, shifted out to the six path in
upper stretch and stayed on to reach fourth in the late stages. FAST LANI pursued from midpack in the four to five path and chased between horses.
CLASSIC PERFORMER tracked along the inside, tipped two wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid before getting outkicked for minor placings at the
sixteenth pole. THE GREAT MAYBE broke a step slow, trailed in the two path around the turn, shifted out picking up stride in the final furlong an ran on late.
BOX OF PICTURES lacked speed along the inside, tipped to the three path in upper stretch and failed to factor. NUMERO SEIS showed the way along the
inside, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and weakened. CATSKILL HUMOR settled towards the rear along the inside, swung out to the
seven path in upper stretch and made litlte impact. TRULY GRATEFUL saved ground off of the pace and faded.

Footnotes
GALAXY THIRTYSIX chased along the inside, tipped to the three path around the turn, ran on shifting further out in midstretch, bid in the six path at the
sixteenth pole and drew clear. DOLLY'S GUITAR tracked in the two path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, bid and led into the final furlong, but was
bested by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole then saved place from an inner challenger at the wire. NEW YEAR'S PARTY laid off of the pace along the
inside, rallied to split foes at the sixteenth pole, bid for place in the late stages but missed. ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN trailed in the four to five path, then
pursued in the six path on his left lead and moved up. BIND ON EARTH prompted the leader from the three path, led entering the lane in the four path, got
headed by an outer foe in midstretch and weakened. ISOLATION failed to factor from the four path. BET ON BOURBON set the pace inside of a prompting
rival, got headed entering the lane and weakened.
