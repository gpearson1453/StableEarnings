Footnotes
NO BEACHES crowded at the start and away a bit slowly, settled while saving ground, saved all of the ground into the far turn, waited for racing room while
behind runners at the top of the stretch, found room nearing the furlong marker, responded to urging and took command into the final sixteenth, was kept to
task in deep stretch and edged away to prevail. IMA KEEN ICE allowed to settle in the early running, was guided two wide into the far turn, roused five wide
for the drive, finished well into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner into deep stretch and outfinished the rest for place honors. HANG ON a bit
antsy in the gate prior to the start, assumed command of the early running and dictated terms into the first turn, set moderate fractions to the half-mile pole,
came under pressure into the second turn, dug in into the stretch and held a narrow lead approaching the furlong marker, could not keep pace with
oncoming rivals nearing the final sixteenth and was overtaken, while holding clear in the end for third. ALMOST GOT LUCKY forwardly placed away from
the start, stalked three wide along the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, maintained an outside path approaching the half-mile pole,
loomed three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong pole and gave way in the final
sixteenth. LOVELY BRIDE close up in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, saved all of the
ground into the far turn, gained ground into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened.
MY MOTORHOME prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace through the backstretch
run, pressed the pacesetter two to three wide and between runners into the second turn, lost position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUALITY CAT bothered a bit by neighboring rivals at the start, was allowed to settle in the early stages, tracked the modest pace while not far back nearing
the half-mile marker, guided two wide into the far turn, roused four wide into the stretch and loomed nearing the furlong marker, took command at
mid-stretch and battled the stubborn runner-up into the final sixteenth, held MAGICISTHEMOONLITE at bay into deep stretch and kept to task in the final
strides to prevail. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE broke out at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, recovered and was prominent into the first turn, stalked
the early pace two to three wide, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the modest pace nearing the half-mile pole, pressed the pace into the
second turn and took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was confronted by QUALITY CAT nearing the furlong marker and was overtaken past mid-stretch,
battled stubbornly into the final sixteenth and was outfinished by the winner, while holding safely for second. WRONG SPOT squeezed by neighboring rivals
at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle while not far back into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace
approaching the half-mile pole, well placed into the second turn, mounted an inside bid into the stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and held safely
in the end for third. DARK MYSTERY unhurried early on, saved ground into the backstretch run, guided three wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the
stretch drive and was gaining in the late stages. WORKDAY sent to assume early command, showed the way into the first turn and set modest fractions into
the backstretch run, was prompted into the far turn and held a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was overtaken into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker
and gave way in the final stages. REGULATION DAZED crowded at the start by a neighboring rival, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn,
tracked the modest pace three to four wide into the backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT MAGICISTHEMOONLITE BROKE OUT AT THE START AND IMPEDED WRONG SPOT LEAVING THE GATE, COSTING
WRONG SPOT THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
MR. T'S THIRSTY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed the way into the first turn while off of the rail and set a pressured pace into the
backstretch run, shook free and carved out decent fractions heading to the half-mile pole, controlled the pace while clear into the second turn and was set
down into upper stretch, dug in and held foes at bay at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held in a drive to prevail. SHOT OF A
LIFETIME took back off of the early pace, raced two to three wide into the first turn, gained ground into the backstretch run and was well placed at the
half-mile marker, chased three wide approaching the quarter pole and was asked for run into the stretch, loomed three to four wide nearing the furlong
marker, chased the winner into the final sixteenth and could not reel in the winner into deep stretch, was outfinished and held well in the end for second.
HAPPY DOES rated off of the early pace, tracked from the second flight and saved ground along the first turn, pulled between runners into the backstretch
and came within aim of the lead nearing the half-mile pole, chased the pace two wide into the second turn, was outkicked in the stretch drive and held clear
for third. POUR ON THE COLE allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run, was unhurried to the half-mile marker, steered two wide into the far
turn, roused four wide into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and needed more into the final sixteenth. HARBOR OUTLAW hustled away
from the start, prompted the early pace from the inside, lost a bit of position into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace while saving ground
approaching the half-mile marker, chased into the far turn, could not muster a response into the lane and faded. LOAFERS BOY unhurried in the early
going, went two wide along the first turn, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the second turn, was gaining in the stretch drive but
could not threaten the leaders at the finish.

Footnotes
RICH GOLD was allowed to settle into stride from the break and tracked three deep through the first turn behind the pacesetting WARRENS CANDY MAN,
pulled closer to the leader down the backstretch but was kept just off the flank of that rival to the far turn, moved to challenge for the lead approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, responded when set down in the stretch, finished with determination and pulled ahead in the shadow of the wire. WARRENS CANDY
MAN broke alertly and seized the early lead when no one else wanted it, dictated a pedestrian pace to the far turn, quickened passing the three-furlong
pole, met the challenged posed by RICH GOLD and PLAYBOY STYLE, battled gamely the length of the stretch but came up just short in the final jumps.
PLAYBOY STYLE raced near the rear of the compact field through the first half mile, advanced through the far turn, made a three wide bid for the lead
approaching the five-sixteenths marker, floated a little wide into the stretch and lost some ground on the top two, finished with some interest but came up
short. MADE THE TEAM came away a little awkwardly and was last into the turn, bided time near the rear of the very compact field racing on the rail, was
trapped behind horses through the far turn, then slipped through an opening into the stretch, had some finish under a stiff drive but was outkicked and
unable to improve. TITOS WITH A TWIST was kept behind the pace under a hold, dropped back to last on the far turn, started to launch a bid from the
five-sixteenths pole, was blocked form there to the head of the stretch, tried to split horses near the furlong marker but was outfinished.

Footnotes
LORD PRANCEALOT off a half-step slowly, showed good speed away from the start and assumed early command, set a fast pace while prompted to the
half-mile marker, was pressed into the turn by GOOD LOVIN and carved out quick fractions nearing the quarter pole, shook free of GOOD LOVIN into the
stretch and drew clear at the furlong grounds, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth and was geared down in deep stretch as much the best.
WILD JEWELS tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, chased three to four wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker,
swung widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and was second
best. HALO RANDO tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, chased two to three wide into the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter pole,
continued a sustained bid into the stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held clear for third. LIGHT THE BEAM took back off of the fast early
pace, trailed into the turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, could not muster a response in the stretch drive and passed tired rivals in the late stages.
DRUM BUNNY hopped at the break and was away slowly, recovered and saved ground into the turn, improved position at the quarter pole and maintained
an inside path into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and weakened. GOOD LOVIN prominent
away from the start, engaged with LORD PRANCEALOT in the early stages and pressed that runner through fast fractions heading to the half-mile marker,
contested the quick pace two wide into the turn, was asked for run nearing the top of the lane, dropped back approaching the furlong marker and came up
empty in the late stages.

SAWASDEE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set a fast pace to the half-mile marker and dictated terms into the turn, showed the way to the
quarter pole while a bit off of the rail and led into the stretch while in hand, kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and
held safely for the win. GABBY HAYES hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early running and stalked the fast pace heading to the half-mile
marker, chased SAWASDEE into the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch, could not make headway on
the winner into the final sixteenth and held for second at the finish. TALBOT BAY chased the fast early pace from between rivals, made a mild gain two wide
and between runners nearing the quarter pole, maintained a two wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded to urging and
closed well into the final sixteenth, just missed for second at the finish and held for third. OUR BOLD PRINCE asked for speed in the early stages, chased
the fast pace four wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, swung four to five wide for the drive, was outkicked in the late stages and
missed for third. CARDIFF CRACK chased the fast pace from between runners, ran in pursuit three wide and between rivals nearing the quarter marker,
needed more into the stretch drive and finished evenly. SHARONA'S WILD BOY chased the fast pace from the inside, lost position into the stretch and gave
way in the final furlong. WELTON ducked in at the start and was off slowly, trailed into the turn, went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole and did not
factor in the stretch. ACERO lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn and did not have an impact in the drive.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIST was pushed from the break to get forward position but was floated four wide through the first turn, remained near the rear of the field and
three to four wide to the half, began to advance from the three furlong marker circling the field, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and produced a
strong closing kick to get up in time. SUPER CARO opted to settle behind the early pace and raced near the rear of the field through the first half mile,
moved to the two path for the run down the backstretch and through the far turn, built up some momentum turning into the stretch, split horses at the eighth
pole, responded to strong handling, put in a strong finish but came up short. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS outrun into the first turn but secured a ground saving
spot on the rail, continued to save ground through the far turn, swung out three wide into the stretch, responded when set down at the three-sixteenths pole,
battled between horses to the wire and just missed in a blanket finish. TURA LURA was hustled from the break and won the race to the rail and the first
bend, slipped away to an open lead through the turn and was left alone to dictate the pace, held sway to the quarter pole then was set down turning for
home, dug in gamely to mid-stretch then was overtaken inside the sixteenth pole. STEIN'S GIRL off a step slow and was outrun from the break and raced at
the rear of the field in the early going, stayed to the inside and bided time through the far turn, got clear run into the stretch up the rail and finished with some
interest but was not good enough. VILLA NOVA was pushed to the front from the start and caught three wide going into the first turn then raced three to four
wide down the backstretch, went into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, still three wide, did not respond or quicken and finished evenly to the wire.
CLASS CODE was hustled from the break and went two wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked behind the lone pacesetter to the far turn, launched a bid with
three furlongs to run, went to challenge for the lead passing the quarter pole, was rebuffed, then weakened in the final furlong.
