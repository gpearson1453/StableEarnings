Footnotes
MISSION IS A GO stalked the pace, made a good three wide bid near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under strong handling.
LITTLEJACKRABBIT showed good early foot to cross over and set the early pace, dug in late and missed in a game effort. ROCKETSHIP RUN rated along
the inside, shifted out three deep just past the eighth pole and kept on willinglyl to the wire. PROOF OF PURCHASE dropped back off the early pace, raced
three to four wide and made a good late gain. DUTTON'S REVENGE was allowed to settle early, raced five deep into the upper lane and needed more in
the drive. ONE LUCKY BOY pressed three deep and gave way.
