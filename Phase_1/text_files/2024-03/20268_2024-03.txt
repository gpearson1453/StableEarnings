Footnotes
BUBBA CAN DANCE saved ground off of the pace, closed in entering the lane, split the leaders in midstretch and edged past. ACTION SEEKER set a clear
pace, held sway through upper stretch, but was collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and lasted for place. ITWASTHISBIG stalked outside of the
pace setter, chased that one around the far turn, got outmoved by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, kept on thereafter but needed more to reclaim
place. ATKINS tracked in the two to three path but gave way turning for home. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was outrun.

Footnotes
SEARCH laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked the main flight from the three path around the far turn, tipped to take aim from the four path entering
the lane, bid outside of the leaders in upper stretch, drove past at the furlong grounds and cleared. LUMINOUS RULER saved ground well back, then rallied
up the rail to gain place in the final sixteenth. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL stalked outside of the leader, bid along with an outer foe turning for home, vied
into the lane, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and yielded place to an inner foe in the final sixteenth. HARD EXIT tracked three
wide, bid outside of the top pair turning for home, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked b an outer rival at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his
left lead nearing the final sixteenth and weakened. ENGLISH LUNA trailed in the two path, moved to the four path entering the lane and improved between
horses. MORO MAESTRO was taken up between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, lacked a response to urging in the four path
around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. SHEHASANATTITUDE was bumped by an outer rival at the start, set the
pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of bidders turning for home and weakened. LINDA FAYE bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked along the
inside, came under heavy urging around the far turn, but caved between horses in upper stretch and was eased thereafter.

NONCHALANT showed the way from an outer presser around the turn, then held firm from that chaser through the lane. AUTO DIAL broke a beat slow and
bumped with an outer foe at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside, moved forward to press outside of the leader into the turn, took aim shifted to the
three to four path entering the lane, but only managed to chase that one home while being kept at bay. RUNNIN MUNNIN broke a bit outwardly, raced at the
rear three wide, tucked two wide entering the lane and ran on for show. FURTHER EVIDENCE bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four
path and yielded. NO BRAKE NEEDED chased two wide and between horses, got put to a bit of crowded quarters among them at the half mile pole,
steadied while faltering through the field around the turn and made little impact thereafter. AMERICA TOUGH saved ground off of the pace and tired.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) trailed along the inside, advanced four wide into and around the far turn, took aim tipping to the five path entering the lane,
bid in upper stretch, vied into the final furlong and edged ahead. IM SINGLED UP bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide, bid turning for
home before leading from outer bidders while entering the lane in the three path, lugged out and flopped leads while vying with an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds, fought on after getting headed and held place. SUPER STORMY pursued from midpack in the two path, swung to the six path entering the lane,
flopped back to his left lead while getting subtly herded by an inner foe in upper stretch, ran on in the final furlong but needed more for place. RUBY FOO
tracked two wide, came under rousing between horses around the far turn, moved to the three path nearing the lane, split foes beating an inner rival to a
spot to take aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch, but only chased evenly through the final furlong. MISS TAPPY TONE pursued from midpack in the
three path, gained three wide around the far turn to bid in the four path entering the lane, vied between horses hanging on her left lead through upper
stretch, but yielded at the furlong grounds. CAHUILLA tracked along the inside, steadied when blocked and stymied behind foes through upper stretch,
managed to slip through inside of rivals at the furlong furlong grounds and ran on willingly. LA VILLANA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out
entering the lane and failed to menace hanging on her left lead. LATE NITE LIZZIE lacked speed two to three wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane
and made little impact. CLEVER JOKE stalked forwardly in the four path around the first turn, tugged to the fore approaching the five furlong pole, led and
tucked to the inside down the backstretch, but got headed by outer bidders nearing the lane and weakened. LANETTA bumped with an outer foe at the
start, showed the way along the inside around the first turn, stalked an outer bidder with five furlongs to, awaited racing room from the pocket around the far
turn, but remained blocked in upper stretch and faded.

DOUBLEDIAMOND DEAL took contact from an inner foe soon after the start, pressed two wide, chased under urging around the turn, kept on to offer a bid
at the furlong grounds and drove past at the sixteenth pole. SUMMERTIME PEPPERS broke a bit outwardly, stalked three wide, chased the bidding
eventual winner into the final furlong and edged place from the pace-setter late. OVER PAID shifted out soon after the start causing his hind heels to be
clipped by a trailing rival before brushing an outer foe, set the pace, built a clear advantage into the turn, but was caught by an outer bidder at the sixteen
the pole and gave way. BENJI STAR bumped with an inner rival early on, raced off of the pace in the four path and between horses, sustained a chase
through midstretch, got floated to the five path in the final furlong while vying for fourth with an inner foe and prevailed for that position. STEEL ARGUMENT
broke a step slow, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, bumped with an outer rival approaching the turn, stayed on mildly through the lane to
vie for fourth with an outer foe in the final sixteenth, but missed that position. SOUNDS LIKE POWER clipped the hind heels of an inner rival as that one
shifted across his path soon after the start, saved ground at the rear around the turn, then improved between horses in the late stages. ELLS pursued from
midpack along the inside, chased turning for home and faded. TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR lacked speed in the five path, improved position around the turn,
but emptied out in upper stretch. SPEIGHTFUL ONE got herded out and forced to bump with an outer rival early on, raced off of the pace three wide and
between horses, bumped with an inner foe approaching the turn and subsequently weakened.

Footnotes
ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN showed the way along the inside, was confronted by an outer challenger entering upper stretch, repelled that one in the final
furlong and held sway. BOLT ACTION broke a step slow and took contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, smoothly moved forward
and tipped out to take aim on the leader from the four path entering the lane, bid while shifting inwardly to issue a challenge in upper stretch, but failed to
maintain even terms while drifting out entering the final furlong, got repelled in the process and was kept at bay thereafter. GOLDENTOWN transferred
contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, lacked speed along the inside, shifted out to the five to six path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly.
MO RUM raced forwardly three wide and between horses, gave way under urging around the bend, then surpassed tired rivals in the late stages for a minor
share. MOONLIGHT ROAD pursued from midpack tucking to the inside around the turn, gained show from outer rivals shifting a bit off of the fence in upper
stretch, but faded through the final furlong. GREAT RUNNER broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide, chased between horses around
the turn, got floated three wide by an inner bidder entering the lane and tired. KING OF THE PALACE stalked four wide and weakened. GHOST PRINCE
broke slowly yet avoided getting pinched between horses by doing so, trailed around the turn and got outrun. GOOD APPLE broke a step slow, lacked
speed in the two path and made little impact.

Footnotes
BRIGADE COMMANDER stalked two wide, bid inside of the wide leader along with an inner foe sparking a duel at the five sixteenths pole, sparred with that
one while forging a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but leaned in and bumped his counterpart entering the final sixteenth, fought on as the battle
continued and prevailed via a head-bob. THE PRINCE'S SPUR tracked along the inside, bid along with an outer rival turning for home, dueled gamely while
slightly headed into midstretch, but took contact from his outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole, doggedly persisted by missed the head-bob at the wire.
FREDDY J tracked three wide, chased in upper stretch then held show from rivals on either side. FROMANOTHAMUTHA pursued from midpack two wide,
tracked the new leaders turning for home, chased while bidding for show inside of that position in upper stretch but was kept at bay. JOINT VENTURE
showed the way around the first turn, allowed the loose horse to move forward inside of him nearing the far turn, but got carried wide by that errant rival
around that bend causing him to surrender the advantage to inner rivals at the five sixteenths pole, yielded before recovering and tucking back to the six
path entering the lane, and kept on but needed more to re-threaten show. SUNDAY BREEZE lacked speed in the three path, then failed to factor. SILVER
HEIST laid off of the pace towards the inside and made little impact. WICKED ROSE was a bit restless in the starting gate, lacked speed along the inside
and never got involved. MAASAI WARRIOR broke slow and was outrun two wide. RECKER POINT stumbled and dislodged his rider at the start, then
walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE TRAINER OF THE PRINCE'S SPUR
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BRIGADE COMMANDER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING THAT OBJECTION, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BRIGADE COMMANDER AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
FUNNYFLAME stalked along the inside before moving to the two path entering the backstretch, ranged up to bid outside of the leader turning for home,
kicked clear in upper stretch, then flopped back to his left lead in the final furlong with the deal sealed. DROBNY set a clear pace, met an outer challenge
turning for home, proved no match in upper stretch then safely lasted for place. VERY SATISFACTORY pursued from midpack along the inside, then in the
two path around the far turn, brushed with an outer rival while looking to split foes in upper stretch, ran on between horses to gain show passing the furlong
grounds and narrowly held from an outer bidder. DOUBLE NEAT lacked speed in the two to three paths, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, moved
up but missed reaching show. HOPE JOE'S RIGHT settled three wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, exchanged contact with an inner rival at the
three sixteenths pole and leveled off between horses. ROUSSETTE stalked two wide, pursued from the two path around the far turn sustained a chase
through midstretch but yielded in the final furlong. SPINNING HEART tracked two to three wide, drifted about bumping with an outer rival and in inner foe at
the three sixteenths pole, then lacked a bid. SIR EXTON pursued from midpack two wide, cut the corner turning for home, but steadied once blocked behind
rivals in upper stretch, and failed to menace. SHARP STRIKE pranced outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, trailed around both turns and made little
impact. NOW IMA BELIEVER was brushed by an inner foe at the start and was slow to recover, laid off of the pace along the inside, steadied passing the
three furlong pole and never got involved. EL ALACRAN tracked along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SARAH'S VISION stalked along the inside, moved out to the three path early on in the backstretch, ranged up outside of the leader to bid and gained an
advantage at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held. IT'S A BIRD stalked in the three to four path, claimed place entering the lane,
gradually closed in on the clear leader late but needed more. TSURIS laid off of the pace along the inside, tugged between horses with five furlongs to go,
moved to the four path in upper stretch and ran on to edge show in the final sixteenth. JUJU NINETEEN laid off of the pace in the three to four path and
between horses, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and stayed on mildly before an ahead rival shifted across his path late. SHANKINSTINE broke a
step slow, laid off of the pace in the four to five path, fanned to the seven path into the lane and moved up. FORT BONZ was taken back at the start to trail
the field, then moved up between horses in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT CROWN pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted to the five path and
between horses in upper stretch but lacked a rally. GOTTATAKEHIMTO pursued from midpack in the four to three path and faded. J B GRAY prompted
inside of the leader, chased around the far turn and weakened. INSPECTOR ED showed the way in the four to two path, got headed by an outer bidder
turning for home and weakened. THE RIDER OF JUJU NINETEEN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST IT'S A BIRD FOR LATE INTERFENCE. FOLLOWING THE
OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
