TAKES THREE sat off the pace along the rail early, moved up to chase behind the leader on the backstretch, lacked room between horses at the
three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the lane, tipped out and challenged three deep at the eighth pole and drove clear late. VODKA VODKA chased in
the two path, moved out three wide leaving the backstretch, challenged the leader from outside at the three-eighths pole, dueled around the far turn, took
over in upper stretch, fought between runners into the final furlong and got outkicked by TAKES THREE in deep stretch. VOLS traveled outside a rival in the
two path well off the pace, chased three deep on the second bend, steered out in the lane, could not summon the needed late kick in the furlong grounds
but kept on to outfinish MYSTIC SPIRIT for the show. MYSTIC SPIRIT dueled for the lead inside WINTER IS COMING, cleared that rival past the half-mile
pole, dueled with VODKA VODKA on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch, fought to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. MOTIVATING FORCE
raced far off the pace on the inside early, moved into range in the middle stages, had to steady at the three-eighths pole, remained on the fence in the drive
and flattened in the late stages. IT'S MY WORLD off slow to begin, trailed on the inside to the far turn, angled out to pass a tired rival then steered back to
the rail, came up empty in the lane and was eased to the wire and walked off. WINTER IS COMING dueled outside MYSTIC SPIRITY to the half-mile pole,
started to weaken leaving the backstretch, tired on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

HUNGRY HEARTS set the pace up the backstretch off the rail, drifted to the four path on the turn, led clear on the wrong lead to midstretch, confronted by
MAGIC ACCOUNT in deep stretch and was able to hold. MAGIC ACCOUNT raced up close outside HUNGRY HEARTS, chased four wide through the turn,
cut inside the leader at the top of the lane then lugged inward in upper stretch, straightened out and rallied in the final sixteenth pole to miss in a narrow
photo. GETEMDUSTY broke well then dropped back off the pace, chased three wide leaving the backstretch, moved into the two path around the bend, put
in a mild late bid and closed the gap on the top pair. SPEED OF THE NILE chased under coaxing from inside, saved ground to the stretch and kept on to
whittle the gap late. BESKAR tossed his head to come away slow, lagged behind up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and never got involved.

MOBE TOWN set the pace outside UNUSUAL WIN to the turn, cleared that early and moved inside on the bend, met the challenge from CAROL'S COMIC
in upper stretch and held gamely to the wire. CAROL'S COMIC tracked three deep up the backstretch, drew closer three then two wide around the bend, bid
from outside at the top of the stretch, dug in late but could not get by. LUTHER PASS chased from inside, shifted to the two path on the turn and lost
ground, churned on through the lane and was along for the show. UNUSUAL WIN pressed the pace from inside up the backstretch, lost touch with the
leader early on the turn, continued along the rail then tipped out into the lane, drifted back in a bit in upper stretch and faded. SPEND IT ALL chased
between rivals, dropped back two then three wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) got squeezed between rivals early, raced outside a rival at the back, hard to ride at the five-eighths pole, continued to trail two wide
into the second bend, tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch, rallied from the middle of the track and got up. CROSBY
BEACH stalked on the inside then moved off the fence around the first turn, bid three deep near the five-sixteenths pole but could not keep up with the
leader and chased three wide into the lane, came gain with a sixteenth remaining, took over late but got outkicked by the winner. HULA CANDY dueled for
the lead then ceded command and stalked along the rail, bid two wide near the five-sixteenths pole, failed to stay alongside the and chased two wide into
the lane, stayed within striking distance into the final furlong, re-bid in deep stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. STANDING O dueled from outside
then cleared crossing the finish line for the first time, showed the way to the far turn, met a pair of bids midway on the second bend but moved clear again at
the quarter pole, led into the final furlong, tested by outer rivals in deep stretch and yielded late. CARMELITA'S MAN brushed with inner rival and got
crowded early, sat off the pace outside a rival, went between foes on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, kept on trying through the lane and
improved position. REIQUIST chased from off the pace and moved inside, raced in range while continuing to save ground on the far turn and lacked a bid.
JIMMY BLUE JEANS unhurried in the beginning and moved into the two path, rounded the far turn three wide and lacked a rally in the lane. ZALAMO (FR)
broke a bit slow, got put in tight and brushed the rail early, saved ground chasing through both turns and could not rally.

ASHCROFT forwardly placed two wide into the first turn then three deep around the bend, stalked from outside up the backstretch, bid three deep midway
around the far turn, took over leaving the bend, put away inner rivals in upper stretch but still had to contend with DURAN to the outside, disposed of that
rival midstretch and won going away. NORMANDY LANDING stalked along the rail to the far turn, tipped three wide around that bend and got up for
second. DURAN broke a step slow, trailed three then four wide on the first turn, bid four deep on the second bend, fought to the eighth pole, lost touch with
the winner midstretch and faltered late. LAKE SUPERIOR bobbled leaving the gate but still came away quickest and went to the front, led along the rail then
moved to the two path around the bend and took pressure from inside, dueled leaving the backstretch, fought between rivals on the second bend and into
the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. THEISMANN chased on the inside behind the leader approaching the first turn then began to pull and went
up to press the pace, raced on even terms leaving the backstretch, put a head in front early on the far turn, fought inside rivals midway around the bend, lost
command nearing the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
JOHNNY PODRES settled off the pace, rounded the bend two then three wide, got floated out across the dirt, rallied widest in the stretch and edged
LOVESICK BLUES in the end. LOVESICK BLUES showed early speed between rivals then ceded command and stalked two wide into the turn, moved out
and came four wide into the stretch, launched a bid outside the top pair approaching the eighth pole, battled through the final furlong and got outgamed by
the winner. CLOVISCONNECTION set the pace outside a trio of rivals early then cleared and angled in entering the turn, confronted by CATALINA EDDY
entering the stretch, dueled and resisted to the sixteenth pole, then yielded late and managed to save third. CATALINA EDDY showed early speed between
rivals then took back to stalk the leader, went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, challenged from outside entering the lane,
dueled to sixteenth pole and never found the needed late kick. COALINGA ROAD trailed on the inside into the turn, shifted to the two path around the bend,
angled out crossing the dirt, boxed in upper stretch, moved out a bit and kept trying to the wire. NONE ABOVE THE LAW broke a bit slow, chased along the
rail then two wide, roused in upper stretch and could not rally. DISKO TRIBUTE pressed early inside rivals then was rated on the inside, saved ground
through the turn, roused leaving the dirt and tried to launch a bid inside the leader but lacked room at the top of the lane, then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SEA DANCER stalked three then two wide early, was on the move three deep on the far turn then challenged two wide at the quarter pole, took over
entering the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and won going away. LAMPORGHINI stepped to the front and moved inside, controlled the pace to the
far turn, challenged by SEA DANCER at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead exiting the bend and stayed on to hold second. ELEGANT stalked four deep
into the first turn then moved down to the two path after dropping back off the pace, rounded the far turn two then three wide, moved out in the drive and got
up for third. VISUALLY unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, drew closer on the backstretch, angled three wide on the far
turn, finished evenly late and got edged for third. BEAU SOLEIL stalked keenly along the inside, saved ground around the far turn and could not respond
when called upon. HATTIE T hit the gate and came away slow to begin, traveled in the two path near the back, saved ground through the far turn, roused
approaching the stretch and failed to menace. BRAND NEW DREAM was also off slow, hit the rail early and trailed into the first turn, tipped two wide on the
second bend and was not a factor. BLACKPINK (IRE) pulled early racing outside the the leader, chased two wide into the far turn, between rivals at the
quarter pole, then faded down the lane.
