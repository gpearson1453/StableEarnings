Footnotes
PHENOM bumped inner rival in the beginning, stalked outside a rival or in the two path to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane, rallied under left then
right handed encouragement and proved best in the end. PALEO'S PRINCESS got pinballed at the start then crowded between rivals shortly after, chased
out of range on the inside into the turn, angled out in the furlong grounds and finished well outside the winner to gain second. UNWRITTEN CODE set the
pace under pressure from outer rival, inched clear into the turn, pressured again by TEEN DRAMA around the bend, put that rival away for good past the
eighth pole, showed the way clear into deep stretch but was run down by the top pair late. TEEN DRAMA broke inward then went up to press the pace from
outside, chased after the leader into the turn, put the heat on UNWRITTEN CODE again around the turn, hounded that rival to the eighth pole, then faltered
in the late stages. AVENTAPP bumped leaving the gate, chased along the inside to the stretch and never produced a bid. AWESOME TAYLOR broke a
step slow on the outside, trailed along the rail through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
PATRON D'ORO broke a step slow, went up to apply pressure from outside, fought headed to head around the turn and inched ahead past the quarter pole,
disposed of inner rival in upper stretch and drew off under urging. HEARTFULLOFSTARS settled near the back outside a rival, rounded the bend three
deep, moved out in upper stretch and showed a mild rally to best the rest. EL DIABLO ROJO broke a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, chased between
in the two path through the turn and got outkicked for second. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME showed good early speed and set the pace inside PATRON
D'ORO to turn, dueled around the bend and lost command at the quarter pole, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.
SLEW'S JOY raced up close between rivals on the front end but got crowded and suffered a mild shuffle at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased the top pair
three wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. STAY IN THE GAME tracked the speed along the rail into the turn, raced inside a pair of rivals then
trailed into the stretch and had little left for the final furlong.

KING OF GOSFORD (GB) vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, inched ahead and dueled with RAGING TORRENT around the bend, kicked clear past the
eighth pole and held safely to the wire. FINAL BOSS attended the pace four deep early on, chased the top pair four then three wide on the turn, finished
willingly through the final furlong and outkicked RAGING TORRENT for the place honors. RAGING TORRENT vied for command between rivals up the
backstretch, dueled from outside around the turn, fought to the eighth pole then failed to kick on with the winner and got edged for second. CHARGE FOR
GOLD vied three deep early, chased three then two wide on the turn and flattened to fourth. MIGHTY KAI settled off the pace, navigated the turn two then
three wide and lacked a rally. ALWAYS ON CAY lagged behind in the early going, saved ground through the turn, steered out in the lane and failed to
menace. LAWLESS WORLD broke inward, keen early and had to steady off the heels of the winner, settled into stride along the inside and saved ground
through the bend but weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
MOR TEQUILA set the pace inside rivals then moved clear, showed the way along the inside through the turn, kicked clear under urging in upper stretch
and was kept to task to the line. BAG'S GOLD tracked the speed from outside, chased four wide through the turn and got up for second. SOUL OF
MIDNIGHT forwardly placed three deep, closest in pursuit three then two wide around the bend, chased within striking distance through the stretch but
finished evenly late. EREBUS off slow to begin, lagged behind two wide into the turn, swung out into the lane, came with a mild rally but needed to find more
late. ELECTOR stalked the top trio early, began to climb past the half-mile pole, lacked room inside CROWNING GOLD early on the bend, had to steady
when lacking room again entering the stretch, stayed on the fence in the lane and kept trying to the wire. CROWNING GOLD showed early speed between
rivals then chased two wide into the turn, moved to the inside briefly then exited the bend a it off the rail and failed to rally. TRUSTY RUSTY raced in range
off the inside, chased between on the turn then three wide into the lane and lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
PIONEER PRINCE stalked off the rail, bid three deep on the turn, dueled outside QUINTECENTS with a quarter mile remaining, put that rival away in upper
stretch and drew away under steady handling late. QUINTECENTS set the pace along the fence with NOBEL GARY applying pressure, fought inside a pair
of rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside PIONEER PRINCE past the quarter pole, could not kick on with that rival in upper stretch and stayed on to
hold second. ZAFIRO ANEJO sat off the pace, saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the stretch, lacked room behind SIX MAGPIES (IRE) in upper
stretch, moved to a clear path and got up for third. NOBEL GARY pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch, fought between rivals early on the turn,
chased after the top pair past the quarter pole while moving to the inside, kept on down the lane and got edged for third. SIX MAGPIES (IRE) chased near
the rail into the turn, angled out to the three path midway around the bend then came two wide into the stretch and could not rally. SOLDATNA was a bit
rank crossing back onto the turn early, had to put the brakes on when running up on heels at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased outside a rival into the turn,
got floated out to the four path briefly then angled back down to the two path and lacked further response. RUNNING FOR COSI came away with the field
then lacked early speed and dropped back, two wide then on the inside on the turn and was not a factor.

MAN O ROSE pressed CRYPTO CRAZE from outside, dueled around the turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared leaving the bend and powered
away through the lane. BUCK OWENS traveled near the back off the rail then moved to the inside, saved ground through the turn, steered back off the
fence in the lane and rallied for second. LEFT HAND MAN stumbled slightly at the start, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, came under a ride chasing
inside a pair of rivals on the turn, moved out and went between rivals into deep stretch and got outkicked for second. DONT FIGHT THE FED broke a step
slow, stalked between rivals into and around the turn and failed to summon the necessary bid. MINISTER SHANE tracked out of range two wide leaving the
backstretch, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CRYPTO CRAZE set the pace inside a rival up the backstretch, dueled
around the turn, could not keep up with the leader past the quarter pole and gave way in the drive. TRINIDAD broke well then dropped back and trailed two
wide into the turn, moved out and exited the bend four wide, came out further at the top of the stretch and was never a factor. JAMMING EDDY stalked
three deep to the stretch and weakened.

MEDORO stalked two wide outside a rival around the clubhouse turn, tipped out at the quarter pole and challenged three deep, fought between rivals in
upper stretch and gained the advantage with a furlong remaining, drew clear with a sixteenth remaining and edged away. ZONA VERDE (IRE) closest in
pursuit from the two path early on, applied pressure from outside past the half-mile pole, dueled around the far turn and took over past the quarter pole,
fought inside a pair of rivals in upper stretch, was overtaken by MEDORO at the eighth pole and stayed on to secure second. ANTIFONA (FR) traveled
outside a rival at the back in the early stages, started to move while angling out on the far turn, challenged four deep with a quarter mile left to run, fought
outside rivals in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong and churned on to save the show. MO FOX GIVIN took a bump from
inner rival at the start, settled inside, ran into traffic on the far turn, tipped out into the clear past the five-sixteenths marker, angled out further in the stretch
and missed the show. VISUALLY broke out and bumped MO FOX GIVIN, tugged keenly along the inside shortly after, settled in a stalking position on the
inside, had to pause behind GIRL OF MY DREAMS when boxed in early on the far turn, stayed along the fence to the stretch, then tipped out in the lane
and could not rally when asked. GIRL OF MY DREAMS broke out then went up to take control while racing keenly in hand, led clear before taking pressure
from ZONA VERDE (IRE) past the half-mile pole, dueled around the far turn, lost command past the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) sped clear and cut over to the inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, spurted away on the far turn, roused in upper
stretch and continued to widen under urging before coasting in late. TIZ TOK stalked inside rivals along the rail, continued on the fence then came two wide
into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner down the lane but kept on to best the rest. SEATTLE BREAKOUT chased three deep between
into the first turn then moved into the two path, lost positions past the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn in the two path and was along for the show honors.
FLINT STROLL settled inside off the pace, drew closer in the middle stages, cut the corner into the lane and lacked a rally. MONTANA stalked four then
three deep early, chased between in the two path on the far turn, then spun three wide into the lane and weakened. TAKE CHARGE CURLY broke a step
slow, climbed two to three wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled four deep on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CANELO
broke a step slow, chased five then four deep early, rounded the far turn three then four wide and faded out of contention. CREATIVE WAY stalked between
rivals into the first turn then got shuffled back and climbed on the bend, chased three deep into the far turn, suffered another shuffle on the far turn and
came up empty in the lane. FEROCIOUSLY broke a step slow, tracked in the three path early, saved ground on the far turn and was not a factor.
