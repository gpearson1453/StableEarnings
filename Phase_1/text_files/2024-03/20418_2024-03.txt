the early lead three deep and kept on gamely to the wire. IN BOND WE TRUST was off slowly, raced near the rail past the quarter pole, angled out through
the drive and rallied well late. RED DIRT RICH stalked the pace soon after the start, slipped through on the rail near the three eighths pole with a quick
move to take a narrow lead and faltered in the drive. QUALITY BLASTOFF was off slowly, swung six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.

chased the pace from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. CHASIN JASON chased the pace from the inside,
angled out through the stretch and closed in mildly. NORWAY BEACH dueled early along the rail and faded. LEGACY ACCOUNT dueled two deep from the
outside of rival and gave way. R D C POSSE void of early speed, swung six wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
MR PELOTON prompt the early leaders from the outside, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and just got up late under all out pressure. PONZA
pressed the early pace between rivals, du in from the inside of rival and missed in a game effort. CATALE HURRYCANE was off a step slow, vied near the
rail and weakened a bit in the final stages. STRAIGHT AHEAD settled off the early pace setters, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved
up to improve position. I BE A KING forwardly placed from the outside, raced three to four wide and needed more in the drive. BROWN RESERVE was off
slowly, had an inside run and was even with no closing bid. HE'S ALL EARS stalked the pace, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no late
rally. SONIC POSSE saved ground and never threatened. E D'ORO raced four to five deep around the far turn and had no response. RIGHT CIDER
dropped back early, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. FRONT ROW SHOW void of early speed and failed to respond.
