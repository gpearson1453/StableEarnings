Footnotes
PIPPA'S PROSPECT tracked the early leader two deep, loomed just to the outside of Witsec nearing the eighth pole and edged up under all out pressure.
CAT TALE SKY rated inside, angled out through the drive and surged late to miss in a game effort. WITSEC set all the pace along the inside, dug in late
and gave way grudgingly. CAYMAN QUEEN void of early speed while trailing and lacked a bid. HIGHWAY SIXTY ONE settled early on, hard ridden near
the three eighths pole two deep and had no response.

KWONTRO was hard sent to a clear early lead along the inside, shifted off the inside near the three sixteenths pole, dug in and held to prove best under
strong handling. UNITED PATRIOT tracked the early pace from the outside, took aim four wide near the three sixteenths pole but couldn't get by the winner
to finish second best. TOMMYHAWK was unhurried early on, raced two wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the drive and finished gamely to the
wire. MANDOLIN WIND prompt the early leader two wide from the outside and weakened through the drive. THAT'S SOMETHING was allowed to settle
early, had inside run and never threatened.

wide around the far turn and never threatened. OKIE CHROME swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. FURIOUS AVENGER void of early
