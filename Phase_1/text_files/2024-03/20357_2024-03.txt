Footnotes
SHARP ATTITUDE rushed up down the backstretch, set the pace off the inner rail but inside her main competitor, went clear in upper stretch and prevailed
under steady handling. SWEET AND EZ prompted the pace outside the winner, failed to match stride with that one through the stretch but finished gamely
as best of the rest. MARK OF VICTORY raced between horses on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally. TEXAS WENDY ,
wide on the turn, was fanned seven wide in upper stretch and was steadied when carried out in mid stretch. DUKE GIRLS chased the pace outside horses,
angled to the six path in upper stretch and weakened. NORTHERN LINCHPIN chased the early pace, was in the three path leaving the turn and failed to
rally. CALIFORNIA DIVA saved ground on the turn and weakened.

pressed him to mid stretch and finished gamely. DELTA DELTA , never far back, raced inside horses leaving the turn and weakened. DIVERSIFUL , wide
while chasing the pace, weakened. GOALINE broke slowly, advanced outside horses leaving the backstretch, raced widest on the turn and weakened.
KNOCKOUT GUY raced in the two path leaving the turn and was no factor. CALCULATED SPIN , along the inner rail around the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
FUERTEVENTURA , patiently rated inside horses down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn while waiting for room, found an opening along the
inner rail entering the stretch, bid for the lead inside WAR AT SEA in upper stretch, brushed and battled with that one and determinedly prevailed. WAR AT
SEA , well placed behind horses down the backstretch, advanced in the three path between horses leaving the far turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch,
brushed and battled with the winner and finished gamely. LOW EXPECTATIONS hugged the inner rail disputing the pace for six furlongs, drifted off the rail
turning for home and weakened. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) advanced five deep leaving the far turn and failed to sustain the move. SEA TO SUCCESS
lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the far turn and failed to menace. DESHAMBEAU , wide both turns, gave way. CREATIVE BID hopped slightly at
the break, disputed the pace outside LOW EXPECTATIONS and faltered.

Footnotes
SAKURA BLOSSOM , never far back, saved ground around the far turn, had ample room along the inner rail through the stretch, challenged for the lead in
mid stretch and dug in tenaciously to prevail. PINK WHITNEY , a forward factor inside horses down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the far turn,
drifted out in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to just miss. MADISON RAE stalked the pace outside horses down the
backstretch, circled the far turn four deep, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. WHERE IS ZIZI , pinched back after breaking slowly,
rushed up four wide around the first turn to gain the lead, set the pace, raced in the three path the far turn and faded in the drive. LADY MARY LOU was no
factor. POP CHART , outrun, raced near the inner rail leaving the far turn. ZORINA bore out leaving the starting gate, raced four wide both turns and lacked
a rally.

E J WON THE CUP , right to the early lead, was kept well off the inner rail, drifted out inside the sixteenth pole and drew off late. LAST CALL LONDON
advanced four deep leaving the far turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch, lugged in approaching the sixteenth pole and drifted out inside the sixteenth
pole. NORWEGIAN CALLUM , near the inner rail leaving the far turn, dropped back a bit in upper stretch, swung wide near the eighth pole then altered
course outside LAST CALL LONDON when that one drifted out inside the sixteenth pole. MEEKING brushed the outside of his starting gate stall when
veering out at the break, prompted the pace outside the winner, lugged in near the eighth pole and weakened. GENERAL CROOK , four wide the first turn,
remained outside horses on the backstretch, angled in approaching the far turn and failed to rally. FREEZE 'EM , fractious going into the starting gate, was
rank early, swung wide leaving the far turn and failed to be a factor. FERRARI RED chased the early pace and gave way.

Footnotes
LOVE MY JIMMY broke alertly and quickly went clear, set a controlled pace in the three path around the turn and was kept alert in the drive. TRUTH
SEEKER trailed early, circumnavigated the turn extremely wide and rallied outside foes. TULANE TRYST raced in the three path on the turn and in the
stretch and flattened out between horses. PRAYER OF JABEZ chased the pace outside, was four deep leaving the turn and flattened out. TONY'S TAPIT
raced in the three path inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. MINISTER OF SOUL , wide throughout, chased the pace and weakened.
HIGHLAND GHOST , five wide on the turn, failed to rally. HOWBEIT , steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, raced wide and failed to rally.
PRINCIPE CARLO , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the pace and gave way late. KINGDOM HEART chased the pace racing in the two path
inside rivals and gave way in the drive. MOOSE MITCHELL , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate was no factor and his rider dropped his
whip in upper stretch. EXXEL lacked speed, angled in leaving the turn and weakened.
