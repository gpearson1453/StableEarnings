Footnotes
SUNNY ISLE BEACH unhurried in the early going in the two path, began to advance far turn, angled out and challenged three wide into the lane, gained the
advantage and drew clear under steady handling. ENCHANTED NILE broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn off the inside got out a bit
midway on that bend, moved inside, saved ground second turn, briefly dueled with the winner past midstretch, could not match strides late, remained clear
for the place. MAKEMEBELIEVE closest to the runner up early outside that one, dropped in underneath that rival late in the first turn, tracked in the two path
through the second bend, had little for the top two in the drive, well clear of the others. SIMONA'S CHOICE forwardly placed outside, four wide through the
first turn, remained within striking distance the middle half while remaining outside, had little for the drive. ALSANAH fell back to trail after the start, dropped
inside when making a modest advance in the far turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. INDY AGAIN remained always back
while racing toward the inside. HONEY RUN off a step slow, raced in mid pack outside, four wide through the second turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
KID SHELLEEN forwardly placed off the inside, lodged a bid outside the leader midway on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, held the runner up safe
late under firm handling. LORD GRANTHAM void of early foot, angled out four wide while between horses into the stretch, rallied, late bid, could not get by.
AMERICAN ICON off a step slow, was asked a bit to move up to race in mid pack while in the three path, moved out a bit for room in the drive, went evenly
through the stretch. EIGHT STRAIGHT with the pace four a half along the inside, weakened. PERMAFROST behind the pace inside, moved out in the two
path turning for home, failed to muster a rally. SIR four wide into the turn when off the pace, floated out five wide turning for home, also lacked a closing
response. MO TAP broke alertly, narrowly set the pace off the inside, gave way when headed turning for home.

Footnotes
ADIVA narrowly showed the way early, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear past the furlong grounds, narrowly held the runner up
safe late to prevail. FUNTIMEGIRL broke with the leaders, fell back off the lead pack up the backstretch, two path early turn, tipped out four wide entering
the stretch, late bid outside the winner, just missed. NAVAGATIONALBEACON with the early pace between horses, continued to press the issue through
the turn in the three path, proved no match for the top two in the drive, saved the show. SHUTUP PLEASE asked a bit early, fell behind the leaders while
saving ground into and through the turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. JERI DAWN broke with the field, quickly fell back, lagged for almost a half,
three wide into the lane, improved position with some mild, late interest. QUEENIES WAY lacked speed well wide, five path through the turn, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing response. SODDY DAISY forwardly placed outside, fanned five wide out of the turn, had little left for the stretch run.
TAKING CHARGE DESI in mid pack early, four wide into the turn, asked for run soon after, failed to respond then tired through the stretch. BLONDES
HAVEMO FUN was finished early along the inside.

Footnotes
ROSE PARADE allowed the leader to go early, stalked that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, went after that one soon after, challenged turning
into the stretch, took over and drew clear. QUEEN CLANCY broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, briefly offered
resistance when the winner came calling exiting the final turn then proved no match, held sway for the runner up spot. HAPPY HAPPY back off the early
pace, asked along midway on the second bend, angled three wide when set down into the stretch, steadily gaining for the second spot late. MY FAVORITE
GIRL settled behind the pace along the inside, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. TWO PRACTICAL last away, lacked early foot,
saved ground to no avail to also be found lacking a finishing kick. TANDI SUE four wide into the first turn, three down to two path second bend, remained
back through the lane. K'ANTHEIA raced off the early pace and the inside, in some traffic when beginning to tire tiring for home, continued to fade through
the lane. HAUNTED DREAM steadied past the wire the first time when well back, continued to trail to be outrun.

FEARLESS KRISTIE mid pack, three wide advance, took over, kicked well clear. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD pressed early, early bid, showed way into the far
turn, offered brief resistance when the winner challenged into the lane then could not keep up. TEXAS TWINKIES last to leave, void of speed, saved
ground, rallied up the inside to be well clear of the others. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT broke alertly, set the early, headed before a half, gradually weakened.
BYZANTINE turned in a one paced effort while racing toward the inside. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS forwardly placed inside, in a bit tight inside of traffic late
backstretch, came up empty in the drive. FASHION IDOL remained back in failing to threat while three wide. SALSALITA VERDE five wide first turn,
continued outside, four wide second bend when tiring. LEGALLY LUCKY five wide through the turn, remained back.

BUSINESS AS USUAL off a step slow, moved up to mid pack inside, rail bid late in the turn, vied through upper stretch, edged clear late under steady
handling. SPACITYGAL behind the pace just off the inside, remained in the two path behind the first flight late turn, moved in a bit, rallied up the rail to be in
time for the place, too late for the winner. SHE'S NOT A JOKE within striking distance well out in the strip, closer four wide turn, vied through upper stretch
and past the furlong marker, lacked a late punch. TAKER BACK narrowly showed the way in the two path, allowed the winner the inside midway on the turn,
vied between rivals outside that one through upper stretch then weakened the final furlong. OPPOSITE THE CROWD off a step slow, trailed for over a half,
improved position through some traffic. HONORABLE MISCHIEF pressed the issue up front while racing three wide for a half, had little left for the drive.
MIESHA remained back in lacking a closing response. FROSTY VI four wide trip through the turn, faded down the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLD LUCK unhurried for a half while racing in the two path, split foes under confident handling inside the furlong grounds, edging clear late with good late
energy. RITHM NIC back off the pace and the inside, swung out four wide out of the turn, rallied while remaining well out in the strip while unable to match
the winner. BACKSIDE BUZZ forwardly placed early inside, shifted off the inside to chase three wide through the turn, bit closer when moving to challenge
past the furlong marker, floated out a bit by the tiring leader and was then outkicked by the top two. ABSOLUTE CHAOS within striking distance off the
inside, moved closer and lodged a mild challenge nearing midstretch then weakened in the late run to the wire. TRIPLE ELVIS broke alertly, clear early,
continued to show the way through the turn in the two path, responded when challenged when straightened for home, drifted out slightly and then yielded.
BALSA within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for the drive. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS off a step slow, trailed, four wide through the turn,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY off a step slow, remained always back. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL in
mid pack while off the, came four wide for the drive, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
RUGGS forwardly placed while three wide, asked into the lane, three wide bid upper, shook clear, drifted, held. SAMURAI PRINCE in the second flight
toward rail, moved closer while angling out four wide turning for home, finished willingly to be clear for the place, unable to get to the winner. MEAN JAKEY
in mid pack while well out in the strip, four wide four much of the turn, staged a mild rally while remaining well wide, up for the show. TEE BURNS took
control soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, weakened when headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker to lose a couple of more
positions late. UPSTRIKER broke back, lacked speed, in some traffic then waited briefly midway on the turn, got through to improve inside of rivals into the
lane then flattened out and went evenly the final furlong. LIGHTNING STRUCK void of speed while three wide, made little impact in lacking a closing
response. ROYAL ACT off a step slow, remained back and was never a threat in the two path. TROPIC STORM chased the early leader from toward the
inside, began a steady fade before a half. THREEFIFTYSEVEN was finished after a half while three wide into the lane.

Footnotes
CITRUS BAY in the second flight outside, four to three wide turn when challenging into the lane, drove clear under a firm right handed crop. MARTINI BLU
dueled up front off the inside, garnered a larger advantage late in the turn, was joined by the winner entering the stretch, second duel past the furlong
marker then could not keep up. BLACK STORM back off the pace toward the inside, came in to tighten up BABA'S BOY into the turn, steered back out three
wide turning for home, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. POPULIST in the second flight while off the inside, lacked a closing kick to go
evenly through the stretch. MOR BIG LEE with the pace while racing along the inside, weakened. VIOLENT GIGI broke back, lacked speed, saved ground,
continued inside, improved upper stretch then flattened late. JIM AND JIM back and well wide, four to five path through the turn, lacked a closing kick.
BABA'S BOY back off the pace toward the inside, checked up when in tight entering the turn, trailed past the furlong marker then picked up a couple of tiring
rivals late. RISK PROFILE off a step slow, trailed. MORNING SNOW mid pack off the inside, tired. DRILL'S LI'L MAN mid pack and wide, five wide turning
for home, backed up steadily through the lane.
