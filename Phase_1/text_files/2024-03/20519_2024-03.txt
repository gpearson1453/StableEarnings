Footnotes
COWGIRL KIMMIE broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, shook off brief pressure at the three-eighths pole, opened a clear lead on the turn, drifted
very wide to the nine path turning for home, and kept on through the lane to prevail. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY tracked the pacesetter through the turn,
rallied three wide at the head of the lane and kept grinding through the lane, failing to get passed the winner. FRANKLY MY DEAR was well placed saving
ground through the turn to cut the corner and engage the leaders in upper stretch and finished evenly lacking a closing punch. O K BABY trailed most of the
way and never posed a threat. SWEET BELEN broke slow to be at the rear of the field, rushed up the rail to press the pace down the backside and flattened
out on the turn.

RANSAM PAYNTER broke alertly to take command from the gate, opened a clear advantage on the turn and finihsed willigly while unchallenged through
the lane. PACIFIDERO tracked the pacesetter from three wide through the turn, rallied in the lane but failed to close ground on the winner and finished up
second best. MR. BLUTARSKY stalked the leader to the top of the lane and made a mild rally in the stretch to be best of the rest. LEAVENWORTH broke in
a tangle bobbling from the gate, was gathered together, steadily made up ground on the field, but had no impact having lost all chance at the start.
CAMILAS WARRIOR prompted the early pace and fade on the turn.

Footnotes
KINDERHOOK sped to the lead from the gate, was well rated on the pace, maintained a clear lead, widened upper stretch and was not challenged down the
lane. DIAL DIRECT stalked the pace from the fence, made a bid turning for home and could not get to the winner finishing willingly to be second best.
ROMANIAN PRINCE tracked the pacesetter on the turn, mounted a four wide bid and finsihed evenly to hold the show. STORMED OUT reserved off the
leaders through the turn, angled eight wide at the head of the lane and made a mild bid through the stretch. YIPPEE KI YAY pressed the early pace and
flattened out. MAILS HERE went evenly failing to menace. NOAH MY BABY contended from five wide through the turn and lacked a response when called
upon. WHISKEY HELPS shuffled leaving the gate to lose position and drop to the rear of the field and was never a factor from there.

Footnotes
TADZIO hustled up the rail to take command leaving the gap, opened a clear lead on a well rated pace, responded when challenged nearing the quarter
pole, shook free in upper stretch and held the runner-up safe through the lane. K C OUTWORK prompted the pace to midway on the turn, rallied two wide to
loom at the head of the lane, could not go with the winner and kept on willingly to be a clear second best. MOR CRAFTY tracked the leader from the fence
saving ground on the turn and failed to mount a closing rally. A VAN ON THE RUN stalked the pacesetter from four wide through the turn and flattened out
in the lane. SMOKE SCREEN dwelt when the gates opened giving the field nearly forty lengths and lost all chance.

OUTSPOKEN unhurried in the early going to trail, circled five wide on the bend to engage the leaders turning for home and closed well through the lane to
be going away at the wire. TAP N GLO pressed the pace to the trun, rallied two wide to take command at the head of the lane, was out-finished while
keeping on a clear second best. MAKES SENSE TO ME reserved off the pace through the turn and showed late interest to be along for the show. JACK'S
YACHT QUEEN stalked the pace into the turn, rallied between rivals to be prominent at the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. WILDCAT DREAM
sped to the lead to midway on the turn and lacked a response when challenged on the bend.

SWEET UNIQUE dueled on the pace from between rivals to the turn, continued to battle with the runner-up on the turn and down the lane and prevailed in a
determined drive. GO GIRL pressed the pace from four wide through the turn, dueled with the winner the length of the stretch and was outkicked nearing the
wire in a game effort. BODIL tracked the leaders into the turn from five wide, rallied well down the lane but was not quite good enough to close the gap.
YOU NAME IT broke outward, reserved in the early going, made a steady advance on the turn from three wide and failed to sustain the rally in the lane.
THE MIRACLE KIUT hesitated at the start while slow into stride to be well behind the pack down the backside and showed some late interest coming home.
GOLD HONEY went evenly never posing a threat. PRETTY PATTY flashed inside speed to duel on the lead to the turn and gave way on the bend.
