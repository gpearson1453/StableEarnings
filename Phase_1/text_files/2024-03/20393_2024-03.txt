LEAVE NO TRACE prompted the pace five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, steadily gained to apply
increasing pressure to the leader and swung three wide into upper stretch, seized command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat to the inside and held
gamely to prevail at the end. DAME CINCO chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly through the final eighth but missed at the finish. STARSHIP DEFIANT showed the way in
hand four then three wide under pressure from LEAVE NO TRACE to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and faced ever increasing prompting to the
outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared nearing the eighth pole, kept on to just preserve
the show honors on the wire. PROUD FOOT chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. PORTAGE broke out a step at the start, chased
three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JACKSON'S DIXIE was last to commence then hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn,
responded well under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker and held under strong urging. TRUE
EMPRESS stumbled at the start then bumped solidly with a foe, settled near the back, was roused while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, chased outside in the drive and gained gradually but missed while able to secure the place. HARLAN'S BOND tracked the pace on the
inside of a rival, came under urging late on the backstretch, was roused while moving from the two path to the three path midway through the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. BANK ON ANNA chased the pace on
the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and also lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. SILKEN
DOLLAR bumped solidly with an opponent at the start, established a good position just off the pace, began to drop back some outside the half-mile pole
then steadied, lost position while dropping back into the turn, saved ground while guided with heavy left-rein pressure around that bend, was roused outside
the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response.

MAJESTIC FRONTIER three then two wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide advancing on the front through the latter portion of the far turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command and swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside and gamely
repelled the challenge to inch away in the late stages and prevail. COLLOQUY lunged to the off side at the start brushing the gate and then got taken in
hand when HANG TIGHT bobbled in front, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing four then three wide following the aforementioned
foe, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four wide at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a to threaten the
leader to the outside through to the sixteenth marker, then got rebuffed in the late stages to the finish while clear of the rest for the place honors. CANDY
TYCOON just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to take the first run at that rival coming
under coaxing near the five-sixteenths before taking command briefly and narrowly at that station, got headed near the quarter pole and spun two to three
wide for home, then kept on to end. LORD GATLING along the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide for home, weakened in the late stages. HANG TIGHT broke out at the start and bobbled awkwardly forcing COLLOQUY to be taken briefly
in hand after his own trouble at the start, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three then two wide getting placed to coaxing at the half mile
pole, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DATESFREEDOM just off the inside through the opening bend, chased five then four wide
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. PHOEBE'S FROSTY coaxed from the start, showed the
way in hand just off the inside spurting clear early on before settling into a comfortable rhythm down the backstretch allowing the field to take closer order,
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under increasing pressure to the outside and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front with
five-sixteenths to go, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO chased the pace down the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid between foes at the quarter-pole,
took the lead in upper stretch, fought with multiple rivals into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. DYNAMITE KARMA was forwardly
placed on the outside, came under urging while four then five wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole, battled outside of foes in the stretch
and was outfinished while able to get the place. MR PHIL disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, battled under a drive
into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while clear for the show. FIRST DEPUTY broke a bit slow, moved in early then was urged along well off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CHARLIE FIVE O contested the pace on the inside of a rival,
vied inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. F F ROCKET dropped back while urged along, went
three wide on the turn and was no factor. ANYTHING PAZIBLE dropped back after the start, was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two
path and showed little. STRIKING SPEED moved off the rail while well placed under restraint, came under urging while dropping from the two path to the rail
early on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. HONORARY DEGREE stumbled awkwardly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a
few lengths, went around the turn in the five path and never reached contention.

Footnotes
MISS BOURBON chased the pace, made a bid outside the half-mile pole, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the two path on the turn,
shook clear at the five-sixteenths pole, responded well when set down after turning into the stretch, shortened stride while still clear into the final sixteenth
and held under steady urging. ZHEN LOU showed speed and led on the outside early, lost the advantage outside the five-eighths pole then chased on the
outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that bend, kept on determinedly in pursuit of
that foe in the stretch, gained in the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. NECESSARYANDPROPER bobbled after the start then stumbled,
moved up to get the lead outside the five-eighths pole, lost the advantage near the seven-sixteenths, vied inside on the turn, dropped back late on that bend
and tired while clear for the show. LADY LAWRENCE chased the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and lacked
the needed response. JEN'S KISS broke a half-step slow, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the turn and came up
empty. STONEY LONESOME was reluctant to load, leaned in at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, moved from the rail to the
two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. KNIGHT TRAIL broke in and a bit slow then was taken up off heels, spotted the
front several lengths, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. DACTILOGRAFA broke awkwardly and was off slow then was taken up,
spotted the front a few lengths, went three then two wide on the turn and was distanced.
