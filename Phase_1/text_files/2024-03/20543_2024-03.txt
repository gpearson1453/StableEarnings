continued inside rivals and gained the place through deep stretch. HUEY DUEY dueled inside the winner through the turn and weakened in the lane. HIS
GIANT failed to mount a rally three wide. HAIL STATE angled six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ELUSIVE WAR was not a factor.

CREDITOR followed the early pace to reel in MORE THAN A DIVA through the far turn and went clear under steady handling. MORE THAN A DIVA gained
a clear early lead racing about the two path, carried the lead to midway of the far turn and could not handle the winner while just lasting for the place.
REASONABLY LOVELY angled in going to the far turn while moving up and made a mild rally in the lane to just miss the place. IRISH TAP followed the
pace three wide and lacked a final closing run. FOOLISH INTENT failed to mount a bid four wide. TRIBAL SPIRIT was always back four wide. MISS CANEY
was not a factor. TAP ME A TEXT dropped back along the inside.

Footnotes
P R ODDS SETTER stalked the early pace three and four wide to bid into the far turn, cleared the field nearing the lane and held sway under steady urging.
TRACK SMART forced or set the pace inside rivals to the far turn then could not go with the winner while holding clear for the place. BAYLEYWICK settled
back along the inside and rallied to gain the show. RAY AREWETHEREYET saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide and went evenly in the drive.
PRESLEY'S ARTWORK stalked the pace from four wide and failed to mount a late bid. TENNESSEE MOON was just off the leaders between rivals then
moved outside to bid into the far turn but faded nearing the lane. VIRTUALLY was always back three wide. ADRIA showed early speed two to three wide
and weakened.
