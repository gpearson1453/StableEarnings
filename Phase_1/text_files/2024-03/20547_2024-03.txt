Footnotes
SCOTCH NO ROCKS took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the backstretch and dueled to clear Long Tom
approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. MARCUS JUNIUS settled off the early pace in the
three and four paths, saved ground on the second turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn and relented the win,
but held on for second. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground racing well off the pace, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased
out at the eighth pole and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. DON'T QUESTION ME saved ground early then eased out into the backstretch,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. CHROME HEIR raced off the rail and showed little
response. LONG TOM stalked from the three quarter pole, challenged into the backstretch but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened. I
SEE NOTHING raced in the five path the first turn and was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
MOONSET gave chase through the backstretch, raced close four wide on the turn, dug in for the lead later yards and ran clear nearing the wire.
MISSIONARY was reluctant to load then gave chase outside, took the nod two deep midway on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but
relented in later yards. LANDON JACK pressured the early pace inside, angled out past the eighth pole and dueled to take third later yards.
GLASTONBURY gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn then angled to the outside entering the stretch and showed little more. MO EH HENNESSY set a
pressured pace, was met at the rail midway on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. AIR KENNEY steadied on the chute then gave chase toward
the outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. MY BALBOA chased the early pace inside, steadied at the rail in the vicinity
of the three eighths pole and was eased into the turn.

Footnotes
JACK CLOUD took over while moving to the inside and rated the pace, kept the advantage over the challenge of A B C YA leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met into the stretch but dug in determinedly to deter that
one. The latter stalked off the rail, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole and challenged the winner leaving the far turn but was turned back through
the lane. LOUIE'S HEAT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. TIZAWINNER raced well back about the three path the opening turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail and
showed little in the lane. BULLETONTHECHARTS settled in the three path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path
on the far turn. DOWSING ROD raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole but weakened nearing the far turn. SOUTHERN SAINT
was not a factor. SUPER BUSTER rounded the first turn about the five path, left the turn outside, loped around wide and was eventually eased.

Footnotes
TEXAS TANGIE settled in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed, raced close in
the four path on the far turn, took the lead passing the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. AIM'S JUBILEE saved ground off the
pace, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the five path leaving the turn and dug in under steady handling
to share second under the wire. SAYYESTOTHELADY became anxious in the gate then stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole,
took the nod approaching the three eighths and dueled clear past the five sixteenths, was met leaving the far turn and dug in from that point, flattened stride
late but held on to share second. LUCKY BLONDE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn
off the rail, angled to the outside entering the stretch and finished evenly. EMBERLY rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, but weakened nearing mid-stretch. OREO ANGEL steadied leaving the gate, rounded the first turn
about the six path and showed little response through the backstretch. GILDED QUEST showed little response. MAGIC BEAUTY became anxious in the
gate then rated a slim lead off the rail, was met toward the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back past the five sixteenths and
gave way off the rail on the far turn.

turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. SOUL CATCHER settled off the rail the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid toward the three
eighths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far turn about the four path then finished well to clear second later yards. ALDARIGHTTRICKS stalked from
the four path the first turn, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, dropped back in the three path midway on the far turn then
dueled through the stretch for third. MR. DUMBLEDORE settled off the rail, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GIACOMO CASANOVA raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and flattened in the lane. CAFFEINENNICOTINE raced in the four path the opening turn, left the turn
outside and showed little response through the backstretch. LAST PARTY rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole
but faded at the rail on the far turn. MY BUDDY DUANE checked at the rail into the first turn then saved ground. LOVE IS WICKED raced well off the pace,
left the first turn outside and was not a factor. DESTIN'S RAINBOW tapered in and showed the way early, was met nearing the three eighths pole, gave
chase from that point but weakened past the five sixteenths pole.

MUAD'DIB settled well off the pace about the three path the opening turn and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily improved,
rounded the far turn in the five path, drifted wider toward the head of the lane but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and determinedly held off SOCIAL CHIC
through the final sixteenth. The latter stalked off the rail, challenged Remys Showtime leaving the three eighths pole and took over from that one in the three
path at the quarter pole, dug in under steady handling leaving the far turn but was met mid-stretch and outfinished the final sixteenth. NO CHANGE settled
back in the three path the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for third.
REMYS SHOWTIME drew clear and angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail at the
quarter pole and remained a factor to mid-stretch before weakening. LATE IN THE GAME stumbled at the break and mostly saved ground. CANDY
INVASION raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response.
