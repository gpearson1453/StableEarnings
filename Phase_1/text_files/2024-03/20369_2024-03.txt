LAKE NAKURU was allowed to settle early making way over towards the inside, advanced on the far turn and eased off the inside to split rivals nearing the
quarter pole, made a three wide bid off the turn and hit the front leaving the three sixteenths and after a few pops left handed with the crop quickly drew off
to prove much the best. MOON WARRIOR was slammed at the start, reserved on the inside, advanced on the turn following the winner, three wide by the
quarter pole and came four wide into the lane and ran on well for the place award while no match to the winner. SECRETARY AT WAR broke in and
bumped MOON RIVER at the start, vied for the lead three wide and made a two wide bid to draw clear on the far turn, then was headed leaving the three
sixteenths and faded in the final furlong. UNCLE YUDI was taken back early, dour wide on the backstretch, angled in on the far turn, cut the corner and had
a belated rally on the inside. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA tracked the pace three to four wide and weakened in the drive. TEMPESTUOUS was reserved early
three wide, four wide on the far turn and had no rally. JACK SLYE vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was settled three
wide and tired. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL was well placed on the inside, two wide by the quarter pole but tired.

MY LAST MISSION pressed the pace and made a three wide bid off the turn to have a long drive and got up late to prevail late. GRAB THE GOLD set a
pressured pace on the inside and then came two wide off the turn and dug in gamely but was caught late to just miss. COPPERHEAD CREEK was settled
early, saved ground and made a inside bid but was outfinished late. STRAWBERRY TREAT was reserved early, swung six wide off the turn and rallied well
late. ASHAAB was off a step slow, four wide into the first turn, then shifted in to settle two wide, tipped out three wide off the turn and ran on but had no kick.
SKIMBLE SHANKS was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. TWIXTER was settled back early and lacked a serious rally.
YES IT'S ROO chased the early pace two wide, swung out five wide leaving the turn and faded in the drive. EVENT PARTY failed to menace. KAZ SWEET
HEIST tracked the early pace four wide and tired.

Footnotes
NORMANDY LIFE pulled between rivals after breaking a half a step slow, then waited on the turn towards the inside, made a two wide bid off the turn and
went on even terms for command by the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. DEWEY DOIT dueled for the early lead and
made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, came three to four wide off the turn but was out-kicked in the final furlong, good effort. BACK FORTY was
rated along three wide, dour wide by the quarter pole, came six wide into the lane and had a mild late rally. MARY'S REWARD dueled for the lead on the
inside and weakened in the drive. CHUBLIN was rated early on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn and came five wide off the turn but was
empty. LEO'S PISCES chased the pace on the inside and weakened. GLOWING HUMOR stalked the pace three wide but stopped.

KINGDOM was away alertly and quickly crossed over to the inside, then dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid off the turn and drew out under mild
right handed crop urging to prove much the best. MAJOR THOMAS was reluctant to load, settled on the inside, three wide by the quarter pole, then finished
well to gain the place award. MR SANDMAN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn but hung in the lane,
lost place award late. DANCE CODE chased the early pace, four wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. WARRIOR'S
CAUSE tracked the pace along the inside and faded in the drive. LILTONYTWOPHONES dueled for the lead two wide and then made a three wide bid by
the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. TIZ SPEEDY was outrun early, saved ground on the turn but had no rally. ON THE RIM was settled three wide
and was not a threat.

fractious in the gate, vied for the lead on the inside and kept on but was outfinished late. POPS HARPER pressed the early pace three wide and in between
rivals, then dropped towards the inside and rated behind the leaders on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn but had no kick. STEWIE vied for the
early lead from between rivals, then dueled for the lead two wide on the turn and faded late. TWENTYEIGHTTOTHREE was outrun early and then found
best stride late. LANIE'S FIRST DUDE chased the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
NAZARENO was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and closed full of run to get up in deep stretch and then edged away
to prove best, driving. FAST FREEZE KAZ dueled for the lead on the outside, made a two wide bid leaving the quarter pole, drew clear leaving the turn and
widened the margin by the furlong marker but was caught late, second best. NORTHWOODS was settled early, three wide on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and was up for the show award. CHUCKA MOON tracked the early pace, two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane but weakened.
ONE TRUTH dueled for the lead on the inside and then was empty in the drive.
