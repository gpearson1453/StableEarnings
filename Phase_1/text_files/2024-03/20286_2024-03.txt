Footnotes
VON HOFF bumped SUPER BOURBON leaving the starting gate, circled foes on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch, remained on his left lead,
bumped with THE BIG ENCHILADA when drifting in late and was drawing clear at the end. THE BIG ENCHILADA , four deep stalking the pace leaving the
backstretch, advanced outside SUPER BOURON to take the lead in upper stretch, gave way grudgingly and bumped with the winner when drifting out in
deep stretch. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR saved ground around the turn, moved off the rail in upper stretch, raced between horses and passed tired ones.
FERRARI KID bumped with SUPER BOURBON at the start, hugged the inner rail on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and weakened. SUPER
BOURBON , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. LOST
WEEKEND dropped back on the turn, swung to the four path in mid stretch and failed to rally. BOX N BEN , four wide on the turn, gave way in upper stretch
and drifted in approaching the eighth pole. An objection by the rider of THE BIG ENCHILADA against VON HOFF for alleged interference during the late
going was not allowed.

Footnotes
IRISH LACE , three deep early and in range of the leader, emerged as the closest pursuer while in the clear and under coaxing mid turn, closed in doggedly
under stout left handed asks, collared THUNDER BUGGY a sixteenth out, forged past late and was edging away at the wire. THUNDER BUGGY pulled
clear of rivals heading to the three quarter pole, dropped in a bit and set a rated pace, widened the advantage leaving the far turn, responded when set
down two wide in upper stretch, maintained the advantage past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted and ceded grudgingly through the final yards.
MATOULA broke inward and soundly bumped with SWEET TALIA, regrouped and rated off the pace while saving some ground, advanced two wide
between runners entering the lane then chased the top two home in willing fashion. SWEET TALIA , jostled at the break, recovered and edge up to be close
past the three quarter pole, saved ground and to the inside of a trio pursuing into the stretch but came up empty in the final furlong. CONGRESS HALL , off
the pace and three deep into the far turn, circled rivals four wide with a bit of a run into the lane but failed to sustain. REDWHITEANDTACOS , rated four
wide while not too far back early on, failed to go on under asking mid turn and faded. FEATHERS (IRE) advanced towards the rail leaving the five eighths,
eased back soon after, dropped back mid turn, swung wide for the drive but lacked a rally. WILL OR WON'T , between foes leaving the chute, secured the
inside heading to the turn, failed to go on under a ride past the half and faltered.

Footnotes
SMOOTH RICO had speed along the rail then was content to be rated just off the quartet of leaders heading to the turn, eased out and worked his way
forward while between foes past the five sixteenths, sustained his run under left handed asks while laying in a bit, forged to command a sixteenth out then
eagerly spurted clear through the final forty yards. MR. MOX , snugly in hand bidding three wide between foes nearing the half mile marker, pulled his way
clear leaving the far turn, was put to a serious ride leaving the three sixteenths, steadied briefly near the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. ONE
MORE FACTOR bobbled inward at the break and was away last, corrected and moved up to threaten four deep approaching the half mile pole, chased the
MR. MOX three wide around the turn, shifted out some for the drive and kept on with effort. WORKIN ON A DREAM , five wide early, dropped in a couple
paths into the turn, came back to be about five wide in upper stretch then churned on though unable to really threaten. NICK'S LITTLE BOY vied inside early
on, could not quicken with MR. MOX exiting the three eighths, stayed on to pursue to upper stretch then faded. PATRIOTIC PARTY dropped back while
saving ground near the three eighths, eased out for the drive but failed to muster up a solid run. GRAND MANNER , off the pace, saved ground in upper
stretch. CLASS ACTOR showed speed, vied two wide between runners into the turn, failed to go on near mid turn and retreated. An objection by the rider of
MR. MOX against the winner alleging interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
HOTPOT circled the turn three to four wide, was fanned five deep entering the stretch, closed steadily outside horses and was up approaching the finish.
ADDY'S LADDY T N T , three wide on the turn chasing the pace, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, bid for the lead between horses late and just
missed. BIG ROWDY DAN , two wide on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch, altered course to the inside of ADDY'S LADDY T N T in upper
stretch, altered course to the inside of COMMANDING GENERAL near the sixteenth pole and rallied gamely inside rivals. COMMANDING GENERAL , two
wide chasing the pace on the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch, went clear in mid stretch and drifted out near the sixteenth pole when weakening.
MASAI MAN sprinted to the early lead, showed speed along the inner rail to the eighth pole then gave way. HEADS OR TAILS , a forward factor along the
inner rail on the turn, retreated through the stretch.

ONE WAY FARRIOR drifted out at the break and brushed with a rival, was nudged along while saving ground, took closer order of the three pronged duel
mid turn, eased out to advance between runners into the stretch, altered out from behind foes leaving mid stretch, closed sharply under pressure, forged to
command outside of FORCE OF JUSTICE in deep stretch then went clear at the wire. FORCE OF JUSTICE rated off the embattled trio while two wide mid
turn, angled four wide into the lane and challenged, kicked clear under asking in mid stretch, maintained the lead past the sixteenth pole, faded very late and
just saved the place. SQUARE SLICE drafted back off the early pace, saved ground past the five sixteenths, eased out to the three path in upper stretch,
worked his way between runners through the final three sixteenths then finished with a flourish to the inside of the top pair. BUCKIN' DREAMER , bumped
at the break, edged up early and stalked the contested pace while three wide, angled five wide for the drive but came up empty. ASCENDANCE , off the
pace while urged mid turn, raced three to four wide in upper stretch and had a mild response. RAKIA veered out sharply at the break, got corrected in the
opening furlong, was urged along outside a rival mid turn, weaved his way through traffic in the final eighth and kept on with interest.
BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH had speed in hand, moved up and bid between foes leaving the far turn, emerged in a battle to the inside of IRISH BANDIT past
the five sixteenths, held a narrow lead nearing the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then faded. MISTER AGENT , bumped at the break, lost ground four to
six wide and failed to generate a rally. IRISH BANDIT , with the pace outside foes, bid three deep near the three eighths, sparred to about mid stretch then
weakened. STOP BEING GREEDY , inside, was not a factor. DUBAI FIRE had speed to clear nearing the half, was joined from a pair of rivals to his outside
leaving the far turn, stayed on to about the head of the lane then tired.

BY THE GLASS stalked the pace, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch, responded to brisk whipping in mid stretch and
was allowed to relax late. TIZ VINNO , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and
rallied. YUMYUM EAT EM UP raced in the two path between horses on the turn, angled outside in upper stretch and passed tired foes. NO WALK INTHE
PARK set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. HATEFUL prompted the pace from the two path and faltered in mid stretch.
FLAG SONG FLYIN , three wide around the turn, was outrun. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL hugged the inner rail on the turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
ROYAL SEAMSTRESS prompted the pace outside ANGELOFCANTERBURY, applied more pressure while confidently handled mid turn, was floated out a
bit entering the lane, responded when set down four wide past the three sixteenths and cleared, kept on under left handed asks and denied DEVIL PAYS IN
GOLD. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD steadied between runners while close up near the half mile marker, recovered then moved up between foes past the three
eighths, shifted out five wide for the drive, closed in on her left lead leaving the furlong grounds, switched over to her correct lead in deep stretch and
finished gamely. ANGELOFCANTERBURY was nudged to the front, set the pace towards the inside, was hounded by the winner leaving the far turn, held a
tenuous advantage while guided three wide into the lane, ceded soon after then faded through the final furlong. ANGEL ART broke a bit slow, edged up
inside nearing the half and stalked, came under pressure in upper stretch but failed to generate a serious run. CHICKAHOMINY , four wide outside rivals
nearing the half, was under a ride while wide mid turn and faded. PER RULING ECM2024-14/EAD FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION DEVIL
PAYS IN GOLD IS DQD FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.
