Footnotes
GAME SEVEN led narrowly outside, repelled a challenge and shook loose nearing midstretch then remained safe under steady urging. CARNIVORE settled
inside, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. RUNANDSCORE forced the pace along the inside, moved out in the
stretch and finished willingly. DANCE A DINI raced just off pace between rivals and outside then faltered. KING SWANSBORO dropped back inside, moved
wide on the final turn and lacked a bid. RUSH CENTER trailed briefly and was never in contention. FIRST MONEY raced wide into the first turn then gave
way readily.

sixteenth marker and edged away late. PARTY AT SAM'S vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, hooked up with the winner in the stretch drive, dug in
gamely inside, bumped lightly with that rival and was no match late. LITTLE LANCE raced off the pace inside, angled out, rallied mildly outside and closed
for third. NUEDORF vied between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn, dropped back turning for home and weakened inside. GRAHMALAMADINGDONG
raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. DOS DE OROS chased three wide, came four wide into the lane and tired. GUCCI MAN trailed the

Footnotes
SPEARGUN set the pace racing with a short lead, showed the way into the far turn, drifted well off the inside at the quarter pole, responded when roused,
dug in gamely in the stretch drive and determinedly held off the runner up. IN SPADES raced close up early on the inside, then stalked two wide on the
backside, chased SPEARGUN on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of that rival in the stretch drive, dug in gamely through the final furlong
but second best. BRILLIANT CHASE steadied after the start, raced off the pace between rivals, chased inside on the far turn, gained mildly inside and got
the nod for third. KINGSVILLE raced three wide off the pace, chased between rivals on the far turn, gained mildly and just missed for third. ROAN
MOUNTAIN trailed the field, saved ground and gained some ground belatedly. JAA MODE stalked close up two wide, then three wide, chased three wide on
the far turn and faded.

FIVE DREAMS set a measured pace inside, shook loose after the half and remained clear while kept to his task. DIDINGER prompted the winner outside
and continued gamely to the finish. MR. ROUNDTREE trailed near the inside, swung wide in the stretch with good late energy. THE JUDGE AND JURY
forced the pace between rivals down the backstretch then weakened slightly. LAST ROMANCE dropped well behind then rallied mildly near the inside.
SHADY MUNNI chased wide off the leaders and was never a factor. SPEEDY BOLT raced between rivals on the turn and faltered. POWER AGENDA
saved ground within striking range then gave way.

Footnotes
ALL AMERICAN ROD hustled to a clear advantage, widened on the turn and remained safe while kept to a drive to the finish. PROFESSOR KOOL stalked
the dueling leader outside then made a gradual late gain to just capture the place. JOHN DUTTON split rivals advancing on the turn and continued gamely
to the wire. SAVINGS RATE raced off the pace outside and continued well while no threat. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE dropped well behind, raced wide then
flattened out. RETWEET trailed for half a mile and lacked a response. YO NESSROUNDONKERN saved ground, was urged on the turn then faltered.
ROAN BURGUNDY dropped off the pace, raced wide on the turn and faltered. CENTER MID MADDIE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter early then
stopped. A claim of foul by the fifth finisher against the fourth finisher for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
