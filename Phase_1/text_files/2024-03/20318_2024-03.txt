Footnotes
WEEKEND CONCERTO set the pace in the three path, waited confidently in the two path rounding the turn, was cued at the top of the lane, and drifted out
to the five path while drawing clear. FIRST SHOT FIRED tracked in the five path, was coaxed from the three path into the turn, and chased on from the four
path in the stretch for place. WALKING TESTIMONY chased in the three path, was ridden from the two path into the turn, tipped out to the four path
entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. TITAN rated in the two path, came under a ride in the three path going into the turn, swung from the five
path into the stretch, but was one paced. SIR BANANA BRIAN prompted the pace in the four path, was cued along the inside midway around the turn, but
faded in the three path down the lane. EL TEKILERO bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path before merging to the rail going into the
turn, but made no impact in the four path down the lane. BIGLY DEAL was hustled from up close in the two path but backed up along the inside around the
turn. DANELAND bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, bobbled slightly and steadied after the half, and never menaced.

Footnotes
ROYAL WINTOUR stalked the pace from the rail, moved up inside down the backstretch, dueled at the rail around the far turn then drew off under a drive in
the lane. STREET VIEW checked nearing the first turn, saved ground off the pace, circled four wide around the far turn and ran on to be clearly second
best. LADY O'BRIEN broke outwardly, pressed the pace two wide around most of the first turn, was carried out late on the bend, stalked three wide down
the backstretch, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole but was no match for the winner in the lane. SPEAK UP chased the pace two wide around the first
turn and at the rail around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane,. EL MEGEETH bore out entering the first turn, was forced even wider late on
that bend, made slight progress four wide around the far turn, lacked the needed rally and lugged in leaving the eighth pole. MONT SAINT MICHEL (FR)
raced in range three wide, was forced out late on the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and faded in the stretch. RAZZLE RED was outrun inside.
MATURITY DATE broke in a tangle and was outrun inside. FEAR AND FRIDAY set the pace along the rail, bore out late on the first turn, dueled outside of
the winner down the backstretch and around the far turn and retreated through the lane.

and weakened through the final furlong. RAGING FURY chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally.

MADAKET'S ARROW kicked clear around the first turn to set the pace while floating out to the four path entering the backstretch, waited confidently in the
two path , rounding the far turn, was cued at the top of the lane, kicked away again passing the eighth pole, and held safely. IN AWE tracked in the five path,
was coaxed from the four path into the far turn, drifted out to the eight path in the stretch, and ran on for place. FACTOR THAT stalked in the four path, bid
under coaxing in the three path rounding the far turn, drifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and evened out for show. BREEZING ALONG got rank in
the three path going into the first turn, trailed in the five path down the backside, was ridden from the three path into the far turn, bumped with an inner foe
passing the quarter, and failed to bid. TIZ ERIN raced off the pace in the two path, waited in the three path rounding the far turn, tipped out to the five path
at the top of the stretch, bumped with an outer foe, and made no impact. CERCHI laid towards the back of the pack in the four path, was coaxed along
around the far turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the stretch, bumped with an inner foe, and never threatened. CLASSY DISPOSITION chased in
the four path, was cued in the two path midway around the far turn, bumped with an outer foe passing the quarter, and weakened down the lane. LUNETTA
JAK raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

GREAT NAVIGATOR set the pace along the rail, ceded the lead midway around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead near
the sixteenth pole and lasted. CLASSIC LEGACY settled off the early pace, edged closer three wide around the turn, shifted further out in upper stretch and
rallied outside. TURBO pressed the pace outside, led in the four path midway around the turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but
kept on to save the show. BRON AND BROW had his head turned at the start, advanced five wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane.
THREETHIRTYTHREE chased the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. TOP RECRUIT had early speed two wide
and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
BREES stalked in the two path before tipping out to the three path down the backstretch, came under a ride while back in the two path going into the far
turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the stretch, was herded outward in the final sixteenth, but got up in the final strides. HOMESTEAD set the pace
inside, was roused into the far turn, kicked on from the rail turning into the lane, but drifted out in the final furlong, and was caught by an outer foe in the final
strides. TAKE YOUR SEATS (IRE) was reluctant to load, chased in the two path, tipped out to the four path down the backstretch, was driven around the far
turn, swung from the six path into the lane, but got herded out in the final sixteenth while keeping on for show. WAR OFFICER raced off the pace in the five
path, merged into the three path down the backside, was coaxed in the five path midway around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the
lane, and stayed on but was herded out in the final sixteenth. BROADCASTER tracked inside before tipping out to the two path down the backstretch, but
made no impact from the four path down the lane. BEE WELL rated from the three to four paths but never threatened. FOUR TOP prompted the pace in the

STONE SILENT pressed the pace from the rail, rated back entering the turn, stalked at the rail around the bend, bid inside of the pacesetter in midstretch,
took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. FUTURE IS NOW set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held clear of the rest. SOL
HOPE chased the pace three wide, could not threatened the top two but ran on for the show. SECRET MONEY raced off the pace three wide, swung seven
wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL stalked the pace three wide, bid near the quarter pole and weakened through the final
furlong. SARA MIA was outrun inside. THE ARCADIAN WAY bumped with FULMINATE at the start, chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
PARAMOUNT PRINCE set the pace in the three path down the backstretch, was cued in the two path just after the quarter, kicked clear in upper stretch,
and held sway. CYBER NINJA trailed in the two path, tipped out to the five path and was roused passing the three-eighths, and chased on from the five path
down the lane for place. PATOU ROAD raced off the pace in the four path, came under a ride going into the far turn, and finished evenly from the three path
in the stretch for show. SIGRUN FAST BOY stalked in the two path, was driven along the inside into the far turn, but faded on his left lead. JEOPARDY
THEORY laid up close in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn, but gaveway. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE tracked in the three path
but never menaced.

Footnotes
SWEET REBECCA checked soon after the start, was hard held while rank through the opening half-mile, raced off the pace three and four wide around the
first turn, advanced two wide around the far turn, swung five wide near the quarter pole, kicked in under mild urging in upper stretch and drew clear under
confident handling. LAST EPISODE set a rated pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch but was no match for the winner late. PAST TENSE raced
off the pace two wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn and kept on to gain the show late. JUSTIFIED STRATEGY broke step slowly,
raced off the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid around the far turn but failed to sustain it in the lane. PACIFIC FRONT chased the pace two and
three wide and lacked the needed rally. STREETERVILLE stalked the pace inside and weakened in the drive. KISSING ROCK was reluctant to load,
pressed the pace three wide and tired in the stretch. THEFORCEBEWITHYOU played no factor while racing two wide. IMPUDENCE was outrun inside.
