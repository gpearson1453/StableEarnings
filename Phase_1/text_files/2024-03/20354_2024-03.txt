Footnotes
CAUSE I'M ELEGANT tracked the pace towards the inside, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best
under left handed crop urging. DIANE was rated on the outside, made a mild bid four wide leaving the quarter pole but could not go with the winner while
being second best. JOYFUL DEPARTURE chased the early pace and was two wide by the quarter pole, then had no kick while gaining the show award.
HARD TO CATCH broke in at the start, settled early, inside into the lane and had no rally. PRINCESS WIGGY was away alertly to set the pace on the inside
while clear, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened. SECRET SPELL was shuffled back to trail the field early on the inside, came three wide into
the lane and was not a threat. CLASSICALCROSSOVER checked after the start, then failed to menace.

Footnotes
ALWAYS MIA pressed the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then shook clear nearing the furlong marker and then held well to prove
best under a drive. CHAPA was bumped at the start, well placed on the inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole and finished well but could not get to
the winner. MOONBOOTS stalked the early pace three wide and made a four wide but by the quarter pole but flattened out. MARY Q was reserved early,
made a four wide move on the turn and then had a mild late kick. PHANCY PHILLY was settled early, advanced three wide on the turn but lacked the
needed stretch bid. ARROGANTE broke in at the start, then advanced on the turn but lacked a late rally. GIRVINIZED was off slowly, then passed the tiring
rivals. WARRIOR'S DEFENSE set a pressured pace on the inside and faltered in the lane. OLIVIA DEE chased the early pace four wide and stopped.
SURPRISINGLY SWEET was through early.

Footnotes
CRICKET WEST stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then gained a short advantage off the turn and then held on to
prove best under a drive. SPECTACULLARI was well rated and three wide on the far turn, made a four wide bid off the turn but hung late to just miss.
SWITCHRATTLENROLL was reserved early, came three wide into the drive and was up for the show award. MIKEY'S JEWEL was allowed to settle but
lacked the needed winning bid. SERENE WARRIOR set the pace on the inside and was headed on the far turn and weakened the final furlong. KESTENNA
(GB) was not a factor while wide. JUSTIN TIME chased the pace on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
GURT'S WARRIOR set a pressured pace on the inside while being well handled, then made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn and then maintained a
safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. PRACTICALLYMINE was off slowly, settled on the inside, saved ground and advanced on the far turn, angled
out leaving the turn and rallied well. LOUIE'S HEAT pressed the pace three wide and faded in the drive, bested rest. SILK PRINCE was rated along two
wide, swung out four wide leaving the turn but had no kick. HE'S FANCY FREE chased the early pace on the inside, then shuffled back, advanced two to
three wide on the far turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn, then angled in nearing the furlong marker but flattened out. HE AROSE passed the tiring
rivals. SUPE tracked the pace four to three wide and tired. QUACKENBUSH was settled early and tired.
