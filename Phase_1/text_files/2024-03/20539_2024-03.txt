Footnotes
SYNTHESIS showed early speed, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe then in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then was
carried further out, dueled outside of the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. AGGREGATION broke very alertly, showed
speed then contested the pace on the inside of the winner while in hand, vied along the rail on the turn, spun off the inside into the stretch, came further out
while dueling inside of the winner in the drive and just missed while able to hold a share of the place. POWER SEEKER was urged along off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail in upper stretch, gained with good courage in the final furlong and got up for a share of second. WAKE
SURF broke out then brushed with a foe, was well placed down the backstretch, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn,
was driven four wide into the stretch then moved further out, pursued the leading duo into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead late and was
out-kicked. ALTERNATE REALITY brushed with a rival at the start then dropped back while in tight, settled at the rear, was urged three wide on the turn and
was no factor. CHAMPIONS DREAM tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved
further out, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. DIVINE ARMOR was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. AMERICAN LAW settled towards the back, saved ground on the turn, angled out into upper stretch and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
HEARD ON THESTREET was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the advantage passing the
five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear under the crop in upper stretch, drew away while kept to the task into the final forty yards then was put to lighter
encouragement while much the best. MR. GEORGIE bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in
the two path while still inside that rival on the turn, lost the advantage passing the five-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and proved
no match while able to get the place. CITIZEN MACK was hustled from the gate then urged along on the inside of an opponent, went four then five wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was along for the show. ALPHA CAT was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, altered
in behind a foe in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CASTLECOVE SPIRIT was coaxed along towards the rear, came under stronger
encouragement late on the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path, was taken up off heels in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MY MAN WOODY
settled on the outside, raced in hand while off heels leaving the backstretch, was roused five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no
factor. SHAKIN THE BELLE chased the pace on the outside then in the five path on the turn, brushed with a foe in upper stretch and weakened. RUDY
RUDY RUDY bumped with an opponent at the start, chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and tired. MODEL S
tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, was urged four wide on the turn, brushed with a rival in upper stretch and came up empty. THE ELUSIVE
DRWONG broke a bit slow then was taken up and dropped back, angled quickly to the far outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went four to three wide
on the turn, came out into the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just
inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under tussling with the runner up latched on to the inside through to the finish and gamely held sway to the end.
PRINTRACK coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared inside the three-sixteenths, fought on latched on through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire
while clear of the rest and along second best. BIG ENGINE coaxed from the start, got coaxed along chasing along the inside, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish. ICY REPLY chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide
into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. PASCHAL MOON chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. FIRST DEPUTY got away to an awkward start when the rider appeared to be balanced against the mouth of his
charge as the latch was sprung and conceded four lengths to the front, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six to seven
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BOURBON'S HOPE chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper
stretch, made no impact. POPPY'S PRIDE chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SITTIN ON GO went to the front, was well rated while showing the way from the inside to the two path, controlled the action on the far turn, responded well
when asked coming to the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved much
the best under steady urging. COMPLETE AGENDA stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was asked late on the backstretch, chased in the
three path on the far turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. RUNGIUS established a forward position early, raced inside to the two
path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired while well clear for the
show. MAJESTIC FRONTIER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside in fourth position, was urged three wide on the far turn, came four wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. SIX PERCENT brushed with a rival shortly after the start, tugged on the bit while taken under a snug hold early, went
around the first turn in the two path, settled on the backstretch, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, traveled around the far turn in the tow path and
also failed to respond. STRONG LIGHT was last to commence then brushed with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged
along passing the nine-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the far turn, came out six wide into upper stretch and was no factor. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY
brushed with an opponent after the start, angled in on the opening straightaway, saved ground while well off the pace, was urged along passing the
nine-sixteenths, continued inside on the far turn and had nothing left. BOLD VICTORY brushed with a rival after the start, went four to five wide on the turns
and showed little.

Footnotes
MYSTIC SEAPORT coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and took
command at that station, swung three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. SUE ELLEN MISHKIN showed the way in hand along the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths under challenge from her prompter, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while coming again mildly running on to secure the place honors. A NEW PEACE coaxed from the gate,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. CARROLL GIRL broke out at
the start, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the finish. JACKIE THE JOKER a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish.
SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, passed tired rivals to the finish.
WATCH YOUR TONE broke a beat slow, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and made no impact.
JACKSON'S DIXIE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, bid four wide into upper stretch to the
furlong grounds, then got wrapped up and backed away to the finish. LIBERTY FLAME chased five then four wide down the backstretch placing RUVIES IN
TIME off her heels when tucking directly in front at the nine-sixteenths, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. RUVIES IN TIME chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and had to be taken in hand off the
heels of the aforementioned foe when that rival tucked in front at the nine-sixteenths, tipped five wide into the turn and came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
MESSIER was hustled from the gate, went around the first turn in the five path, tracked the pace on the inside of a foe to the five-eighths pole then on the
outside, was given his cue in the four then three path on the far turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead outside the quarter-pole,
came inward inside the three-sixteenths then put the un-official runner-up in tight quarters, inched clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging.
LAUGHING BOY moved out while going to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the first turn, showed the way through quick
fractions, was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost the advantage late on that bend, fought inside of the un-official winner into upper stretch, checked
when that foe came in inside the three-sixteenths pole then altered out while dropping back into the final furlong, gained gradually while keeping on willingly
to the finish but missed while clear for the place. KUCHAR was hustled from the gate, dropped back between foes early, saved ground on the first turn, was
well spotted just off the pace, came under urging while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
lacked the needed response while clear for the show. QUALITY CHIC broke out then was corrected by the rider, was taken up while in tight between horses
early, went three then four wide on the first turn, was urged along towards the back, went around the far turn in the two path and failed to threaten. KINETIC
SKY was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the far turn and failed to rally. CURBSTONE
was hustled from the start then caught in the seven path on the first turn, raced on the outside near the back under urging, dropped from the five path to the
three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and was no factor. OLYMPIC DREAMS was hustled from the start then caught in the six path on
the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back with five furlongs to run, went five wide on the far turn and had nothing left. ROCCO STRONG
was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, came outward early, raced in the four path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was
urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, dropped back in the three path on the far turn and faltered. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF LAUGHING
BOY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MESSIER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE INSIDE THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW,
MESSIER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
MARGIN OF AIR three then two wide in aim of the leader, advanced to prompt that rival through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command nearing the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off
the inside and then along the inside through the turn coming under pressure from a pair midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors. NIGHT EFFECT coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside
just off the leader down the backstretch, advanced on the front three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home,
dug in shaken off by the top pair and kept on clear for the show honors. MAGICAL WAYS brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. STORMING CHROME chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. KAZ SUGAR BANK chased six to seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TETSU
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. LOOKIN AT ROSES chased five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. CENTAVO three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled seven wide into upper stretch, tired.
