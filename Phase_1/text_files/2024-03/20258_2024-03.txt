Footnotes
FROSTY RIA rated a slim lead inside, was met entering the backstretch and dueled from that point, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and
dug in under determined handling to eke out the nod over the game effort of OWE YOU ONE, who raced with the early pace in the three path, challenged
leaving the first turn and dueled from that point, contested even terms two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely, while reluctantly ceding the nod. SWIPE
THAT CANDY rounded the opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn,
drifted leaving the turn and flattened in the lane. BIT OF BLESSINGS stalked from the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the two and three paths on the far turn but flattened in the lane. LESLIE'S LAYLA saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. COLD CASH raced inside on the first turn then faded through the backstretch. SWISS HORIZON rounded the first turn about the three
path, left the turn outside and showed little response.

speed to take over the final strides. CASTLE LIGHTS took over on the chute and set a pressured pace, contested the rail on the turn, dug in under steady
stretch handling but was caught in the final strides. BAYLIS STREET broke outward and made contact with SEEMS TO WHISPER then pressured the pace,

ANOTHER FINE JUBA closed to the front at the half mile pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure at the three eighths, rounded the turn at the
rail and held on with steady handling. BULL'S LEGACY pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and came back in the lane
to finish well. UNITE THE GIRLS was bumped at the break, gave chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn near the rail, then flattened in the
lane. WOODEN SHIPS chased, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the lane. LIZZY LOU was bumped inward and into Unite The Girls
leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and weakened in the lane. HOLY MOAT came in at the break
and made contact with Lizzy Lou, gave chase outside, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened.
