Footnotes
TOOMUCHAINTENOUGH led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and drew off in the lane. A BIT OF
CAPTAIN tracked the leader on inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on to the wire. EUCLID
AVENUE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack early, came around the bend in the three path and improved
position in the stretch. IT'S ABOUT TIME raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and gained
ground late. Z RACES stalked the leader on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the four path and weakened in the lane.
MACKOR veered out leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five and six path coming around the turn and
faded in the stretch. GRAY MEDALLION trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and made up some ground in the lane
while never threatening. CHARLICITO bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the rail early, saved ground
around the bend and was outkicked from there. LAKE CHAPALA raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path
and showed no kick. EL KOZAN bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile,
