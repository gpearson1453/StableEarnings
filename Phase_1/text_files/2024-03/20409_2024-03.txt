SILVER MATT wouldn't load in the gate, saved ground, drew on even terms for the lead under right handed urging in upper stretch and proved best by the
narrowest of margins in a stretch long drive. BARRELHOUSE set all the pace under pressure and just missed hanging on in a game effort while two wide.
CHARGER pressed the pace three wide and was outfinished. HAD RIGHT trailed around the clubhouse turn, moved up four wide before a half then came
up empty. KALINBA vied for the lead three then four wide and weakened in deep stretch.

GUNNER GABRIEL sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn, was headed briefly by the winner up at the quarter pole, fought back
gamely under right handed urging to regain the advantage before the furlong marker and proved best under strong handling. WHO DA BOSS allowed to
settle, surged to the front with a rapid move three wide through the turn gaining a narrow advantage at the quarter pole, matched strides until deep stretch
and finished second best. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE raced outside, moved closer four wide into the turn then failed to sustain that bid. I STRONG chased the
winner two wide into the turn then weakened.

MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide under strong left handed urging through upper stretch, was put to an energetic hand ride
late and got up in the final strides. UNIDENTIFIED MAN stalked the early pace, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch, set the balance of the
pace then couldn't handle the winner. COMPASS POINT trailed into the stretch and closed a gap late in the five path. UNCLE EARL away alertly, set the
pace inside rivals into the turn, matched strides from the five sixteenths pole to the furlong marker then weakened. GEMO RAIN pressed the early pace two
wide, remained a sharp threat for a half then faded. TWICE AS SMART pressed the early pace three then two wide, drew on even terms for the lead
midway on the turn, dueled into the stretch and gave way late.
