Footnotes
SHUTUPN'KISSME set a pressured early pace, was met toward the five sixteenths but regained the edge two deep nearing the quarter pole, dueled clear
passing the sixteenth pole and held on well. BLUE HOUR was hustled to contention and dueled to a slim brief lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met
toward the quarter, remained a close factor nearest the rail on the turn but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened approaching the wire.
KNOBIESMAGICSONDE came in early then gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then dueled for third. WINDSOR'S PLAY was hustled to
contention and raced with the early pace, but steadied from between horses leaving the five sixteenths pole and flattened at the rail on the turn. GREAT
DEVOTION gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, left the turn outside and showed little more. CALIENTE RUM gave chase through the
backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the lane. VICTORIAN RIVIERA flipped in the paddock, gave early chase outside then
weakened near the rail on the turn. ZUPITA was shuffled back on the chute, gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path.

turn, dug in under steady handling from the head of the lane but was met under the wire. SYMPTOMATIC gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn off the rail, dug in leaving the turn and reached even terms under the wire. UNITE THE GIRLS gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then
dueled through the stretch and took third the final stride. HEART STOPPING engaged in close chase through the backstretch, remained a factor in the three
path on the turn and dug in from the head of the lane, but was nipped from third under the wire. LADY RAMBO chased, angled to the rail on the turn, eased
out toward mid-stretch and finished evenly to close the gap. CANDY TRICKS gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. MASH TATERS
hesitated at the break then saved ground. I'M FLYING UP refused. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race before posting it official.

terms nearest the rail past the quarter, dug in determinedly leaving the turn and raced clear under the wire. The latter stalked then challenged approaching
the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep past the quarter, dug in gamely leaving the turn but reluctantly ceded inside the sixteenth pole.
MORETHANREADYEDDIE stalked from the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path on
the far turn, then flattened stride mid-stretch. ROCKET APPEAL rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
then flattened in the stretch. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path

Footnotes
AIM FOR THE CORK ducked out and made contact with On A Whim leaving the gate then gave chase, came between horses to take over at the quarter
pole, raced briefly clear midway on the turn, dug determinedly while in an outward drift through the stretch and eked out the advantage over the game effort
of EVANESCO, who closed to the front inside and rated the early pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and was met at the pole, dropped
back midway on the turn but dug in a game stretch factor. SUGAR LIPS gave chase, entered the turn off the rail then angled to the seven path through the
turn and finished well to take third later yards. DR RENDEZVOUS was reluctant to load then pressured the early pace outside, dropped back at the quarter
pole, raced in the five path on the turn then flattened in the lane. ON A WHIM was bumped at the break then angled to the outside to give chase, raced off
the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. METALLIC CAT engaged in close early chase but faded past the five sixteenths pole. DOG TOWN ALLEN
set a pressured early pace then challenged toward the five sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the quarter and flattened off the rail on the turn. DIRECT
THE SHOW gave close early chase but faded approaching the five sixteenths pole.
