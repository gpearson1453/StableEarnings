Footnotes
KITTEN WITH A WHIP raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming
around the far turn and kicked clear in the stretch. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS saved ground early, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the far bend from the four path and kept on to the finish. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and weakened in the lane. SNEAKY CHEEKY raced in the three path around the first bend,
tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the two path and tired from there. TEMPEREYA trailed the field from
the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WHEELINGNDEALING dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and dug in gamely in the stretch, drifting mildly
late and just getting the bob for the win. THE SWEATY FOX dueled on the outside through the opening quarter, continued to battle from the four path
around the turn and dug in gamely to the wire, just missing. BAND SWEETHEART stalked the pace setter on the outside through the early going, navigated
the bend from the four path and chased on in the lane. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around
the bend and was outkicked in the stretch. WAIT A SEC chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path
and faded from there. OUR LITTLE TIGER raced off the pace through the opening stages, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
BEATIFUL KARLA bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a
bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear. MISS EASY hit the gate leaving it and bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled in the
middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
chased the winner home in the lane. CHRIS'S MOTOWN GAL bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch. SUSIE'S SAVER raced off the pace early, came
around the turn in the three path and improved position in the lane while never truly threatening. HUMOR SENSE led the field up the backstretch, dueled
while saving ground around the turn and faded in the lane. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
dropped back while saving ground around the turn and was outkicked from there. HALLANVAARA trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around
the bend and made no bid.

Footnotes
CHARGING AERO raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole
and gained ground to kick clear late. BIG LOUIE chased the leader on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the bend and dueled in the
stretch, getting caught near the wire. SARATOGA BANKER led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and into the stretch
and was caught late. ROCKINGHAM JOE raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter, began a bid from the two path coming around the
bend and dueled in the lane, getting caught late. LOYAL LOUIE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to track the leader between
horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. BANG A RANG raced off the pace on the outside early, angled in to
save ground around the turn and made no bid. SONG RUNNER bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, stalked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, came around the bend in the five path and tired from there.

CALL ME ICE MAN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the
lane. MR JACK tracked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and gained ground late. ESTILO
MAGICO chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch. GRANTED SUCCESS
dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn from the two path and chased on to the finish. COOL MEMORY raced off the pace
between horses early, came around the bend in the two path and showed no kick. JAY'S DELIGHT dueled on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to
the five path coming around the turn and faded in the lane. LINE TO GAIN trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was never a
