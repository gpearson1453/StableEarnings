Footnotes
CLICKING rated off of the decent early pace, improved position into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch
and ran evenly while within aim approaching the furlong marker, wore down foes into the final sixteenth, reeled in the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a
drive to prevail. STREET TIGER broke alertly, assumed early command and set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn
and showed the way to the quarter marker while a bit off of the rail, set down into upper stretch, kept foes at bay with a furlong remaining, felt pressure into
the final sixteenth, was overtaken into deep stretch and held for second at the finish. SOCIAL STATUS squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start, was off a
bit slowly and was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position into the turn then came in tight nearing the quarter marker, found room into upper
stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the top pair into deep stretch and just held for third at the finish.
DIPLOMATIC away in good order and forwardly placed leaving the start, got caught in tight early on and checked past the five furlong marker, stalked the
moderate pace two to three wide along the turn, chased STREET TIGER into the stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and just missed for show
honors. RIVER MARKET chased the decent early pace from between rivals, ran in pursuit three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the
stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. WHAT'S IN A NAME chased the decent early pace from the outside, went four wide into the turn and lost
position at the quarter marker, gave way into the stretch and did not offer a late response. MISTICAL CANDY prominent away from the start, chased the
decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn, lost position at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch drive. THE RIDER OF
DIPLOMATIC LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF STREET TIGER FOR INTERFERENCE ALONG THE BACKSTRETCH RUN. THE
STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
HAVAKASH READY hopped at the start but was away in good order, assumed early command and set a moderate pace while prompted to the half-mile
marker, set the pace while a bit off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from
GOOD FOCUS into deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. GOOD FOCUS forwardly placed leaving the start, prompted the moderate early pace
outside of HAVAKASH READY, kept close attendance to the pacesetter into the turn and pressed two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, was turned
away into upper stretch and chased HAVAKASH READY to the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, closed well in the final strides and just
missed for the win at the finish, while besting the rest. RANCHO RED rated off of the early pace, rushed up nearing the half-mile marker then came in tight
while between runners approaching the turn, was shuffled back and chased two wide into the bend, closed in the stretch but could not impact the top pair at
the finish and was well clear for third. DANZ TILL TEN took back off of the early pace, rushed up along the inside nearing the half-mile marker and stalked
the pace from the inside approaching the turn, came in a bit tight entering the bend and steadied at the three furlong pole, lost position and chased to the
quarter marker, weakened into the stretch and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
SEA OF LIBERTY was unprepared for the start and missed the break then settled a the rear of the compact field along the rail through the clubhouse turn,
made slow steady forward progress to get back into contention down the backstretch, started to rally from the three-furlong marker, then tipped out to the
three path to bid for the lead approaching the stretch, caught the dueling leaders just past the eighth pole and won clear. TORPEDO AWAY broke alertly
and was up early to challenge DESERT DUDE for the lead, opened up on the rest down the backstretch, continued to duel through the turn and into the
stretch, got a nose in front near the eighth pole but was unable to hold off the winner. DESERT DUDE broke on top then was pushed to get to the lead and
the rail, had TORPEDO AWAY as a constant shadow to the outside, set moderate fractions to the turn then quickened in tandem from the three-eighths
pole, battled gamely to mid-stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. YOU KIDDING ME was not asked for speed from the break and was outrun
to the turn, circled four wide to get up with the leaders before the turn down the backstretch, then allowed the two pacesetters to go on and dropped back to
a tracking position, was set down passing the three furlong pole, came four wide into the stretch and was unable to improve. BABY FRANKIE tracked the
pacesetters to the far turn, began to struggle to keep up approaching the three furlong marker, and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROSES R BLUE allowed to settle in the early stages, trailed to the half-mile marker and was guided three wide into the turn, roused five wide into the
stretch, improved position at the furlong marker, closed fast and took command into the final sixteenth, held the runner-up at bay in deep stretch and kept to
task to prevail. KERRYGOLD LADY away from the gate in good order, took back off of the decent early pace and tracked to the half-mile marker while
outside of runners, improved position into the turn and chased four wide nearing the quarter pole, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, came within aim
of the lead past the furlong marker, was outfinished into the final sixteenth and was clear of the rest for second. SMOOVE AS SILK rated off of the decent
early pace, tracked from the second flight and raced between rivals nearing the half-mile marker, chased two wide and between runners into the turn then
was boxed in at the quarter pole, shifted three wide into upper stretch and closed into the final furlong, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch but
finished well and got up in the final strides to secure third. DON'T TELL HYDEE stumbled at the break and was away a bit slowly, rushed up in the early
stages and pressed the pace while between rivals nearing the half-mile marker, contested the decent pace into the turn and vied for the lead two wide at the
quarter pole, took command into the stretch and shook free approaching the furlong grounds, was kept to task while all out heading to the sixteenth-marker,
overtaken into deep stretch, weakened in the final stages and just missed for third. AMANDA ROSE broke alertly and was prominent away from the start,
ceded the early lead and stalked the pace three wide nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole,
ran in pursuit into the stretch, got caught behind a tiring rival nearing the sixteenth-marker and altered course into deep stretch, could not muster the needed
late response and was outfinished. RUNNING LUCK close up to the decent early pace, chased into the turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, was
outrun to mid-stretch and gave way. LA POPIS hard sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace while prompted to the half-mile
marker, disputed the pace into the turn and dueled through moderate fractions nearing the quarter marker, took an awkward step and steadied nearing the
top of the lane, lost position into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and faded.

Footnotes
RIMPROTECTOR was allowed to settle from the break, unhurried, then kept in the clear three to four wide through the first half-mile while gradually
advancing, was given the cue to go on approaching the three furlong pole, inhaled the leaders before the top of the stretch, then surged under steady
handling and intermittent urging to win clear. AMERICAN FARMER got away well and was up with the leaders before the first turn but backed off the
developing speed duel, tracked three wide through the early going, launched a bid from the three furlong marker, came three wide into the stretch under
pressure, had trouble changing leads the whole of the stretch but still managed to gain the second spot. PASSARANDO settled mid-pack to the inside, sat
well behind the duel up front, was asked to go on when the pace quickened with three furlongs to go, did not immediately respond but was kept to task
under steady handling and was able to grab third in last jumps. ROYAL 'N RANDO broke well and was pushed to get forward position, hooked up in a
moderate speed duel with LOVE CANDY near the seven-eighths pole and was lapped on that outside of that rival to the stretch, battled determinedly and
got a nose in front inside the sixteenth but was outfinished for a minor award. LOVE CANDY bobbled at the start but recovered quickly and won the race to
the first turn, was joined by ROYAL 'N RANDO at the seven-eighths pole and dueled that foe through moderate fractions to the turn then matched that one
stride for stride down the stretch and gave way grudgingly in a game effort. HONOS MAN was off a bit slow, lagged at the back of the compact field went
into a drive with three furlongs to run but was outkicked and chased the field to the wire.

TALK ABOUT AUTISM bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, tracked the fast early pace from an inside position and was well placed heading into
the turn, chased to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into upper stretch and was asked for run into the drive, loomed at the furlong marker and drew to
even terms with WAR GAMES past mid-stretch, dueled with that game rival into the final sixteenth, wore down the runner-up in the final strides and held in a
drive to prevail. WAR GAMES off a step slowly away from the start, was hustled to be forwardly placed and assumed early command, set solid fractions
while pressed into the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out quick fractions heading to the quarter pole, led into the stretch and held foes at bay at
the furlong marker, met the bid of TALK ABOUT AUTISM past mid-stretch and battled that runner into the final sixteenth, dueled to deep stretch, was
gamely bested in the final strides and was well clear of the rest for second. HONEYMOONZ OVER pressed the fast early pace outside of WAR GAMES,
lost ground into the turn and chased two to three wide and between runners approaching the quarter pole, was shuffled back into the stretch and ran in
pursuit to the furlong marker, finished evenly and won the battle for show honors in the final strides. YES HE CAN broke alertly from his outside post, ceded
the early lead and stalked the fast pace four wide heading to the half-mile pole, chased four wide along the turn and improved position nearing the quarter
pole, shifted three wide into upper stretch and was outkicked at the furlong pole, weakened into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third in the final
strides. COASTAL JAZZ prominent away from the start, stalked the fast early pace three wide and between rivals heading to the half-mile pole, chased
three wide and between runners into the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, gave way into the final sixteenth and
could not muster a late response.

MOBOU was taken in hand from the break, pulled a bit down the backstretch, navigated traffic through the far turn, had to wait a bit for room at the
three-sixteenths pole, split horses approaching the furlong grounds, assumed command and held driving in deep stretch. MOGOLLON RIM was last away
and not asked for speed early, was content to lag a the back of the field for the first half mile, took the two path through the far turn, tried to slip through a
narrow opening at the three-sixteenth and had to check slightly, was stuck behind horses to deep stretch, split horses inside the sixteenth-marker, found
another gear late and got up for second in a gutsy effort. UNION WAVE came away well but did not get involved in the early pace, secured a good position
along the rail, responded when set down passing the three furlong pole, tipped out three wide to get even with the dueling leaders at the three-sixteenths
pole, then flattened out late but finished on good courage to get third. DRUIDIC broke well and set out for the lead, won the race to the turn then joined by
NO SECRET past the seven-eighths pole, attempted to slow the pace down as that foe backed off to a stalking position, held sway through the far turn then
went into drive passing the five-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch with a short lead but was overtaken and missed out on a minor award. EXPLAIN THIS
AUDIT got off to a poor start then lagged near the rear of the field, made some forward progress down the backstretch, got into a bit of a box going into the
far turn, had clear run into the stretch, stayed on the rail and finished evenly. NO SECRET stumbled at the start then rushed up into the early mix, got a
share of the lead going into the first turn, took up a stalking position under a tight hold just off the flank and to the outside of DRUIDIC, tried hard but was
unable to get past that foe then weakened in the late stages. J D'S RUDE BOY was off a step slowly then raced three wide in the middle of the tracking
group through the early stages, went four wide through the far turn then five wide into the stretch but was unable to make an impact in the stretch. DEBS TIZ
broke well and was up with the group contesting the early pace into the first turn, raced at the head of the tracking group down the backstretch, was unable
to keep up when the pace quickened near the three furlong marker, dropped to last and chased the field the rest of the way.
