SO CAL MEMORY chased the leaders up the backstretch, challenged while saving ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. TEAGANS ATM
bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to duel from the rail up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and could not go
with the winner in the stretch but kept on to the wire. THIRSTY drifted in and bumped with W. WHITEHOUSE leaving the gate, dueled on the outside
through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the four path and weakened late. HERMISTON raced off the pace on the inside early, continued
around the turn in the three path and improved position mildly in the lane. ROUGE SUNSET bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced off the
pace up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and showed no kick. W. WHITEHOUSE was bumped and forced to take up sharply shortly
after leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path around the turn and was empty in the stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE
INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, HORSE SIX, THRISTY, WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE.
