Footnotes
FITTS N STARTS pressed outside of the leader, failed to sustain pressure despite urging turning for home, yet kept on along with an inner bidder to drive
past the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. SWEET LITTLE ROSE pursued from midpack in the two path, advanced between horses around
the far turn, sustained progress to bid along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, but got outkicked. QUEEN OF THE MOON trailed along the inside, then
in the five path around the far turn, yet rallied outside of foes to reach show late. NICELY UNIFIED showed the way inside of a pressing foe, inched away
from that one in the two path turning for home before being set down entering the lane, but yielded to an outer pair of bidders at the sixteenth pole. OAK
HILL SENIORITA laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. CANA GRIS stalked two to three wide, chased under urging in the four path
around the far turn and faded. LIGHTENING MO stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
MOVE IT BABY stalked along the inside, tipped to the three path entering the lane, surpassed an inner rival to take aim inside of the leader in upper stretch,
drove past that one at the furlong grounds and drew clear. MISS TULSA pursued from the two path, steadied into the turn, then ran on between horses to
edge place in the final sixteenth. MADAM HENNY chased forwardly in the four path, then stayed on but needed more for place. IRONIT prompted the leader
from the three path, vied into the turn, led turning for home, but hung on her left lead, got bested by an inner bidder in midstretch and weakened. CANT
ATTACK ARCH set the pace inside of a prompting foe while a path off of the inner rail, but got headed by that one turning for home and weakened. MYSTIC
STORM trailed in the three to four path and got outrun. SIKUM lacked speed along the inside, but suffered a catastrophic injury and fell passing the three
sixteenths pole, then was euthanized. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
COUNTRY GUY tracked from midpack in the two path, chased through upper stretch before gaining passing the furlong grounds, split foes entering the final
sixteenth to offer a bid and edged ahead. CABOCHON TREASURE was tough to load, stalked in the three path, pressed around the turn, wrestled an
advantage at the furlong grounds, but lugged outwardly nearing the final sixteenth and was caught by an inner bidder in the late stages. COLT'S BRIM laid
off of the pace along the inside, rallied shifting out to the five path in the final furlong, then moved out wider while sustaining progress to gain show.
CHAOTIC JACK stalked from the two path before saving ground in pursuit around the turn, tipped to the four path to take aim outside of the top pair entering
upper stretch, gradually closed in but was floated outwardly by the lugging leader nearing the final sixteenth and was taken in hand before getting outkicked.
HANDSOME HAROLD showed the way inside of a prompting foe while a path off of the inside, clung to an advantage through upper stretch while hanging
on his left lead, got headed at the furlong grounds and gave way. LIL WOADIE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear in the three path
and improved late. FLASH N CLASS tracked in the four path, chased getting floated to the five path entering the lane, then lugged inwardly in upper stretch
and gave way. EL IT lacked speed in the four to six path and failed to factor. VERO CAMPIONE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then was
outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
MISTER MMMMM broke through the gate pre-race, dueled for the lead with an outer rival while a path off of the inside around the turn, drew clear of his
counterpart entering the lane, maintained a clear margin into deep stretch, but tired as a rival. SWIFT AS I AM chased along the inside, swung out to the six
path entering upper stretch, rallied while flopping back to his left lead in midstretch, sustained progress to close in on the leader in the late stages but ran out
of ground. READY TO POUNCE trailed along the inside and advanced up the rail to gain show late. GILCREASE broke through the gate pre-race, tracked
two wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but got outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch and lost show to an inner foe in the final sixteenth.
CHARGING dueled with the eventual winner from the three path, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
LITTLE BLAZE prompted two wide while a bit keen, steadied briefly approaching the half mile pole, gained an advantage travelling well in the bit with three
furlongs to go, cleared entering the lane and drew off handily. SAVAGE DARLING broke a step slow before being brushed by an outer rival at the start,
advanced between horses to stalk from the two path approaching the turn, tipped outside of the top pair turning for home, gained place at the eventual
winner shook free entering the lane, proved no match for that one and held place thereafter. MISS LONELYHEARTS bumped with an outer rival before
brushing an inner foe at the start, chased from midpack in the three to two path under urging into the turn, advanced inside of rivals while shifting to the four
path at the three sixteenths pole and ran on willingly. PRIZE DEBATE advanced in the four to five path into and around the turn, but flattened out in upper
stretch. DREAMING ALWAYS broke slowly, trailed in the three path, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up while hanging on her left lead.
SCOOP laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. HEART OF HANISCH set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed at the three furlong
pole and falterd entering the lane. WARM FUZZIES bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked in the three to four path but faded between horses in upper
stretch.

TUSSLING CHARLIE brushed the gate upon leaving it, but was quick to recover to show the way via a loose advantage in the two path, led in hand along
the inside around the far turn, then drew off under a drive. KICKIN CHIP stalked the clear leader from the three to two path, but failed to keep pace while
chasing in the three path in upper stretch, sustained pursuit hanging on his left lead and lasted for place. EMILY'S BOY tracked along the inside, then
sustained a chase to miss reaching place. OUR MAJESTIC checked back passing the wire for the first time, pursued from midpack along the inside into the
first turn, but was restrained to lay further back leaving that bend, altered course outwardly and across rivals' paths with seven sixteenths to go, took the far
turn in the five to six path, then ran on to reach fourth at the wire. RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM settled off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the four
to five path, stayed on to gain fourth in the final furlong by was nailed by an outer rival at the wire. BOSTON BLITZ broke a step slow, saved ground well
back and advanced inside of rivals. BRADFIELD BABY tracked four wide and between horses, faded in the three path among foes turning for home, yet
regained stride shifting to the six path in midstretch, but encountered traffic entering the final sixteenth. REGATTA BAY pursued from midpack while held up
in the three path and among foes around the first turn, shifted four wide in pursuit in upper stretch but lacked a bid and yielded between horses. CATCH ME
T steadied from crowded quarters between horses early on, trailed three wide, got floated to the six path around the far turn, shifted in and made little
impact. CONTRABAND EARLY lunged outwardly at the start, lacked speed two wide and between horses, steadied when an inner rival shifted across his
path at the seven sixteenths pole, then pursued in the three path among foes in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MISTERHOLYROLLER pursued from
midpack in the five path early on, took closer order tracking down the backstretch, but came under coaxing three wide around the far turn and weakened
between horses while hanging on his left lead. THE RIDER OF CONTRABAND EARLY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OFOUT MAJESTIC FOR
INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE FAR TURN, HOWEVER THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
HELEN'S LITTLE SIS tracked four wide tucked to the two path behind the leading trio into the turn, smoothly took aim outside of the newly-clear leader in
upper stretch, bid in the final furlong, sparred through the late stages and prevailed. PLUM TRICKY showed the way along the inside, shook free of outer
pressers entering the lane, dug in to resist an outer challenge leaving the furlong grounds, dueled gamely late but got nailed at the wire. OH MY MIA tracked
from midpack along the inside and ran on willingly to gain show at the furlong grounds. FLIGHTNING BOLT broke a step slow and trailed early on,
advanced in the four to five path around the turn, then stayed on in the six path to reach a minor share. HAUNTRESS bumped with an inner foe at the start,
laid off of the pace in the five path, bumped with inner rivals into the turn before tucking down to the three path, then sustained a chase in the four to five
path through the lane to miss show. SALLY O'MALLEY broke a beat slow yet rushed forward early on to prompt the leader from the three path, but faded
three wide in upper stretch. GOLDEN DEGREE stalked outside of the top pair, pursued within striking range turning for home in the four path, but weakened
four wide in upper stretch. CHOCOLATECHOCOLATE bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path and between horses, but
bumped with rivals on both sides and checked into the turn, pursued from the two path soon after and made little impact. DREAMSCAPE lacked speed
along the inside and never got involved. MIZ MASTERY raced keenly off of the pace three wide and between horses, bumped with an outer foe and
steadied into the turn, then faded.

Footnotes
CORNISHMAN stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid into the far turn, gained command with five sixteenths to go, drew clear in upper
stretch, dug in to meet an outer challenge in the final sixteenth and held confidently while put to hand in the shadow of the wire. GUN PARTY pursued from
midpack along the inside, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, rallied hanging on his left lead to close in on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but
was kept at bay late. ELEPHANTS EAR stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path to gain place and take aim on the clearing leader entering the
lane, but only managed to chase thereafter and got outkicked for place passing the furlong grounds. CASCADE CRUISER broke inwardly, laid off of the
pace just a bit off of the inside, then stayed on willingly. PATRIARCHAL showed the way along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner turning for
home and faded. FALCON QUEST lacked speed two wide, took the far turn in the six path and failed to factor. AIR IT OUT tracked in the three to four path,
chased into the far turn and gave way. KISSTHEMOON lacked speed in the four to five path, inched closer around the far turn, but tired hanging on his left
lead through the lane. ON MY HONOR trailed in the two path and got outrun.

Footnotes
BIG DREAMING rated well back along the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, surged between horses to bid inside of the leaders in the final
sixteenth and got up late. WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) tracked two wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, sustained gradual progress to bid at the
sixteenth pole, vied late but got outfinished by an inner bidder. FREEDOM'S WAY stalked two wide, pressed before bidding in the three path entering the
lane, vied gamely among foes into deep stretch but was bested by bidders on either side late. NORTHERN INVADER pursued from midpack three wide,
shifted five wide into upper stretch, but lacked the required punch while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, ran on but needed more to bid
for show. BEUYS (IRE) got rank among foes and steadied into the first turn, settled off of the pace two wide, fanned to the six path in upper stretch and ran
on willingly. VERBAL was brushed b an outer rival soon after the start, trailed in the two path then offered a belated charge among foes in the late stages.
ARDANWOOD stalked along the inside, bid inside of the top pair in upper stretch, forged an advantage in midstretch but faltered entering the final sixteenth.
DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) showed the way along the inside, got headed between bidders in upper stretch and weakened late. EVAN HARLAN laid off of the
pace along the inside, awaited racing room nearing the lane, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, but steadied when
stymied behind traffic at the sixteenth pole. KENTUCKY GHOST brushed an inner rival soon after the start, lacked speed three wide, fanned out to the
seven path into upper stretch and made little impact. DONEGAL FACTOR saved ground in midapck and faded.

Footnotes
OAK HILL LG brushed an outer rival and was off a step slow, lacked speed three wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane and offered a good kick to
sweep past the leader late. BLACKTECA bumped by an inner rival at the start, showed the way along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder entering the
lane, fought back to reclaim an advantage in the final furlong, but was overhauled by an outer bidder late. BERTIE'S GALAXY stalked three wide, bid turning
for home, led entering the lane, but hung on his left lead and gave in between horses late. DREWMAZING was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at
the start, raced well back along the inside, moved to the four path while between horses in midstretch and stayed on. HALF AGAIN tracked four wide and
lacked a bid. LAURI'S WISH saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN hopped slightly at the star, laid off to the pace two wide,
shfited to the six path in midstretch and failed to factor. HELAIRE trailed then improved late. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK pressed two wide and weakened
between horses entering the lane. GOLD PUNCH bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside and weakened.
