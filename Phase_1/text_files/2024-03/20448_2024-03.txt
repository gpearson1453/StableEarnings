SIZZLE settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and powered clear through the lane. MOBAY PRINCESS set the
pace inside, yielded leaving the eighth pole but held clear of the rest. BANANA SPLIT stalked the pace inside, tipped two wide midway around the far turn,
had aim in upper stretch but was no match for the top two. LITTLE MISS MUNNY saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed rally. JULYSATURDAYNIGHT raced up close four wide around the first turn, moved up to press the pace down the backstretch, chased three wide
around the far turn and faltered in the lane. SPECTACULAR FORCE chased the pace three and four wide and retreated after six furlongs.

Footnotes
IMPERIOUSLY stalked inside, waited along the rail rounding the turn, was cued from inside at the top of the lane, bid up the rail passing the eighth pole, got
put in tight thru the final sixteenth, but prevailed. NO ACTION set the pace inside, waited confidently rounding the turn, was roused from the two path into
the stretch, dug in while facing an inner challenger and tipped in to tighten things up passing the eighth pole, but lost the bob to place. INTO TOURING
chased in the three path, was coaxed midway around the turn, got floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly for show. GREEK
MOJO rated in the two path and made no impact from the three path down the lane. VAL'S GAL prompted the pace in the two path, floated out to the five
path in upper stretch, but flattened.

Footnotes
SOUPER ENERGIZER showed the way in the two path down the backstretch, was cued while just off the rail midway around the far turn, opened slightly in
upper stretch, and held sway. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY stalked in the two path, was roused from the rail into the far turn but had to steady midway around
that far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. MEGAYACHT had a slow start, tracked in the four path, ranged up
three wide approaching the quarter, but hung while back in the four path down the lane for show. MCMONEY rated in the three path, was cued midway
around the far turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. YOU TALKIN TO ME had to steady early, raced wellback in
the two path, was coaxed along in the three path around the far turn, stayed on, but made no impact in the five path down the lane. LIGHT FURY was held
up in the two path turning into the backstretch, floated out to the five path under a drive turning into the lane, but never threatened. MY MAN FLINT was
unhurried along the inside, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but never menaced. UNCLE CURLY prompted the pace in the three path,
was ridden between foes around the far turn, but had to check around the three-sixteenths, and was eased. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
LIGHTS OF BROADWAY AGAINST THE RIDER OF SOUPER ENERGIZER FOR INTERFERENCE MIDWAY AROUND THE FAR TURN WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BELLA FUTURE stalked the pace in the four path, steadily gained through the final furlong and was up late. TIVY set a fast pace in the two path and led
until deep stretch. CANTARO was bumped at the start, raced well back in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied for the show. GRIMES
prompted the pace in the three path and was one-paced through the stretch. HILARIOUS AFFAIR was off a step slow, lagged inside and had a mild stretch
gain. MR. AMERICAN bumped with CANTARA at the start, raced two wide around the turn and was no threat.
