Footnotes
PRINCETOWN laid in range from the two path, waited along the rail rounding the far turn, was coaxed thru an opening along the inside to bid passing the
eighth pole, drew clear around the sixteenth, and held sway. GROG bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off the pace inside, was roused in the three
path early around the far turn but got stymied passing the quarter, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. HANGIN IN
THERE rated in the four path, was roused while three wide going into the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch bumping an outer
foe, and kept on for show. MY LIFE STORY broke slow and had to steady at the start, trailed in the three path down the backstretch, circled inner foes in the
five path around the far turn, got bumped out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and stayed on. TYPHOON FURY chased between foes in the three
path, was nudged along while looking room in the two path rounding the far turn, but was stuck behind traffic in the stretch, and could not make a bid.
JUVENTUS bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, was coaxed between foes while two wide going into the far turn, but flattened
from the three path in the final furlong. BOURBON OUTLAW raced wellback in the three path, was coaxed along around the far turn, but failed to factor from
the eight path in the stretch. ENDLESS REIGN tracked in the four path, was cued while three wide early around the far turn, but faded between foes in the
five path down the lane. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND went clear around the first turn to set an open pace along the inside, was roused in the two path turning
into the stretch, but gaveway in the final furlong. THE JIG IS UP (IRE) had a slow start, was unhurried along the inside but never threatened from the six
path down the lane. DUNES OF GOLD got a bit rank and had to steady going into the first turn, was held up in midpack from the two path but came up
empty entering the stretch.

BE LIKE CLINT settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, closed outside, seized command near
the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. FLY THE W race off the early pace in the three path, made a wide run down the backstretch, bid three wide around
the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, vied past the sixteenth pole and was second best late. SAND DANCER tracked the pace two wide, took the
lead near the three-eighths pole, was head near the quarter pole, fought back inside to regain command in upper stretch, fought on to deep stretch but was
outfinished. SPIRIT ANIMAL saved ground in range, bid in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE failed to menace
while racing three and four wide. THE BEST DISTANCE set the pace along the rail and gave way near the three-eighths marker. POSSIBLEMENTE played
no factor while racing two wide. TAP GOLD was throwing his side to side when the gates opened, advanced in the four path around the first turn, bid
between foes entering the far turn but faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
SIR LONDON stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes in the lane, steadily gained and was up late. SPY HUNTER set a pressured pace along the rail,
led to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. FREDO pressed the pace two wide, battled on between foes throughout the stretch and just missed in a game
try. JUST A PHOTO saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, leaned in a bit in upper stretch, lacked a clear path through much of
the stretch and was gaining between foes late. READ ON was rank early, raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and finished well. O
CAPTAIN raced off the early pace two wide, checked midway around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. MEYER raced
off the pace two and three wide, swung eight wide in upper stretch and ran on. SPIRIT MAKER saved ground and failed to menace. ROTTERDAM saved
ground in range, steadied when in tight in upper stretch and had no further bids. MUTAAWID played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
MINDFRAME stalked in the four path, ranged up under coaxing approaching the quarter, made a sweeping move to take command in the five path at the
top of the lane, and kicked away. ONE SHARP COOKIE broke out and bumped an outer foe, pressed in the three path, bid around the turn, was no match
for the runaway winner, but chased on for place. VALUED CAJUN rated in the three path, came under a ride in the two path going into the turn, angled out
to the seven path at the top of the lane, and was along for show. ASSERTOR broke in and bumped an inner foe, rushed up to set the pace inside, was
roused into the turn, but faded in the stretch. PONCE DE LEON chased in the three path but flattened from the five path in the stretch. SIX KINGS raced
wellback in the two path and made no impact. GREAT LILO was hustled in midfield along the inside, floated out to the eight path at the top of the stretch,
and weakened on his left lead. TROUBLEMEISTER prompted the early pace in the four path, but fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch while
coming up empty. MANHATTAN BOY raced in midpack from the five path but never threatened. IDONEO got bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced off
the pace in the four path and never menaced. WAYLON got bumped by an outer foe at the start and always trailed.

Footnotes
IL MIRACOLO prompted the pace in the three path, was roused while bidding between foes in the two path midway around the far turn, dug in while dueling
with an outer foe from the three path into the final furlong, and inched ahead in the final strides. TUMBARUMBA laid up close in the four path, vied for the
lead midway down the backstretch, took the lead while under a ride and three wide rounding the far turn, ran on while trying to hold off an inner foe from the
four path down the stretch, but was edged out in the final strides. STEAL SUNSHINE chased in the four path, came under right handed encouragement in
the five path midway around the far turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. LURE HIM IN rated inside, tipped out to the
three path midway around the far turn, but failed to bid. DONEGAL FOREVER tracked out in the five path turning into the backstretch, was coaxed from the
four path early around the far turn, but made no impact from the seven path in the stretch. X Y POINT showed the way in the two path around the first turn,
was headed by an outer foe midway down the backstretch, received a right handed cue along the inside going into the far turn, but lost the lead before the
quarter, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, and faded. MBAGNICK (CHI) stalked in the four path turning into the backstretch but backed up around
the far turn. THE SKIPPER TOO trailed throughout around the six path.

to try to lug in. DESTINY STAR set the pace in the two path and was collared near the sixteenth pole. HELLO HOLLYWOOD raced off the pace two wide,
swung five wide nearing the eighth pole and rallied outside. ZO LEE stalked the pace from the rail, bid at the rail nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished
late. GOLDEN GHOST (GB) prompted the pace two and three wide, kept on through the lane but was outkicked. PHAROAH'S WINE had her head turned
at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. JOYFUL LASS chased the pace four and five wide and lacked the needed rally. MANAGING MISCHIEF
pressed the pace three and four wide and tired in the drive. MADNESS raced off the pace three wide, checked near the three-eighths pole and was not

MCKULICK (GB) settled off the pace while racing two wide, made a three wide bid around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole, edged clear in
midstretch, drifted out under right-handed urging and held safe. SURPRISINGLY saved ground in range, angled three wide turning for home, was in a bit
tight in midstretch, shifted out soon after and was gaining late. LA MEHANA (FR) checked not long after the start, saved ground off the pace, swung five
wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally for the show. ANATOLIAN prompted the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide thereafter, bid
between foes nearing the quarter pole but was outkicked in the lane. VIVA LA RED set the pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. TOWER BRIDGE
steadied early and trailed while racing in the two and three paths. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF LA MEHANA AGAINST THE
RUNNER-UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THE FIRST TIME DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
CAIRO CONSORT settled off the pace while racing two wide around both turns, angled four wide in upper stretch, kicked in, seized command near the
sixteenth pole and powered clear. FAST AS FLIGHT was bumped between foes at the start, pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes near the
sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner but battled bravely to save the place. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) saved ground off the pace, swung six wide in
upper stretch and rallied outside. ANGEL NADESHIKO set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole, kept trying inside of foes and just missed
second and third. MARKETSEGMENTATION bumped at the start, raced in range two and three wide and was one-paced through the stretch. INFINITE
DIAMOND saved ground in range, tipped two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BEECHNUT TROPHY was bumped at the start, raced
three wide and went evenly. CANDY LIGHT saved ground in midpack, hit the rail entering the far turn and had no further bids. TYPEY checked into the first
turn and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' T laid in midpack in the three path, waited while looking for room early around the far turn, was roused while two wide passing the quarter, angled
out to the seven path at top of the lane, and surged between foes in the final sixteenth to get up on the wire. SARATOGA FLASH rated in the two path,
waited rounding the far turn, was coaxed while cutting the corner turning into the stretch, rallied up the rail to lead around the sixteenth, but was nailed at the
wire by an outer foe to place. TIDAL FORCES bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was roused while three wide midway around
the far turn. got carried out to the six path turning into the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught on both sides late to show.
QUALITY G raced off the pace in the five path, was roused in the four path early around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, and
kept on. NEVER SURPRISED laid up close in the three path, bid between foes in the two path rounding the far turn, floated out to the five under coaxing at
the top of the stretch, and dug in, but was outlasted by foes on both sides. CHURCHTOWN bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path,
was cued four wide midway around the far turn, swung out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) stalked in
the two path, was roused from the rail into the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but got stymied passing the eighth pole, and made
no impact. SKYRO was unhurried in the three path, waited along the rail around the far turn, but failed to threaten in the nine path down the lane. BIG
EVEREST (GB) showed the way along the inside down the backstretch, was roused passing the quarter, but faded from the three path in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FIERCENESS broke on top, set the pace in the three path around the first turn, drew clear late on the bend, angled into the two path for the backstretch run,
remained clear while racing just off the rail around the far turn, widened the margin leaving the five-sixteenths pole, quickly extended it under minor urging in
upper stretch and continued drawing off in hand through the final furlong. CATALYTIC hit the starting gate, advanced four wide around the first turn into a
stalking position, tracked the winner down the backstretch, chased in the two path around the far turn, could not keep pace from the five-sixteenths pole but
stayed on well hold clear of the rest. GRAND MO THE FIRST was bumped at the start, saved ground just off the pace for six furlongs, could not keep pace
with the winner late on the turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, dueled outside of CONQUEST WARRIOR through the final furlong for the show and
narrowly prevailed for that placing. CONQUEST WARRIOR saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch, was never a threat to the winner, battled
inside of a foe for third and just missed. HADES was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, dropped back around the far turn, angled five wide
nearing the quarter pole and passed some tiring rivals. FRANKIE'S EMPIRE was off a step slowly, saved ground off the early pace, made a four wide
middle move into contention down the backstretch but could not sustain the bid. IRIS'S DREAM played no factor while racing four wide. REAL MACHO was
bumped at the start, raced four wide in midpack, checked near the three-eighths pole and had no further bids. LE DOM BRO bumped with REAL MACHO at
the start, raced up close two wide between foes and retreated after six furlongs.
