Footnotes
KATIE'S NOTION settled just off the pace, angled out rallying in the stretch and edged away under moderate urging. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE far
behind early, advanced inside and was full of run too late. Z'S SO GOOD vied for the lead outside, led at the quarter pole then weakened late. SKYHOOK
prompted the pace along the rail then flattened out in the stretch. MILAGROSO raced wide under urging and continued willingly while no threat. TATER
AND TOT raced wide off the leaders and lacked a rally. TITANIUM RECKAGE hustled to the front, dueled between rivals then faltered. GAMERUN broke
slowest and was never in contention. CARPE ALL DAY dropped back early and was always outrun. VINDICATO saved ground and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
JEWELS IN THE BAY pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the turn, dueled into the stretch, gained a short lead, edged away and held well late,
driving. PROFESSOR KOOL tracked on the inside, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between rivals and dug in gamely for second. DEPOLI was off slowly,
raced off the pace inside, steadied nearing the turn, then moved up on the turn, exchanged bumps in the stretch run with WARRIOR'S VOW, rallied outside
and got the nod for third. SUNSET TOWN set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and just
missed for third. WARRIOR'S VOW stalked three wide, chased on the turn, rallied between rivals, drifted out and exchanged bumps with DEPOLI, then was
outkicked. COUNTERFEITCURENCY was outrun early and passed tired foes. CARBONITE was off slowly and steadied, then steadied between rivals at
the half mile, chased and tired. BRODIX raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. BROTHER SHOWTYME raced off the pace inside and did not
factor. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
LIAR SIDE CHAT led outside, steadily widened after half a mile, extended his advantage in midstretch and lasted while tiring late. SECRET ALLIANCE
settled just off the pace inside, rallied in the stretch with a steady late gain. THTWASTHENTHISISNW moved close up three wide, faded on the turn then
came again for the show. HOMETOWN HERO stalked three wide, edged closer before the half then weakened. FINALLY CAPTURED prompted the winner
along the rail to the three eighths pole and faltered. IMAGINE THIS dropped far behind then moved very wide into the stretch. WILKINSON WARRIOR
lagged far behind and was never a factor. HE'S ON FIRE chased within range briefly then gave way readily.

through a long stretch drive and prevailed in the final sixteenth. PARTY AT SAM'S vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, continued

Footnotes
KINGSVILLE settled well off the pace, advanced inside, surged through the stretch and was up in time. SPEIGHTSTER RED stalked the pace three wide,
angled in on the final turn, bid clear in midstretch but was nailed nearing the wire. BRINDISI chased along the inside, moved briefly closer in midstretch and
finished willingly. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS dropped back early, was steered inside for the stretch run and closed well. RERALLY had his heels clipped early,
was taken up on the first turn, was taken up and bobbled near the eighth pole but finished well. WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS clipped heels and bobbled early,
raced very wide on the final turn and stretch. DIVINE MIRACLE moved off the pace in the two path and began tiring on the final turn. MEGA CHARLIE set a
pressured pace inside, shook loose before the half then faded in the stretch. ARTISTIC REASON raced off the leaders outside and lacked a rally. SEA
TRIDENT prompted the pace outside to the quarter pole and gave way. CORKMAN trailed wide and was never in contention. SAL N LOUIE raced wide and
weakened steadily losing contact with his field.
