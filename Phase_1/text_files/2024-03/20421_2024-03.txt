Footnotes
SOLOMONS GOLD trailed in the five path, was coaxed to split foes in the four path midway around the turn, ranged up while angling out to the six path
turning into the lane, and inched ahead of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. ALL ABOUT LUCKY got sent to set the pace in the two path, was
coaxed along around the turn, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth to place. FORT ATTITUDE tracked in the
two path, was nudged along the inside around the turn, but was short of room passing the quarter, then fought on from the two path in the stretch for show.
CARSOWN prompted the early pace along the inside, swung out to the five path under a ride turning into the stretch, tipped back into the three path, then
finished evenly, but hung to miss show. ACAMAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, was driven in the four path around turn,
but faded from the six path in the stretch. WARLORD CRUZAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the six path and never
threatened from out in the nine path down the lane. EXALTED CHARM chased from the four path into the turn but never menaced. GOLDEN SKULL was
hustled from up close between foes in the three path, but weakened turning into the stretch.

APPLAUSE set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. SPREZZATURA stalked the pace inside, tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole,
had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but was second best. STARLIT SOFI chased the pace two and three wide and finished evenly to maintain the
show. ARISAEMA saved ground and failed to menace. DIALITHIC prompted the winner in the three path and came up empty in the lane. PRIMA RIVIERA
played no factor while racing two and three wide. FANCY STAX trailed inside.

Footnotes
GLIDING AFLEET stalked in the two path, was roused along the inside early into the far turn, but had to steady midway around the far turn, angled out to
the five path passing the eighth pole, and kicked on past an inner pair in the final sixteenth. MOMZA prompted the pace in the four path, was driven in the
three path around the far turn, bid in the four path turning into the lane, ran on in a duel with the inner pacesetter, was out-finished by the outer eventual
winner, but got up for place late. BACKWOODS BOOGIE showed the way in the three path around the first turn before settling in the two path going into the
backstretch, was roused early into the far turn. tipped out to the three path at the top of the stretch, dug in while dueling with an outer foe, but was overtaken
by a different outer foe around the sixteenth, and got edged out late to show. BURNING MAN rated in the three path, was driven in the five path around the
far turn, but flattened from the seven path in the stretch. SIR TERRE tracked in the four path, ranged up under a ride passing the quarter, floated out to the
six path at the top of the stretch, but faded.

Footnotes
LOUD MOUTH vied inside down the backstretch, settled back at the rail entering the turn, tipped two wide near the five-sixteenths pole, took over in
midstretch and drew off under a drive. MY MAN VITO chased the pace three wide, was no match for the winner but won the battle for the place. PURE
SPEIGHT saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and moved up between foes to gain the show.
RAGTIME BLUES disputed the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, drew clear near the seven-sixteenths pole, set the pace along the rail around the
turn and through midstretch then weakened. RHYMES LIKE DIMES chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. JOE DI BAGGIO failed to
menace while racing two wide. MOST WANTED MAN trailed, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MALIBU SPRINGS tracked in the three path, tipped out to the four path midway down the backside, came under a ride going into the far turn, swung from
the four path to bid entering the stretch, kicked on to lead passing the eighth pole, and safely held off an outer foe. UNIT ECONOMICS (GB) slowly broke
out at the start, then got rank early around the first turn, rated in the three path, was cued into the far turn, angled out to the seven path and bumped an
outer foe in upper stretch, then rallied for place. SWORDOFHONOR (IRE) laid up close in the three path, bid going into the far turn, took the lead under
coaxing midway around the far turn, tipped into the two path entering the lane, but evened out in the final furlong to show. INHERENT PROMISE had a slow
start and trailed in the three path turning into the backstretch, was cued in the five path midway around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path entering the
stretch, but got bumped out to the nine path just after, then stayed on. SENTENZA had an awkward start, stalked in the two path, was cued passing the
quarter, tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened. SCAT TU TAP chased in the five path, was coaxed along around the far turn, floated
out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but got pinballed between foes just after, and did not threaten. NEW YORK STRONG pulled around the first turn
to set the pace along the inside, but gaveway in the stretch.

Footnotes
ACQUIRED TASTE tracked in the two path, was driven into the turn, bid between foes while three wide passing the quarter, took the lead entering the
stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. ALBRIGHT stalked in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, tipped out to the five path
entering the lane, and chased on for place. MY SWEETHEART DANI had a slow start, raced off the pace along the rail, swung out to the four path at the top
of the stretch, and got up for show. MRS. CASH MAN rated in the two path, floated out to the four path midway around the turn, and was one paced in the
seven path down the lane. CABERNET was steadied at the start and trailed in the three path, got put to a drive rounding the turn, and made no impact
around the five path in the stretch. FOR THE THRILL chased in the three path, was cued midway around the turn, but flattened from the five path in the
stretch. GIRVACEOUS set the pace in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, but yielded in the stretch. APEROL SPRITZ pressed the
pace from the rail but gaveway turning into the stretch.
