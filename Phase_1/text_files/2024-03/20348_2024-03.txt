Footnotes
BIG SCULLY was brushed by an outer rival at the start, stalked the top pair from the three path, sustained gradual progress to bid at the furlong grounds,
gained an advantage entering the final sixteenth and held from bidders on either side. RECKLESS RANSOM broke a beat slow, recovered to pursue from
midpack in the two path, split rivals rallying in midstretch, ran on to take aim inside of the leaders and gained place at the wire. SMOOTH COLLIERY laid off
of the pace in the three path, stayed on in the four path and between horses in midstretch, sustained slow progress hanging on his left lead to take aim
outside of the new leader leaving the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay and missed place to an inner bidder. RAP ARTIST prompted outside of the pace
setter through quick fractions, wrestled an advantage at the quarter pole, dug in to resist an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, but was bested at the
sixteenth pole and weakened late. SLITHER chased forwardly under hard urging in the two path, shifted to the three path entering upper stretch, then
chased evenly among foes while hanging on his left lead. BIBLEMAN tracked in the four to five path, chased while getting outkicked for minor placings in
midstretch and lacked a bid. WIN YA WIN lacked speed in the four path and improved between horses in the final furlong. ANDIAMO GIACOMO pursued off
of the pace hung in the six to seven path and failed to menace. SABER RUN broke a step slow then took back from crowded quarters among foes in the
opening stages, raced well back along the inside and made little impact. OUR FREDDIE MAC brushed an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack in
the three path, altered across a rival's heels to the five path entering the turn fanned to the six path while among foes entering the lane and faded. JAKE
THE BAND MAN set a quick pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one entering the lane and faltered. COACH KENNY showed little.

Footnotes
ZING stalked behind the leading pair around the first turn, smoothly split them to offer a bold bid at the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and
held sway. FADED MEMORIES settled off of the pace in the two path, awaited racing room around the far turn before advancing inside of rivals nearing the
lane, tipped to take aim outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, ran on to narrowly claim place at the furlong grounds and held between horse. BAR TAP
settled off of the pace in the three to two path, awaited racing room behind rivals turning for home, tipped to the four path advancing entering upper stretch
and ran on to gain show at the wire. CAVE CREEK pursued from midpack along the inside, split foes two wide in midstretch to bid for place, but was denied
that position and lost show at the wire. MARY JACK vied along the inside, led into the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and
gave way. QUINN MURPHY lacked speed along the inside, took the far turn in the four path before swinging tot he seven path entering the lane, shifted in
and failed to menace. JUST PASSING THRU tracked four wide, got floated five to six wide while losing ground nearing the lane and failed to re-rally.
SKYKAT steadied untroubled after the start and was restrained to trail the field, lagged behind around both turns, then surpassed a tiring pair while outrun.
ANGEL OF VERDUN stalked three wide and between horses, chased getting floated four wide around the far turn and weakened. ATOMIC ROSE vied two
wide, but faltered three wide and between horses at the five sixteenths pole and caved in hand through the lane.

Footnotes
LOVELYREDSTILETTOS set a clear pace, inched further away entering the lane, but came under a drive beginning to tire at the sixteenth pole, and lasted
between bidders to the wire. CANADA'S CUSTOMS stalked along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around the turn, chased while drifting
about passing the three sixteenths pole, straightened course and closed in on the tiring leader along with an inner rival, but was too late to reel in the leader
and dead-heated for place. CAJUN NINJA pursued from midpack two wide before moving in around the turn, then offered a charge along with an outer rival
in the final furlong, closed in on the tiring leader late, but ran out of ground and dead-heated for place. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN tucked to the inside while off of
the pace into the turn, then advanced inside of rivals to gain fourth nearing midstretch. MICHELLES LIL STAR trailed along the inside, then moved up
between horses in the late stages. MISS PRIORITY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted in encountering mild traffic at the three sixteenths pole and
lacked a bid. SUMITUP raced forwardly two wide and between horses into the turn, chased getting floated to the three to four path around the turn, and
faded through the lane. WON DAY bumped an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the six path and made little impact. LAKE MARIE was bumped by an
outer rival at the start, chased from midpack in the five path and tired. DROP DEAD SEXY chased forwardly in the four path into the turn, but weakened
between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
NILES CHANNEL stalked along the inside, smoothly floated outer rivals to take aim outside of the leader entering the lane, bid and gained an advantage at
the three sixteenths pole, dug in as an outer bidder menaced in midstretch and repelled that foe late. SUPER WISE settled in the two path, swung six wide
entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the new leader at the furlong grounds but was turned away. OPTIMUS KAT pursued from midpack two wide, took
aim four wide and between horses in upper stretch, sustained a chase of the top pair in the final furlong to edge show at the sixteenth pole. MAU MAU broke
slowly, trailed in the two to four path around the first turn, moved out of last before picking up stride in the three path around the far turn, encountered mild
traffic in midstretch, checked to alter course outwardly at the sixteenth pole and sustained progress to move up between horses late. GROUP EIGHTEEN
showed the way along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole and gave way. PALACE KITTEN stalked outside of the leader,
applied mild pressure around the far turn, but got outmoved by an inner rival while floated three wide entering the lane, and yielded between horses.
FREEDOM FACTOR tracked three wide, stalked around the far turn, drifted to the five path while within striking range entering the lane, but was outkicked
by an outer bidder in upper stretch and faded. SEVEN CHANNELS brushed an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two to three wide, shifted to the
six path nearing midstretch and failed to menace. TWOKO BAY settled off of the pace along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses around the
far turn, shifted out before being floated to the eight path nearing midstretch and failed to factor. SILENT POWER was brushed by an inner foe at the start
and allowed to settle well back in the two path, saved ground around the far turn and made little impact. HALEYS SAILOR was hustled out of the gates, but
only achieved a midpack position, saved ground and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
YES INDEED pressed outside of the pace setter, bid entering the lane and drove clear in midstretch. GOURMET showed the way from an outer presser
around both turns, got headed by that bidder in upper stretch, yielded through the final furlong yet lasted for place. MONTCLAIR ROAD laid off of the pace
along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around the turn, ran on with a rail chase in the final furlong and edged show at the sixteenth pole.
LOOKING FOR GINNY saved ground at the rear of the field and stayed on willingly with a good gallop out. MISCHIEVOUSNESS tracked in the three path
and between horses into the first turn, shifted to the four path at the half mile pole, inched closer outside of the leader around the far turn, but floated to the
fve path in upper stretch and flattened out. BEELIEVE HER tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, chased tipping to the
there path in upper stretch, but yielded through the final furlong. CHURNING BERNI broke a step slow and was put to tight quarters by an inner rival at the
start, raced at the rear in the three to five path around the first turn, moved out last down the backstretch, but tired under urging around the far turn.
STYLISH SUE stalked four to three wide but weakened between horses leaving the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
MI SOLUTION stalked in the two path, swept past the pace setter turning for home, drew off entering the lane and held sway. IZZY'S BABY BOY tracked
from the three to two paths, chased the clearing leader while gaining place at the three sixteenths pole, then lasted from an outer challenger for that position
late. DEER CROSSING pursued from midpack in the three to two path, tipped to the four path entering the lane and ran on to miss reeling in a tiring rival for
place. PERRINS lacked speed along the inside, encountered traffic in upper stretch, altered course outwardly leaving the three sixteenths pole and stayed
on. CAJUN EDDIE laid off of the pace in the two to three path and failed to menace. GUITAR DOCTOR set a clear pace, but offered little resistance to the
eventual winner's challenge turning for home and weakened. MR. TIN MAN altered to the three path whlie off of the pace into the first turn, settled and
maneuvered back to the inside around that bend, then saved ground to no avail. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF raced at the rear two wide, got floated to the four
path around the far turn and never got involved. REAL CITY SPEED tossed his head at the start, pulled tucking behind foes at the rear early on, tipped to
the three path around the far turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS tracked four to three wide, ranged up to bid outside of the embattled leading pair entering the lane, drove past them while hanging on his
left lead in upper stretch, then kicked clear while changing over at the furlong grounds. KAVOD pressed three to two wide into the turn, vied turning for
home, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and kept on well to be second best. EYEING CLOVER prompted along the inside, steadied
while backing off to stalk into the turn, pursued before tipping outside of the leading trio in upper stretch and ran on willingly. MARSALIS showed the way
outside of a prompting foe early on, cleared and crossed over to the inside as an outer foe applied pressure into the turn, vied with that one turning for
home, but got headed by a wider bidder in upper stretch and gave way. PRO OXIDANT chased from midpack in the two path, checked behind a troubled
foe into the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. BOSS' DIALIN IN broke slowly, lacked speed in the three to five paths and failed
to factor. WILLTORUN saved ground off of the pace and failed to factor. TODO FINO (CHI) trailed in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane
and made little impact. CAMPFIRE CREED brushed the inner part of the gate upon leaving it, raced off of the pace in the three path, but checked back into
the turn and was outrun thereafter.
