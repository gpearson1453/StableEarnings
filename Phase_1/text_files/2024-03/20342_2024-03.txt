Footnotes
MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) was allowed to settle two wide, shifted out and came five wide into the lane, made a bid to be up in time under a drive.
MOBEER set a pressured pace on the inside and turned back a bid by the quarter pole and shook clear leaving the turn but was caught late to just miss in a
good effort. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN tracked the early pace from between rivals, then was towards the inside on the turn and made a two wide bid off the
turn but flattened out, held show award. GABE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but faded in the drive. PICTOR
tracked the pace from the outside and was four to three wide on the turn but weakened in the drive. SUNRISE JOURNEY chased the pace on the inside
and weakened.

Footnotes
ELEVENMONTHSLATER was well placed early shifting off the inside entering the first turn, tracked the pace three wide and made a bid between rivals on
the turn, then was clear off the turn and widened the margin to prove much the best under a drive. INCONTROVERTIBLE stalked the early pace four wide,
made a three wide bid on the far turn but could not go with the winner while staying on for the place award. MAKE A SPLASH had a four wide pursuit early,
then was three wide on the far turn, angled out to the outside leaving the three sixteenths and had a later ally to grab the show award. KENTUCKY REIGN
was away alertly to set the pace, headed by the five sixteenths and weakened, lost show award late. MOON POOL chased the pace two wide, then
advanced on the inside on the far turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn but had no late kick. TRECHMO GIRL was taken back early to be far back and
never threatened. WIN FOR LAILA was off a step slow, then reserved two wide and had no rally. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS broke in the air at the start, then
made an early inside move to chase the pace but tired.

Footnotes
JACKIE B GOOD pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to set a pressured pace on the turn inside of two rivals, then dug in
gamely in the stretch and edged away late to prove best under a drive. DOWSER stalked the early pace and made a bid between rivals to vie for command,
but was out-kicked in the final furlong while winning the place award battle. BULLET ON TAP was off a half a step slow, made a four wide move on the turn
to vie for command on the outside but hung late. BALI MOON chased the early pace and was five wide by the quarter pole, came six wide off the turn and
had a mild late rally. LIL H chased the pace in between rivals and had no rally. WE'LL SEE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.
SCOREBOARD LILY was settled early, two wide on the turn and was not a threat. MASKED HEROINE was bumped at the start, then showed brief speed
on the inside and stopped.

HE IS BAD was well rated along the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and made a bid to draw away to prove much the best under mild urging.
GIUSEPPE set the pace on the inside, then was in the two path off the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on gamely for the place
award. SEA TO AIR was well placed early on the inside, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but could not sustain that bid while just missing the place
award. LOCO was settled early three wide, then shifted to the inside on the turn and had a late kick on the inside to just miss the place award. MONEY
MAKING KAZ was reserved early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. MILLBANK MAN was reserved early and raced on the outside and passed the
the tiring rivals. BORN HAPPY was reserved early and failed to menace. RAGING BEAR pressed the pace four wide and then was empty the final two
furlongs. BODE O was settled back early, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CAUSALISTIC was reserved two to three wide early, then advanced three to four wide on the far turn, then came five wide into the lane, then was given a
few pops left handed with the crop nearing the furlong marker and responded well to draw away late to prove best. REBEL RULER was three wide into the
first turn, then went on and crossed over to the inside to set the pace, remained clear by the furlong marker and dug in but could not go with the winner while
saving the place award gamely. ADY'S MUNNY stalked the pace and made a three wide bid but hung in the lane, missed place award. SAMURAI SAINT
was reserved early on the outside, made a four to five wide advance on the turn, came six wide off the turn and had a mild late rally. SOUPER CATCH
tracked the early pace four wide, then chased the pace on the far turn three to two wide, then had no kick in the lane. NOBLE CONQUEST was settled
along the inside, then was two wide to the inside on the far turn and finished willingly but needed more. SIR SAHIB was off a step slow, then settled three
wide, made a three to four wide move nearing the quarter pole, then came four wide off the turn but flattened out late. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved on
the inside, eased out nearing the five sixteenths and swung out wide leaving the turn but had no late kick. A T M AWESOME chased the pace from between
rivals, steadied nearing the six furlong marker and then tired on the far turn. JUPI'S LIGHTNING chased the pace on the inside and stopped.
