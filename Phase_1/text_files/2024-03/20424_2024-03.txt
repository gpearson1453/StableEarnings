Footnotes
ROCK ON KITTEN unhurried in the early going to trail, made a five wide early bid circling the field on the turn to engage the leader in upper stretch, took
command nearing the eighth pole and held the closers safe. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO tracked the leaders to the turn, commenced a steady rally splitting
horses on the turn to be prominent turning for home, angled out for the drive and ground out the placing. LAUDA SPEED set a pressured pace to the turn,
dropped back on the bend while racing along the rail and re-rallied through the lane. CRIMSON ROCKET pressed the pace to the three-eighths pole, took
the lead on the turn to upper stretch and gradually gave way down the lane. HARD N'SWEET chased the leader to midway on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S SON pressed the pace through the turn, waited under patient handling to rally in upper stretch, quickly cleared and held to the wire
convincingly. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK tracked the leaders from striking position to the head of the lane and made a steady advance down the lane to be
second best. SAG HARBOR reserved off the pace at the rear of the field and showed good late interest with a belated stretch run. BROADWAY JONES
rated off the leaders in contention, angled in to make a mild bid in upper stretch and failed to gain ground. FLY HOME rushed up five wide on the turn
mounting an early bid to take the lead at the quarter pole and flattened out in upper stretch. HOLY SAINT flashed brief speed to set a pressured pace and
came up empty turning for home.

DELOVELY stalked the leaders to midway on the turn, made a three wide bid to quickly take command, drew clear in upper stretch and continued to pull
away as much best. FAITHFUL STEPS tracked the leaders in the turn, was put to an early drive and kept-on grinding down the lane to be second best.
FEW REGRETS slow early to be the distant trailer and rallied mildly through the stretch to be along for the show. DAISY JONES pressed the pace to the
quarter pole and weakened down the stretch. QADIRA flashed speed up the fence to take the lead and came up empty turning for home.

OUTSPOKEN well rated tracking the early pace to the turn, rallied five wide to take control at the head of the lane and steadily pulled away as clearly the
best. CATCHAFALLNSTAR slow early to be the trailer, found his best stride in the lane and closed well to be gaining and garner the place. FOUR
BLESSINGS pressed the pace to midway on the bend, took the lead to the top of the stretch and was outkicked down the lane. NOT TODAY chased the
leaders through the turn and failed to mount a closing rally. MY SUZIE Q set a pressured pace to the five-sixteenths pole and weakened.

DARK BARON set a well rated pace under restraint, repelled the runner-up's bid turning for home and finished willingly holding that one safe through the
lane. THAT'S THE WAY stalked the paceto the far turn, rallied to loom turning for home, failed to pass the winner and kept-on to be second best. AULD
LANGE SYNE reser ed off the pace down the backside, rallied between horses on the bend and failed to sustain the bid. VAIL OF HONOR failed to
menace. SEEING RED prompted the early pace, saved ground along the rail and flattened out on the far turn.

STAR ENTERTAINER unhurried in the early going to be well off the pace, angled six wide at the head of the lane and closed with a rush to be up in time.
JOKEMEISTER sped off to a wide advantage in rapid fractions and could not hold on, tiring late in the lane. RED GUN tracked the leaders to the top of the
lane and rallied mildly down the stretch to be along for the show. C J ALL THE WAY stalked the pace through the turn and failed to mount a closing rally.
AQUITANIA ARRIVAL chased the pace and faded. TOUCH CODE squeezed at the start to drop back to the rear of the field and trailed as a non-factor
throughout.

AZ WE SPEAK broke a step slow to trail, was unhurried down the backstretch, made a steady advance circling six wide at the quarter pole, closed well to
take command inside the sixteenth pole from her stablemate and was in hand at the wire. WORK'N ON A BUZZ tracked the leaders to midway on the turn,
rallied up the fence sneaking through on the rail to take a clear lead in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner. OLYMPIC
WINGS well placed stalking the leaders into the turn, made a three wide bid to be prominent turning for home and was out-finished in the lane. SHE'S A
SOLDIER prompted the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. ANGIE'S DEAR ONE was not a threat. OPIE'S GIRL sped to the lead for a half
and gave way turning for home.
