break, quickly advanced four wide into the far turn the faded. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD saved ground the first turn, raced in the two path the far turn and
failed to rally. TUBTIMSIAM , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was no factor and swung to the four path entering the stretch. DR JACK
FLYER sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN , angled in early, raced along the inner rail on both

Footnotes
LUV YA BYE BYE prompted the pace three wide outside THE CAIRO KID, battled three deep past the five sixteenths, saw MR. MOX get away a bit near
the three sixteenths, came back on under left handed asks, took command a sixteenth out then edged clear in the final yards. MR. MOX broke a step slow,
regrouped and was sent up between rivals to gain a tracking spot, bid between foes mid turn, took over into the lane, shifted in and spurted clear, dug in
when confronted leaving the furlong grounds, dueled then gave way grudgingly. RAHMER , four wide outside rivals giving hard chase, had aim of the
embattled trio past the five sixteenths, stayed in range under pressure in upper stretch and came back a bit through the final furlong. NICK'S LITTLE BOY
dropped back under a ride early on, came off the inside around the turn, raced four wide into the stretch, switched over to his left lead when angled wider
near the sixteenth pole then churned on. CLAW steadied back off a rival in the opening furlong, settled in clear the mid turn, saved ground into the stretch
but came up empty. THE CAIRO KID sped to the front, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure from the winner leaving the turn, battled inside a pair
of foes mid turn, failed to go on nearing the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
NO WALK INTHE PARK prompted the early pace outside PRETTY COAST, overtook that one approaching the three eighths pole, opened up turning for
home and held sway under steady handling. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL chased the winner, stayed in the two path on the turn and gamely closed the gap late.
FLAG SONG FLYIN , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, dropped back some on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and had a
slight rally. CARSONS COOL WOMEN lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and passed tired rivals. ANY FOOLS GOLD broke awkwardly,
advanced three wide mid way on the turn, swung wide approaching the stretch and weakened. BUCKIN' LUCKY , pinched back at the start, saved ground
on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was outrun. PRETTY COAST bore out leaving the starting gate, made the early lead, hugged the inner rail
and faltered leaving the turn.

Footnotes
SWIFTY DEVIL rated kindly tracking the leaders from the outside, responded when given his cue and bid three deep mid turn, took over four wide into the
stretch, kicked clear under a solid drive in mid stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch but held firm while kept alert. ALWAYS GAMBLING , urged along
while off the pace, raced three deep leaving the far turn, commenced a run soon after, circled four wide with progress into the lane, advanced outside foes in
mid stretch and kept on gamely to be second best. JESTER'S SONG broke a bit awkwardly, recovered and was nudged up to prompt the pace outside
VAGABOND SHOES, applied more pressure leaving the far turn, dueled between foes from the five sixteenths to upper stretch then faded in the final
sixteenth. VAGABOND SHOES popped the gate open pre race, sped to the front and set a rated early pace, handled outside pressure leaving the far turn,
battled inside a pair of foes from mid turn to the head of the lane, stayed on with effort past mid stretch then weakened in the final seventy yards. VON
HOFF popped the gate open pre race, broke a step slow, raced between runners leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE saved
ground with some early pursuit then faded around the turn.

Footnotes
DERBYNESS bumped with CAP COM leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide, took command in upper
stretch then steadily drew away while kept to his business. RAKIA saved ground on the turn while stalking the pace, eased out to the three path turning for
home, moved to the five path in mid stretch and rallied. BUCKIN' DREAMER chased the pace, advanced in the two path on the turn, gained a short lead
entering the stretch and gradually weakened. IN THE DANCE trailed to the turn, circled foes four wide around the turn, eased out to the six path in upper
stretch and rallied outside foes. CAP COM bumped with the winner at the start, worked between horses in the stretch and lacked a rally. JOE THE JET , two
wide on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and came up empty. RUBYS FLASH sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and gave way
after six furlongs. EL DE LARRY stayed along the inner rail around the turn and faltered.

HATEFUL , three wide between rivals nearing the turn, edged up off the rail past the five sixteenths, swung out six wide into the lane, leveled off under right
handed encouragement nearing mid stretch, surged outside K KAKE POP to take over in deep stretch then drew out at the wire. K KAKE POP dueled
outside a rival into the turn, shook clear leaving the three eighths, opened up under a stout drive inside the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but just could
not contain the winner's charge. DUELA DENT , fractious behind the gate, rated off the early pace while about four wide, ranged up leaving the far turn,
chased three deep past the five sixteenths, failed to seriously kick on from the head of the lane but had enough left to save the show. LEGEND OF LIGHT ,
away alertly, rated back off the dueling leaders, edged up three wide and between runners mid turn, pursued to the inside of DUELA DENT in upper stretch
but lacked the needed finish. HARMONIZING vied inside K KAKE POP into the turn, could not quite go with that one leaving the three eighths, chased
inside runners past the sixteenths, was taken firmly in hand for a stride or two in upper stretch then faded. NAY SLAYER flashed speed, stayed in touch
pursuing towards the inside to the quarter pole then weakened. BANKERS ROSE GOLD broke outward, corrected and edged up behind foes, steadied
leaving the far turn, dropped in towards the rail and came up empty. TIA MAYIN , off a bit slow, raced three wide mid turn, angled wider for the drive but
failed to rally. SHARED AUTHORITY broke slowly, angled in and moved up some past the half, checked sharply soon after, dropped back then angled wide
for the drive.

mid stretch and readily drew out. CHARGE TO VICTORY , prompted the pace three deep, gained a brief lead leaving the turn, weakened through the
stretch and held the place. SUPREME LAW , rated along the inner rail while stalking the pace around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, had
clear sailing and failed to rally. B B BAD lacked speed, circled the turn four deep, was fanned to the six path in upper stretch and came up empty. BY ITS
ABSENCE disputed the pace between horses to the stretch and weakened. SUMO , briefly steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, dropped back. ICING

Footnotes
BRADY BEAR , under a snug hold four deep with the early pace, pulled his way clear then dropped in a couple paths near the five eighths, set a rated pace
around the turn, responded when set down two wide in upper stretch, kept on under a stiff drive past mid stretch, drifted out late and held sway.
MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE carried out a bit at the break, vied between runners through the opening quarter mile, eased back a bit then ramped up a run
three wide past three eighths, moved up within striking distance in mid stretch, attempted to lay in on his left lead despite efforts with the left crop, shifted out
some late and kept on gamely. UNDER THE OVERPASS broke outward, corrected and disputed the early pace inside a trio of foes, dropped back under
urging leaving the far turn, came off the inside around the turn, angled five wide for the drive and churned on to gain the show. IMAGINIZED , four wide
advancing past the five eighths, chased the winner around the turn, shifted in for the drive and gave way. THIRTY WEST vied three wide between foes early
on, stayed on to chase as the winner cleared, failed to kick on past the three eighths and weakened. BETTER WATCH IT , off the pace, raced five to six
wide into the stretch but failed to generate a rally. DIVINE CHILD , between rivals leaving the far turn, was not a factor. CONNECTAMUNDO stumbled at
the break, was used five wide outside rivals to reach a stalking spot, failed to go on around the turn and faltered.
