Footnotes
FORTY NINER GOLD hopped and bumped inner rival at the start, rushed up to take control and moved inside, dueled with outer rival through the turn,
shook free in upper stretch and remained strong under urging to the wire. ANTIBES sat off the pace up the backstretch, gained along the inside on the turn,
finished willingly on the fence in the lane and edged GHOSTLY ACT for second. GHOSTLY ACT chased three wide into the turn, moved into the two path
around the bend, steered back out a bit in upper stretch and got outkicked for second. DEFENSOR FORTIS chased outside a rival while a bit rank early on,
navigated the turn two wide and failed to threaten in the final furlong. GETEMDUSTY trailed early and steered to the inside, saved ground through the turn
and could not make an impact. BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK got bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed from inside then switch to the outside of the leader
up the backstretch, dueled from outside around the bend, could not kick on with the winner approaching the final furlong and weakened in the late stages.

UNKEPT SECRET settled off the pace, on the move from the rail through the turn, slipped through on the fence at the top of the stretch, quickly cleared and
drew away in the final furlong. GLORY OF CHROME trailed two wide into and around the bend, angled out in upper stretch, rallied widest in the drive and
bested the rest. SWEET MILLIE set the pace inside a pair of rivals to the turn, cleared early on the bend and led two wide to the lane, yielded in upper
stretch and churned on to save the show. GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA pressed the pace three deep early, chased after the leader in the three path outside a
rival around the bend, re-bid at the three-sixteenths pole but flattened in the final furlong. YO YO MAMA bobbled in the beginning, went up to press the pace
between rivals, chased the pacesetter two wide on the turn, angled inward in upper stretch and weakened.

STAY HOT took hold briefly to move outside chasing ISLAND CRUISER early, applied pressure around the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, took over
in upper stretch, dueled outside GUY NAMED JOE in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. GUY NAMED JOE got put in a bit tight briefly between rivals
then stalked in-hand early along the rail, saved ground through the far turn, launched a rail bid in upper stretch, dueled inside STAY HOT and could not get
by. LORD BULLINGDON was rank early chasing off the rail then three to two wide around the clubhouse turn, inched closer from outside in the middle
stages, rounded the far turn three then four wide, challenged four deep in upper stretch but got outkicked by the top pair in the late stages. ISLAND
CRUISER away quickly to take control and moved inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, challenged by STAY HOT around the bend and maintained a
short lead while coming off the rail a bit entering the lane, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch.

Footnotes
SHOW CARD antsy in the gate, stalked the pace off the inside, loomed three wide at the quarter pole, fought three deep into the stretch, cleared inner pair
outside the eighth pole, asked left handed a few times in the final furlong and drew away. MS BO J showed early speed then chased DISPOSITION from
outside, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole then fought between rivals into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but stayed on
to secure second. DISPOSITION showed good early speed inside MS BO J then cleared that rival to take full control, challenged by a pair of rivals with a
quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch, weakened in the furlong grounds but managed to save third. VEGAS CONDO chased from off the
pace four wide early, moved into the two path approaching the turn, found the rail around the bend, angled out in the lane and missed third. SWEET GEM
trailed off the inside, rounded the bend in the three path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHAMROCKIN trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail into the turn, shifted out to the two path around the bend, angled out approaching the stretch,
rallied under left handed urging and flew late to overhaul the runner-up in the final twenty yards. CLUBHOUSE BRIDE sped to the front and moved inside,
pressured by a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, shook free past the three-eighths pole, led clear under a drive to the sixteenth pole but got run down in
the closing moments. CAN'T SLEEP stalked outside rivals in-hand early, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three to four wide around the
turn, finished willingly down the stretch and earned the show honors. QUICK KATE chased along the rail then tipped two wide past the quarter pole, kept on
through the lane and rounded out the superfecta. RECALCITRANT chased between rivals then got shuffled back early, coaxed along from the rail around
the bend, lacked room in upper stretch, found a clear path midstretch and improved position. DORIE MILLER sat off the pace, went four wide into the turn,
shifted into the three path then moved back out leaving the bend and weakened. PANDA PEAK raced up close on the inside, saved ground to the stretch
and weakened. THE SHUSHALA stalked off the inside, bid outside the leader at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep up past the three furlong marker,
spun two wide into the lane and faded. CROWN OF HOPE bobbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail then between foes leaving the backstretch, took the
turn two to three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
MATANZAS CREEK vied for the lead three deep up the backstretch and around the turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, shook free leaving the bend,
edged away under urging and was kept to task to the wire, sustained an injury following the race and was vanned off. FIFTH STREET vied between rivals
for command into and around the bend, could not keep up with the winner and chased two wide into the lane, moved out then came back in a bit in the
furlong grounds and held the place. HAVILDAR chased two wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide, tipped out into the stretch and finished willingly to
whittle the gap late. HEY BROTHER stalked the top trio from off the rail, navigated the turn three then four wide, got floated out a bit entering the lane, kept
on from outside and earned a minor award. POP D'ORO fought for the lead inside a pair of rivals to the quarter pole, chased the winner leaving the turn and
weakened down the lane. I DON'T GET IT broke a step slow, trailed off the rail then moved to the inside for the turn, shifted to the two path around the bend
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SKETCHY bumped with outer rival at the start, stalked in the two path, pushed around the far turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, drew alongside the
leader approaching the eighth pole, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining, drifted out to impede AMERICAN GLORY (GB) late and held gamely.
NITTI (IRE) broke a step slow, raced towards the rear on the inside in the early going, continued on the fence into the far turn, moved to the two path
midway around the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed fast but ran out of time. INDISPENSABLE stumbled badly in the beginning and moved
to the inside trailing early, eased off the rail still at the back on the far turn, angled widest entering the stretch, finished gamely from outside and gained the
show honors. AMERICAN GLORY (GB) traveled in the two path off the pace, spun three wide into the stretch, tipped out lane, rallied in the furlong grounds
but got impeded by the winner and had to take up late. BARTHOLDY set the pace under pressure from outer rival, maintained a short advantage through
the far turn, put that rival away in upper stretch but was confronted by SKETCHY shortly after, resisted to midstretch, then lost command at the sixteenth
pole and faltered late. LET SEAMUS GO bobbled leaving the gate, took a stalking position along the fence, continued on the rail around the second bend,
came off the rail a bit at the top of the lane then moved back inside and lacked the needed late kick. CHASING RAIN settled inside out of range, stayed on
the fence to the stretch, moved out in the lane and failed to rally. SHOT OF COURAGE got bumped from inside at the start, prompted the pace two wide,
kept the heat on the leader through the far turn, could not keep up in upper stretch and faded to last. THE TRAINER OF AMERICAN GLROY (GB) LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST SKETCHY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING
THE SAME INCIDENT. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH SKETCHY DID DRIFT OUT AND BOTHER AMERICAN GLORY
(GB) LATE, THE INCIDENT DID NOT AFFECT THE FINAL PLACINGS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON set the pace off the rail with ELWOOD BLUES applying pressure from outside, cleared that rival while in the three path with three
furlongs remaining, showed the way four wide into the stretch, coaxed along approaching the eighth pole, asked once left handed in the final sixteenth and
held safely over the runner-up. GHOST OF MIDNIGHT chased the top pair two wide into the turn, continued off the rail into the stretch, was closest in
pursuit with a furlong left to run, finished willingly in deep stretch but had to settle for second best. ELWOOD BLUES pressed the winner from outside, could
not keep pace and chased four wide around the turn, weakened in the furlong grounds but churned on to hold the show. MCLAREN VALE raced at the back
inside SUPER CHIEF while off the rail, exited the backstretch two wide, moved to the inside around the bend then chased two wide into the lane, lacked the
needed rally in the stretch run but kept on for a minor award. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) raced in range pacesetter well off the rail early, navigated the turn five
wide and weakened down the lane. SUPER CHIEF traveled outside a rival at the back in the early going, took the turn three to four wide and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
LAHAINA FLAVOR entered the first turn between runners at the rear, moved to the rail around the bend, gained on the fence through the far turn, steered
out into the stretch and commenced a bid, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole, took over at the sixteenth pole and proved best while drifting in late.
CARIBBEAN KING stalked in the two path and shifted in a bit to bother a rival on the clubhouse turn, continued two wide into the far turn, took aim three
wide entering the lane, took over in upper stretch, drifted out past the eighth pole while battling with LAHAINA FLAVOR, relinquished the lead to that rival at
the sixteenth pole, got floated in late and stayed on for a game second. SMOOTH SALUTE reserved in the two path, angled out and went between runners
on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, rallied and edged GOLD COUNCIL for the show honors. GOLD COUNCIL applied pressure from outside in
the early going, dueled around the far turn, fought between rivals to the eighth pole, then faltered in the late stages. MY RANSOM tracked two wide early,
moved inside in the middle stages, moved back to the two path on the far turn, tipped out into the drive and could not produce a bid. PRECISION STRIKE
traveled three deep at the back into the first turn then moved into the two path, continued off the rail to the second bend, moved into the two path then
steered out four wide late on the bend, cut in a bit entering the lane and failed to menace. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS stalked along the rail and got put in tight
on the first turn, continued in a good spot to the second bend, waited for room to the stretch from the fence, came off the rail but could not find room chasing
behind GOLD COUNCIL and could not rally once in the clear. TELOS had good early speed from inside to take the front, dueled around the far turn and into
the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ST IGNACIO dropped back early on the inside, remained off the pace two wide
leaving the backstretch, angled seven wide late on the turn and into the stretch and failed to be a factor. ARROGATES SPIRIT tracked three deep early, two
wide into the far turn, steered out and spun six wide into the lane, then faded in the stretch.
