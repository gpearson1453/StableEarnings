Footnotes
DREAM RIVER was reluctant to load, raced with the early pace then took the nod two deep passing the nine sixteenths pole and showed the way from that
point, came under pressure past the three eighths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in under determined handling through the stretch and
just lasted. HIALEAH NATIVE settled in the three path the first turn, started his bid past the half mile pole and rounded the far turn in the five path, dug in
widest leaving the turn and just missed the win while taking second under the wire. EMPTY MY POUCH rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up
the chase into the backstretch and raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and took third the final strides while outfinished in the duel
for second. HERE COMES RUSTY stalked off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but was
outfinished in the duel through the stretch. MON GATEAU raced with the early pace inside, was met leaving the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase toward
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. RUSH TO CANDY stumbled inward and made sharp contact with
Watch the Tramcar leaving the gate then saved ground well off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn and showed little more. ROYALLY FLUSHED rounded the first turn in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. SMOKIN
SMITTY raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. WATCH THE TRAMCAR was
bumped off stride leaving the gate and never factored.
