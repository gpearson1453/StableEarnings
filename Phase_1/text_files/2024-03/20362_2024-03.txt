MASTERPIECE DAY was sent to a clear early lead, met bid near the three sixteenths pole and kept on gamely to the wire. SCREENPLAY tracked the early
leader from the inside and needed more in the drive. EL CENTENARIO dropped to race mid pack early, had an inside run and never threatened. TIGER
THE MAN raced three to four wide and had no response. COWORKER chased three deep from the outside and weakened. ACE GILFORD settled off the
early going, was five deep around the far turn and never was a factor. PICKLES N ME saved ground and lacked a bid. GONE PREACHIN showed little.

WINZE pressed the early foe from the outside, took command down the backstretch and held gamely under strong handling. LITTLE MORE LOVE was
allowed to settle early, moved up three to five wide in the lane and rallied for the place position. OUR HALLIE stalked the pace, made a three wide bid and
flattened out. FARRAH FOWLER dropped back to race mid pack, saved ground around the far turn into the stretch and closed in mildly. I GUESS NOT
settled off the early going, raced along the inside into the stretch, altered out near the sixteenth pole and never threatened. CHARACTER COUNTS pressed
the pace from the inside and faded. EASY ACT was off slowly and never was a factor. SPOILED BRAT was sent along between, pulled up down the
backstretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
G VICTORY pressed two deep and finished well to draw clear under strong handling. BRUIN MAGIC pressed the early pace three deep from the outside
and finished second best. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE stalked the pace, raced two to three deep and kept on to the wire. BRICKBAT was allowed to settle
early, raced three deep and moved up to improve position. WEBCAM raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE
raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. GETCHA saved ground and never threatened. NATE'S REVENGE dropped back early and
failed to respond. U S NAVY CROSS was void of early speed and never was a factor. UNLEASH THE BEAST vied for the early lead near the rail and
stopped.
