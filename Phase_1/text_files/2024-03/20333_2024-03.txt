SAL N LOUIE tracked close up on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, ran by the leader and edged away, driving. KENNER set
the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, dug in along the rail in the stretch, was no match for the winner, then held for second.
HOMETOWN HERO chased close up between rivals, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. GOLDEN WILDCAT
chased close up three wide, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and tired. LONG LEGGED BOY raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the
turn and failed to threaten. MUSK was outrun early and did not factor.
