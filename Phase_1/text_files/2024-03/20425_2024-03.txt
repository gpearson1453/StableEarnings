with the winner and dug in gamely inside to the finish. BIG BROWN SHOES vied two wide for command, dueled on the turn, weakened in the stretch and
held on for third. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE raced two wide off the pace and closed belatedly inside. THE ANGRY MAN was off a bit slow, outrun early and
passed tired rivals. R GOODTIME CHARLIE stalked outside, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and faded. ALMOND CIDER vied inside for
the lead, dueled on the turn and gave way.

FICTIONALFAIRYTALE stalked the dueling leaders, made a three wide bid on the far turn, dueled with NORTH POLE into the stretch, battled it out with that
rival in the lane and edged away in the final sixteenth, driving. NORTH POLE raced four wide early, then dueled two wide for command, dueled on the far
turn, then dug in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch drive and continued willingly to the finish. IMPETUD raced two wide off the pace, chased on the
far turn, commenced a late rally inside and was gaining at the end. CENTURION raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into
the and gained mildly outside. SMOOTH MOTION cleared the field entering the clubhouse turn, then dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and
weakened in the stretch. MILANO raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. RETWEET raced three wide off the pace, came
four wide into the lane and faded. ACHILLES HEEL was outrun.

Footnotes
LIBERTY STAR lacked speed, split rivals rallying on the turn then quickly drew away through the stretch. OMERTA CODE trailed far behind, moved very
wide in the stretch and closed well to gain place. SUMMER ASH dropped back early then offered late energy to gain the show. CADDY MAN moved close
up early, chased very wide and continued willingly. EDDIEMUSH hustled close up in the opening quarter outside then lacked a rally. MODERN MIDAS
lacked speed, chased wide and was no factor. SMARTHUMOR prompted the pace briefly in the two path then faltered. SAILOR'S RETURN broke slowly,
rushed up inside, steadied briefly behind loose horse, widened, on the turn then tired in the stretch. REX KWON DO was taken up when bothered by loose
horse in the initial quarter, moved inside and faded. ALTA FOX rider appeared to lose his balance when horse ducked out and fell off his mount in the early
stages.

ELOQUIST stalked between rivals, chased inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, closed steadily in the lane, put a head in front in
deep stretch and prevailed. CONCEALED CARRY set the pace on the inside, was pressed on the backside, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely in the
stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. SIMOVITCH tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied mildly outside
for third. RICH'S WAY was outrun early and closed belatedly inside. DEE JAY stalked two wide early on, then pressed the pace on the backside, chased,
rallied three wide into the stretch and weakened. NEW COMMISSION raced off the pace, was asked on the far turn and lacked a response. LITTLE
DEMON chased close up three wide, chased on the far turn and gave way.

FLASHNDYNAMITE close up outside early, went after the winner on the turn, wore down that rival and edged clear in the final furlong. POWWA OF LOVE
set clear pace in hand, widened on the turn then weakened in the stretch. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY saved ground off the leaders and offered some late
energy. SCOTT ALAIA prompted the pace three wide to the far turn and faltered. CATALON flashed speed along the inside and began fading on the turn.
BROAD JUMPER trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. CLOUT CHASER raced wide off the pace and weakened steadily. SPANIKOPITA lacked
speed and gave way readily losing contact with her field.

MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT set the pace racing with a clear lead, turned back a bid from FINAL SHOT passing the furlong marker, then edged away and
held on gamely for the win. EAGLES CRY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and
finished gamely inside. FINAL SHOT tracked the pacesetter, chased on the turn, made a strong bid outside of the winner in upper stretch and was
outkicked. YOUNG SQUIRE stalked three wide, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, raced evenly in the stretch and closed the gap late. ONE
MORE SCOOP raced three wide off the pace, four wide on the turn and gained mildly outside. VEESON chased two wide and lacked a rally. GEEBERT
raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
