Footnotes
AVAILABLE STAR chased the leaders from the two path mid pack, remained nicely rated on the turn, then shifted gears and steadily gained ground down
the lane and was up at the wire to prevail. AGENT PETER GRAVES showed the way from the inside, cleared the turn, maintained the lead under a gamely
drive then was caught at the wire and was second best. TODDCHERO pursued the pace while three wide, then moved along the inside on the turn, shifted
out to the three path and closed belatedly down the lane just missing victory in the end. ALTO ROAD broke outwardly and bumped rival, then chased the
duet from the inside, menaced leaving the turn in attempt to gain command in the upper stretch, was in a gamely rally then steadied in the late stretch. OUR
PASTOR pressed the leader while two wide into the turn under a steady drive, lost second position leaving the turn, then continued to give way in the late
stretch. MOR VICTORY was bumped at the start, then settled in the back trio while two wide, made a mild bid leaving the turn and made no difference in the
end. BELEWS GOLD raced at the tail of the field then bid on the turn while two wide and came up empty. LET'S GO ALAMO settled along the inside and
failed to rally. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of ALTO ROAD claimed foul against the rider of AGENT PETER GRAVES
for interence in deep stretch. After reviewing the replay, the STEWARDS declared no change to the order of finish.

on the far turn, re bid in the early stretch and came up evenly in the end. SHAKINTHEMONARCHY broke outwardly and bumped rival, was allowed to settle
while two wide, then bid mildly from the inside leaving the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN was bumped at

Footnotes
MISS CODE WEST sparred with an inner rival heading into the first turn, then gained command to set the pace down the backstretch, was confronted by
TOO MUCH KIKI leaving the far turn, but kept on determinedly and drew clear in the late stretch to prove best in the end. TOO MUCH KIKI angled out to the
four path heading into the first turn, then stalked the pace down the backstretch while three deep, then inched up on the far turn in attempt to take the lead
from, lacked the winning spark and could not catch MISS CODE WEST in the end. MAGNOLIA AVENUE stalked the pace while two wide in the early
furlongs, then rallied on the far turn and was best for the show prize in the end. CONTOUR dueled with an outer rival headed into the first turn, then settled
back to stalk the leader down the backstretch, was in hard drive on the far turn, could not gain the lead and weakened in the home stretch. TEXAS MOON
was allowed to settle close behind the pack down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn and came up flat in the stretch. KENTUCKY ANGEL trailed
behind the field and failed to rally.

JOSH'S DREAM reserved ground behind the field in the early furlongs, then came out four wide leaving the bend took to rouse and found the best stride in
late stretch to surpass inner rivals and be up just in time to claim victory. ZAVALA led the way from the inside into the turn, lost command briefly by an outer
rival at the quarter pole, dug in gamely to regain the lead in the last sixteenth then was caught at the wire and was second best. CHIEF BRADY was away
well to press the leader ZAVALA while three wide, then took over briefly at the quarter pole, was met with said rival once again in the early stretch to duke
out then was out kicked and missed the place prize in the end. WILL THE THRILL chased the leading trio while four wide, then urged steadily on the turn,
came out five wide to bid in the stretch and needed more in the end. BOBBY BRINKLEY was allowed to settle along the inside while behind the field, then
rallied in the early stretch but it was not enough in the end. ALGEBRA pressed the pace while two wide, was in hard drive leaving the turn, could not retain
bid and gave way in the stretch.

NO MAS TEQUILA was nicely rated along the inside close behind the leaders, then moved between rivals leaving the far turn, slipped thru along rail and
met with stable mate in the last sixteenth to duked it out and was up at the wire to prevail. IMALUCKYCHARM tracked the pace while four wide and outside
of rivals down the backstretch, then dug in gamely at the top of the far turn to battle gamely for the lead, pulled away to spar with stable mate in the final
furlong and was out kicked in the end. MISSINGYOUCRAZY saved ground in the early furlongs while racing towards to back of the field, then rallied leaving
the far turn while coming out four wide and closed willingly down the home stretch and was best for the show prize. GRACIE'S KITTEN tracked the pace
from the two path, then took command at the top of the far turn, maintained the lead under a gamely rally in the early stretch then was out finished by rivals
on both sides and missed the show prize in the end. TUDELA tracked the pace while three deep down the backstretch, then dug in at the top of the far turn
to vie between rivals in attempt to gain the lead, could not keep up and gave way in the late stretch. BLOOD ORANGE was allowed to settle along the the
inside, then bid leaving the far turn and came up empty in the end. TAHITIAN BREEZE was unhurried early, continued to race at the back of the pack down
the backstretch, then bid leaving the far turn and made no impact in the end. TURN ON THE BLING set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive
heading into the far turn, was met with incoming rivals on the outside, steadied at the quarter pole and lost stride in the home stretch. There was an
INQUIRY following the race. After review, no change was made.

Footnotes
VICTORY FOR VETS tracked the pace while two wide and between rivals in the early furlongs, remained nicely rated on the far turn, then shifted out to the
three path in the early stretch, edged past the dueling leaders and was up in the final furlong to prove best overall. STRONG PROMISE pressed the pace
into the first turn while two wide, then dueled with an inner down the backstretch and into the early home stretch, was in a long drive then was out finished
by an outer rival in the final furlong and was second best. MISCHIEVOUS M led the way into the first turn, then sparred with an outer rival throughout the
majority of the course before being surpassed by an outer rival in the final sixteenth and missed the place prize in the end. CLASSIC RICK chased the pace
while three wide and between rivals, was in a hard drive on the far turn in attempt to gain the lead, could not retain stride and gave way in the late stretch.
COASTAL BRINK tracked the pace from the inside at an evenly pace throughout the first three quarters then came out four wide leaving the bend to bid in
the stretch but it was not enough in the end. THIRD STREET raced in the middle of the field from the inside at a moderate pace throughout and needed rally
in the end. SHARP LORENZO was allowed to settle along the inside, lost ground in the late backstretch and raced at the back of the field, then urged
steadily on the far turn to bid in the late stretch and came up empty. FOO FLIGHTER was unhurried early, raced while three wide towards the back of the
field and was no threat. SHAKIN LOOSE raced towards the back of the pack under a mild drive throughout and needed rally in the end. DEACON JONES
stalked the pace while four wide down the backstretch, then bid briefly on the far turn, was used up and tired in the late stretch.

SINGAPORE FLASH was in pursuit of the pace while two wide, continued to track the leader under a steady drive into the far turn, came out four wide at the
top of the stretch, dug in gamely to edge past SUNLIT SONG in the final furlong and was up in time to succeed. SUNLIT SONG showed the way into the
first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, cleared the far turn, maintained the lead under a long drive in the final yards then was caught at the wire and
was second best. IBERIAN RUNNER was allowed to settle while two wide, then steadily urged on the far turn to split rivals in the upper stretch, lacked the
winning bid and was best for the show prize in the end. EASTER SNAP stalked the pace from the two path while maintaining second position into the
backstretch and throughout the far turn, was used up and flattened out in the home stretch. WITT'S TAQUITO tracked the pace in the early furlongs from
the inside, then settle back on the far turn, bore out six to seven wide to re bid in the stretch and came up empty in the end. TRULY DANZIG was allowed to
