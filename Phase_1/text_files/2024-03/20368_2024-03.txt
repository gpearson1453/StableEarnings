Footnotes
BOURBON AFICIONADO unhurried early after being last away, tipped out four wide when advancing exiting the turn, bid, extended drive, wore down the
runner up late. OUR KEEPSAKE back off the pace toward the inside, angled three wide inside the winner entering the stretch, continued on equal terms
with that one when the pair was challenging the leader inside the furlong marker, dueled, yielded late. DREWMANIA took command after the start, showed
the way up the backstretch inside, shook clear in the turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage upper stretch, proved no match for the top two late.
SWEET SODDY J chased the leader in the two path for a half, had little left for the stretch run. JUST ASK WATTS forwardly placed backstretch well out in
the strip, began to weaken while four wide through most of the turn, continued to retreat stretch. KINGDOM FORCE fell back to trail after the start, was
never involved to be well beaten.

advantage into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire while being kept to pressure. INSIGHTFUL MISS void of speed along the inside, roused and
rallied up the rail to finished willingly and be clear for the place. CODE FOR SUCCESS off the pace while racing outside, three to four wide through the turn,
displayed some mild interest to prove best of the rest. THE PRINCESS SAYS forwardly placed for a half to the winner's inside, had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CHADRON settled off the pace in the two path, in some traffic a quarter out, dropped to the rail late in the second turn, bid into lane, clear. OUR HEAVENLY
GIFT broke on top, set the pace inside, continued to show the way into and through the final turn, moved off the inside a bit entering the stretch allowed the
winner the rail, proved no match for that one the in the drive while holding sway for the place. AUDEN hesitated at the break then broke a bit awkwardly to
spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back, angled three wide late in the final turn, rallied with some interest to be up for the show. PRINCE IS MY BOY
back early well wide, six wide into the first turn, moved closer five wide onto the backstretch, bid 2nd, flattened out in the drive. LEAD FOOT void of speed
outside, four wide onto the backstretch, three to four wide again in the second bend, lacked a closing punch. BOURBON ON FIRE back early, closer five to
four wide through the first turn, bid second bend while between horses, faltered in the drive. DEVIL'S SHADOW forwardly placed early along the inside, fell
back the middle half, nothing for drive. STAUF in the second flight while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, fell back, four wide far turn,
remained back. CRIME ZONE prompted the early pace while three wide, began to give way before a half. LUCKY SUPER NOVA finished early, well back.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SUNSET close from the start, moved up to duel in the two path before a half, alternated up front into the far turn, cleared the other speed,
dropped to the inside by late in that bend, drifted in repeatedly to nearly brush the rail, stayed clear to the wire. RABBIT HOUND settled off the early pace
three wide, continued in the three path backstretch and into the far turn, bit closer in some traffic with a quarter to run, slowly getting to that drifting leader
late, narrowly gained the nod for the place. AUTO GLIDE back off the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued back the middle half, in some
traffic late in the final turn, split foes past the furlong marker, also showed some steady late interest while missing the second spot. MAZING MARK broke
back, lacked speed, three to four wide out of the final turn, improved a bit in upper stretch then flattened out a bit the final furlong. WALDRIP lacked speed
off the inside for six furlongs, steered three wide turning for home, improved position without posing a serious threat. A LA CARTE four wide in the first turn,
stalked the two leaders the middle part in the three path, faltered in the drive. ARTWELL broke on top, showed the way early inside, dueled the middle half
mile closest to the inside, gave way late in the final turn. THIRD WATCH forwardly placed early while off the rail, began a steady fade after a half.
LIVINGSTON stumbled at the start, remained always back.

Footnotes
THIS IS USCAR with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled into the lane in the two path, kicked strongly clear in a promising debut. CAPITAL
CONNECTION dueled up front closest to the inside, remained on equal terms with the winner out of the turn, proved no match for the winner, held the
place. DUKE OF DUVAL mid pack toward the inside, in the two path through much of the turn, rallied, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the runner
up. MO EL GRANDE broke back, trailed, also in the two path out of the turn, displayed some mild, belated interest to improve position. CHARBON balked at
loading, off step slow, moved up in mid pack off the rail, three path exiting the turn, continued one paced through the stretch. BURLSWORTH broke in good
order, raced prominently three wide for a half, began to weaken when straightened for home, continued to falter the final furlong to lose several positions.
HOBY CAT lacked speed, three to four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. INDY CHARGE broke sharp, raced in the second flight then faded
through the stretch. HIGH RANSOM fell back quickly after a quarter, distanced after losing contact with the field stretch, jogged in.

HEIR TO GREATNESS in mid pack off the inside first turn, continued in mid pack the middle half, in some traffic late in the final turn, split foes to contend
past the furlong marker, put a head in front then drifted out a bit late to help put UNSTABLE PRINCE in somewhat tight with a sixteenth to run, outkicked the
runner up to the wire. CALRISSIAN in the second flight early along the inside, crept closer in the second turn, steered to the outside for room into the lane,
outside bid past the furlong marker, put a head in front, drifted in slightly to help tighten up UNSTABLE PRICE a sixteenth out, outkicked late. UNSTABLE
PRINCE lacked early foot, began to advance four wide in the far turn, continued in the four path, steered in upper stretch, brief bid between the top two, was
idling when in a bit tight, steadied, narrowly gained the nod for the show. HUMOR ME NOW off a bit slow, four wide when well off the pace first turn,
continued back, began to advance in some traffic into the far turn, two path for the drive, improved to narrowly miss the show. HARD TO COME BY four
wide through the first turn, continued outside, steadily advance four to five wide second turn, outside bid past the furlong marker, faltered in the late run to
the wire. STAR NATION dropped inside to save some ground first turn, moved back out, four to five wide second bend, also improved position upper.
ASSUMPTION void of speed, remained well back for six furlongs, angled three wide into the lane, passed some tiring rivals. AIN'T THAT A KICK stumbled
at the start, also raced well back for six furlongs, steered four wide into the stretch, passed faltering foes to better position as well. POINT BLANK angled in
early first turn when forwardly placed, dueled the middle part then gave way when the real running began exiting the final turn. CHROME RUN dueled up
front along the inside, also faltered into the stretch. MR. WULLY BULLY forwardly placed along the inside, staged a steady retreat after a half. FETCHS
BRAHM in the second flight while three wide, began to back up after five furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF UNSTABLE PRINCE AGAINST HEIR TO GREATNESS, THE RESULT WAS
ALLOWED TO STAND. PER RULING ECM2024-112 FROM HIWU, CALRISSIAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
CASTLEWARDEN broke with the field, moved off the rail and pressed the leader from the outside, engaged that one turn, dueled, edged clear late under
firm handling. SIMOVIC back off the pace and the inside, crept a bit closer late in the turn in traffic, continued covered up upper stretch, finished willingly
when clear the final furlong to earn the place. PINELAND broke on top, cleared to the inside soon after, showed the way into the turn, dueled with the winner
through the bend and upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that one and the runner up late. BATON ROUGE off slow then bumped with LEAR, moved
up to race behind the pace along the inside, moved out a bit for the drive, lacked a closing punch. MILLERS RITE fell back after breaking in good
order,dropped inside, continued to save ground into the lane, displayed some modest late interest. MEMPHIS PHAROAH within striking distance up the
backstretch outside, four to three wide far turn, faltered in the drive. LEAR off slow then bumped, trailed early, moved out four wide into the lane, failed to
rally.

MIDNIGHT TAXES away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, shook well clear of the other speed in the drive, drifted out in upper stretch, wrapped
up late to win ridden out. STUCK N SNOW off the pace along the inside, made a good gain along the inside late in the turn, could do little with the winner
through the stretch, kicked well clear for the place while remaining inside. TWENTY TO PARK in the second flight early, three down to two path turn, up late
to gain the nod for the show. HIT SCENE dueled inside the winner up the backstretch, fell back off that one early in the turn, moved out into the two path,
had little for the drive, nipped late for the show spot. HESS hesitated at the break, moved up to be one paced while racing three wide, improved slightly
while not a serious threat. HOLUS BOLUS chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch, tired while racing three wide through the turn. CHEZ WHIZ
remained back while racing four wide through the turn, lacked closing response. READY SHOES saved ground to no avail. I'M AN OAK off a step slow,
trailed most of the way. YAQUI VALLEY tired while five down to four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
STRIKE RIDGE pressed the early leader from the outside, moved closer and dueled in the three path through the turn, continued on equal terms upper
stretch then kicked well clear the final furlong under a steady right handed crop. TASK in mid pack early inside, moved out a bit to race in the two path
through the turn, rallied willingly through some traffic to earn the place while not a threat to the winner. GOD'S COUNTRY off a step slow, raced back,
swung out four to five wide turning for home, found best stride too late down the middle of the strip. STRATO broke alertly, showed the way up the
backstretch along the inside, dueled inside the winner turn, continued to vie upper stretch then caved the final furlong. HAYAHLOOKATME in the second
flight outside, three to four wide into the lane, went flat late. ROCKET SANDERS came in after the start, lacked speed outside, four to five wide turning for
home, lacked a closing kick. CLEAR ECHO hesitated at the break to trail early, continued to trail through the turn, improved with some belated interest
inside. RYNO WRECKER forwardly placed in the two path for a half, gave way in the stretch. PEARCY ROAD jostled at the break, raced back and well
wide, five wide then bumped turning for home, failed to rally after recovering. MACHO STRIKER forwardly placed along the inside for a half, backed up
through the stretch. TWO DOLLAR EDDIE hopped at the start then was bumped and in tight, raced in mid pack, swung out four wide, bumped with
PEARCY ROAD exiting the turn and faded. WILLIE CAT was finished early inside.
