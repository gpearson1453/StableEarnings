Footnotes
BO'S BOURBON set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead by the quarter pole, shook clear nearing the sixteenth marker and then lasted
late to prevail while being on the left lead. SUMMER ASH was taken back early towards the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong
marker and closed fast on the outside to just miss. STARLITE WALKER prompted the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn but hung in the
lane. DR RAGS was settled early, three wide entering the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, then had some late gain but needed more. RED
DEVOLUTION pressed the early pace between rivals two wide, then tracked the pace on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole and then faded.
OUR ANDREW B was reserved early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. MY BLUE EYES chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
UNIFIED BY CANDY was away alertly to set a pressured pace while in the two to three path, then made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear, then was put
to mild right handed crop and remained clear to the wire with speed to spare to score. PUMP IT UP tracked the early pace on the inside, then shifted off the
inside to go by a tiring rival nearing the quarter pole and then finished well on the inside to be clearly second best. EASTER BET was settled early along the
inside, then shifted out midway on the turn, five wide by the quarter pole while advancing, then came six wide into the lane and lugged in by the furlong
marker and rallied to gain the show award while racing green. GREAT KISSER tracked the early pace three wide and made a four wide bid leaving the
quarter pole but flattened out. OUR ETHAN CHARLES was bumped at the start, then raced between rivals early, four wide by the quarter pole and had no
rally. THIRTY WEST passed the tiring rivals. PRETORIAN GOLD was rated along three wide and then when asked weakened. JAKE BRAKE ALLEY was
settled four wide early and then came three wide into the lane and tired. ANNA'S GOT STYLE pressed the early pace on the inside and then was empty in
the lane. DESERT TWISTER failed to menace.

COULD BE A COUGAR tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn and kicked away to prove much the best under a mild drive. HOT
FUDGE WARRIOR was rated along the inside and made a inside bid leaving the turn but could not go with the winner while keeping on for the place award.
CHARM ALARM was reserved early, three wide on the turn and came four wide off the turn and had a mild late kick. ORGANIZED CHAOS was off a step
slow, then ran up while head strong to the front to set the pace while clear in the two path, then was headed leaving the three sixteenths and weakened the
final furlong. STASSI chased the pace on the inside and was roused nearing the quarter pole and had no response. MS STRONG HEART was reserved two
wide and never threatened.

PYROTECHNICS vied for the early lead on the outside, then went on to set the pace three wide, then dropped to be two wide on the turn while clear, drew
out leaving the turn and then widened the margin to prove much the best under a drive. INDINI tracked the pace on the inside but proved to be no match for
the winner wile staying on to be second best. DANCING BEAUTY chased the pace three wide, then was between rivals leaving the five sixteenths and then
kept on to best the rest. SOL EMPERATRIZ was settled early, four wide and on the outside on the turn but lacked the needed bid. ENSUING GRACE was
off a step slow, outrun early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. BUCKFAST ABBEY tracked the pace two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT FLYING was away alertly to set a pressured pace in the two path under a hard hold, was well rated and shook clear leaving the turn and then
drew out to prove much the best under a drive. WISH FOR PEACE had a three to four wide pursuit early, then moved up to stalk the pace five wide nearing
the half mile marker, made a four wide bid on the far turn but could not go with the winner in the drive, clearly second best. JAMIE DREAMS was four wide
into the first turn, pressed the pace three wide, made a bid to vie for the lead in between rivals by the five sixteenths but flattened out in the lane, held show
award. MY REDEMPTION was bumped at the start, reserved early, outside pursuit up the backstretch, five to four wide on the far turn, shifted out and had a
mild late kick to just miss the show award. TRENDING UP was allowed to settle early, three wide on the far turn and had no rally. TUNE IN pressed the
pace from the inside and weakened. SITTIN ON GO steadied leaving the seven furlong marker and then tracked the pace from between rivals and
weakened. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH chased the pace on the inside and then was shuffled back on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
NOBLE JON was well placed on the inside, then steadied slightly and then shifted out for racing room leaving the five sixteenths to make a four wide bid
leaving the quarter pole, then slowly edged clear late to prove best, driving. MARTINKELLY was rated early, made a four wide sweep on the turn to take
over by the quarter pole, then was confronted by the winner and dug in but was out-kicked by that rival, good effort. SAMURAI SAINT was settled back
early, came six wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. INDIRECTLY stalked the pace three wide, made a two wide bid by the quarter
pole and was on the inside into the lane and faded, lost show late. SASSY LAD was reserved early, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and had a
belated rally. KAZ MUNNINGS was settled early, made a mild bid five wide leaving the quarter pole but flattened out late. I ONCE STOOD ALONE was
reserved early, made a mild inside move leaving the turn but had no late kick. JUST GOT STARTED broke in a tangle at the start and never factored. ACT
OF VALOR vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE vied for the lead two wide and stopped.
