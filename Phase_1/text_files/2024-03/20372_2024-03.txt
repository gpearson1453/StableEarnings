Footnotes
CIRCLE OF TRUST chased along the rail early before having to steady off heels first time through the stretch, continued in range from the fence to the far
turn, angled three wide to take aim at the leaders from outside, challenged approaching the drive, quickly cleared in upper stretch, drifted to the inside and
held safely. RUNYON CANYON was off a bit slow to start, traveled two wide at the back, cut to the inside past the quarter pole, steered out in upper stretch
and showed late effort to gain second. IMA JOKER sat off the pace outside a rival, chased two to three wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and
finished evenly for third. AMERICANDREAMMAKER broke a bit slow and inward, traveled along the rail at the back, suffered a mild shuffle at the
three-eighths pole, tipped out into the clear, then kept on through the lane for a minor award. TAHINI stumbled at the start, showed speed while racing
keenly in hand outside a rival, cleared and crossed over early on the first turn, showed the way under pressure up the backstretch and far turn, fought inside
a pair of rivals leaving the bend, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. AURATIUM away quickly and crossed over, rated early while
racing keenly on the front end before ceding command to TAHINI, steadied off the heels of that rival early on the first turn, angled out and went up to press
the pace from outside, stayed alongside through the far turn, could not keep up entering the lane and faded out of contention. MATTERS became fractious
in the gate, saved ground towards the rear, came under a ride on the far turn and weakened in the lane. WESTPHALIA stalked three deep first time through
the stretch, two then three wide on the first turn, began to weaken three to four wide on the far turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
LANSDOWNE (GB) vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals to the turn, fought inside MITICO through the turn holding a slight edge, put that rival away at the
eighth pole while receiving another challenge from inside, dueled outside ELEVADO in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. ELEVADO stalked the leading
trio from the rail, saved ground through the turn, roused entering the lane, launched a rail bid with a furlong remaining, battled from the fence inside the
winner but could not get by. ROGUE SON broke well then dropped back early and angled in, trailed on the inside then angled out past the quarter pole,
closed with a mild rally from outside and gained the show honors. MITICO vied between rivals to the turn, fought outside the winner around the bend and
into the lane, could not kick on with LANSDOWNE (GB) at the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. AFTERNOON HEAT chased from off the pace
up the backstretch, navigated the turn in the two path, went between rivals at the sixteenth pole and failed to threaten. DIVINE RASCAL fought three deep
for the lead in the early going, could not keep up with the top pair and chased three wide around the turn, then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
BLONDE BOMBSHELL broke out and bumped rival, settled off the pace, got put in tight along the rail into the turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole,
moved out to launch a rally in the stretch, surged in the final sixteenth and overhauled the runner-up. TOPOLINA away quickly and led for a bit before
ceding command to WINK WISH AND PARK, stalked that rival two wide into the turn, bid from outside with three furlongs remaining, kicked clear at the
quarter pole, remained unchallenged into deep stretch then was engulfed by the winner late. ARINNITI (FR) broke in and bumped rival, stalked in the two
path through the turn, roused around the bend and asked left handed, could not summon the needed late kick in the final furlong but churned on to hold
third. DOLLY MAY (IRE) dropped back early on the inside, went between rivals into the turn, chased two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and
failed to threaten. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) got bumped and squeezed back at the start, trailed early then went outside a rival, went three deep into the
turn, lacked room behind a rival from the five-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, swung out into the lane and could not summon the needed rally. SUFFICE
got bumped on both sides at the start, tracked off the rail, three wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. WINK WISH AND PARK had good early
speed from outside then crossed over once clear of inner rival, challenged at the three-eighths pole, relinquished the lead midway around the bend, started
to weaken at the quarter pole and gave way in the lane. THE RIDER ABOARD CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
ARINNITI (FR) FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT.
AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ARINNITI (FR) FROM THIRD TO FIFTH FOR BREAKING INWARD AND INTERFERING WITH
CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE), COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
PERFECT IN GRAY dueled outside EASTER COMING BACK then cleared that rival leaving the backstretch, led a bit off the rail around the bend, flagged
with the whip in the final furlong and drew off. ACE ACE BABY chased off the inside, closest in pursuit in the three path on the turn, chased within striking
distance in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the furlong grounds. HIGH FLYING GRACIE broke a bit awkwardly, chased from inside near
the back, spun two wide into the lane, moved out further and was along for the show. FANCY FASCINATOR broke a step slow, tracked from outside,
rounded the bend four wide and weakened down the lane. EASTER COMING BACK broke well and dueled inside the winner early then gave chase
approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, raced along the rail then two wide into the stretch and also weakened. SPICY RIDE dropped back and trailed three
wide into the turn, angled down to the rail around the bend and was never a factor. SUZZIE'S DARLIN broke well then chased out of range under coaxing,
traveled two, three, then four wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.

the leader with a sixteenth remaining and proved best late. COURT SNORT settled in the two path then between rivals, angled four wide into the stretch,
rallied widest in the lane but got outclosed by the winner. ISSA COURT stepped to the front and showed the way from inside, remained clear through the far
turn, asked right handed entering the lane, led untested to midstretch, then was confronted by ABHITA at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. JESSEBEAR
rated on the inside in the early stages, coaxed along on the far turn continued to hug the rail, elected to stayed on the fence in the stretch run, kept on
through the final furlong and missed third. SAND TO SEA was closest in pursuit in the two path to the top of the stretch, chased within striking distance
through the final furlong but never produced a bid. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS chased three then two wide on the first turn, rounded the far turn two then three
wide and lacked a bid. TRUE PATRIOT antsy in the gate, reserved in the early going and moved inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, chased
between in upper stretch, then angled inward and lacked a bid. VRONSKY FEINT chased four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, went three deep into
the second bend, exited the far turn four to five wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
KNOWN IDEA set the pace under pressure from SPECIAL CLUB up the backstretch and around the turn, battled head to head with that rival down the lane,
was overtaken in deep stretch but dug in late to edge the runner-up in a narrow photo. SPECIAL CLUB pressed the pace from outside, coaxed along
outside KNOWN IDEA around the bend, fought on even terms into the final furlong, took a slim lead in the final sixteenth but was beaten at the wire. UNCLE
CHILLY chased two wide into the turn, rounded the bend between foes, moved out a bit in the lane, finished willingly late and was gaining on the top pair to
the wire. MYSTIC SPIRIT chased three deep to the stretch, failed to find the needed late kick to threaten for the win but kept on for a minor award. J
DUTTON broke a step slow, stalked from inside, asked right handed past the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. DRIVE FOR SHOW trailed well off
the rail early, started to climb at the half-mile pole, chased three then two wide on the turn and failed to menace. STRIKING THUNDER tracked three deep
between then got crowded early, checked at the half-mile pole, saved ground inside a rival on the turn and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
MUBTADAA showed the way two wide then along the rail through the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace in-handed up the backstretch, remained
confidently handled on the far turn while feeling pressure to the outside, headed by MEGA MOON leaving the bend, roused in upper stretch, kicked clear
under right handed urging midstretch and drew away. ANMER HALL reserved in the three path, chased within range three deep on the far turn, rallied in the
lane and edged MEGA MOON for the place honors. MEGA MOON tracked two wide early, bid three deep late on the far turn and headed MUBTADAA
entering the stretch, fought outside that rival to the eighth pole, then could not keep up with the winner in the furlongs grounds and got nailed for second.
SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) traveled two wide towards the rear in the opening stages, remained in that path to the far turn, angled out and came four wide
into the stretch, finished willingly from the middle portion of the stretch and rounded out the superfecta. TARANTINO well place behind the leader along the
rail, continued to save ground on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed response. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT bobbled and got
shuffled back at the start, trailed from inside to the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. GOLDENEYE got put in a bit tight early
then moved inside, traveled in mid-pack then went between rivals into the far turn, had to wait when boxed in around the bend, continued two wide into the
lane and failed to menace. SILENT HEAT stalked three then two wide early, put in a mild bid outside the leader at the three-eighths pole, could not keep
pace and chased two leaving the bend, then faded out of contention.
