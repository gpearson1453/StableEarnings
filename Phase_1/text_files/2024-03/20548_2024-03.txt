Footnotes
ATLAS STRONG came in at the break, was a forward factor in the two path between horses leaving the backstretch and on the turn, swung to the four path
turning for home, remained on her left lead through the stretch, led near the eighth pole and edged away. VIROLOGIST prompted the pace three deep,
gained a short lead entering the stretch and finished willingly. TOOSHAY lacked speed, raced near the inner rail entering the stretch swung to the seven
path in mid stretch and passed tired rivals. BEST WORST IDEA , bumped at the break, stayed along the inner rail around the turn, angled out in mid stretch
while chasing the pace and weakened. PRUGOVA set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way in mid stretch. NO
COMMON CENT worked between horses on the turn and lacked a rally. ARROGATES DREAM , four wide chasing the pace to the turn, faltered after six
furlongs.

Footnotes
KAYA'S HALO broke sharp and set a rated pace just off the inside, handled outside pressure into the turn, was nursed clear around the turn, kicked away
after being set down in upper stretch then held firm while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. CATCH THE KITTEN , snugly rated between rivals while
close up nearing the five eighths, had the leaders get away a bit into the far turn, picked up the pace and advanced between runners near the quarter pole,
shifted out four wide and finished willingly to earn the place. CANDY ARCADE rated off the pace and off the inside, raced between runners leaving the three
eighths, advanced between runners in mid stretch, dropped in soon after and churned on with interest. SOUTH PACIFIC , in tight at the break, settled off the
pace and outside a rival, edged up between runners near mid stretch, shifted out late and kept on with effort. GOOD STORY , firmly in hand four deep near
the five eighths, pulled her way forward and bid outside the foes leaving the far turn, chased the winner to mid stretch then faded late. FLITTER , three wide
between runners and in range past the five eighths, was under pressure chasing the off the rail mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch and weakened.
RAZORETTE forced the pace outside the winner, threatened between runners around the far turn, failed to kick on towards the rail nearing the lane and
tired. LUV U MARY JANE broke outward and bumped with NAMI, lagged back, saved ground mid turn, angled out for the drive and failed to menace. NAMI
broke awkwardly then was bumped, rushed up inside foes, checked off heels near the five eighths, regrouped to save ground, lacked a punch mid turn and
retreated.

COLLECTION DAY bore out at the break, rushed up five deep on the first turn, made the lead approaching the backstretch, set the pace and was kept
under pressure in the drive. MASTER OF NONE chased the winner, raced in the two path around the far turn and failed to rally in an even effort.
MARYLAND MOON lacked speed, saved ground around both turns, remained along the inner rail in the stretch and failed to be a factor.
AGARRAMESIPUEDES , up close down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and weakened the final furlong. BLAZING RED showed speed along
the inner rail and gave way leaving the backstretch. FINANCIAL STRENGTH , four wide the first turn, was three wide the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
UTTERLY ENCHANTING , jostled at the break, regrouped and edged up off the rail and under a ride leaving the far turn, pursued the dueling leaders past
the five sixteenths, advanced between runners three wide into the lane, altered out past mid stretch, leveled off to her best stride when roused right handed,
forged to command outside SULTRY SALLY H in deep stretch then edged away nearing the wire. SULTRY SALLY H , with the pace three wide and
between runners into the turn, sparred three deep past the five sixteenths, took a short lead soon into the lane, briefly edged clear inside the furlong
grounds, kept on with good effort but just could not fend off the winner's charge. NO MORE MASK came in at the break bumping with the winner and forcing
others towards the inside to be in tight, corrected and pressed two wide between foes, battled on near even terms while between horses past the five
sixteenths, emerged in a battle to the inside of SULTRY SALLY H past the three sixteenths, could not quite go on with that one leaving mid stretch then
gave way grudgingly. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN , four deep prompting the pace, failed to quicken with the trio to her inside leaving the three eighths, chased
four wide into the lane but came up empty. FANCY PRINCESS , roughed up between runners leaving the gate and was away last, regrouped and was put
to urging, angled out into the turn, gave hard chase circling five wide into the stretch but failed to generate a serious run. OLIVE KAT came out at the break
bumping THROWBACK, straightened and rated a bit off the four ply battle into the turn, gained towards the rail soon after, had aim, failed to go on in upper
stretch and faded. THROWBACK , bumped at the break, regrouped and sped up to take a short lead, was hounded by rivals to her outside, stayed on to
upper stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
BANDITSGOLDENCHILD broke on top and briefly lead then was content to be rated off of a keen foe to his outside, eased out a bit and bid between foes
near mid turn, sparred on a slim lead outside STELLARS IN CHARGE from upper stretch past mid stretch, edged clear under a drive, swapped over to his
left lead in the final jumps and held firm. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND reluctant to load, broke outward and bumped a rival, angled off the inside nearing the
half, moved up and bid three deep mid turn, chased the dueling leaders in upper stretch, came back on a bit late and gained the place in the final yards.
STELLARS IN CHARGE pulled her way clear nearing the turn then dropped in, met outside bids around the turn, battled inside the winner from mid turn to
the sixteenth marker then weakened very late. TAJI MIKE , three deep leaving the far turn, offered a mild response. HAVE NO REGRETS rated between
runners early, dropped in towards the rail mid turn, chased and came up empty. MY ASIAN LOVER , four wide, lacked a bid. ROOMMATE MARTIN broke
slowly and was outrun. RAINY SKIES hesitated at the break, lagged off the pace, raced three to four wide into the lane, shifted in some and lacked a bid
under some hand coaxing. TOONICE , bumped at the break, steadied off the heels of a rival nearing the half and gave way.

ARMANDO R , off the pace and under some coaxing, edged up inside rivals nearing mid stretch, was guided outward leaving mid stretch, closed sharply
under right handed asks and got up in the final yards. YOUR ANALYSIS settled in the clear and within range of the leaders, commenced a run when given
his cue past the three eighths, circled four to five wide into the lane, made a grinding run and drew alongside TOPS THE CHARTS inside the sixteenth
marker, battled on near even terms and kept on gamely between runners. TOPS THE CHART vied four wide outside CAPTAIN QUINT into the first turn,
took over past the seven eighths and set a rated pace two wide, widened a bit under pressure soon into the lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch,
drifted out some when collared near the sixteenth pole, dueled late and stayed on well to the inside of the top pair. CAPTAIN QUINT vied three wide inside
TOPS THE CHARTS then rated back off that one heading to the backstretch, tracked inside, remained inside within reach into the stretch and gave willing
chase to the wire. WISH FOR PEACE settled off the inside, moved up a bit four wide outside a rival into the lane, exchanges bumps with MINDTAP
between the three sixteenths and eighth pole then churned on. FRIGHTLAND tugged his way forward from the outside then rated in a prompting spot three
wide, continued in hand into the far turn, stayed on under asking and pursued the leader to mid stretch, lacked a punch a sixteenth out and faded. MINDTAP
broke inward bumping a rival then stumbling badly, regrouped and saved ground, advanced along the rail past the three eighths, eased out to move
between runners into the stretch, bumped twice with an outer foe through the lane then was taken in hand while fading. BODE'S MAKER , bumped with
MINDTAP at the break when that one came inward, recovered to save some ground, edged up off the inside near the half, chased between runners leaving
the three eighths, failed to kick on nearing the lane and tired.

along the inner rail throughout and rallied gamely. WESTERN LANE lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. PATTY
CAKES , a forward factor outside the winner, chased that one and flattened out late. THISNAMEISOKAY hesitated and reared at the break, lost ground on

DUNVEGAN DOLL hugged the inner rail while stalking the pace in hand, advanced on the far turn, eased out to three path approaching the stretch, swept to
command in upper stretch, was under rousing and drew away. HAPPY UNION raced inside horses for six furlongs, swung four wide turning for home and
rallied. MYSISTERNANCY chased the pace, took a two wide lead mid way on the far turn then weakened through the stretch. VIKING QUEEN showed
speed along the inner rail, lost the advantage on the far turn then weakened in the stretch. CONGRESS HALL stayed along the inner rail most of the trip
and was not a factor. INSTINCTIVE , three wide both turns, was not a factor. SWEET TALIA chased the pace well off the rail and gave way leaving the
backstretch. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE was outrun.
