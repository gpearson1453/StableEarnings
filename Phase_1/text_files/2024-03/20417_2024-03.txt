AS LUCK HAPPENS dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. SIR LOOKING GLASS raced off the
pace up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SEA BREEZE BOY stalked
the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the three path and chased on to the wire. WEDNESDAY AT SHADY veered
out leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the outside early, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and weakened in the lane. LORD FISC
trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. COUNTRY BOY tracked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and faded from there.

Footnotes
GREASE MISSLE led the way up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and drew off in the stretch. CALEBS LADY raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, swung out to the five path coming around the bend, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
improved position late but was no match for the winner. LOTSA STEEL raced off the pace early, saved ground around the bend and passed tiring horses in
the lane. PERFECT MISCHIEF chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and weakened in the stretch.
ACES OVER DEUCES pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and tired from there. CHIRISCA raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, dropped back while racing in the two path around the bend and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
NYQUILER bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to kick clear. INCREDIBE MO
raced in the four path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, pulled clear in upper stretch and
was caught late. WESTERBERG raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the
far bend from the two path and improved position in the lane. GORM raced in the three path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the six
path coming around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position from there. IOWA HAWKEYE saved ground in the middle of
the pack through the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the three path and finished evenly. GRUMPY BAY bumped with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the two
path and faded in the lane. IMISSBAYMEADOWS bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and weakened in the stretch. LITTLE RED RIFLE led the way from the rail through the opening
half mile, continued to save ground around the second bend and tired in the lane. CONRAD THE RED raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in
the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and made no bid. BIG WAY raced in the five
path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the five path and was empty in the stretch.
