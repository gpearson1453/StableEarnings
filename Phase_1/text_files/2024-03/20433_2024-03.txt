Footnotes
SAINT EROS GIRL prompted two wide, dueled around the turn, led turning for home and drove clear. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW leaned in and bumped a
rival at the start, stalked the top pair from the three path, shfited to the five path entering the lane, gained place chasing the clearing leader while hanging on
her left lead in upper stretch, then held that position. WA WA WEE WA laid off of the pace in the four to six path and stayed on. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT was
bumped by an outer rival at the start, led from an outer prompter early on, dueled with that one around the turn, got headed with five sixteenths to go and
weakened. COINMAKER was off a bit awkwardly, chased from midpack in the two path and gave way. CHEROKEE SUMMER was off a step slow, saved
ground at the rear and made little impact. BELMAR BEAUTY raced off of the pace in the three path and faded.

Footnotes
FIRST LOVE leaned out into open space at the start, set a clear pace a bit off of the rail around the turn, padded her margin well in hand through upper
stretch, but came under a drive in the final furlong while beginning to tire, yet lasted safely. CONTROLLED TEMPER bobbled outwardly and bumped a rival
leaving the gates, recovered and gain ground in the four path into and around the turn to reach place entering the lane, but leveled off in pursuit in
midstretch, yet gamely clung to place from bidders on either side in the closing stages. MISS TAPPY TONE broke a step slow, trailed in the three path,
moved out to the five path in upper stretch and rallied to miss place while gaining show at the wire. DULCIA tracked along the inside, sustained a chase to
vie for place with an outer rival leaving the sixteenth pole, but missed that position and got nailed for show. AMANDA'S CHALLENGE lacked speed along
the inside and failed to factor. THISONEISFORYOU made little impact from the two path. HURRICANE LASSIE took contact from an inner foe at the start,
stalked the clear leader from the three to two path, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GRABIQ was a bit restless in the starting gate before the off, then bumped with an inner rival multiple times in the opening stages, settled well back in the
two to three path around the first turn, inched closer in the five path around the far turn before tucking to the three path entering the lane, sustained progress
to surge between the leaders entering the final sixteenth and drew clear. SWEET ALEXIS raced forwardly inside of rivals early on, bumped with an outer
rival moving to the first turn before steadying hard when put to tight rail quarters entering that bend, recovered before checking again at the three quarter
pole, tracked down the backstretch, responded to urging to range up outside of the leading pair around the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, dueled through
the lane, but got outkicked by an outer oncharging foe leaving the sixteenth pole, edged place soon after and held that position. MO DIVA pursued from
midpack in the three to two paths, tipped to take aim outside of the leading trio entering the lane, but only managed to chase before getting outkicked by an
inner bidder entering the final sixteenth, kept on but missed reaching show. A MISS DEAMEANOR stalked in the four to three path moving forward around
the first turn, bid and dueled outside of the pace setter down the backstretch, sparred around the far turn as an outer foe joined the fray nearing the lane,
gamely battled with that one entering the lane and through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder leaving the sixteenth pole and gradually yielded.
TAP IRON FIST checked when put to tight quarters between horses soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. BETSY'S
ALL IN broke slowly, trailed in the four path early on then surpassed tired rivals. GOLDZONE showed the way around the first turn, dueled with an outer
bidder down the backstretch and around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. IN B. J.'S HONOR bumped with an inner rival approaching the first
turn, was taken in hand making contact with that one again entering that bend, stalked from the two to three path, chased floated four wide around the far
turn and weakened turning for home. DR. BOO bumped with an outer rival multiple times at the start, lacked speed along the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
BRIE'S MISSION settled off of the pace three wide and between horses, took the far turn in the four path, rallied shifting out to the six path in midstretch and
sustained progress to reel in the leader nearing the wire. GOTTA KEEP HIM tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair to take aim from the five
path in upper stretch, gained an advantage nearing the furlong grounds, led into deep stretch but was caught by an outer bidder nearing the wire and saved
place from inner foes. CATHY'S BOY broke a beat slow, saved ground well back, progressed inside of rivals turning for home, sustained a rail rally to
threaten the leader in the closing stages but missed. BY THE SWORD pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide tracking around the far turn,
altered course to the four path while among foes in midstretch, then stayed on between horses to miss in the photo for place. GHOST PRINCE laid off of the
pace along the inside before moving two wide and between horses around the first turn, pursued from the three path around the far turn, stayed on among
foes into the final furlong, but was blocked behind traffic entering the final sixteenth, then bumped with foes on both sides splitting them to reach a minor
share late. THEPLAINS MARSHALL prompted outside of the leader while well clear of the rest down the backstretch, bid in the three path entering the lane,
got outkicked by an outer bidder in midstretch and faded between horses nearing the final sixteenth. MAX IS G MONEY led from an outer presser, dug in
entering the lane in the two path, clung to an advantage before being bested by an wider bidder in midstretch, then weakened between horses at the
sixteenth pole. SAM'S PROMISE broke a step slow, lagged behind around both turns and failed to factor. STORM FORCE raced off of the pace four to five
wide and faded. MARYS WINE tracked two wide but faltered between horses around the far turn and was eased through the final furlong.

B FIFTY TWO settled off of the pace four wide, rallied along with an inner foe to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled with that one while shifting ground
inwardly and prevailed. PRACTICAL THOUGHT tracked three wide, bid along with an outer rival in midstretch, dueled with that one through the late stages
but got bested. SUMMER READY vied with an inner rival while in the three path, led into the turn, drew clear turning for home, but was bested by an outer
bidding pair at the furlong grounds and held show. ORIZZONTE stalked two wide and among rivals, chased aiming inside of the leaders in upper stretch,
checked subtly when put to tight quarters entering the final sixteenth, kept on but missed reaching show. MIDNIGHT AVENGER tracked along the inside,
got shuffled back behind a tiring foe turning for home, shifted to the four path into upper stretch, chased and ran on willingly. OATHBREAKER trailed along
the inside, shifted to the six path in midstretch and improved position. OUTWORKALLDAY steadied back at the start, raced off of the pace hung five wide
and made little impact. METRONOME vied along the inside into the turn, but weakened with five sixteenths to go.

Footnotes
WAY TO BE MARIE dictated terms via a loose margin down the backstretch, responded readily when shaken up in upper stretch, kicked away with good
energy and was put to hand with a sixteenth to go. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS brushed with an outer rival while in cramped quarters among foes early on,
pursued from midpack along the inside, aimed to split foes three wide in upper stretch, did so with a steady grind in the final furlong and edged place.
CANDY BAR stalked along the inside, vied for place into the final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead, but was outkicked by an outer bidder late and
saved show. SWEET ALYSSA bumped an outer rival soon after the start, stalked two wide without applying pressure, proved no match for the leader
entering the lane, vied for place with bidders on either side through midstretch, but was outkicked late and missed show. GENEROUS LOVER tracked three
wide, chased in the four path in upper stretch and yielded. COCOA ICING was bumped by an inner foe and checked back from tight quarters between
horses soon after the start, saved ground off of the pace, moved to the four path entering the lane, but was kept from tipping wider for clear sailing by an
outer foe through upper stretch, managed to shift to the six path at the furlong grounds, but lacked a rally. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE laid off of the pace two
wide, crept closer three to four wide around the far turn, floated to the five path entering the lane, lacked a rally hemming in an inner foe through upper
stretch, got floated to the seven path in midstretch and yielded. SPARTAN QUEEN was forced out by a rank inner rival entering the first turn, trailed in the
three path, improved saving ground around the far turn, shfited to the eight path in midstretch but failed to factor. TANGO ZULU was a bit keen towards the
rear between horses early on, then made little impact from the three path. URBAN FORCE was a bit restless in the starting gate, then brushed with an inner
rival while steadying out of crowded quarters among foes early on, got rank and bore out into the first turn, pursued from midpack in the five path, but
weakened into the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CLEAR AS A BELE was last away, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses early on, awaited racing room taking the turn in the two path, shifted
out five wide in midstretch, rallied to bid passing the sixteenth pole and drove past. KINGOFBROKENHEARTS dueled for the lead with an outer rival while
remaining a path off the inside around the turn, fought on as the battled continued well into the final furlong, but was outkicked by a wider bidder in the final
sixteenth and saved place. DOCTORED DEAL dueled for the lead with an inner rival while kept in the three path, wrestled a narrow advantage nearing the
lane, sparred as his inner counterpart grudgingly sustained the battle in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer bidder late and missed place.
MYGLORYBEE broke a step slow, tracked in the four path, chased within range through midstretch but was outkicked by a wider bidder at the sixteenth
pole, kept on but was denied reaching show. UP N GONE trailed in the three path, rallied along the inside in upper stretch, shifted out in the final furlong and
sustained progress between horses. IRON IN THE FIRE stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase through the lane and lacked a bid. SONO
stalked in the three path, chased between horses around the turn, pursued evenly into midstretch but tired late. JACK BOB AND LARRY lacked speed in
the three path, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. CHAD'S FLASH chased from off of the pace three wide, shifted to the five path
entering the lane and faded. ADIOS CARLOS lacked speed along the inside, weakened around the turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BLISSFUL broke through the gate pre-race, pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the clear
leader at the sixteenth pole and slowly edged past. SWOONATRA set a clear pace around both turns, held sway into the final furlong, but was collared at
the sixteenth pole, fought on but was bested. PAINT ME PERFECT trailed, moved out of last in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the seven path
entering upper stretch, rallied to take aim on the top pair in the final sixteenth but needed more late. SULTRY LASS got a bit antsy when an outer rival broke
through the gate pre-race, pursued from midpack along the inside, checked nearing the lane, moved out to the seven path in midstretch and moved up.
STORM BAY laid off of the pace two to three wide, shfited inwardly in midstretch and failed to menace. MORGS WORLD stalked the clear leader from the
three path and gave way. ELLE EST FORTE lacked speed two wide and between horses, saved ground around the far turn, but steadied entering the lane
and failed to factor. SHIRLEY'S TEMPLE lacked speed in the three to four path and failed to factor. PRINCESS FAWZIA stalked along the inside and faded
around the far turn. OUR DAVINA lacked speed inside and was done early.

Footnotes
RED IDOL set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and held sway. ONE MORE SLEEP
stalked in the three path, bid and vied two wide around the far turn, but was turned away and held place. BREAKING STAR laid off of the pace tucking from
the five to three path around the first turn, gained ground approaching the far turn in the four path, then chased the top pair in the lane, bid for place late but
hung. QUEENIE'S LEROY tracked along the inside, two wide and between horses into and around the far turn then, chased through the lane. RENATI
lacked speed two wide, advanced in the four to five path around the far turn, but leveled off. LAST OF THE PAST saved ground off of the pace, shifted to
the six path entering the lane, but saw his rider lose his crop in upper stretch and failed to menace. BIG TAP BABY broke through the gate pre-race, then
made little impact four wide. MEASURE OF FAITH prompted along the inside and weakened turning for home. MINE YOUR BIZ pursued four wide and
faded in the six path around the far turn. MUNCLE pursued along the inside and faded. WILD FIST lacked speed in the six path and never got involved.
JOEY'S FAST PLAY showed little.
