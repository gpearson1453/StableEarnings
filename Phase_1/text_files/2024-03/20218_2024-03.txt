DUKE OF DOOLY saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the far
turn, drifted in in upper stretch, bumped with SIR DANIEL at the sixteenth pole and held clear to the wire. SIR DANIEL saved ground early, raced off the
pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail coming around the turn, gained ground in the lane, raced into traffic and bumped with DUKE OF DULY
when that rival drifted over in late stretch and kept on from there to narrowly miss. SIR GOOSA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SEMINOLE AUSTIN

and passed tiring horses in the lane. HEZMORETHANREADY raced in the three path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued
around the second turn still in the three path and weakened in the stretch. GOOD BUMP saved ground around the first bend, tracked the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded from there. OUR DARK COURAGE raced in the two path around the first turn,

Footnotes
IT'S GRAVY bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far
turn and dug in gamely in the lane to just hold the win. TORO FORWARD raced in the two path early, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the far bend, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late, drifted in sharply in late stretch
and bumped soundly with both LAS OLAS and STORMY VICTORY and just miss. LAS OLAS saved ground around the first bend, chased the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and dueled to the finish, despite getting bumped hard by TORO FORWARD
near the wire and just missing. STORMY VICTORY raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
challenged from the two path coming around the far bend and dueled to the wire, getting bumped hard by TORO FORWARD in the final strides and
narrowly missing. PRALINE'S CAT bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the
outside coming up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and improved position in the stretch. HERE COMES BILLY
saved ground in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. LORD OF
THE NILE raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and faded in
the stretch. TIGERITO raced in the two path early, dueled between horses up the backstretch, came around the far bend still in the two path and tired from
there. ERUDITE raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far bend
and flattened out in the lane. DON'T BLAME FREDDY saved ground early, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and
was never a factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE TEN, STORMY VICTORY, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE FIVE, TORO FORWARD, CITING
INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS ALSO MADE. UPON REVIEW, HORSE FIVE, TORO FORWARD, WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
E MINOR saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around
the far turn and drew off in the lane. HUMBLE WARRIOR raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, swung out to
the five path coming around the far bend, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. BALLINDINE hopped up slightly leaving the gate,
saved ground around the first bend, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the four path and
improved position in the stretch. COMMANDER BIZ raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn still in the three path and kept on to the wire. JEBY raced in the five path around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack
on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground between
horses in tight quarters in upper stretch but was outkicked late. RANSEUR saved ground early, led the way up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the two path and weakened in the final furlong. MUSIC GEM saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. PHRASEOLOGISM raced in the three path around the first bend, trailed the field on
the outside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the four path and made no bid. MORETHANICANHANDLE raced in the two path around
the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path, raced in tight quarters in upper stretch and tired from
there. BAD HENRY raced at the back of the pack in the four path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path and was empty in
the stretch.
