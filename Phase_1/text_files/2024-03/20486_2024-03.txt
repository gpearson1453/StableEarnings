Footnotes
XCELLENT MEN broke in and bumped HOLONUI at the start, tracked the pace from between rivals, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole and
kicked clear leaving the three sixteenths, then remained clear to prove best, driving. I CAN SEE THAT was bumped at the start, reserved early, two wide on
the turn, split rivals at the three sixteenths and finished well. JAY was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was blocked leaving the turn to the furlong
marker, angled off the inside for racing room and then rallied well late. RADAR ALERT tracked the pace on the inside, shifted out leaving the quarter pole
into the path of HOLONUI and then shifted back in, then had no kick. HOLONUI chased the early pace, three wide by the quarter pole then was cut off and
had to check hard leaving the turn and then shifted to the outside and had no rally. BOLD TALK was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear,
then weakened in the lane. COZY NOTION tracked the pace from the outside, made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole then was empty in the drive.
THE JOCKEY AND TRAINER OF HOLONUI CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST RADAR ALERT FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE QUARTER POLE, ALSO
JOCKEY OBJECTION I CAN SEE THAT AGAINST XCELLENT MEN FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE, AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEW
THE TRAINERS AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION WAS ALLOWED AND HOLONUI WAS PLACED FOURTH, BUT THE OTHER OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED AND THE RACE WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
PETINGAS TWIN was away alertly and showed good speed on the inside, rated back and let IRISH HERO clear and cross over to the inside, shifted out for
aim leaving the five sixteenths, made a bid off the turn and drew off to proved much the best under left handed crop urging. IRISH HERO vied for the early
lead two wide, then went ahead and cleared and dropped to the inside entering the turn, then was headed leaving teh turn and proved to be no match for
the winner while clearly second best. DATS MY PHARAOH stumbled at the start, settled into stride, saved ground on the turn and cut the corner and bested
the rest. UNIWINNER was reserved early, two wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and improved position. SAIL ON HOME chased the early pace and
was three to two wide on the turn and weakened. BAD ADVICE was settled back, three wide on the turn and came five wide off the turn and had no rally.
BIG TONE C was settled back on the inside and was not a threat.

Footnotes
BLACK ICE set a pressured pace on the inside, came two wide off the turn and dug in gamely in the final furlong to hold on under a drive. GINGER GIRL
tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn and dueled to the wire but missed. BABY SOX steadied off of a rival's heels leaving the chute,
regrouped then advanced two wide on the turn and came three wide off the turn, then was blocked nearing the furlong marker, angled out for racing room
and closed well late. LOVELY LIZA tracked the pace on the inside, then stayed on the inside leaving the turn but lacked the needed winning bid, no kick.
ALWAYS FORWARD was taken back early and dropped to the the inside, then eased off the inside nearing the bend and came five wide off the turn and
had a late rally. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA pressed the pace and made a two wide bid off the turn but faded in the final furlong. GWYNEDD was settled on the
inside and weakened.

Footnotes
MATTITUDE prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid off the turn to be clear by the furlong marker, then widened the margin nearing the sicteenth
marker and then was kept safe late to prove best, driving. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH was rated along the inside, cut the corner off the turn and then closed well
late. SHERO was off slowly, trailed on the turn and came four wide off the turn, then angled out to the far outside and rallied well. MOONSAFE was
reserved early, saved ground on the turn, tipped out two wide leaving the turn and finished well. SPEAK YOUR MIND set the pace on the inside and was
headed off the turn and faded the final furlong. PROPER ATTIRE was settled early, made a five wide move by the quarter pole but flattened out late. MAMA
G'S WISH chased the pace and was three to four wide on the tur n, between rivals leaving the quarter pole and weakened. SPICY MARGARITA chased the
pace on the inside, came three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
LADY ZETA was away alertly to set a pressured pace two wide by the half mile marker, then shook clear on the turn, then widened the margin in the lane to
prove much the best under mild crop urging. FUHGEDDABOUDIT pressed the pace on the inside, then tracked the winner on the turn, eased out and came
three wide into the lane but proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award. BOURBON WILDCAT chased the pace along the inside,
ridden along on the turn and finished willingly to just miss the place award. BOUND BY DESTINY was settled early, four wide by the quarter pole but had no
rally. GOLDEN EFFECT, rank in close quarters soon after the break, raced inside and was no threat.. BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES stalked the pace three
wide and stopped.
