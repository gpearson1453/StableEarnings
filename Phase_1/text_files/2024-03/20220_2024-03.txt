Footnotes
MITOLE'S GIRL showed early speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, came out slightly and jostled
mildly with an opponent near the three-eighths pole, responded well under pressure into upper stretch, shook off foes into the final furlong and prevailed
under strong handling. LUNA PATINA was urged along on the far outside, chased five wide on the turn, was jostled lightly near the three-eighths pole, came
seven wide into the stretch under a drive, remained on her inside lead while in pursuit of the winner, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with
good courage for the place. BETTER BE SMART chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, kept on in pursuit of the
winner in the stretch and willingly earned the show. MARY UNION AVE was sent hard from the gate, contested the pace on the outside, was urged in the
three path on the turn, jostled lightly with foes near the three-eighths pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished. TOP OF THE
TABLE ducked in just after the start then steadied while the rider corrected and dropped back, climbed greenly while angling out and losing more ground at
the rear, drifted out while tossing her head high in the air nearing the five-eighths pole, fell well behind the rest of the field, went two to three wide on the
turn, came five wide into upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and finished well while reaching her best stride too late. SPIRIT OF ESTHER
stumbled some while breaking awkwardly but with the field, chased the pace, went four wide on the turn, jostled mildly with foes near the three-eighths pole,
dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead near the sixteenth-pole and tired.

Footnotes
CHEEKY TICO raced forwardly placed along the inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch, continued three wide in pursuit
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went nine wide into upper stretch, drifted out three to four paths straightened away, dug in
under a drive rallying to collar the leader in the final jumps to the finish. APOLLO RISING two to three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the
inside down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
a furlong out, dug in under threat and was caught in the last strides to the wire. MEMPHIS three wide through the first turn, chased four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. MODERN ERA coaxed from the gate, grew detached at the tail of the field just off the inside through the first turn when devoid of
speed, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. MASTERWORK three then two wide through the first turn,
showed the way in hand three paths off the rail down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
JAY'S LOVE checked while pinched back between horses at the start and dropped back, spotted the front several lengths, settled at the rear under some
urging, moved out with about five furlongs to run, went six then seven wide on the turn, rallied eight wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths and proved best under a solid hand-ride to the finish. ACCELERINA chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path,
made a bid while drifting out under a drive in upper stretch, battled inside the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished but willingly earned the place.
MONTAUK MYSTIQUE bumped with a rival at the start then steadied while in tight quarters, angled in early then settled off the pace, went four wide under
urging for most of the turn then shifted to the six path, came seven wide into the stretch, bumped with a rival near the three-sixteenths pole and also finished
willingly but missed the place while clear for the show. DRAMATIC EFFECT came in then bumped with a foe at the start, chased the pace on the outside
then in the five path on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, bumped with a foe near the three-sixteenths then was jostled in the hindquarters by
another rival and tired. DEBBIE DARLING went to the front, showed the way while off the inside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage in
upper stretch and gave way. MY GORGEOUS chased the pace on the outside of the leader, went around the turn in the four path, drifted out in upper
stretch then jostled with the hindquarters of an opponent and capitulated.

GUT FEELING was coaxed along while off the early pace, moved up inside the three-quarter pole, made a bid with five furlongs to run, vied inside of foes
while in the two path for most of the turn, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch then drifted out, dueled with the
runner-up in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. GOLDINI was hustled from the gate, moved out while coaxed along, made a bid with five furlongs to run,
vied in the four path for most of the turn then moved to the five path, came six wide into the stretch then was carried out, dueled outside of the winner in the
final furlong and missed while able to get the place. CO CONSPIRATOR pressed the pace on the inside of the leader while well off the inside, raced
between horses starting about the five-eighths pole, vied in the three path while between horses early on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths
then moved to the four path, dropped back into upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and willingly earned the show. PIT BOSS was fractious in the gate,
went to the front, showed the way on the outside, vied in the five path for a majority of the turn then moved to the six path, lost the advantage under a drive
in upper stretch and tired. PRINCE OF JOY was urged along off the pace, chased while moving from the three path to the five path on the turn, angled in
near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. FULL MOON FEVER was urged early then tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back five
then six wide on the turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left. NOBODYRIDESFORFREE was urged along at the rear, angled in near the
three-quarter pole, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

JODY'S PRIDE stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three then four path on the turn, reached even terms for the
lead while six wide into upper stretch, took over inside the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth then moved clear under
strong urging to prove best. CARMELINA broke out then was corrected by the rider, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside of a foe while in the two then three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, lost the advantage near the three-sixteenths,
fought on well into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while clear for the place. GIN GIN moved out early then settled between horses, was urged three
wide on the turn, came out six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. AOIFE'S MAGIC was coaxed along off
the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to rally. REGULATORY RISK was well placed towards the
front, angled from the inside to the four path while dropping back some on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SICILIAN
PRINCESS broke a bit awkwardly and was last away, angled out early, was urged along on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then moved to the
six path and failed to respond. PRINCESS MAYFAIR broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, tracked the pace on the
inside of a foe, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from three to five wide on the turn and capitulated.

SUPER CHOW was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted
out significantly in the final furlong and held under steady urging. MANNY WAH was urged along off the pace, chased in the four path on the turn, was
driven seven wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive, had that foe drift in front but with clearance near the sixteenth-pole and willingly secured
the place. STAGE LEFT broke in at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick while able to get the show. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA was a bit reluctant to load, broke in the air and was off slow, spotted the front a few
lengths, settled at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN
showed speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
ROTKNEE disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and tired. LISTENTOYOURHEART chased

Footnotes
DETERMINISTIC four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled ten wide into upper stretch among a
quartet, rallied with good energy inside the eighth pole to collar the leader just outside the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. JUST A
TOUCH seven paths off the inside in pursuit in aim of the leader, tucked six wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went ten to
eleven paths off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly to get up for the place honors in the final jumps to the finish. EL GRANDE
O prompted the leader from the outside six then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, seized command at the quarter pole and went ten
wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat inching away to the eighth pole, got collared just outside the sixteenth pole and kept on to preserve the show
honors clear of the rest. MAXIMUS MERIDIUS broke in at the start and was corrected, advanced inside to take over the front and showed the way five then
four paths off the rail under pressure from the aforementioned foe to his outside, came under coaxing midway on the turn as the pressure intensified, angled
nine wide into upper stretch displaced from the front, dug in prominent to the furlong grounds, then weakened in the late stages. CAPITAL IDEA chased
nine paths off the inside down the backstretch and then six wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch
and stayed on one paced to the finish. DEPOSITION chased five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. LIGHTLINE chased seven to eight wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped eight to
nine wide at the head of the stretch, tired. BERGEN six paths off the inside in pursuit from mid pack down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the
turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. ELIMINATE chased seven to eight paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked to the two path placed to coaxing at the half mile pole and was ridden along through the turn, swung three wide at the top of
the stretch, then tired in the drive. FACENDA got forced to steady at the start when appearing to be pinched out, grew detached quickly at the tail of the field
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, continued three wide into upper stretch well behind and was unable to
make an impact. AIR CAV chased five then six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went nine to ten wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased
home to the finish.
