Footnotes
PROPRIETARY TRADE got bumped in the hind end by LASER SHARP due to pressure from the breaking in TWO TONS OF FUN, came under coaxing
and established the front, showed the way in hand four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, remained
patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to inside the eighth pole, then got geared down inside the
final sixteenth to the finish. LASER SHARP got bumped at the start by TWO TONS OF FUN and in turn bumped PROPRIETARY TRADE, chased four then
two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one and ran on clear of the rest to be
second best. ROMANTIC CHARMER chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened. TWO TONS OF FUN broke in at the start bumping LASER SHARP into PROPRIETARY
TRADE, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. ALEAH ALEAH chased three then two wide, came under coaxing along the inside at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COLLECT DATTT showed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for her best
in upper stretch, came out a path near the sixteenth-pole and held gamely under strong urging. VOLEUSE was urged along off the pace, went three early on
the turn, jostled with a foe near the three-eighths pole, moved to the four path later on that bend, gained to make a bid nearing the eighth-pole, battled
outside the winner in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. FRANNIE LEW stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn,
chased into upper stretch then made a bid, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened while able to hold the show. ROMAN GODDESS was
hustled from the gate, chased the pace, raced inside early on the turn, came out some and brushed with a foe near the three-eighths pole, moved to the two
path later on the bend, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead until outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper
lead and lacked the needed response. STOP GIGGLING bobbled at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied inside
while asked on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. TAKE TIME TO DREAM was urged along near the back, raced between horses in the
two path early on the turn, jostled with foes near the three-eighths pole then moved to the three path later on the bend, shifted five wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was hustled from the gate then urged at the rear, saved ground early on the turn, was roused for more near the
five-sixteenths then moved to the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
RETAIL MAN was reluctant to load, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead just
inside the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear while dropping to the two path into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady
urging. MASTER FREUD broke awkwardly and was last away but broke with the rest of the field, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn,
loomed a threat while chasing the winner on the outside into the final furlong but failed to overtake that foe while well clear for the place. COMPUTE IT
chased the pace on the inside of a foe, moved in late on the backstretch, hit the rail into the far turn then dropped back, saved ground on that bend, shifted
to the three path into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. UPTOMYKNEESINIT settled at the rear, tossed his head briefly
outside the five-eighths pole, tossed his head again outside the quarter-pole and was steadied, checked while throwing his head yet again into the turn,
shifted from the two path to the five path on that bend and failed to respond. SOLO EMPIRE was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
vied inside of a rival while in the two path for most of the turn, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths pole, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole and
tired.

Footnotes
STRESS RELIEVER dueled early on with CALLING AN AUDIBLE before establishing sole command three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path into the turn and came under intensified pressure from the runner up through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide into upper stretch on near even terms, dug in under a drive dueling through the length of the stretch and was slightly headed a sixteenth out but fought
on to get the nod on the wire. CALLING AN AUDIBLE coaxed from the gate, dueled early on from the five path before easing off to prompt the
aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced to intensify the pressure through the bend under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch getting on near even terms, dug in dueling through the length of the drive in game fashion but lost the bob
on the line. APOLLONIA C chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. TURNUPTHEMUSIC chased four then two wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. CALL HER BLUFF got bumped at the start by ADDAGIRL ADDIE, who broke
inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. ADDAGIRL ADDIE tossed her
head a bit before the start and broke in at the break bumping CALL HER BLUFF, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths drifting
out slightly and was four to five wide midway on the turn, tucked back to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

SWIFTSURE went to the front, showed the way on the inside of foes, moved to a solo lead near the nine-sixteenths, was asked in the two path on the turn,
responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. NOVA RAGS prompted the pace on the outside, was
asked leaving the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able
to hold the place. WINIT was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. STOLEN BASE settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the
turn and lacked the needed response. SYNTHESIS raced up close on the outside, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, went four then five
wide on the turn and came up empty.

FRAU DIABLO broke in at the start bumping TIMELY CONQUEST solidly into TRIPLE P, pinching that foe back against VIRTUAL REALITY, established
the front and showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. VIRTUAL REALITY
got bumped at the start in a chain of bumps begun by FRAU DIABLO breaking inwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MONGOLIAN PANTHER four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. VIENNA CODE
chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide
into upper stretch and weakened. TIMELY CONQUEST got bumped solidly at the start by FRAU DIABLO and in turn bumped and pinched back TRIPLE P

Footnotes
BAR FOURTEEN went to the front, was well rated while showing the way, came under urging in the two path on the turn, responded well under steady
urging in the stretch and drew off to prove much the best. KHAFRE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the
three path on the turn and earned the place while no match for the winner. FIRST GLIMPSE settled between horses, was jostled repeatedly by an erratic
DADDY KNOWS outside the five-eighths pole then dropped back, saved ground on the turn and missed the place while clear for the show. BOURBON
CALLING was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. DADDY KNOWS was hustled from the gate, lugged
out some while racing erratically early, jostled repeatedly with FIRST GLIMPSE while continuing to get out inside that foe outside the five-eighths pole, bore
out to the outside of the field near the nine-sixteenths, went six wide on the turn and had nothing left. MAJESTIC EAGLE was forwardly placed on the
outside, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and faltered.
