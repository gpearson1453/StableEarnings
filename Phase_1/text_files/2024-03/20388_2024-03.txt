Footnotes
AA TAKE A CHANCE tracked the pace from the two path, then menaced leaving the turn to battle between rivals for the lead in the early stretch, shook
clear and held sway in the late stretch to prevail in the end. RB MOTHERLOAD chased the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn to vie with inner
rivals at the quarter marker, was out kicked by an inner rival and kept on for second place while drifting out in the late stretch. KISSOUUR was unhurried
early, was well rated before advancing on the turn and continued to gain ground down the lane and just missed the place in the end. WMA BANDANA raced
swiftly along the inside to gain second position on the turn under a gamely rally, took command briefly then was overpowered by outer foes heading into the
stretch and gave way in the stretch. WMA OLIVER was allowed to settle along the inside, then made a mild bid leaving the turn while two wide but it was too
little too late. RB MUNCHIE showed the way from the inside, maintained the lead at the top of the turn before being over taken by outer rivals at the quarter
pole and faltered in the stretch. KD DERBY GIRL bid from the inside towards the back of the pack in the early furlongs then stopped on the turn and had no
final bid. WMA BADGE raced from the inside and was no menace.

Footnotes
BASKET CASE tracked the pace while two wide heading into the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn from the three path, dug in gamely mid stretch
to edge past inner rivals and be up in the final strides. RIOBELLA exchanged the lead with an outer rival into the first turn and into the early stretch, was in a
long drive, drifted in towards the rail in the final furlong and was out finished in the end. SAN MATEO KAT raced in the middle of the field from the inside
under a steady drive throughout the first three quarters then menaced leaving the far turn, met traffic in the late stretch and kept on for third place.
CLAUDETTE HEIR dueled with an inner rival throughout the early furlongs, continued to spar for the lead heading into the home stretch, then was over
powered by rivals on both sides and gave way in the end. OUR AMEN tracked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then settled back on the far
turn, re rallied in the upper stretch along the rail, then steadied in the final furlong, avoiding rival and lost stride. POETIC UNION was allowed to settle while
two wide, bid three to four wide on the far turn and made no impact in the end. HOURGLASS FIGURE broke outwardly, brushing foe then raced at the back
of the pack and came up empty in the end. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to disruption in the late stretch. After reviewing the replay,
RIOBELLA was disqualified from second place and placed fifth for causing interference.

maintained the second position throughout the turn, rallied in the early stretch, lacked the winning bid and held onto the place prize in end. SOARING BIRD

BANKER stalked the pace from the inside under a steady drive, then rallied leaving the turn and dueled for the place prize in the late stretch before giving
way in the end. MALIBU S S was unhurried early, came out seven wide leaving the turn and bid mildly in the lane coming up empty in the end. SOUL
SACRIFICE bumped rival, then raced towards the back of the pack while four wide, urged steadily on the turn to dig in at the quarter pole and came up
evenly in the end. REBEL EMPIRE chased the pace while two wide, was in a mild drive throughout the turn and needed more in the stretch. DRIVEHAPPY
bumped rival then chased the pace from the inside, faded on the turn and showed little in the end. NAUTICAL MOON raced towards the back pf the back
while five wide, then bid on the turn but did not spark in the lane.

Footnotes
SPOILER was nicely rated while tracking the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters, then dug in gamely leaving the far turn and edged
clear in the late stretch to prevail in the end. MOON CAT was allowed to settle along the inside and towards the back of the pack in the early furlongs, then
bid on the far turn while coming out four wide, rallied and found the best stride in late stretch and kept on for the place prize. FROM THE HEART was
unhurried early, then saved ground down the backstretch while racing behind the field, bid on the far turn to split rivals in the upper stretch and closed
willingly in the end. COUNTRY CAPER was allowed to settle while two wide and outside a rival down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn while coming
out to the five path then closed well in the late stretch. WILTON was allowed to settled along the inside towards the back of the field in the early furlongs,
then moved up on the far turn while five to six wide and closed well but it was too late in the end. GAMETIME GLADIATOR chased the pace from the two
path under a steady drive down the backstretch and into the far turn, angled inside and to bid briefly then gave way in the end. COWBOY RIDGE set the
pace from the inside heading into the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn then faltered in the home stretch. BIG WAVE JAMES tracked the pace
while two wide at a moderate pace throughout the majority of the course then flattened out in the home stretch. BLOCKED chased the pace from the inside
at an evenly pace throughout and lacked rallying in the late stretch. MAN IN THE MIDDLE chased the pace while three wide and under a strong drive, then
flattened out on the far turn.
