Footnotes
QUIET WISDOM broke very alertly then was coaxed to show speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path early on the turn, took the lead
with three furlongs to run, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, came out into upper stretch, drew off under a solid hand-ride while flagged with the crop
into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. JUDGE RULES broke in at the start, settled off the pace, was hard ridden while two then
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. DILLON tracked the early pace on the
outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, dropped back while three to four wide on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend and came
up empty while best of the rest. MAMA'S DREAM hit the outside of the gate then was hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail
on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths pole, dropped back approaching the quarter-pole, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and tired. MALIBU
MARGARITA broke a step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, went four to five wide while dropping back on the turn and failed to respond.

final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. WAR CHROME was last to commence, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on
the turn, rallied approaching the quarter-pole, gained to take the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while well
clear for the show. FLYING IN STYLE was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. THE

Footnotes
OCEAN GATEWAY prompted the leader from the outside six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, advanced on
the leader to take command swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. GRACEFUL ROSE coaxed from the gate, chased
five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. IRISH JACKSON seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the
turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages.
MISS FASHIONISTA coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and was one paced through to the finish. ANILEATE chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went seven wide into upper stretch, offered no response. ARGENTINA GIRL hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down
the backstretch under pressure from OCEAN GATEWAY to the outside, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under intensified pressure to the
outside, yielded the front and spun three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. MISS KRISTY coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the half mile pole, went three to four wide into upper stretch well behind, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY broke in and hit the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole,
responded well when put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady
urging. TOUGH STREET dropped back early then settled off the pace, moved closer while urged in the three path for most of the turn, was driven four wide
outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the stretch, gained in the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the place. TOWHEAD was urged along
while contesting the pace between horses, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired while just able to get the show. COPPA
GIRL threw her head at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. CRYPTO
MAMA bobbled at the start and was off a step slow, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the four path for most of the turn then moved to the five path
outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. SPIKED broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back
around and reloaded, settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STRATEGIC DECISION got bumped at the start by APURO, who broke inwards, established the front narrowly and showed the way two to three wide down
the backstretch, got headed for the front briefly near the half mile pole, advanced between foes to take back narrow command at the seven-sixteenths, vied
from the two path through the turn patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch displaced by
ALLEGRINI, dug in under a drive to take over just outside the eighth pole, came under late threat from a pair of rivals and had the rider go to a left handed
crop inside the final forty yards, came out and bumped DON VINO VICI forcing that rival to pause between foes while in turn bumping INDIANQUEST to that
foe's outside askew and just held on to prevail by a neck. INDIANQUEST seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, came under a right handed crop and leaned in brushing and bumping
DON VINO VICI with three-sixteenths to go, rallied in tandem with that foe to issue a challenge a sixteenth from home, dug in and was bumped askew late
when the aforementioned foe came out under a left handed crop and just missed at the end. DON VINO VICI broke out at the start and was corrected,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, got bumped by INDIANQUEST with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under a drive rallying in concert with that foe to his outside to engage the
leader in the final sixteenth, dug in between foes, then got bumped and forced to pause in the final jumps to the finish when STRATEGIC DECISION came
out under a left handed crop and missed at the end. ALLEGRINI hustled from the gate, prompted the pace along the inside before advancing to take
command near the half mile pole, vied inside a pair of rivals through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole for the final time and weakened in the late stages. APURO broke in at the start
bumping STRATEGIC DECISION, raced five wide in aim of that rival applying pressure down the backstretch before advancing to vie three wide outside a
pair through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four wide at the head of the stretch, weakened in the late going. UNCLE EDDIE chased
six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper
stretch, weakened. CROWN THAT SAINT chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch, briefly tucked four wide at the half mile pole before going
three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide at the top of the stretch, weakened in the drive. NICOLE'S
KING chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. CONFLICTED
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered. There was a Jockey'
Objection by the rider of DON VINO VICI alleging interference against STRATEGIC DECISION as well as a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the first three
finishers. After review, it was deemed that STRATEGIC DECISION had interfered with DON VINO VICI and STRATEGIC DECISION was disqualified from
first and placed third prior to the result being declared official.
