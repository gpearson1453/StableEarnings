Footnotes
REBEL WARRIOR set the early pace while clear and then widened the margin by the quarter pole and then drew off under right handed crop urging to
prove much the best. BAG OF GOLD chased the early pace on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied well for the place award while no
match for the winner. RIGATONI ALA VODKA was out sprinted early, saved ground on the turn and had a belated rally to gain the show award late. COXZY
broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, then shifted out and advanced four wide and then three wide on the turn but came up empty in the final
furlong, lost show award late. SHELTRFROMTHESTORM was bumped at the start, then settled early on the inside, came three wide into the lane and had
no rally. WARRIOR AT BAT stalked the pace two wide and weakened. LUCCA'S LEGACY chased the early pace four wide and then stopped.

WICKED STREET set the pace while in the two path, drew clear on the turn and then drifted slightly through the lane while well clear and was ridden out to
prove much the best. MRS BELL was settled early on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied well to be clearly second best. BABY FADE
prompted the early pace three wide and then chased the winner off the turn and faded, held show award. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE was off a step slow,
then moved up and dropped to the inside to chase the winner on the turn and faded. TESTED POSITIVE was settled back early, came six wide into the lane
and had a belated rally. ORBALINE chased the pace four wide and weakened in the drive. LA LIMA was settled early, three wide on the turn and had no
rally. KASHAN lunged at the start and never factored. DREAM MUSIC failed to menace.

PAULA'S SURPRISE was away alertly and crossed over to the inside to set the pace while clear, then was sent down off the turn and held well to prove
best, driving. OVERMUCH was between rivals on the first turn, then steadied nearing the eleven sixteenths, shifted out and advanced four wide, made a
three wide bid on the turn, then continued willingly in the lane but could not get to the winner. PHABULOUS PHOEBE was four wide into the first turn, then
shifted in, then advanced two wide on the far turn, then shifted out and came four wide off the turn and had no late kick. FAYTASTIC stalked the early pace
three wide, then was two wide and dropped to the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. LADY AHAVA chased the early pace on the inside and tired.

WINDSOR GOLD was five wide into the first turn, pressed the pace from the outside, made a four wide bid on the far turn and then dueled for command to
the outside of TIME TO CRUISE, then had a long drive with that rival and prevailed late in a game score. TIME TO CRUISE vied for the lead in between
rivals, then made a bid and dueled with the winner by the quarter pole, then was out-kicked to just miss in a gutsy try. HOUGHTON SHUFFLE was rated
along three to four wide, then made a five wide bid off the turn but flattened out in the final furlong, won battle for the show award. WILD VINE tracked the
early pace two wide and then on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn but lacked the needed kick while just missing the show award. RON DON
SCORESE was settled early from between rivals, shuffled back on the far turn, swung wide for racing room leaving the turn and had a belated rally.
BESTSUGARDADDYEVER was reserved early three wide, then moved up on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, drifted in by the furlong marker
and had no rally. CLASSIC UNION vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. JAYJAYDEE was rated along the inside and tired. LINGFIELD

RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY was five wide into the first turn, then rated along the outside, made a five wide bid on the turn and then slowly edged clear in the lane
to prove best under a drive. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE set the pace on the inside and then was headed on the turn and then dug in gamely in the lane but
could not hold off the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. P JS SILVER DUKE was taken back early, six wide by the quarter pole, came wide
into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. HANALEI'S HOUDINI was reserved early, advanced three to four wide on the far turn and had a
mild late rally and missed the show award. MIDNIGHT ACT stalked the pace and made a three to four wide bid on the far turn in between rivals but
weakened. I AM THAT I AM was five wide into the first turn, angled in and then chased the pace on the inside and lacked the needed bid. REDEEM EDDIE
was off slowly, then saved ground and was not a threat. CARGO SHIP stalked the pace two to three wide and made a mild bid on the far turn then tired.
MOJOVATION was off a step slow and failed to menace.

held off a gaining CAMELLA ROD late to prove best, driving. CAMELIA ROD chased the early pace two wide, then saved ground on the turn, made a inside
bid leaving the turn and ran on to the wire but was out-kicked by the winner. DISCO DAISY set the early pace while clear on the inside, then came two wide
off the turn and faded late, bested rest. ROSES ARE FREE stalked the early pace three wide, then was bewteen rivals on the turn and came four wide off
