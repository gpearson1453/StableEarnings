Footnotes
CURLY ESA settled off the leading pair stalking in behind, switched out and advanced four wide on the turn and asked for more coming to the quarter pole,
took a narrow lead in upper stretch, forged clear under steady handling. CONRADO attended the pace pressing the leader to the turn, went three wide on
that bend taking a narrow brief lead coming to the top of the stretch, proved no match for the winner but second best. I'M NOBLE was urged at the break,
soon made the lead, set the pace inside on or just off the rail with outside pressure, weakened in the stretch. ESPE'S GUY stalked from outside racing
mostly four wide on the turn, failed to rally. GREENBRIER was encouraged along inside but failed to rally.

Footnotes
LOUDMOUTHSOUP advanced between foes heading to the turn, put to a drive past the five-sixteenths, was getting out late on the turn drifting numerous
paths into upper stretch, straightened out for the drive, struck the lead about mid-stretch and kicked clear. BEAU MISCHIEF bobbled outwardly at the start,
settled off the early leaders, took closer order on the turn racing off the inside, came out seven to eight wide turning into upper stretch, kept on late to secure
the place. BAYOU CHROME tracked from inside not too far off the leaders, switched out at the top of the stretch, went evenly late and was outfinished for
place. TEAGANS ATM soon led, set the pace from off the rail with mild early outside pressure, edged clear late up the backstretch, was challenged turning
for home while drifting out a bit, lacked the needed late kick. HUNTER JUMPER chased from outside going five to seven wide, shifted in a bit in upper
stretch, failed to rally. PRINCE OTTO was guided out off the rail in the early going bringing up the rear, went in the five to six path on the turn swinging eight
to nine deep for the stretch run, failed to menace. IMPASSIONED CLAIM pressed just briefly in the early going from outside, dropped back, failed to rally.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS RYDER switched out heading up the backstretch settling off the leaders, advanced five wide coming to the quarter pole, drifted about eight
wide past that marker, straightened out for the drive, struck the lead in mid-stretch and drew clear. RANGER JOE moved forward inside the early leader but
off the fence to force the pace, kept on in the stretch but needed more. DELTA DELTA tracked in behind near the rail, came out a bit nearing the furlong
grounds, kept on but needed more. STREETLIGHT PEOPLE stalked the leaders, bid four to six wide coming to the quarter pole in contention, evened out in
the stretch. STREET MINISTER had the early lead then continued to press in the early going racing outside the pacesetter, dropped back and faded.
POBRECITO tossed the rider heading to the gate, was a bit fractious in the gate, refused to break properly when the gate opened and lost the rider, walked
off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED ALL RUNNERS HAD A FAIR BEGINNING AND THE RESULTS TO
STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
LADY MARY LOU was urged at the break but lacking speed, came out a bit on the far turn, was four wide at the top of the stretch, split foes and kicked
clear. ETHAN'S GIRL pressed the pace from outside three to four wide, took a narrow lead about three furlongs out, was outkicked. SAILING AWAY set the
pace from off the rail, faced outside pressure, was overtaken, angled out six wide nearing mid-stretch, kept on. LUPITA settled off the pace racing two to
three deep, moved out seven to eight wide in upper stretch as inside rivals came out, ran on. CLUBHOUSE DRAMA pursued from outside racing mostly
four to five wide, needed more. GETAWAY DAY was taken back heading into the first turn settling off the pace and outside three to four wide, was carried
nine deep in upper stretch, ran on. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF LUPITA AGAINST SAILING AWAY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE
IN THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SUBSIDIZE got away alertly, set the pace racing well off the rail, was asked for run in upper stretch and responded by quickly drawing away before being
geared down late. BEL RAGAZZO was taken back early settling off the pace and outside, advanced around foes five wide on the far turn floating seven
deep turning for home, was clearly no match for the winner but secured the place. MONGOLIAN MOON stalked mid-division racing mostly four to five wide,
needed more late. MY CALL pressed the eventual winner racing mostly four to five wide, asked to keep pace nearing the quarter pole but could not, steadily
weakened. MY DAD IS THIRSTY broke a bit slowly and was subsequently strongly urged, raced mostly just off the rail toward the rear, failed to menace.

Footnotes
HIGH GUNNER stalked mid-division, was given encouragement from the three-eighths, had aim in upper stretch and after a long drive surged past late.
COCKTAIL PRINCESS attended the pace from outside, moved to a narrow lead outside the seven-sixteenths, moved clear willingly by the midpoint of the
turn, was still clear when encouraged by upper stretch, kept busy and desperately tried to hold on but was caught. KO OLINA moved through inside the
runner-up to soon take the lead, set the pace from off the rail with outside pressure by the aforementioned, weakened. HERSABIGGIRL moved out in the
early going, came into upper stretch five wide, failed to menace. TRULY A MESS shifted in early, saved ground on the turn encouraged along near the rail,
came out for the drive, was not a threat. FOREST ACCLAMATION broke quite awkwardly, raced near the inside mostly, was not a threat.
