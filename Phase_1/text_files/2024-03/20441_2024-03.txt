Footnotes
PHILBIN ROAD circled horses on the turn, was wide entering the stretch, closed nicely outside rivals, led late and drove clear. NORTHERN COCKTAIL
chased the pace outside horses, gained a wide lead turning for home and weakened late. RANTANEN , a forward factor inside horses, chased the pace and
finished evenly along the inner rail. ROYAL CANDY sped to the early lead, stayed well off the inner rail through out and weakened the final sixteenth of a
mile. ROMEO'S GLORY , wide leaving the turn, passed tired horses. HERMISTON bobbled at the break, worked between horses most of the trip and
flattened out. MONGOLIAN MASTER , steadied when squeezed back soon after the break, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch
and finished with interest. PIRATE MISCHIEF chased the pace inside horses to the stretch, swung out in upper stretch and gave way. PER RULING
ECM2024-121 FROM HIWU, RANTANEN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

CORN POP , wide around the turn, swept to command in upper stretch, drifted in and drew out under steady handling. YOU ENJOY MYSELF lacked speed,
swung to the seven path straightening out for the drive and rallied outside foes. COLLECT DIS MONEY , wide on the turn, floated five wide at the head of
the stretch then flattened out. QUEENS EFFORT advanced in the four path between horses turning for home, was bumped by DRISKILL when that one was
forced out in upper stretch then flattened out. PLAY CHICKEN , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, impeded DRISKILL when drifting out in upper
stretch then weakened. DRISKILL gained a three wide lead mid way on the turn then was checked and forced out when shut off by PLAY CHICKEN in
upper stretch. MIGHTY TIGER , sent to the early lead, raced along the inner rail and gave way in the drive. Following a stewards' inquiry, PLAY CHICKEN
was disqualified and placed sixth for interference in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TOP OF MY GAME chased the early pace, raced in the four path between horses leaving the turn, gained command in upper stretch and drew out while
kept to his business. FAR BEYOND took a five deep lead mid way on the turn, finished willingly but was second best. REPLETE raced near the inner rail
leaving the turn and in the stretch and rallied. BERNALINHO chased the pace, was very wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT
broke sluggishly, swung very wide for the drive and passed tired rivals. BOSS NINE sprinted to the early lead, was kept well off the rail down the
backstretch, raced in the two path inside horses on the turn and gave way. HIJO GALANTE was no factor inside rivals. WESTWARD LOOK prompted the
pace racing in the three path between horses on the turn and gave way. MY DAD IS THIRSTY stumbled at the break and was outrun. ARIZONA JEREMY ,
wide, gave way.

the far turn, swept to command in upper stretch and drew off under steady handling. FOUND MY BALL sprinted clear soon after the break and was steered
to the inner rail, set the pace to the stretch, weakened and held the place. DISCRETIONARY DAY chased the pace outside FOUND MY BALL and
weakened in the stretch. TEXTHELEGEND , along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch and finished willingly. I AM
FREAKY FAST , wide in the stretch, passed tired horses. KYSTONE , bumped and caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced between horses
in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ALL THE KING'S MEN chased the pace inside horses and gave way in the stretch. CAPITAL JOKE was outrun.
