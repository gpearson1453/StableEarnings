Footnotes
LAMPORGHINI stepped to the front and moved inside, challenged by a rival to the outside on the far turn, cleared briefly in upper stretch, tested again by
several rivals in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. SIZE DOES MATTER traveled in the two path off the pace, made progress while angling out to the
four path on the far turn, came out further and rallied widest through the lane but missed at the wire. JUST A GUESS rated behind the top pair on the rail,
tipped three wide on the second bend, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch, kept on gamely between foes late but was outkicked. MISCHIEFS
CAUSEWAY closest in pursuit from the two path, challenged from outside on the far turn, got bumped on both sides in upper stretch and stayed on gamely
to the line. TWO BY FOUR saved ground off the pace, tipped out and bumped in upper stretch, kept on willingly but was unable to find room in deep stretch.
KEEP MOVIN' ON steady when racing keenly early then settled into stride near the back on the rail, roused with a quarter mile left to run, moved out in
midstretch and lacked a rally. STAGGER LEE hesitated and stumbled at the start, bothered by KEEP MOVIN' ON early, trailed on the inside then two wide
on the far turn and failed to get involved. MOTIVATING FORCE chased while rank three then two wide on the first turn, raced outside a rival in the middle
stages, moved out to the three path on the second bend, cut back in approaching the stretch and weakened.

EIGHT CLAP set the pace under pressure from ELIGIO to the outside, shook free from that rival on the turn, asked left handed in upper stretch and drew
under steady handling. ELIGIO prompted the pace up the backstretch, lost contact with the winner past the three-eighths pole, remained closest in pursuit
two wide into the lane and held second. GOSTOSO chased outside rivals to the turn, asked three wide around the bend and could not rally. SMILING JOJO
stumbled then propped at the start, looked to rush up between rivals but lacked room and had to put the breaks on, chased along the rail through the turn
and weakened down the lane. NO SHOW JONES chased between rivals then got crowded near the nine-sixteenths pole, trailed on the inside through the
turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to menace.

JOHNNY PODRES settled early then moved closer from inside up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, steered out in the lane, drew alongside
the dueling pair late and got up in time. FORGIVING SPIRIT showed early speed inside MUBTADAA then took control up the backstretch, headed by that
rival again on the turn, battled down the lane along the fence and lost a narrow photo. MUBTADAA away quickest from the gate then chased FORGIVING
SPIRIT up the backstretch, challenged for the lead from outside around the bend, dueled through the stretch and was edged by the top pair in the closing
moments. JETOVATOR stalked three deep in the early going, continued three wide through the turn and finished evenly in the furlong grounds.
GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) had to steady crossing back onto the turn, stalked between or two wide on the turn and could not rally. LANSDOWNE (GB)

BELLE EPOQUE bobbled leaving the gate, went up to take control then got pressured by BOBBY BRUIN GIRL in the early going, maintained a short lead
through the turn, inched clear in upper stretch and proved best under right handed urging. BOSSY BRUIN GAL was off a bit slow to begin then went up to
between rivals to the front and pressed BELLE EPOQUE from outside, remained alongside the pacesetter through the turn, chased after the winner into the
final furlong and kept on willingly to secure second. WARREN'S WILD RIDE tracked four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, bid
three deep at the top of the lane but lacked the needed late punch in the final furlong. INDIAN DREAMER off alertly in the beginning then dropped back to
chase, took the turn three then two wide, angled out leaving the bend and could not rally.

Footnotes
HEY DEMPS showed keen early foot two to three wide on the first turn, pressed the pace from outside on the backstretch, dueled on the far turn and inched
ahead at the quarter pole, disposed of inner rival at the top of the stretch and held well under a drive. ISABEL LUDLOW stalked from inside, chased the top
pair around the far turn, angled out into the stretch, finished willingly and whittle the gap on the winner late while earning second. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE
chased three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, had to pause when keen to go on approaching the five-eighths pole, angled out on the far turn,
brushed with inner rival at the quarter pole, finished with a mild rally and gained third. GLACIER RIM chased between rivals briefly then was taken back and
moved inside, coaxed along the rail then angled off the fence, kept on willingly through the lane but could only earn a minor award. TAKE CARAMIE took
control early along the rail, took pressure from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn and lost command at the quarter pole, yielded to the
winner in upper stretch and gave way. BLONDZILLA reserved and steered to the two path, angled out late on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch
and was never a factor. BOUGIE LIKE stalked in the two path, started to weaken on the far turn and brushed between rivals at the quarter pole, then tired in
the lane.

Footnotes
RUFF RIDE stalked three deep then was taken back to last and moved into the two path for the clubhouse turn, started to move while angling outside rivals
on the second bend, spun four wide into the lane, closed fast in deep stretch and caught FREEDOM LASS at the wire. FREEDOM LASS hopped at the start
to come away a bit slow, stalked off the rail then in the two path, drew alongside the leader on the clubhouse turn, lost touch briefly on the backstretch then
applied pressure once more, kept the heat on the SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) around the far turn, gained the upper-hand approaching the stretch, put away
that rival in upper stretch, showed the way under left handed urging into the final sixteenth but got nailed by the winner. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) sped clear
and controlled the pace early, pressured from outside on the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch before being hounded again from outside, roused at
the quarter pole, lost command entering the lane, faltered late but managed to save the show. YARBOROUGH got put in tight in the beginning, started to
pull between rivals, chased two wide up the backstretch, got caught in traffic on the far turn and fell back to last, angled in leaving that bend and put in late
run up the fence to earn a minor award. REBEL GIRL stalked from inside through both turns, moved out in upper stretch and finished evenly late. MILAGRE
DO SOL settled along the rail, ridden along into the far turn, shifted off the fence leaving the bend, steered out further in upper stretch but could summon the
needed rally. ETHERIC came away a bit slow, chased widest across the dirt then three deep first time through the stretch, moved up outside the top pair in
the middle stages, lost ground on the far turn while three wide and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
PACO'S PICO sped to the front in the two path, held a short lead through the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, challenged by TEMBO at the
five-sixteenths pole, maintained command inside that rival to the stretch, dueled through the lane and would not let the runner-up by. TEMBO chased three
wide around the first turn, closest in aim leaving the backstretch, bid outside PACO'S PICO at the five-sixteenths pole, hounded that rival through the lane
but lacked the needed final kick to get by. DIVINE FEMININE was caught four wide chasing through the first turn, went four wide into the second bend,
moved into the three path then steered out and came five wide into the stretch, kept on to gain the show honors but was no match for the top pair.
SETTECENTO checked hard off heels entering the first turn, chased in the two path after, continued two wide into the second bend, was driven along the
rail into the stretch and could not rally. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE trailed three wide early then passed a rival on the clubhouse turn, had two foes beat two
then three wide on the far turn and failed to menace. SUMMER SHANDEE sent early chasing from the rail and went up inside the leader into the first turn,
lost touch with that rival early on the backstretch, continued to lose positions up the backstretch, remained well back on the far turn and came up empty in
the drive. JACKS OUTLAW dropped back five then four wide on the first turn, chased well back three to four wide on the second bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ICE QUEEN showed good early speed from the rail to take control then got pressured by QUARIA THUNDER, moved clear past the five-sixteenths pole,
put to right handed urging in the lane, threatened again by QUARIA THUNDER in deep stretch but was able to hold that rival at bay. QUARIA THUNDER
closest in pursuit through the clubhouse turn in the two path, moved up to apply pressure from outside, failed to keep up with ICE QUEEN on the far turn,
chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining, showed late try in deep stretch but could not get by. CHASINGSERENDIPITY stalked the top pair
from the fence, coaxed along continuing to save ground through the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, could not produce a late bid but managed to
hold third. A CROWN FOR KITTEN stumbled a bit then got crowded between rivals, trailed from inside early on, moved closer then lacked room inside
CHASINGSERENDIPITY from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, trailed on the fence into the lane, tipped out midstretch and kept on for a
minor award. VIOLET STORM settled along the rail, chased between foes into the far turn, exited the bend two wide and lacked further response. TAPIT
DOUX stalked from the two path, went three wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive. BUILT DIFFERENT came away awkwardly from the
outside, keen two wide early, chased outside rivals to the far turn, rounded the bend four wide and weakened.
