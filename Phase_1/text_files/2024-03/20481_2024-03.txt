Footnotes
NEW WOMAN showed the way in the two path, shook clear of an outer presser entering the lane and held sway from an outer chaser thereafter. MISS
MIKOS stalked three deep while kept in the four path by inner rivals around the turn, claimed place while brushing an inner rival entering the lane, then
chased the leader home well to prove second best. GALADINI pressed the leader from the three path along with an outer counterpart around the turn,
brushed with that one while losing place entering the lane, yielded but remained well clear of the rest. SIGNING lacked speed in the four to five path and
failed to menace. HATTIE BLOOM laid off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. CASBY trailed along the inside, shifted out in the final furlong and failed
to factor. BIKINI BOTTOM pursued from midpack along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
MEAN AMERICAN stalked two wide an between horses around the first turn, pursued a bit further back from the the two path around the far turn, closed in
to bid outside of the leader passing the three sixteenths pole, sparred and wrestled an advantage entering the final sixteenth, then held firm. MO BLING
showed the way along the inside, shook free of an outer presser entering the lane well in hand, came under a drive as an outer bidder menaced at the three
sixteenths pole, dueled into the final furlong, but flopped back to her left lead while getting headed at the sixteenth pole and was bested grudgingly.
ANGELA'S CELERITY tracked in the three to two path, saved ground around the far turn, paused behind the eventual winner turning for home, ran on to
edge show from outer foes at the furlong grounds, shifted out and held that position. OUR LITTLE GIRL broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, then two
wide around the far turn, picked up stride shifting to the six path at the three sixteenths pole and rallied belatedly for a minor share. REALITOS laid off of the
pace in the four path, inched closer in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out nearing midstretch. CAJUN ACES stalked in the five to four path
around the first turn, moved to press the leader from the three path around the far turn, but yielded entering the lane and faded between horses. START
WELL broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the three path, then failed to menace between horses. STAR'S DREAM raced towards the rear in the five
path and improved position. AVERI EVER AFTER laid off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. HOT PATOOTIE pursued from midpack in the five to four
path and faded between horses. KITTENOFTHE COURT lacked speed in the six to four path and made little impact. I DONT KNOW EITHER saved ground
off of the pace but faded.

BEER WITH ICE showed the way inside of a prompter around the first turn, cleared that one entering the backstretch before opening up a wide advantage
shortly after, then held sway with a clear margin through the lane. MOONOVERMONTGOMERY shook his head and bobbled slightly at the start, laid well
back in the four path, advanced approaching the far turn, took that bend from the three path, sustained his rally shifting outside of a place-battling pair in the
final furlong and drove past them in the late stages. SILENT COUNT laid off of the pace three wide, bid for place along with an inner foe at the three furlong
pole, sparred for that position with that one while leaning inwardly in midstretch, but was surpassed by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth. TALK OF THE
TOWN tracked two wide, bid for place along with an outer rival at the three furlong pole, dueled for that position into the final furlong but yielded late. DEN'S
GOOD GRACE broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, pursued in the two to three path around the far turn and moved up. BOLIVER laid off of
the pace in the two to four paths and failed to menace. SHIRE'S END tracked along the inside, faded around the far turn, then steadied to maneuver around
a faltering foe at the five sixteenths pole. SPOKEN CODE was put to a bit of tight quarters between foes at the start and never got involved. GREY'S
RUMOR was outrun. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS lacked speed two to four wide and made little impact. HOWARD'S GRIT prompted outside of the eventual
winner around the first turn, chased while failing to keep pace entering the backstretch, then faltered quickly around the far turn.

DEBT PAID broke out and snagged the gate upon leaving it, settled in the three to four path, tipped five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the sixteenth
pole and edged past the leader. FUNNYFLAME took contact from an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack three wide, took closer order to press the
top pair into the far turn, ranged up and bid in the four path entering the lane, stuck the front soon after, led into the final furlong, but was collared by an
outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and was bested. ST. ARMANDS KEY stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, led briefly before being headed by an
outer bidder entering the lane, fought on through midstretch, but subtly yielded in the final sixteenth and saved show. MCAVOY bumped an inner rival at the
start, laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane and ran on well among foes in pursuit, but missed reaching show. ROCK'N A
HALO bumped with an inner rival at the start, steadied when hard to handle nearing the first turn, then steadied again among foes coming to the three
quarter pole, regrouped to pursue in the three path, shfited to the five to six path entering the lane and stayed on willingly hanging on his left lead until the
final sixteenth. TOUGH LITTLE NUT settled along the inside, moved to the five path entering the lane and cut the gap on the leaders in the final furlong.
OCEAN VICTORY bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and failed to menace. CARD
TRICK stalked along the inside getting a bit keen into the first turn, chased the top pair around the far turn, spun to the three path entering the lane and
faded between horses. MIND BOLT pursued along the inside and faded. SUMMER IN ADRIANE set the pace, vied with an outer rival around the far turn,
got headed by that one and an outer bidder entering the lane, and caved. BEAN MACHINE trailed throughout.

HONKY TONK HIGHWAY trailed along the inside, rallied to bid inside of the new leader at the sixteenth pole and drove past. ALDER laid off of the pace in
the four to five path, rallied to gain command at the eighth pole, but succumbed to an inner bidder leaving the sixteenth pole. MOTOR CITY tracked along
the inside, was roused to the three path entering the turn, chased in the four path entering the lane, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then by
an inner foe in midstretch before regaining show, and kept on well. BEE DANCER pursued form the four to three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch
and moved up. BEAR RIVER led from an outer vying rival around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, but was no match for an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds and weakened between horses. LOUDERMILK prompted two wide, vied around the turn and weakened between horses in upper stretch.
SHOGUN BE FAST prompted inside of the leading pair for a quarter mile, chased them from the two path around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BOLT FROM ABOVE settled off of the pace two to three wide, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied to reel in the leader at the wire. COOKN
WIT CATMAN dictated terms from the three to two path, kicked clear of chasing foes entering the lane, maintained a clear margin into deep stretch but was
caught at the wire by an outer bidder. VERY SATISFACTORY pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, awaited racing room two wide around
the far turn, then split foes to edge show passing the furlong grounds. PILKINGTON brushed an inner rival at the start, trailed early on, gained in the five to
six path around the far turn, but leveled off in the lane. MO RUM stalked in the four to three path, chased in the four path along with an outer rival entering
the lane, exchanged brushes with that one in midstretch and yielded between horses. BETTERA stalked along the inside, chased and lacked a bid. PEARL
OF ACLAIM (GB) tracked from the five to four path, pursued in the five path hanging on his left lead between horses and brushing with an inner foe entering
midstretch, then tired. CELESTIAL JOY (GB) pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, chased along the inside around the far turn and gave
way. FEAR OF UNION raced in midpack along the inside, dropped back to trail at the three furlong pole and failed to factor. WISSAM SHARAF broke a step
slow and was brushed by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four path and faded.

Footnotes
RED WHISTLE tracked in the three to four path, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the three sixteenths pole and kicked clear. BABY
JANE lacked speed in the two to three path, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to reach place in the shadow of the wire. OUR GAL LAYLA
chased forwardly along the inside, took aim inside of the leaders entering upper stretch, but lacked a kick through tight quarters leaving the three sixteenths
pole, kept on to vie for place, but missed at the wire. HALF OFF HALF showed the way along the inside, entered the lane in the two path, drifted about
slightly while getting headed by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole, kept on to vie for place between bidders in the final sixteenth but yielded. COAL
DANCER popped open the stall doors without leaving the gate pre-race, pursued from the four to three path, shfited to the five path in upper stretch but
failed to menace between horses. LADY CHERYL'S SONG pressed from the three path and faded between horses in upper stretch. TENSAS LUCY
tracked from midpack along the inside, chased from the three path entering the lane and failed to factor. EVERYLITTLESINGH failed to factor from the two
path. LITTLEBITOFAQUEEN hopped and was off slow, trailed in the five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
PATH TO SUCCESS tracked three wide, bid outside of the leader before gaining an advantage turning for home, kicked clear in upper stretch, met a wide
challenge in the final sixteenth and held. GLUCKSTADT stalked from the two path, tipped to the four path to take aim on the new leader entering the lane,
but drifted wider while pursuing through midstretch, kept on to close in and attempt a bid in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. DAPPER DUDE lacked
speed in the two to four path and moved up between horses in midstretch. SMOOTHDINI pursued from the two path, split rivals to reach show in midstretch,
but lost that position to an outer bidder shortly after. DUMBSTRUCK laid off of the pace four wide, tracked within range around the far turn, but drifted to the
seven path entering the lane and gave way. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND hopped and blew the start, trailed in the three path early on, saved ground around the
far turn and failed to factor. JOSAN bobbled outwardly at the start, lacked speed in the five to two path and got outrun. FREEDOM SQUARE pressed two
wide but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. WHISKEY AND EASY led along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder turning for home
and weakened.

OVA CHARGED shot away from the gates to quickly spurt clear at the start, led in the three path around the turn and widened under moderate urging to
prove much the best. RUE LALA stalked from the two path and secured place in upper stretch. FINAL QUEST pursued from the three path, shifted to the
five path in upper stretch and ran on to edge show. WHOLELOTTAMO chased from midpack along the inside, kept on but missed show. TENSAS CANDY
lacked speed along the inside and improved position. BLESSED ASSURANCE broke outwardly, trailed in the four path moved to the nine path leaving
upper stretch and failed to menace. BELEOUT lacked speed in the five path and made little impact. CHARLIE T was brushed by an inner rival at the start,
stalked two wide, gave way and weakened late. STAR MOMENT pursued off of the pace in the three path and faded.

BEHEMAH STAR broke a bit outwardly, vied two wide through a soft pace, led entering the lane and drew off through the final furlong under a drive.
BUDRO TALKING took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied inside of the eventual winner around both turns, but failed to keep pace with that one
nearing the final furlong and was second best. BLUE CHEESE tracked two wide before moving to the inside leaving the first turn, pursued from the two to
three path tipping outside of the top pair turning for home, then chased willingly. WISE VERDICT stalked three deep, chased getting floated to the four path
nearing the lane and gave way. HEZA PICKLE leaned outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, trailed in the two path and never got involved.

Footnotes
SIXTH ANNIVERSARY was put to tight quarters by an inner rival and clipped that one's hind heels at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside,
launched a rally surpassing outer rivals at the half mile pole, sustained progress to split the leaders and offer a bid while shifting to the five path entering the
lane, forged an advantage shortly after and inched clear. DIXIE FARMER tracked in the three path, split the leading pair along with an inner rival to bid for
the lead in the six path entering the lane, but got outkicked by that aforementioned foe and was second best. SWEET SASSICAIA showed the way along
the inside, got headed by a pair of outer bidders entering the lane, yet kept on to safely maintain show. FORT POLK was bumped between horses at the
start, laid off of the pace in the five path, took closer order to track the leading quartet turning for home, but only managed to chase them through the lane.
MONEY WELL SPENT prompted the leader from the three path early on, moved out to the five path entering the backstretch, sustained pressure around
the far turn, but got floated to the seven path while getting outkicked by a pair of inner bidders entering the lane and gave way. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN was a
bit antsy in the starting gate, then steadied back when bumped and put to crowded quarters among foes at the start, veered outwardly to avoid a troubled
foe entering the first turn, regrouped well back in the six path, tucked to the two path around the far turn, then moved up but failed to threaten. MI LIA was
bumped between horses then steadied back from cramped quarters soon after the start, lacked speed in the two to four path, shifted to the seven path in
upper stretch and moved up. MS. CAJUN QUEEN bumped an inner foe at the start, then checked from between horses entering the first turn, raced off of
the pace in the four to two path and failed to factor. SHE TOLD YOU SO stalked in the four path and weakened. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE pursued from the
two path and faded around the far turn. FOURALIVIA broke outwardly and had her hind heels clipped by a rival at the start, trailed and got outrun. LOVERS
NEVER SAY broke a bit inwardly, saved ground tracking the leaders but weakened.

Footnotes
ISLAND GOLD pursued the main group four wide, gained when an inner rival forced his hand turning for home, bid entering the lane, led shortly after, dug in
to embrace an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, dueled and gamely clung to an advantage. MO FOR US broke a step slow, laid well back in the three
path, launched progress leaving the three furlong pole, steadied blocked behind rivals after failing to split them at the five sixteenths pole, altered course five
wide entering the lane, resumed his rally to bid outside of the new leader at the furlong grounds, sparred with that one through the late stages but missed.
LADY ATHENA dueled for the lead three to two wide into the turn, but got outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane and sustained a chase to safely
hold show. GOOD N SASSY prompted along the inside, failed to sustain vying position and keenly pursued just off the leader's heels around the turn,
checked nearing the lane, encountered traffic in upper stretch before moving three wide, then ran on between horses. GETOUTOFDAWAY tracked two
wide and between horses, then lacked a bid. POT'S PAYCHECK stalked four to three wide into the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole before getting
outkicked by a wider challenger entering the lane, and gave way. FRANCESNFRIENDS lacked speed along the inside, shifted to the four to five path
entering the lane and made little impact. DELIGHTFUL HALO hopped slightly and broke a step slow at the start, trailed two wide, got floated to the six path
entering the lane and was outrun. DISCREET DEAL dueled for the lead between a pair of rivals before crossing over to the inside entering the turn, but
weakened entering the lane.

GOT ME A CHRYSLER broke slow, lacked speed five wide, rallied outside of foes to bid in the final furlong and kicked clear. HARD FOUR pursued from
midpack along the inside, chased between horses shifting to the three path in upper stretch, tipped further out progressing in the final furlong and edged
place late. SON CARLOS laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and ran on to reach show at the wire.
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE dueled for the lead three deep, led turning for home before drawing clear entering the lane, but offered little resistance to an
outer challenge in the final furlong, yielded and got nailed for show. ANGELIC KNIGHT saved ground well back, then ran on belatedly between horses.
SPRINGTOWN tracked the leading trio from the two path, shifted outside of them entering the lane, attempted a bid but flattened out in midstretch and tired
through the final furlong. R T'S WILDCAT lacked speed in the four path and failed to factor. HUFFS TAZ A BOO was off a beat slow, lagged behind around
the turn and surpassed tired rivals. STARPORT dueled for the lead with an outer pair of rivals, but faded entering the lane. CUSTOM BOBBY'S pursued
from midpack in the three path and weakened. GUTZY sparred for the lead two wide and between horses but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
FREE LIKE A GIRL stalked in the four path, got carried wide by a bearing rival turning for home, yet recovered offer a rally, drove past the leader in
midstretch and drew clear. MUCHMORETHANREADY trailed along the inside, gained in the five path around the far turn before fanning to the seven path
entering the lane, and rallied to edge place late. A G'S CHARLOTTE tracked from midpack four to five path, then ran on between horses.
THETRUTHISTHETRUTH showed the way in the three to two path around the first turn, held sway into the turn, but was bested by an outer bidder nearing
the furlong grounds and gave way. BASALT STREET tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, chased between horses in upper
stretch and yielded. WORLD WAR raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, then along the inside around the far turn but lacked a bid. SPIRITED
BEAUTY broke slowly, lacked speed two to four wide and made little impact. VISIONISTA saved ground off of the pace to no avail. SPEEDY DUDETTE
prompted from the six to four path around the first turn, but drifted back to the six path turning for home and weakened. ALPINE MIST stuttered a step at the
start, pursued from the five to six path and tired early. VALE MALE prompted in the four to three path and between horse around the first turn, but weakened
nearing the nine sixteenths pole.
