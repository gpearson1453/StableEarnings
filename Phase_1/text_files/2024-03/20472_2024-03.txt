Footnotes
ST. OLAF ROSE raced outside in the run up the backstretch while within striking distance, advanced three then four wide through the turn, engaged the
leader from the outside past the furlong marker under confident handling, quickly well clear to win going away. THIS DAMSEL MAYFLY in mid pack while
saving ground, angled out around a tiring rival late in the turn, rallied to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. MISS ANALYZED lacked speed just
off the inside, began a mild advance through the turn, dropped to the inside for the drive, mild rally up the rail to earn the place. SOPHIE'S STAR also well
back off the pace, improved position a bit late in the turn and into the lane, went flat through the lane to finish up evenly. PETIT JEAN last to leave, was
used a bit to move up and duel up front off the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear late in the turn, offered little resistance to the winner past the
furlong marker then caved late to lose several positions. PINK CHIMES went one paced while racing three to four wide turn, lacked a closing response.
ERUMPENT lacked speed, four wide trip through the turn, failed to respond when called on for the drive. RITA'S REVENGE broke on top, dueled up front
along the inside, first to blink midway on the turn, continued to weaken through the stretch. CATALINA SUNRISE broke back, was not involved. HONEY
PAT steadily faded while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
COPPER ECHO broke sharp to set the early pace, shrugged off the other speed entering the stretch, edged away from the runner up a bit a furlong out then
dug in late to hold that same rival safe in the waning strides. GUARANI in the second flight while racing off the inside, ranged up closer three wide turning
for home, stalled past the furlong marker, came again late to challenge the winner from the outside, denied. J J'S RANGER lacked speed while racing just
off the inside, knifed between horses while three then four wide turning for home, chased the top two past the furlong marker, saw that early progress stall to
finish up evenly while clear of the others. GUATAPE settled in mid pack while three wide up the backstretch, angled in a bit through the turn to race in the
two path into the stretch, evenly in the drive. COMMANDER STORM dueled early outside the winner, could not match that one in the drive to gradually
weaken. TWIRLING TROILLET settled off the pace along the inside, lacked closing bid. PARISIAN PROMISE in the second flight outside, four to five wide
into the stretch, tired in the run to the wire. WRECK IT last to leave, trailed throughout in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
JUBILANT JOANIE vied up front in the two path up the backstretch, allowed a rival the rail midway on the turn while well in, disposed of that rival and the
other speed when straightened for home and drew clear under her own courage to win ridden out. MY CAJUN LADY lacked speed while racing off the
inside, angled out four wide when beginning to rally exiting the turn, finished well to gain the place, no threat to the winner. CUPID'S MUSIC off a step slow,
moved outside, four wide into the turn, swung six wide exiting, improved position down the middle of the strip with a mild, belated rally. DARE ME in mid
pack while racing three wide, moved closer while still in the three path turning for home, chased the winner past midstretch then went flat through the final
furlong to lose a couple of positions. THISONESFORLOVE lacked speed three wide, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. BE MY
HUCKLEBERRY raced back and just off the inside, continued to lag into the stretch, picked off a few tiring rivals well after the issue had been decided.
SAMMIES SAMURAI with the pace while three wide and between horses, got out a bit late in the turn to be four then five wide into the stretch, tired through
the stretch. CHARLOTTES WAY broke back, moved up in the two path, moved to the inside and lodged a brief rail bid in the turn, weakened through the
lane. ALWAYS SMILING in the main body while racing in the two path, backed up through the stretch. WILDWOOD ENOUGH flashed brief speed on the

Footnotes
NYQUICK broke on top, set a pressured pace inside, shrugged off that rival when straightened for home, held the runner up comfortably safe late under
steady handling. NULLIFY in the second flight while racing inside, crept a bit closer into the far turn, remained in traffic until late in the bend, steered out a bit
for room, finished willingly to earn the place, no real threat to the winner. GENO'S MYTH pressured the winner off the inside, weakened in the drive. AZTEC
FIRE off a step slow, lacked speed, four wide turning into the stretch, improved position somewhat while not a serious threat. VIGANO broke back, dropped
inside, saved ground to no avail in lacking a serious closing kick. TOP OF THE STREET in the second flight outside the runner up, floated out by that one to
be three wide into the lane, had nothing for the drive. EMPIRE'S BEST forwardly placed while three wide for six furlongs, backed up through the stretch.

CHIP SHORTAGE behind the early pace inside, idled in traffic through the turn, tipped out four wide in upper stretch, outside bid, drew clear. WREAKING
HAVOC back off the early pace and the inside, loomed boldly into contention four wide late in the turn, vied past the furlong marker inside the winner, could
not match that one, all out to retain the place. MAMBA OUT forwardly placed while racing three wide, lodged a bid late in the turn, held a brief advantage
past the furlong marker but could not last. RISKY SPIRIT lacked early foot inside, fell back while saving ground turn, steered out for the drive and displayed
some mild late interest. ADIOS MUCHACHAS broke alertly, showed the way along the inside, weakened when headed in upper stretch. LOFTY HEIGHTS
in mid pack early just off the inside, three wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch drive. TIZ SWEET CANDY void of speed while well out in the
strip, five wide into the turn, six wide leaving, remained back in failing to threaten. COROMANDEL in the main body early three wide, moved closer between
horses midway on the turn then gave way in the drive. RYE MUNNY off step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

W W CRAZY pulled hard in some heavy traffic through the first turn, continued to race under restraint the next three furlongs, lacked room again late in the
second turn, picked way through, split foes in upper stretch, gained the advantage, kicked clear without pressure, ridden out. WARTIME HERO settled off
the pace and the inside, three to four wide turning for home, rallied to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. LEADER OF MEN in the second flight
while racing outside, moved closer four wide late in the final turn, brief vied with the winner past the furlong marker outside that one, flattened out to lose the
place, saved the show. MAKE NOISE forwardly placed while saving ground through the first turn, made an early move along the rail to challenge before a
half, weakened. COLOSI lacked speed off the rail, angled four to five wide into the lane, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve a bit.
CANADIAN PHAROAH broke back, lacked speed, picked off some tiring rivals to better position. TOMA TODO pressed the pace while three wide,
challenged 2nd, brief lead, gave way. CYCLONE off a step slow, remained back. GET BACK GOLDIE set or forced the pace in the two path for six furlongs,

Footnotes
SEAS OF NORMANDY never far back off the inside, stalked three wide up the backstretch, went after the leader from the outside far turn, dueled through
the bend, shook off that foe to be well clear past the furlong marker then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. FUNNY UNCLE settled in mid
pack while angling in a bit first turn to save some ground, caught up in traffic late backstretch and into the far turn, advanced in the two when clear and
continued that advance through the lane to be slowly getting to the winner. I'M YOUR MAN back off the pace and the rail, moved closer three wide late in
the final turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, flattened out to be caught for the place, narrowly lasted for the show in gaining the nod.
RIVETAGE bobbled and came in at the break, was righted and raced back off the pace, checked across a rival's heels midway on the far turn, displayed
some belated interest after recovering. ROUTE RUNNER void of speed, saved ground, improved inside of horses into the stretch then failed to sustain that
advance through the lane. SINGLE RULER off slow and in tight, raced back, staged a mild middle move four to five wide second turn and also flattened out
through the stretch. WE MISS ARLINGTON moved up after the start to set the pace inside, dueled briefly with the winner through the second turn, gave way
when headed into the lane. REDFIELD pressed the issue up front for five furlongs along the inside and faltered. MAGNA TAP off slow when in tight,
remained always back to be outrun. SUPER RENZO forwardly placed off the rail, stopped far turn, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
NASH settled off the early pace while four wide through the first turn, continued on the outside in the run up the backstretch, swept while four wide again
through most of the second bend, took over into the lane under a firm hand ride, quickly drew clear and won geared down and ridden out. CARBONE
forwardly placed while racing off the inside, advanced and challenged between horses and inside the winner second turn, fell back a bit in upper stretch,
proved no match for that one in the drive, came again for the place. FROST FREE broke sharply, soon cleared into the first turn, set the pace while in hand,
briefly responded when confronted late in the second turn, could not keep up with that one the final furlong, was worn down by the runner up late. MR
FILLIP prompted the pace while racing off the inside, dropped to the rail second turn, went evenly through the stretch. OTTO THE CONQUEROR settled off
the pace when racing in the two path through the first turn, continued back, saved ground through the second bend, lacked a closing response. MENA broke
back and never menaced. MAGIC GRANT bobbled at the start to be away slow, remained back throughout and was also never a factor.

FIRST MISSION forwardly placed from the start, prompted the leader off inside onto and up the backstretch, advanced and took over in short order from
that one midway on the final turn, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. WAR CAMPAIGN off the early pace and the rail,
moved closer in the two path through the second turn, came out a bit when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place.
TIME FOR TROUBLE void of speed three wide, continued in the three path up the backstretch and into the far turn, dropped to the rail late in that bend,
rallied up the inside to gain the show and to be closing the gap on the runner up. MAGIC TAP settled off the pace while saving some ground first turn,
continued to be unhurried the next four furlongs, three wide when advancing late in the second turn, bothered upper stretch when SEIZE THE NIGHT came
out, was straightened and continued to show mild interest, not enough for the show. GREAT ESCAPE broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, began to
weaken when headed by the winner in the second turn, continued to falter through the stretch. AIN'T LIFE GRAND last to leave, trailed the first half, moved
outside, four wide second turn, displayed some mild interest to improve position. SEIZE THE NIGHT raced in mid pack and off the inside, closer three wide
through the second bend, came out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. WIZARD OF WESTWOOD forwardly placed along the inside, gave way in the far
turn, well beaten.

Footnotes
SUNNYANDSEVENTY within striking distance up the backstretch, in some traffic into the turn in the two path and between horses, angled out four wide into
the stretch, late bid outside the leader, wore that one down to prevail in game fashion. SNOW FLURRY prompted the early pace four wide, angled in a bit to
challenge three wide early turn, dueled into the lane, disposed of that rival entering the stretch, responded when the winner came alongside past the furlong
marker and gave ground grudgingly to that rival. STREET PAINTER in mid pack while between horses early, in tight, steadied into the turn, moved out three
wide, lodged a belated rally to finish up willingly and to be getting to the top pair late. PNEUMA lacked early foot, four wide through the turn, staged a mild
rally to better position a bit. DENADA broke sharp, pressed the issue from along the inside up the backstretch, began to gradually weaken through the turn.
ZONGS IRISH FROST away well, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, faltered when headed by the runner up late in the turn. MELANIA T
lacked speed, angled out four wide late in the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. ARDEN AR went one paced in the two path in lacking a
closing response. APRIL FLOWER BOUND hesitated at the break, raced well back early, swung out six wide when advancing late in the turn, continued to
display a modest amount of late interest. AURORA GEE off a step slow, moved outside, raced five wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. LADY
RAZORBACK traffic late backstretch, steadily fade while racing inside. MISS DOUBLE was finished early while three wide.
