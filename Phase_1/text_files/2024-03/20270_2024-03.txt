CAJUN JOE took an immediate lead and was firmly rated to show the way, came under a mild hand ride leaving the quarter pole then kept sharp in the
lane. OVER MY LIMIT entered the first turn in the four path and gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, raced five wide on the far turn then dueled
through the stretch for second. TEN BITS eased outward on the first turn and left the turn outside, gave chase into the backstretch, came through the far
turn near the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FAPPIANO HALO saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. GOOD BUZZ became fractious in the gate and came away awkwardly, raced
off the rail on the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. GOLD DILEMMA raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
KATALIMA raced in the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, started her bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took over in the three path past
the quarter, ran clear midway on the far turn and was mostly hand urged in the lane. FASHION DIVA rated just off the pace inside on the first turn, gave
chase past the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled to the inside leaving the turn and settled for second best. CHANNEL
SCENT came out and made contact with So Red the Rose leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far
turn near the rail and came along to take third later yards. SALTY SAUL rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met
past the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. LIME AFTER LIME rounded the opening turn about the four
path, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path on the far turn and had little left in the lane. SO RED THE ROSE was bumped
leaving the gate, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. MOIRAINE stalked from the three path, challenged toward the three eighths
pole but weakened while drifting on the far turn.

QUEEN LEXI settled back inside on the first turn, started her bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn and dug
in under steady handling to hold off SELES through the stretch. The latter had a brief early lead then stalked inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. HERECOMESPUDD took the lead two deep into
the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met off the rail midway on the far turn and remained close
through the upper stretch before flattening stride. I LOVE MARIA raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
rounded the far turn about the three path, then flattened stride in the lane. DEE DEE SIX settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. PURPLE CALLA raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole but showed little response and weakened off the rail on the far turn. LAILAH NITE saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven

ONLY GET'N BETTER rounded the opening turn in the three path then saved ground into the second turn, started his bid toward the seven sixteenths pole
and steadily improved, raced four wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. OCEAN STORM rated the pace inside,
came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and held the lead through the upper stretch,
but was met mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. ROAD SLEW raced four wide early, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and ran
close three wide on the far turn, but showed little more in the lane. MODERN DAY ROMANCE stalked off the rail, challenged past the seven sixteenths pole
and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but weakened leaving the turn. STRONG LIL KOKORO saved ground early on then eased out into the
backstretch and gave chase, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. GET OFF MY CLOUD saved early ground, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

MASTER THIS saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and circled rivals in the six path on the far turn, dug in
from the head of the lane and took over later yards. WINDSOR'S TRACKER saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in to move ahead of SARGENT KOBE in later yards, but was outfinished for the win. The latter
settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide toward the quarter, raced at the rail
on the far turn and dug in leaving the turn, but was caught flattening stride later yards. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the rail the first turn and left the turn
outside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. NEVER
COMPROMISE tapered in and stalked the early pace two deep, moved to even terms and dueled leaving the nine sixteenths pole, was caught toward the
quarter and faded off the rail on the far turn. CATFISH rated close off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened in the three path on the far
turn. AUBURN MILL rated a slim lead inside but was met at the nine sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, dropped back at the rail toward the quarter
pole and weakened.

Footnotes
KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE rounded the opening turn about the five path and left the turn outside, started his bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed to
the lead three wide midway on the far turn, raced clear approaching the top of the stretch and was steadily handled to widen. MAGICAL SURPRISE
exchanged light contact with BORN TO SIN leaving the gate then rounded the first turn off the rail, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
steadily gained and raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and took second the final strides. The latter came away awkwardly and
exchanged contact with the former then jostled into Calypso John, stalked off the rail, challenged into the backstretch and took a brief lead toward the three
eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail and dueled to retain third. WYSOQUIET raced in the four path on the
first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and dueled to a brief slim lead between horses at the quarter pole, but was caught midway on the far
turn and flattened stride mid-stretch. CALYPSO JOHN was brushed early then saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and weakened. HILLBILLY ROCK raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole
but weakened in the four path on the far turn. MONKEY WRENCH rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure into the backstretch, was met toward the
three eighths pole, dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail.
