Footnotes
BIYOMBO was sharp out of the gate, vied for the lead, set the pace from the three path, was briefly challenged through the turn by an outside competitor,
shook that challenger in the stretch and took the win. HUSTO vied for the lead, stalked the early pace setter from the four path, challenged briefly, headed
leader upper stretch, was sightly bumped, could never gain ground over the leader, gave good effort but was no second best today. CROWN
PROSECUTOR stalked the front runner from the two path, was in contention, bore out into the eight path through the turn, was encouraged once in the
stretch and responded well, closing and getting up for the show spot. OUTOFQUEMADO raced from off of the pace in the four path, improved position,
gaining ground into the stretch then flattened out late. JOE DID IT raced from off of the pace in the two path but was never involved. IMA RASCAL broke
and raced for the first furlong, then went wrong and pulled up, vanned off. THERE WAS A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION FOR INTERFERENCE. THE RIDER OF
HUSTO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BIYOMBO. AFTER A STEWARTS REVIEW THE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

WELL IMAGINE THAT vied for the lead, used a naturally long stride and led setting a reasonable pace, maintained his advantage through out, winning in a
wire to wire fashion. R BARRACUDA raced mid pack in the three path, smartly saved saved ground through out, was given rein and asked through the turn,
responded well lengthening his stride and closing in on the leader but had too much to do and not enough ground hitting the wire as the second place horse
today. YOU'REINTHEARMYNOW had an awkward start, climbed for a few strides while racing on the inside in the two path, settled, edged out into the four
path but to no avail finishing even. LONG GONE SILVER stalked, raced in the three path maintained position through out but had no late kick. EXTRA
BEAT was off a touch slow, raced five wide and finished even. DAVID'S FAITH trailed, showed little.

CLEAR THE COAST vied for the lead from the outside, raced in the four path, was determined through out and out lasted the rest getting up in time for the
win. BRANDYN vied for the lead, raced in the two path and in between rivals while in a four way battle for the lead, was encouraged and pushed even more
and still in a four way battle in the stretch, shook two, kept running and battling with another clear to the last few jumps getting bested at the end finishing
second. SOUTH COAST ROUTE raced mid pack, four wide, edged ten wide upper stretch and closed well. STREET HUMOR raced mid pack in the five
path, maintained position but was no threat. SIPPIN WHISKEY raced from off of the pace in the two path and was never involved. COASTAL FOG vied for
the lead, set the pace while working in company with three other competitors all battling for the first few calls, sustained the effort until the eighth pole then
retreated. LITTLE J P vied for the lead, raced in the three path while in between rivals, tired in the upper stretch. SHINING TIGER turned left after the start,
tried to take the gap, recovered, raced well behind the rest of the field and was no factor today.

PALACE STAR raced off of the pace, was ten wide and out of the dirt, settled early, was cued and circled the field through the turn, kept going through out
the stretch drive and proved to be much the best. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND raced mid pack in the four path, moved up and stalked the leaders, tucked
behind those leaders through the turn, waiting patiently, shifted out from behind horses in the stretch and was put to the talk, responded well and closed
taking the lead briefly, then was collared by the eventual winner and settled for second. KEBA LUCKY DAY vied for the lead, raced five wide, stalked the
pace, advanced and battled for the lead then gave way. FOLK HERO raced off of the pace in the three path, shifted out into the eighth path and tried to
advance but hit another wall horses and raced to no avail. DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY vied for the lead, led, set the pace, raced four wide, battled down the
stretch but could not sustain the bid. MAMALONA raced mid pack in the four path, stalked the leaders while racing in between rivals, moved up and gained
ground into the stretch, challenged for the lead briefly before giving way. JUMPING JILL FLASH raced mid pack i the two path, and made no impact.

Footnotes
TEXAS HEDGE stalked the pace from the five path, improved position down the back side, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch while inching out into
the ten path, was kept on point and closed well passing his other rivals from the middle of the track and getting up for the win. BROOKYS TAPIT raced from
off of the pace in the three path, moved at the three eighths pole, cut the corner through the turn gaining ground, challenged for the lead, then just missed
while still putting a great effort forward. FRISCO KID stalked the pace, raced on the rail saving ground through out, battled but did not have enough today.
KIRBY DERBY raced off of the pace, raced on the rail, trailed early, then found his stride and closed late.. WEAR THE CROWN vied for the lead, led, raced
three wide, set the pace to his liking, was challenged at the quarter pole and gave way. MY CALL raced from mid pack, raced in the two path, then shifted to
the rail while saving ground, then tired in the stretch. TEE CLASS was off a touch slow, raced off of the pace while saving ground, never got involved.

Footnotes
TED stalked the pace from the four path, patiently waited in a pocket behind the leaders through the stretch, was asked in the last furlong, responded with
another gear, getting up for the win easily. BROTHER REID raced from mid pack on the rail, smartly saved ground through out, advanced into a stalking
position, was in contention but was covered up the whole race never getting any room to make a move finally got out and was able to grab second place
honors. CASHANOVA raced from off of the pace in the six path, settled, found his best stride late and closed well just missing and dead heating for third.
JACKS OUTLAW vied for the lead, raced in the two path, battled with a challenging rival at the half mile pole, prevailed and had the lead then was caught
late and dead heated for third.. TABLE FOR TWO raced off of the pace in the four path, improved to mid pack, moved at the half, shifted inside into the rail,
raced down the stretch on the rail improving position and finishing well. JOKER MATT stalked the pace from the inside, raced on the rail, challenged for the
lead at the half mile marker, duel, then flattened out. SLY stalked the pace from in between rivals, was strong in the bridle and was asked to relax, was
positioned perfectly in the upper stretch but did not finish. COASTAL WATERS off pace showed little. GREY STORM raced mid pack in the six path, widest
trip, no rally. THERE WAS A RIDERS OBJECTION, THE RIDER OF BROTHER REID CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TED FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON A STEWARTS REVIEW THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED AND THERE WERE NO CHANGES.
