Footnotes
BOBBY'S GIFT stalked the pace from the three wide between rivals down the backstretch, made a bid on the turn to engage the leader turning for home,
and prevailed in a drive taking control nearing the wire. MY TWO AUNT JOANS tracked the pace from four wide, made an early bid to take the lead at the
half mile pole, held the lead to mid-stretch and could not hold off the winner in a good effort. PEACE OF EKATI reserved off the pace to the far turn, made a
steady advance circling on the turn and continued to grind down the stretch to be along for the show. PARKER set a pressured pace for a half, clung to the
rail saving ground on the turn and kept on willingly through the lane. PRIVATE LAKE broke a step slow to be at the rear early, raced up between rivals on
the first turn to prompt the pace on the backside and faded coming home. DUEL FUEL trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
SUZY Q THE QUEEN well placed racing four wide down the backside, rallied five wide into the turn to take command on the bend and drew off down the
lane unchallenged. MAKES SENSE TO ME prompted the pace from three wide down the backside, made a bid on the turn moving with the winner to briefly
battle for the lead, was no match for that one and finihsed willingly to hold the place. SHEWEARSMYRING settled in hand off the pace leaving the first turn,
tracked the leaders down the backside, moved to challenge entering the far turn, checked when lacking racing room along the fence to lose ground dropping
to the rear of the field, circled on the bend and made a belated bid in the stretch having lost all chance on the turn. WILDCAT DREAM broke a step slow to
be at the rear, pulled turning on to the backstretch to rally between horses, angled to the rail nearing the far turn causing SHEWEARSMYRING to be in tight
on the rail, and kept on evenly failing to sustain the bid. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN set the pace for a half mile, was surrounded by the field making early
challenges into the far turn and failed to respond, dropping from contention on the bend.

Footnotes
COWTOWN BOSS set the pace from the gate, opened a clear advantage on the turn and dug-in through the lane to hold well. STUNT MAN stalked the
pace from three wide, rallied on the turn and closed well through the lane to be gaining in deep stretch. IT'SGOODTOBESEEN reserved off the leaders to
the turn, rallied wide circling the field and kept coming to be best of the rest. UNEEDTOCOMEHOME well placed in striking distance while saving ground
along the rail and failed to gain ground while put to a long drive. OVERLOAD slow early to trail the field to the quarter pole and showed late interest in the
stretch. GIFT OF OAK was not a threat. BAD BOY BOOGIE prompted the pace through the turn, bobbled taking a bad step nearing the quarter pole and
stopped.

PRANCIPANTS tracked the leader from four wide to the far turn, rallied to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch and wore that one down through the lane.
MAUREENLOVESFRANK set the pace on a well rated lead, responded when called upon turning for home and was outkicked in deep stretch. SPECIAL
BEACH stalked the pace from the fence down the backside, was called upon entering the turn and failed to respond finishing evenly. JOYFUL NOISE was
not a factor.

lane. THE MIRACLE KIUT pressed the pace to the turn, took command opening a clear advantage on the bend and finished willingly while unable to hold off
the closing winner. SWEET UNIQUE stalked the pace to the three-eighths pole, rallied on the bend, was unable to close on the pacesetter and kept on
throgh the stretch. ANGEL WINGS trailed to the head of the lane and showed some late energy. GO GIRL flashed brief speed to lead for three-eighths and
faded on the turn.
