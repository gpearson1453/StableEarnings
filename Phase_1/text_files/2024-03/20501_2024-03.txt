BUEHLER'S DAY OFF stalked the early pace, shifted out on the turn, responded readily three wide to make the leads under right handed urging near mid
stretch and drew off to win as much the best. EL BAMBINO trailed into the stretch, rallied determinedly late outside rivals and finished second best. SPIRIT
OF SEATTLE pressed the pace two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. FLAWLESS CAT hopped at the start, stalked the pace two wide and
lacked the needed response. SIR MASON away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch and gave way late.
