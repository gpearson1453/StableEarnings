Footnotes
MONGOLIAN ALTAI settled in the two path, saved ground through the far turn, rallied to the front inside the leaders midstretch and edged clear. GET
KRAKEN got bumped and shuffled back at the start, tracked three wide early, went two wide into the far turn, coaxed along then had to pause behind
GHOST COAST at the quarter pole, tipped three wide into the lane and angled out widest in the drive, rallied and got up for second. GHOST COAST broke
in and bumped GET KRAKEN leaving the gate, stalked in the three path then outside a rival, shifted in a bit at the quarter pole, angled out and launched a
bid in upper stretch but got outkicked by the top pair. BALDORO pressed the pace from outside, dueled leaving the backstretch and around the far turn,
carried a short lead into the final furlong, lost command midstretch and weakened late. PRECISION STRIKE stalked the top pair from the rail through both
turns, moved off the fence in the lane, lacked room and had to steady midstretch, then was not persevered with after. GAELIC NATION (IRE) showed good
early foot to take the lead, set the pace under pressure from outside then dueled leaving the backstretch, fought on to the sixteenth pole, then weakened in
deep stretch. BIG DRINKER off slow to begin, reserved at the back and moved inside, trailed through the far turn, came out past the quarter pole, eased
and walked off.

Footnotes
DISOBEY grabbed the early lead and showed the way under pressure from CRIBBAGE BOARD, maintained a short lead through the turn, put that rival
away in upper stretch, then met the bid from HONDO CROUCH past the eighth pole and gamely prevailed. HONDO CROUCH broke a bit slow, tracked
along the rail into the turn, came under a ride around the bend and started to gain past the five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the stretch,
challenged DISOBEY past the eighth pole and could not get by. CRIBBAGE BOARD pressed the winner from inside to the top of the lane, lost touch with
DISOBEY in upper stretch and flattened to third. DAMAZIO stalked the top pair three wide into the turn, got floated out to the four path by HONDO
CROUCH leaving the bend and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
I'M A LUCKY MAN sped clear and showed the way with a comfortable lead up the backstretch, padded the margin along the rail on the turn, asked right
handed with a furlong remaining and held safely under strong handling in deep stretch. EASTBOUND lacked early speed and dropped back while moving
inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and showed late effort to gain second and whittle the gap on the winner. QUAGMIRE
MAGIC broke well then took a stalking position behind I'M A LUCKY MAN, hugged the rail through the turn and finished evenly down the lane. BLAME
GEORGE broke a bit slow, chased from off the pace, rounded the bend two wide, steered out in the lane and summoned a mild rally to round out the
superfecta. WHAT A DUDE broke inward to bother DERECHO DANDY, chased out of range two wide or outside a rival into the turn, tipped three wide
midway around the bend and lacked rally. RUNNING TIGER traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, raced along the rail then tipped two wide into the
stretch, chased between rivals in the lane and lacked a rally. DERECHO DANDY lost his path at the start, raced outside a rival at the back, tipped three
wide on the turn and was never a factor. CONSTANT CONFLICT slipped leaving the gate to come away poorly, moved into range and was closest in pursuit
into the turn, asked right handed two to three wide around the bend, tired in the lane, dismounted following the race and walked into the van.

IN THEORY vied between rivals briefly then dueled inside SHE'S NO ANGEL up the backstretch, shook free early on the turn, roused at the top of the lane,
drew off when asked right and left handed, then coasted in the final sixteenth. QUEEN OF NAPLES coaxed from the gate then had to pause for a bit when
losing her path early, moved out and chased four wide outside rivals into the turn, traveled four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took aim at the leader two
wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to secure second. NOCTURNE COURT lagged behind early, trailed four
wide through the turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the show honors. APPLE FEST chased the leaders from inside into the turn, ridden along past the
three-eighths pole, cornered nicely into the stretch and weakened. UR IN TROUBLE hit the gate but still came away quickly and vied briefly inside a pair of
rivals then dropped back to chase off the rail, went between runners on the turn but got put in tight and steadied past the five-sixteenths pole, spun three
wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run. SHE'S NO ANGEL vied three deep for a bit then dueled outside the winner up the backstretch, could
not keep pace early on the bend and chased three then two wide around the turn and faded in the lane.

MISSED THE CUT rated along the rail then went up to press briefly at the half-mile point, dropped back to stalk again passing the finish line for the first
time, chased inside a rival into the far turn, tipped out past the five-sixteenths pole, took aim at the top pair two to three wide into the stretch, drew alongside
PLANETARIO (BRZ) with a furlong remaining, got floated out by that rival and raced on even terms at the sixteenth pole, then drove clear in the late.
PLANETARIO (BRZ) stalked the lone leader in the two path, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, took over in upper stretch, put away
BALLADEER at the eight pole, then fought inside MISSED THE CUT while drifting out in the final furlong and yielded late. OFFLEE NAUGHTY settled
inside then went outside MISSED THE CUT on the first turn, moved inside first time through the stretch, chased two wide leaving the backstretch then
angled in on the far turn, moved off the fence in the lane and gained third. BALLADEER sped clear while racing keenly early on, pressured briefly at the
half-mile mark before clearing again, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by a pair of rivals at the three-eighths pole, held a short lead over
PLANETARIO (BRZ) around the final bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened. RESULTANT reserved in the early going on the inside,
steered off the fence and was on the move up the backstretch, put in a mild bid three deep at the three-eighths pole but could not sustain the challenge for
long, chased the leaders three wide to the stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
COWBOY MIKE stalked from inside in-hand, tipped out at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged two wide into the lane, took over at the top of the stretch, put
away HAWKER at the eighth pole, met the challenge from YELLOW BRICK shortly after and turned that rival back. YELLOW BRICK off slow to begin,
moved inside and sat off the pace, drew closer in the middle stages, chased along the rail then two wide on the second bend, tipped out and launched a bid
outside COWBOY MIKE at the eighth pole but was turned away in the furlong grounds. DON'T SWEAR DAVE got put in tight briefly between rivals early,
moved into the two path, chased in range three deep into the far turn, four deep midway around the bend, continued within striking distance with a furlong
left to run but flattened out while holding the show. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH climbed early racing well off the rail and dropped back, roused four then three
wide on the far turn, summoned a mild rally and missed third. CLOUSEAU tracked on the inside then two wide early, had to steady off heels past the
five-eighths pole, ran into traffic at the quarter pole, angled to the inside and churned on to improve. HAWKER showed speed from the rail and dueled from
inside early, cleared on the backstretch, challenged from outside into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. BAD SNEAKERS chased
three wide early, moved closer outside rivals on the backstretch, stayed off the rail to the stretch and faded. THE BIG WAM broke a step slow, trailed off the
rail around the first turn, raced along the rail leaving the backstretch, angled out at the quarter pole and was never a factor. JEWELED SHILLELAGH dueled
into the first turn then tried to cede command to inner rival but pulled the rider along, was taken hold of early on the backstretch, chased between rivals into
the second bend, dropped back around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
SNEAKER vied for the lead inside pair of rivals then cleared to take control, showed the way to the far turn, challenged by outer rival around the bend,
resisted to upper stretch, then kicked clear midstretch and was kept busy to the wire. QUANTUM INNERGY raced outside a rival at the back early on, went
between rivals at the three-eighths pole, angled to the inside around the bend, moved out in the lane and finished well for second. RUNAMILEINMYSHOES
vied three deep into the first turn then stalked outside a rival, bid two wide on the far turn, got turned away midstretch and flattened to third. BE A
GOLDFISH saved ground through both turns and summoned a mild response to earn a minor award. SPARTA F. C. rated along the inside, followed the
leader through the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane, drifted out in the stretch and weakened. ANOTHER SUMMER stumbled leaving the gate, raced a
bit off the rail towards the rear into the first turn, drew closer on the far turn, tipped three wide into the lane, altered out from behind a drifting SPARTA F. C.
and flattened out. NATURALLY BLONDE rounded the first turn three then two wide off the pace, steadied behind BEAUTIFUL JANET at the three-eighths
pole, navigated the far turn three to four wide and lacked a response. BEAUTIFUL JANET vied between rivals into the first turn then chased after the lone
leader, dropped back into and around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off. WHERE IS ZIZI refused to leave when the gates opened. THE
STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF WHERE IS ZIZI AND RULED THAT SHE WAS AWARDED A FAIR START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.
