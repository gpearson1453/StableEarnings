Footnotes
WMA GRAND FINALE saved ground in the early furlongs while being well rated in the four path, then urged eagerly on the far turn, dug in in the early
stretch and edged past the dueling pair and kept on grudgingly to prevail in the end. WMA SMOKE SIGNAL chased the pace into the first turn from the
inside, then moved up to duel with an inner rival in the far turn, kept on in the early stretch, led momentarily before being by an outer rival, steadied slightly
then kept on for second place. RB NASH BASH hopped at the start then led the way into the first turn, was met with an outer rival mid backstretch to battle
for the lead into the early stretch then gave way in the end. WMA NORTH WIND moved eagerly throughout the first turn while two wide to meet with an
inner rival down the early backstretch, dueled briefly then stopped. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of WMA SMOKE
SIGNAL claimed foul on WMA GRAND FINALE in the late stretch. After review, no change was made.

Footnotes
MISSINGYOUCRAZY stalked the pace from the inside heading into the backstretch, was well rated behind the dueling pair, then bid on the far turn to gain
command in the early stretch and held on well to the end. GRACIE'S KITTEN broke outwardly and disrupted rivals, then chased the pace while two wide,
then rallied on the far turn to closed belatedly in the home stretch and be up for the place prize. CAFEZINHO dueled with an outer rival in the early furlongs,
then took command on the far turn, continued to bid gamely in the early stretch then was over taken on the outside and missed the place prize in the end.
VOODOO MISTRESS chased the pace from the inside in the middle of the pack, settled back on the far turn, then rallied in the upper stretch and was
closing well in the end. WICKED SONG was bumped and forced outwardly at the start, then settled in the two path and outside of rival down the
backstretch, then bid on the far turn to rally in the stretch and came up empty in the end. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER dueled with an inner rival heading into
the backstretch, was long drive on the far turn, was used up and flattened out in the stretch. TRANQUILITY was bumped at the start, then settled along the
inside towards the back of the field, bid on the far turn but it was not enough in the end. KAUSE I'M DEVINE was squeezed back at the start, then settled
behind the field, made a mild bid on the far turn while three wide and was no threat.

REASON OVER RICHES was well rated along the inside, then dug in gamely leaving the turn to edge clear in the late stretch and was up in time to prove
best. BLING ON THE LIGHT led the way from the inside, cleared the turn, was in a gamely rally then was caught in the end. THE NEXT BIG BLING stalked
the pace while three wide, then bid gamely on the turn to threaten the leader momentarily, lacked the winning bid in the stretch and was best for the show
prize. BRAD'S SWEETHEART raced at the back of the pack, then was gaining mildly in the stretch but it was not enough to make a difference.
SALTAMONTES DIVA pressed the pace while two wide, then urged steadily on the turn but could not retain bid and came up flat in the stretch.

FROSTY BREW moved swiftly along the inside to set the pace down the backstretch and into the turn and was kept to task till the end. TOOTIE chased the
pace while two wide, was in strong drive throughout the far turn, menaced in the early stretch but could not catch leader in the end. CATO'S LADY saved
ground down the backstretch then swung eight wide leaving the turn and closed willingly down the lane. BECKY'S TATTOO broke outwardly and bumped
rival, then stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the turn and just missed the show prize in the end. TALKATIVE
raced while three wide down the backstretch, then swung seven wide leaving the bend, angled inside and closed too little too late. LILA'S LUCKY LADY
stalked the pace while two wide, then came out six wide on the bend and came up empty in the stretch. CRYSTAL CRESCENT chased the pace from
inside, was in a hard drive on the turn, then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHINING EXAMPLE chased the pace from the inside, was moving up on the turn to grab command at the quarter maker then held sway down the lane to
prevail in the end. GOLD MEMORIES saved ground down the early backstretch then was gaining on the turn, came out seven wide and closed belatedly
down the lane. CRANKY SHEILA chased the pace while three wide in the early furlongs, then angled inside leaving the bend, continued to dig in gamely
and was up for the show prize. FAST TRACK pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the turn and into the
stretch and just missed the show prize in the end. TWISTED BRADE raced in the middle of the field while four wide down the backstretch, then menaced
heading in the stretch and needed more in the end. KAYLEE'S SHADOW chased the pace while two wide in the early furlongs, then settled back on the
turn, bid in the upper stretch and came up evenly in the final yards. SINGLE SATURDAY was allowed to settle while three wide, then came out seven wide
leaving the bend and bid too little too late in the stretch. STARTECA led the way down the backstretch and into the turn, was used up after the quarter
marker and gave way in late stretch. BLUEGRASS DIXIE was no threat.

Footnotes
BLUE BOON bumped rival at the start, then tracked the pace from the inside under a easy hand ride down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn
while three wide, split rivals, gained command in the final yards and was up at the wire to prevail. WITT'S TAQUITO chased the pace while two wide, was
advancing on the far turn in attempt to gain the lead in the early stretch, was in a strong drive and just missed in the end. KISS PRINCIPAL was away well to
lead the pack into the first, maintained a steady pace throughout the backstretch and into the far turn then was met with incoming rivals in the early stretch
and faltered in the end. THICK HAZE bumped for at the start, reserved ground in the early furlongs, then swung seven wide leaving the second bend and
closed willingly down the home stretch. TAKE CHARGE GENT was bumped at the break, then raced from the inside, bid leaving the far turn while four wide,
could not find room and kept on behind gamely rivals. KAZAN (IRE) chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then urged steadily in the far turn
to menace in the early stretch but it was not enough in the end. WAR CHEST was bumped at the start, then raced while two wide towards the back of the
pack, was in a moderate pace throughout the far turn, bid in the late stretch and came up empty in the end. SNIVELING raced in the middle of the field while
two wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn before giving way in the final furlong. FEDERAL HILL was bumped at the start then settled at the
back of the field and was no threat. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) was no menace.
