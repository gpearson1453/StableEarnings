JUBA'S PUNCH was hustled clear then rated the pace, drew away at the rail on the turn then kept alert through the stretch. THETA gave chase, raced off
the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. OUR BREW chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, was eased out nearing the head
of the lane and showed little further. TRUE BUCKPASSING broke through prior the start then gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and
weakened in the lane. BLUSHING BIP BOP became anxious in the gate, chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in
the stretch. FANTASY FROST saved ground. VIESTE gave chase outside and raced in the four path on the turn.

MOON FALL settled close off the rail early on then stalked three wide into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod in the three path
midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold on. RIVER MALBUMOONRVF stalked inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the
four path on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and finished well to take second the final strides. GREATANDGOOD stalked from the two and three paths,
challenged past the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to a brief slim lead at the quarter pole, was met entering the stretch but dug in gamely to late stretch
before beginning to flatten stride. GIACOMO CASANOVA veered out leaving the gate then angled in entering the first turn and settled off the pace, picked
up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. TIME TO CHOOSE raced in the three path the first
turn, left the turn outside and proved no factor. CANDY FOR JUBA rated the pace inside from the seven eighths pole, came under pressure toward the
three eighths, was met at the rail at the quarter pole and weakened from the mid point of the far turn.

Footnotes
PALMARY came away awkwardly then pressured the pace, took the lead two deep passing the quarter pole and dug in under steady handling to hold on.
SERENADE SOLDIER pressured the pace inside, steadied passing the five sixteenths pole then checked off the heels of Luna West nearing the quarter
pole, recovered stride at the rail through the turn, eased out entering the stretch and finished well. EVERYDAYISAGIFT chased through the backstretch,
raced near the rail on the turn, dueled through the stretch for third then flattened late. LUNA WEST accelerated to the lead nearing the half mile pole and set
a pressured pace, was met passing the quarter pole, steadied in the three path off the heels of Palmary midway on the turn then flattened in the lane.
CALERA LOVE engaged in close early chase, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little further. MIDNIGHT PASS gave chase, raced in the five
path on the turn and showed little in the lane. DAPPLESANDDIAMONDS hesitated at the break then saved ground. BERNIE'S DREAMING saved ground.
