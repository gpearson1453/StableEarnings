Footnotes
QUAIL , away alertly, disputed the early pace two to three wide outside a rival, held a slim lead mid turn, thwarted and outside challenge near the quarter
pole, spurted away after being guided wider and set down in upper stretch, opened up past the eighth pole then held firm while kept alert. SIR LOOKING
GLASS chased the contested pace while well off the inside, circled about six wide into the stretch, straightened and finished well to bridge the gap. SEEKET
SAUCE , urged along off the inside, raced between runners mid turn, shifted out past mid stretch and kept on with interest to gain the show. BENNY
BUCKETS , off the pace, saved ground into the lane, slipped through nearing mid stretch but went evenly in the final sixteenth. ROGUE FORCE broke
slowly, was taken well off the rail early on and hustled off the pace, raced extremely wide entering the lane but could only muster up a slight kick. MAGIC
STORM , unruly behind the gate, was fractious once in the gate, broke a beat slow then rushed up to contention, challenged three deep mid turn, failed to
sustain soon into the stretch, dropped back, was being eased across the wire, pulled up early on in the gallop out then was vanned off. EFFORT showed
speed and disputed the early pace two wide and to the inside of rivals, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faltered. PER THE HORSE RACING
INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, SIR LOOKING GLASS HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

stretch then was kept to task until the final strides. HOT MEMORIES settled back off the inside then outside a rival leaving the far turn, raced four wide
under asking into the stretch, advanced between runners leaving the sixteenth marker, kept on willingly and nabbed the show outside a pair of foes. BAYOU
CHROME gave early chase three wide and to the inside of runners, dropped back some around the turn, raced three wide in upper stretch, was guided
towards the inner rail in mid stretch and finished up well. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW stalked early, chased to the inside of rivals leaving the far turn, moved up
to give willing pursuit in upper stretch, stayed on with effort a sixteenth more then faded. WEALTH N HEALTH stumbled at the break, recovered and stalked
well wide outside runners, was under a hustling ride six wide outside a rival in upper stretch then faded through the final furlong. KURT'S CHOICE reared at
the break, recovered then advanced between runners heading to the turn to chase, raced four wide inside a foe pursuing into the stretch, failed to kick on
past mid stretch and weakened. BEAU MISCHIEF , drafted back off the pace, was taken well wide and failed to generate a solid run. IMPERATOR dropped

Footnotes
DISRUPTIVE ARTIST tracked inside, eased out three wide nearing the lane, closed in under asking, forged past the embattled leaders leaving mid stretch,
kicked clear with a sixteenth remaining then held firm while kept alert. MARK OF VICTORY rated in range and between foes past the half, tracked inside
runners past the three eighths, advanced through a seam near the quarter pole, angled four wide while just behind the winner entering the lane, failed to
initially quicken with that one but churned on with interest and gained the place while on her left lead. HERON BAY settled off the pace, was taken wide and
edged up a bit through the backstretch run, circled five wide into the lane, kept on with effort and got past faders to gain the show. SENT BY ANGELS was
nudged clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure into the far turn, dueled on a slim lead from the quarter pole to about mid
stretch then faded. PRETTYWITTYANDWISE prompted the pace, moved up and engaged SENT BY ANGELS leaving the far turn, sparred to mid stretch
then gave way late. UNUSUAL DANCER saved ground and came up empty. ETHAN'S GIRL stalked three wide, raced between runners leaving the far turn,
failed to kick on soon after and retreated entering the lane. SAILING AWAY , three deep early, moved up four wide outside runners and tracked past the
half, sustained an injury approaching the stretch then was vanned off. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
B R KIDD ROCK tracked three wide and outside the leader, moved to engage leaving the far turn, went clear approaching the stretch, opened up under a
drive in mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. HARBOR THUNDER , off the early pace and well off the inside, commenced a run near the three
eighths, circled six wide with progress into the stretch, closed in on his left lead and just failed to get up. WHISKEY VISION was rated back soon after the
break and raced well off the early pace, quickly gained between runners past the five sixteenths, angled five then close in to the inside of HARBOR
THUNDER. ROAD OF LOVE , snugly in hand and to the inside of a rival near the half, angled out leaving the far turn, swung out very wide for the drive and
rallied. MACNAMARA , three to four wide, lacked a solid bid. BRAVE MAGIC sped clear early, set the pace towards the inner rail, was taken on three
furlongs out, ceded command mid turn, stayed on to chase to upper stretch then tired. VENOM , four wide chasing mid turn, gave way leaving the three
sixteenths. PARS AND BIRDIES gave early chase towards the inside and faded. PAINTED SMOKE , outrun, raced towards the inner rail in the lane.

Footnotes
WINDRIBBON , in range six wide, moved up outside foes leaving the five sixteenths and joined the pace fray, responded when roused soon into the stretch,
took command past the three sixteenths, spurted clear under a drive, switched over to his left lead late and held sway. EL ALTO HOMBRE led early, ceded
to a rival to his inside heading to the half, battled five wide between runners mid turn, shifted out after dropping back a bit nearing the lane, straightened,
came back on through the final furlong and got the bob for second. RECKONING DAY moved up to bid between runners near the half mile marker, vied
around the turn and into the lane, stayed on willingly after the winner cleared but was nipped for the place. HEY NOW edged up between foes nearing the
far turn, chased the embattled quartet of leaders past the five sixteenths, raced about five wide into the stretch but could only offer a mild late response.
FIRST CALL , brushed at the break, bid to the inside of a rival to take a short lead approaching the half, dueled three wide and inside runners mid turn,
failed to go on past the three sixteenths and weakened. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) , brushed at the break, failed to get involved.

Footnotes
SIR PISTOLERO , a bit reluctant to load, took over soon after the break, set the pace in about the two path while handling outside pressure, was nudged
clear nearing the quarter pole, opened up under mild hand encouragement in mid stretch, switched leads twice through the final sixteenth and proved much
the best with something in reserve. VINNIEBOB , between rivals early, edged up to the inside of a rival near the far turn, eased out advancing towards the
lane, gave hard chase from there and continued with effort while second best. PURE CANE SUGAR settled well off the rail, ramped up a five wide run past
the five sixteenths, kept on past mid stretch then flattened out late. CALCULATED SPIN settled off the pace and about two wide into the far turn, shifted out
four wide for the drive but lacked a rally. ICE STORM , three wide outside the winner, forced the pace to the quarter pole, shifted in when failing to keep
pace and faded. KNOCKOUT GUY saved ground, angled out in the drive but failed to menace. CHIEFS BLANKET stalked off the rail to the far turn and
weakened. DIVERSIFUL angled in leaving the far turn and weakened.
