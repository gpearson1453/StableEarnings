JACKS SPRING BREAK raced four wide near the seven eighths pole, tracked the early leader two deep, made a good bid four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and drew off to be clear under strong handling. LIARS CLUB showed good early foot, was collared near the three sixteenths pole, dug in
and held the place position. JUST A IRISH LAD stalked the pace along the inside and kept on the wire. MINT was off slowly, raced off the early going,
moved up four wide near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. FREE MAKER settled off the early going, raced two to three wide and raced evenly
to the wire. TIZHOTNDUSTY was unhurried early, raced three to four deep and lacked a bid. LEGIONARY dropped back early, saved ground and never
threatened. SWEET MEDICINE stalked the pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole and weakened. VANGILDER raced five to six wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor.

GOSPEL TRUMPET pressed the pace from the outside of foes, drifted out midway around the far turn into the upper stretch, raced from the far outside in
the lane and held to prove best under strong handling. DIAMONDS R LUCKY coaxed along the inside, angled out four deep and finished gamely to the wire.
ADMIRAL RISTY dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. SUIT OF WANDS was allowed to settle
early, raced three wide in the lane and showed good late interest. HEXCEL dropped back off the early going, raced near the rail around the far turn through
the stretch run and had not enough. OLD TOBY pressed two wide and weakened in the drive. QUIET JOURNEY lost ground to race far back and never
threatened.

Footnotes
SHORT STRETCH was off slowly, raced off the early pace after the poor start, moved up through the far turn into the stretch, circled the field six wide and
got up under a strong hand ride. READY stalked the pace, moved up three to four wide and got up for the place position late. GOSPEL BLOSSOM pressed
the early pace two deep and kept on willingly to the wire. MYSTICAL CODE stalked the pace from the outside of foes, raced four wide around the far turn
and had no final winning bid. GIRLS A LEGACY pressed three wide from the outside of foes and weakened through the drive. HOORAY FOR CREDIT vied
near the rail and gave way. GOSPEL EXPRESSION raced six wide around the far turn and had no late rally while racing from the far outside. CODE OF
THE SOUTH dropped back with the second flight, raced three wide around the far turn and had no response. HOT CHOCOLATE raced four wide around far
turn and lacked a solid bid. LET HER BUCK was allowed to settle early, checked near the three eighths pole, had an inside run and never was a factor.
LADY RASHEN chased the pace from the inside and weakened. MIZ RITHYM lost ground to race far back and never threatened.
