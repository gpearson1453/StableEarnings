Footnotes
CHIVE UP assumed the early command into the backstretch and raced well clear in the lane under a steady hand ride. GIRLS IN CHARGE chased two
deep but was no match for the winner in the drive. AKASI coaxed along into the first turn, raced in tight quarters near the sixteenth pole while racing near
the rail and was even late. TAPIT'S LADY dropped to the back of the pack early, swung out five wide into the upper stretch closed in mildly. STOLEN HALO
raced three to four wide and had no late response. NORTHERN GEM stalked along the inside and faded.

TIZ HOPPIN rated three to four wide outside of rivals and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. NORA'S LEGACY stalked the pace, made a
four to three wide bid around the far turn through the stretch and rallied for the place position. REMARKABLE CHARM broke awkwardly losing a
considerable amount of ground at the break, swung five wide into the lane and closed in too late. WITCHY WINDSOR vied for the early lead near the rail
and weakened. BREWSKY raced three to four wide and had no response. SUNSHINE EMILY pressed two deep and weakened. TAYLOR'S SECRET
dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened. TAYLOR'S VISION settled off the early pace and failed to respond.

Footnotes
JOCOTE was sharp to begin, had full control through the far turn and edged clear under a steady hand ride. SHES STEEL DREAMIN was hustled along the
inside, raced two deep in the lane, kept on but was no match for the winner. WENT HOME chased from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch
and kept on to the wire. ROYAL JUDGE had a three to two wide bid and had no late response. BEAUTIFUL JUDGE dropped back early, saved ground and
raced evenly with no closing run. RUN BRINLEE RUN saved ground and never threatened. DISTANT HOLIDAY raced wide down the backstretch, was five
deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SOUTHWESTERN HOPE pressed the early leader from the outside, dug in late and proved best under strong handling. SCREENPLAY stalked the pace
along the inside, angled four wide through the lane and finished gamely to the wire. GOOSE DRANK WINE set a pressured early pace along the inside of
foe while racing just off the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. TIGER THE MAN was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and made a mild late gain. ITS A BOY dropped to the back of the pack early, swung six to seven wide into the lane and had not enough in the drive. EL
CENTENARIO stalked the pace from the outside of foes and weakened in the drive. GONE PREACHIN saved ground and never threatened. SILVER AND
ACES dropped back early and failed to respond.

OPTIMISTIC VALOR stalked the pace between rivals into the far turn, swung out four to five wide and just got up under strong handling. STEPHEN'S
ANSWER showed good early foot to set the early pace and gave way to the winner grudgingly late. COWORKER pressed the early pace three deep from
the outside of foes and weakened in the drive. STAGE DOOR settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. PRIME
CODE reared at the break, saved ground and never threatened. OH BE ONE dropped back and failed to respond.
