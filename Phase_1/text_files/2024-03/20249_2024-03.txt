Footnotes
MARINAS TINA (IRE) broke a hair slow, stalked in the two path then between rivals past the half-mile pole, boxed in entering the far turn and tipped three
wide into the clear, drew alongside the leader under hand urging past the eighth pole and proved best in a measured win. SHE'S MUY MUY sped to the
front and showed the way three wide earl on the first turn before angling down to the rail, challenged by a pair of rivals late on the far turn, kicked clear into
the stretch, confronted by MARINAS TINA (IRE) past the eighth pole, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go and stayed alongside the winner to the
wire. CAMERON SLOUGH dueled from inside then raced greenly to lose ground on the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, shifted out in
the hindquarters approaching the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in the lane and kept on to gain the show. I'M STILL IN IT hard to load prior too the start,
chased three deep or three wide early, bid three deep then fought outside the leader late on the far turn, could not sustain the challenge entering the stretch,
flattened in the late stages and lost the show. DOWHATEVERITTAKES fractious in the gate, chased three then two wide early, bid between rivals on the far
turn, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. ONE ARROW chased along the rail then got shuffled back behind CAMERON SLOUGH into the
first turn which caused the saddle slip forward, the rider then chose to come out of his stirrups late on the bend, pulled up on the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DREAM PRINCESS cleared quickly and moved inside, set all the pace on the rail to the stretch, kicked away when asked right handed at the eighth pole
and drew off under steady handling in the final sixteenth. FLATTERWITHJEWELS closest in pursuit from the two path through both turns, loomed from
outside into the lane, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. ROMAN EMPRESS stalked DREAM PRINCESS from
inside, lost ground on the fence around the far turn, churned on through the lane and outfinished the rest for the show honors. HOT ROD MAMA broke
cleanly but lacked early speed and trailed from inside into the first turn, saved ground at the rear through the far turn, tipped out into the lane and could not
get by ROMAN EMPRESS for third. A BROKEN BREEZE chased in the three path through both turns and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
SNEAKING CANDY gained the early lead and moved into the two path then along the rail late on the first turn while pressured from outside, cleared early
on the backstretch before being hounded by CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES again at the half-mile pole, drew clear at the quarter pole, drifted out in the lane but
remained clear when flagged by the whip and under hand urging through the final sixteenth. ONE TIME MARK broke a step slow, pulled from inside
approaching the first turn, rated behind the leader to the far turn, ridden along at the five-sixteenths pole, put to right handed urging while cutting the corner
into the lane, finished willingly up the fence and gained second. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES chased two wide then moved up to press the leader on the first
turn, lost contact with the pacesetter early on the backstretch, drew alongside SNEAKING CANDY again at the half-mile pole, came under a ride midway
around the far turn, chased the winner two wide into the lane, stayed within range through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick and held the show.
PALAGIO came away slow, lagged behind on the inside early, trailed along the rail then shifted to the two path around the far turn, steered out in the stretch
and produced a mild rally. ZIHUATANEJO came away quickest then chased from the two path early on, asked three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into
the lane, weakened in the stretch run, then walked into the van following the race.

REFOCUS chased briefly then went up to press the leader from outside nearing the half-mile pole, raced on even terms into the stretch, put away inner rival
outside the eighth pole and held well under right handed encouragment. STAY ON THE FENCE brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, chased in range
up the backstretch, came under a ride two wide then near the rail on the turn, moved out in the lane, finished determinedly in the final furlong but had to
settle for second best. PRINCE PRANCEALOT away quickly to take control, showed the way clear early then under pressure from REFOCUS up the
backstretch, maintained a short advantage through the turn and was asked right handed at the quarter pole, dueled into the lane, yielded to the winner
approaching the eighth pole and flattened to third. CLEVER CLOVER raced up close outside the top pair to the turn, could not keep up with the leaders past
the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. SALSATION brushed with outer rival at the start, tracked from inside in the early
going, lost ground around the turn and failed to rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
AVOIR sprinted clear and set the pace up the backstretch, spurted away on the turn, padded the margin to the sixteenth pole under asking and was kept
busy to the wire. CERTITUDE (FR) toss her head to lose a step at the start, continued to fight the rider while pulling along the inside to the turn, lacked room
in traffic on the turn, angled out into the clear, finished well through the furlong grounds but could not reach the winner. TIANMA chased between rivals out
of range, bumped with outer foe into the turn, found traffic around the bend, kept on through the lane and showed late effort to get up for third. ANG N ASH
forwardly placed between rivals, got floated out and made contact with outer rival at the five-sixteenths pole, was closest in pursuit with a furlong left to run,
flattened late but was able to save the show. MS MCWHINNEY stalked three deep into the turn, got bumped by inner rival midway around the bend and
weakened down the lane. DISCREPANCY settled three deep early on, brushed with inner rival three wide into the turn, continued off the rail into the lane,
steered out further and lacked a rally. TOULOUSE DETRAC stalked inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, then weakened in the
stretch run. SMOOTH AS BUTTER lagged behind early, trailed a bit off the rail to the stretch and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
DE JORIA stalked the leader from inside, coaxed along into the far turn, had to wait when boxed in, tipped out past the quarter pole, reeled in the leader
with a furlong remaining, put away inner rival at the sixteenth pole and widened to the wire. MIDNIGHT SILENCE brushed outer rival at the start, tracked
three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, chased between foes at the half-mile marker, made a three wide move on the second turn, put a head in
front at the quarter pole, disposed of inner rival shortly after, led clear in upper stretch, failed to offer any resistance to the winner in midstretch and kept on
for a clear second. HALF NELSON brushed with inner rival then cleared early and took control off the rail, controlled the pace through the middle stages,
was overtaken by MIDNIGHT SILENCE at the quarter pole, chased along the inside into the lane, grew weary in the furlong grounds but was able to last for
third. YVETT'S SURPRISE tracked the pace two wide early, continued in the two path into the far turn, steered out and came five wide into the lane and
missed the show. GLORY OF CHROME stalked outside a pair of rivals through the first turn, dropped back while moving further out on the far turn, entered
the lane six wide and weakened. ZZYZX stalked between rivals two to three wide early, chased outside a rival on the backstretch, between foes at the
five-sixteenths marker, exited the bend three wide and faded.

Footnotes
GRANNY BUDGIE (GB) broke a step slow from outside, settled off the pace, ridden along two wide through the turn, moved out in the lane under left
handed urging, drew alongside the leaders at the sixteenth pole and outfinished the runner-up in deep stretch. SHE IS ROMANTIC chased from off the
pace, got put in tight and checked past the half-mile pole, rounded the bend two then three wide, steered out widest in the stretch, closed well from outside
but was outkicked by the winner. INVINCIBLE MOLLY (GB) broke slow on the inside, chased along the rail then tipped out near the quarter pole, moved out
further in the lane, rallied between in the final sixteenth and got outfinished by the top pair. ELEGANT set the pace under pressure from outer rival, held a
short lead through the turn, held stubbornly to the sixteenth pole, then succumbed to the pressure late. APRIL VINTAGE stumbled badly leaving the gate
but still came away near the front, pressured ELEGANT from outside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle down the lane but faltered
in deep stretch. HIGHLANDS broke in and made light contact inner rival, trailed on the inside then two wide on the turn, kept on to improve position in the
lane but never threatened. MADISON RAE sat off the pace off the rail then steered to the inside past the half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn and
lacked a response when called upon. MS BRIGHTSIDE (IRE) steadied in tight between the leaders crossing over the dirt, stalked the top pair outside a rival
into the turn, paused when inner foe started to angle out at the five-sixteenths pole, cut to the inside at the quarter pole and could not rally in the drive.

Footnotes
COWBOY MIKE broke well then ceded command between rivals, stalked two then three wide around the first turn, remained three wide into the far turn, bid
three deep with a quarter mile left to run, fought four wide into the lane, kicked clear under left handed urging and drew off under steady handling in the final
sixteenth. DIRECT LINE broke a step slow, trailed three then four wide around the clubhouse turn, chased four then five wide on the second bend and was
along for the place. DEPARTURE showed early speed and dueled outside LAMBEAU to the top of the lane, yielded to COWBOY MIKE at the eighth pole
and flattened to third. LAMBEAU sent along the rail to vie for command, battled inside DEPARTURE to the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
GOLD FOOT forwardly placed three then two wide early, bid three deep on the far turn, dueled with inner rival past the quarter pole, inched ahead in the
furlong grounds and drew clear late. WHEN HEROES FLY showed speed from inside then was rated behind the leaders along the rail, went up to challenge
from inside at the half-mile pole, vied inside rivals on the far turn then dueled with GOLD FOOT late on the bend, fought back inside that rival into deep
stretch and faltered late. GORILLA BOY stalked two to three wide early, took aim three then two wide on the far turn, failed to produce a bid in the stretch
run but stayed on to secure third. TRANSCENDENTAL raced greenly in the two path around the first turn, chased between rivals on the far turn and
bumped outer rival at the quarter pole, kept on through the lane and earned a minor award. GAZON (GB) broke out, chased three then four wide outside a
rival on the clubhouse turn, continued in the three path outside rivals on the second bend, got bumped by at the quarter pole and failed to rally in the furlong
grounds. WRONG DIRECTION broke a bit slow, steered to the inside racing towards the rear, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out leaving the
bend and could not make an impact. UPLIFT pulled on the inside then between runners around the first turn, continued to tug the rider along on the
backstretch, was coaxed along on the far turn then had to pause when finding traffic at the quarter pole, gained a clear path and failed to menace in the
lane. POTENTIAL SPAM threw his head at the start and came away slow, trailed outside a rival early on, rounded the far turn two then three wide and was
never a factor. TIGER BY THE TAIL vied for the lead early then cleared on the first turn, confronted by inner rival at the half-mile pole, dueled into the far
turn, vied between rivals around the bend, failed to keep up approaching the quarter pole and gave way in the drive.
