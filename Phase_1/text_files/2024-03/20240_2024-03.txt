Footnotes
THE LAST JUMPSTART , three wide around the turn, closed outside LITTLE SKIPPY, took the lead near the sixteenth pole then drove clear. LITTLE
SKIPPY hesitated at the break, accelerated down the backstretch, took a two wide lead on the turn, lost the lead late and held the place. MONEY ROOM
lacked speed, circled the turn four deep and offered a slight rally. INFINITE SERIES , a forward factor in the two path between horses around the turn,
weakened in upper stretch. MOONFLYER chased the pace, raced along the inner rail on the turn, gave way and swung out entering the stretch. GREAT
GOOGLYMOOGLY sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail for three furlongs and faltered entering the stretch.

Footnotes
THE GREAT GAZOO , four wide outside rivals into the turn, moved up under asking and engaged the leader nearing the quarter pole, wandered outward a
bit before being straightened, dueled outside MONCRIEF leaving the furlong grounds, gained a slim advantage nearing the sixteenth marker then was fully
extended between rivals to prevail. BOLD HONOR ,sluggish from the gate, edged up five wide under some coaxing into the turn, circled five to six wide into
the stretch, ranged up outside foes leaving the sixteenth marker, challenged while on his left lead and narrowly earner the place. MONCRIEF sped clear
early, set the pace towards the inside, drifted out some when collared nearing the lane, battled gamely inside foes through the final seventy yards and just
missed second. DREAMS DELIVERED , three wide chasing the early pace, shifted inside around the turn, had aim into the stretch but came up empty.
PRINS FIRE rated close up early, saved ground pursuing past the three eighths then faded. EL DE LEO saved ground while off the pace, remained inside
while under a ride into the lane but lacked a rally. KATIE'S NOTION stalked off the inside, failed to kick on mid turn and gave way. NEVER COAST broke
slowly, hustled up early, dropped back around the turn, was pulled up late and vanned off.

Footnotes
WATCH YOUR TONE edged up inside near the five eighths and stalked the pace, took closer order as a duel developed around the turn, eased out four
wide into the lane, leveled off when put a drive, forged to command a furlong out, kicked clear then held firm while kept to task. THE HAUNTED ROOM
stalked three wide, was under asking mid turn, shifted out wider for the drive and churned on through the final furlong to nab the place. BOURBON
WILDCAT rushed up leaving the chute, bid inside a rival then cleared, set the pace towards the inside, was joined around the far turn, dueled then was
guided off the rail into the lane, ceded command a furlong out then gave way grudgingly. BOSSYNESS sped to the early lead, was overtaken from her
inside heading to the five eighths, prompted outside the rebid around the far turn, dueled, failed to kick on with leading pair near mid stretch then faded.
CANOODLE , towards the inside, was under pressure mid turn, eased out some in the drive but lacked a solid response. ALWAYS FORWARD , off the
pace and four wide outside a rival early on, shifted wider for the drive and faded.

Footnotes
MALINOIS set the pace near the inner rail, was pressured around the far turn then steadily drew away through the stretch while kept to his business.
MASAKADO , three wide entering the first turn, prompted the pace outside the winner, weakened in the drive and held the place. IN THE DANCE lacked
speed, swung four wide leaving the far turn and had a mild rally outside foes. KING'S RIVER hugged the inner rail around the far turn, swung to the four
path in upper stretch and flattened out inside rivals. KINGDOM FORCE , three wide the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, swung to the four path in
upper stretch and gave way. BRYSONS OPTION stalked the pace well off the inner rail, raced in the two path the far turn and gave way mid way on the
turn. BROTHER LAD , outrun, stayed along the inner rail around the far turn.

SWEETERTHANWHISKEY , four deep advancing into the turn, dropped in a path and bid three deep near the three eighths, emerged in a duel outside K
KAKE POP leaving the five sixteenths, gained a slim advantage a furlong from the wire, drifted out a bit from left handed asks then dug in tenaciously
between runners to prevail. MADDIE TEN broke a step slow, recovered and moved up to the inside of a rival nearing the half mile marker, continued a rail
run mid turn, came out with aim on the duelers in upper stretch, drifted in from right handed asking leaving the three sixteenths, was guided back out, closed
steadily outside foes and nabbed the place. K KAKE POP sped clear early, set the pace towards the inner rail, was joined by a pair of challengers leaving
the far turn, battled to the inside of the winner from mid turn to the final yards and gave way grudgingly. BYTHENUMBERS , in mid pack about two wide,
eased out some and churned on. REGALED hesitated at the break, raced well back into the turn, saved ground around the turn and through the lane and
finished with interest. STORMY MIDNIGHT , three wide stalking the early pace, bid between foes exiting the far turn, vied, failed to keep pace with the
leading pair into the lane then faded. MIA'S ANGEL , off the pace, raced two to three wide, checked when attempting to work through a seam mid turn then
failed to seriously recover. CHAVETA lost ground five wide and faded. TIA MAYIN flashed speed two wide, pursued to the three eighths then retreated.

GOLDEN CANDY , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, bid for the lead outside TAKE A HINT near the sixteenth pole, drifted out late and lasted.
GOING TO THE LEAD commenced his move three wide turning for home, swung outside in mid stretch and closed gamely. TAKE A HINT set the pace in
the two path around the turn, was still clear in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. OUTKISSED , up close inside horses around the turn, remained near
the inner rail in the stretch and failed to sustain his move. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , steadied in tight quarters about a sixteenth of a mile after the break,
raced along the inner rail throughout and passed tired horses. OUR PRIDE N JOY , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor. TOP BOSS showed
speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way. NAKED AND FAMOUS , fractious at the starting gate, was no factor.

Footnotes
C C ROYAL rated three wide outside the leader, took over nearing the three eighths, edged clear under a light hold soon after, responded when shaken up
into the lane, widen nearing the eighth pole, was given one firm left handed ask then cruised home through the final sixteenth. SOCIETY BALL , three deep
early, advanced four wide into the lane, gave hard chase of the winner through the final furlong and finished with good energy to be well clear of the rest.
HONEY B B rated off foes leaving the chute then moved up between rivals, was under pressure chasing three wide into the lane, came in under right
handed encouragement and impeded COUNTRYCLUB COUPLE near the three sixteenths, corrected and went evenly through the final furlong. BUNNY
HOP set a pressured pace inside, ceded to the winner after about a half mile, pursued to upper stretch then gave way. LADY CHARLOTTE broke slowly,
raced off the pace, angled out six wide for the drive and failed to respond. COUNTRYCLUB COUPLE had speed inside a pair of foes then eased back a bit
near the five eighths, was under a solid ride saving ground and chasing the pace mid turn, eased out into the stretch, was taken up when impeded near the
three sixteenths, dropped back and was eased late. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the ride of COUNTRYCLUB COUPLE, HONEY B B was
disqualified from third and placed last for causing interference in the stretch

Footnotes
UTTERLY ENCHANTING , up close four deep through the opening half mile, secured command in upper stretch then pulled away while kept to her
business. NO MORE MASK disputed the early pace in the two path between horses, remained prominent inside foes in upper stretch then faded. LUCKY
LORRAINE , well off the duel, raced in the two path on the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. ICE CUBE
BABY raced along the inner rail on the turn, eased out for the drive and offered a mild gain. GOLD TIME VIXEN raced along the inner rail around the turn
and was not a factor. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY , a forward factor along the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and gave way. THEA'S THEME disputed
the pace between horses and gave way leaving the turn.
