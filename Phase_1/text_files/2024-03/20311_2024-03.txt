Footnotes
ALIMARA (FR) was away from the gate slowly, saved ground around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, swung out
to the five path coming around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to get up for the win late. SEGESTA raced in
the four path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far
bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and dueled to the wire to just miss. NOVARA raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off
the pace on the inside, began a bid from the four path coming around the second turn and gained ground late to narrowly miss. VICTORIA'S DANCER
raced in the two path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second
turn and improved position in the lane. TWISTED ROMANCE tracked the leader on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn
still in the two path and kept on to the finish. ACTIVE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the
run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path and finished evenly. MAYFLY raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and weakened in the stretch. LUCEVAN LA STELLE saved ground early, led
the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend and tired in the stretch. RUE CAMBON raced in the three path around the
first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace between horses, navigated the second turn from the two path and showed no kick. AIR MASQUE raced in
the three path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and faded in the lane.

no bid. STAGE RIGHT raced in the four path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and was never a
factor.

the winner home from there. MBAGNICK (CHI) saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the
far bend from the three path, was forced out slightly in upper stretch and improved position in the final furlong. DYNAMIC ONE raced off the pace on the
inside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the four path, bumped mildly with DASH ATTACK entering the lane, was pushed out in
upper stretch, and kept on to the wire while never truly threatening. IMPACTO saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled
from the rail around the far bend and faded in the stretch. DASH ATTACK raced in the three path early, settled off the pace between horses up the
backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the second bend, bumped lightly with DYNAMIC ONE passing the quarter pole and made no bid.
