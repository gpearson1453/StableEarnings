Footnotes
RACING STAR stalked the pace two and three wide, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. BULLET BLUES broke inwardly and slowly, advanced four
wide around the turn and rallied for the place. YASUR set the pace along the rail, was collared in upper stretch and held well enough for the show.
PRAISEWORTHY dueled three wide and weakened in the lane. MIDNITE MUSKET broke through the starting gate, chased the pace three wide and faded
in the stretch. MAKE THE BED was outrun while racing five wide. ZAINO hesitated at the start, threw his head after the gate opened, broke several lengths
in arrears and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AIR INVASION rated inside, was roused from the rail into the far turn, but got stymied from the quarter to the top of the stretch, got thru while rallying along
the rail in upper stretch, and was up at the wire. CIAO CHUCK hopped at the start, showed the way from the two path turning into the backstretch, came
under coaxing going into the far turn, dug in while drifting out to the four path passing the eighth pole, was corrected, but was nailed by an inner foe at the
wire to place. STICKY MCSHNICKENS laid up close in the four path, bid two wide around the far turn, floated out to the five path while heading the inner
pacesetter in upper stretch, but evened out in the final furlong to show. SALTWATER COWBOY broke slowly, laid off the pace in the two path down the
backstretch, was roused midway around the far turn, swung out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. MASTER MUNNINGS
trailed in the four path, fanned out to the nine path entering the stretch, and never factored. RIVERWALK stalked inside, tipped out to the four path under a
drive turning into the stretch, but faded. SWEET TRAVELS tracked in the three path, was ridden around the far turn, but weakened from the six path in the
stretch.

POWER ATTACK set the pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. THREE ZERO prompted the winner in the three path, could not gain on that foe
but kept on to hold clear of the rest. LIEUTENANT STAN saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and was along for the show.
FRISSON failed to menace while racing three and four wide. YEAGER chased the pace inside and weakened in the lane. WINE EMPIRE was off a step
slow and trailed inside.

BRAWN vied for the lead along the inside, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and dug in to
hold off an outer foe. THE MONOPOLY MAN broke well and laid up close in the four path, bid three wide rounding the turn, floated out to the six path in
upper stretch, and ran on, but hung to place. ROAR READY prompted the pace between foes in the three path but flattened in the stretch for show.
SECRET LOVER raced off the pace in the five path, drifted out in upper stretch, and did not threaten. CLASSIC BALLAD tracked from the two to three
paths, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and weakened. ALWAYS A WAY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HALON rated in the two path, tipped out to the four path while being roused midway around the far turn, swung from the six path into the lane, drew clear of
the inner pacesetter passing the sixteenth, and held sway. REGGAE MAN trailed in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, angled out to the seven
path in upper stretch, and rallied for place. NEVER SAY NEVER stalked in the four path, was coaxed along while three wide rounding the far turn, tipped out
to the six path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. SOUPER CRUNCHY laid off the pace in the three path, steadied between foes entering the
backstretch, was roused between foes from the two path into the far turn, but had to steady again midway around the far turn, and finished evenly.
FOXTROT HARRY laid up close in the three path, was cued into the far turn, but was one paced between foes down the lane. STUD MUFFIN chased in the
four path but never threatened from out in the ten path down the stretch. LEGENDARY PHANTOM showed the way along the inside down the backstretch,
received right handed cues passing the quarter, but yielded in the final furlong. OCONEE LIFE tracked in the two path but was empty entering the stretch.
