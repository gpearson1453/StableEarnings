APRIL VINTAGE set the pace while kept well off the inner rail and prevailed with something in reserve. ROCKY BAY RAE bore out leaving the starting gate,
raced in the four path around the turn and gamely chased the winner through the stretch. ZORINA , between horses on the backstretch, swung to the five
path at the head of the stretch and was no threat. CAN'T WANT THAT prompted the pace outside the winner, drifted to the eight path leaving the turn and
weakened. BOURBON TIGER chased the winner racing inside horses and weakened. CAT ON THE RUN trailed.

TONY'S TAPIT stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch while confidently handled, circled the turn four to five wide and eagerly pulled away
through the stretch under some mild coaxing. ARIZONA ANDREW showed early speed between horses, lost the lead to the winner on the turn, swung wide
entering the stretch and was second best. WE MISS GENO , a brief early factor between rivals, swung wide leaving the backstretch, remained wide on the
turn and weakened. ARIZONA STEPHEN showed brief speed inside horses on the backstretch and gave way. I'M MR. SHENANIGAN stayed near the inner
rail around the turn while outrun.

KENNEBEC , patiently handled behind horses while near the inner rail for six furlongs, swung wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside foes, led
late and drove clear. MR. WHO set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) , outside
horses down the backstretch, remained wide on the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. KEEN HEIR stayed inside horses throughout,
was well positioned in upper stretch and failed to sustain the move. TULANE TRYST , four deep the first turn, took aim on the lead between horses leaving
the far turn and gave way in the drive. IMPOSSIBLE TASK hopped at the break, prompted the pace to the stretch and gave way. SEA TO SUCCESS , in
the three path the first turn, was four wide the far turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
NASHVILLE SKYLINE , right to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and eagerly drew out through the stretch while under pressure. I'M NOBLE
drifted off the inner rail leaving the first turn, stalked the pace, remained well off the rail and rallied mildly. MOUNTAIN BREEZE , three wide the first turn,
worked between rivals in the stretch and rallied mildly. MR LOVE MUFFIN offered a four deep advance on the far turn then failed to sustain the move.
GREENBRIER raced inside horses most of the trip and passed tired ones. NOTACRY chased the pace and weakened late. GO LAKER GO , outrun, stayed
along the inner rail on the far turn. HEIR (FR) lacked speed, saved ground on the turns, remained near the rail and lacked room in mid stretch. PANZER
PRIDE , squeezed back at the start, failed to be a factor and circled the far turn some five wide. EL CAPRICHO chased the pace, checked in tight quarters
between rivals near the three eighths pole then dropped back.
