off the turn but was caught late. BOOK MARKER was off a step slow, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and finished well late. LIDIA'S
PRAYER stalked the early pace three wide, advanced three wide on the turn, kept on but needed more late. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN chased the early pace
on the outside, dropped back on the turn and then improved late on the outside. ABBY'S SPIRIT chased the pace in between rivals and weakened.

TWIXTER was away alertly and sent to the front and crossed over to set a slow pace in the two path, then turned back bids from both sides leaving the turn
and held well to prove best under a drive. MARCUS JUNIUS stalked the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole but hung in the lane,
second best. DON'T QUESTION ME was rated early, made a inside bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out the final furlong. MUSKOKA GIANT was
allowed to settle early, three wide by the quarter pole but lacked the needed bid. LONG TOM steadied four wide into the first turn, then moved to the inside,
advanced on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn but had no late rally. SWEEPIN HARD was five wide into
the first turn, reserved early and never threatened. SOUL STORY was settled two wide early and was not a factor.
