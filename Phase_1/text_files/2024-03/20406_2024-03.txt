Footnotes
SPECIAL FLOWER broke a step slow, tracked in range off the inside, rounded the bend two wide before angling out four wide into the stretch, rallied to
offer a challenge with a furlong remaining, kicked clear at the sixteenth pole and held safely. LOVIN' ON THE RUN settled off the pace and moved inside,
inched closer around the turn, steered out with a furlong remaining and finished well for second. IRISH ROSE stalked two wide early, took aim outside the
top pair three wide into the stretch, challenged between runners at the eighth pole and got outkicked by the top pair. STRIKINGLY stalked the pace from
inside, followed the top pair while in-hand through the turn, stayed along the fence in the stretch run and lacked the needed late kick. COLLECTIVELY off
alertly to assume command, set the pace under pressure from PONTRESINA up the backstretch, dueled around the turn while relinquishing the lead,
regained the advantage in upper stretch but weakened in deep stretch. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT broke a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, raced along
the rail then angled three wide late on the bend and could not make an impact. PONTRESINA went up to press the leader from inside, took a slight lead
while dueling around the turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

MAN OVERBOARD raced up close four deep, roused four wide at the quarter pole, took over when asked left handed in upper stretch, had the rider lose his
whip approaching the eighth pole, kicked clear in midstretch and held late under hand urging. CRYPTO RIDE broke a bit slow on the outside, climbed a bit
while dropping back and lagged behind to the turn, traveled two wide around the bend, angled out with a quarter mile remaining and came four wide into the
stretch, rallied late and was gaining to the wire. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK fractious in the gate, stalked briefly then went up to press the pace three deep,
angled down to the inside at the quarter pole and weakened while saving the show. THALES dueled from inside then inched ahead to take control, led two
wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, weakened in the late stages and lost the show. AMERICAN CAT bobbled leaving the gate, chased briefly
then pressed the pace from between rivals, fought three wide into the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
TOM SEAVER settled outside a rival off the pace, drew closer two then three wide on the turn, confronted IMMELMANN at the eighth pole, took over shortly
after and drew away in the final sixteenth. TWO BY FOUR reserved at the back early on, ran up on heels leaving the backstretch, came under a ride saving
ground on the turn, tipped out into the stretch and rallied to best the rest. WHERE IT'S AT showed brief speed then stalked the lone leader off the rail,
followed IMMELMANN two wide through the turn, chased between in upper stretch and got outkicked for the place honors. IMMELMANN vied briefly inside
rivals then cleared to show the way up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, roused into the stretch, challenged by the winner at the eighth pole,
could not offer much resistance and weakened in deep stretch. CATMANSUE sat off the pace in the early going, saved ground through the turn, tipped two
wide into the lane, had to alter out behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, kept on trying but needed to find more late. BEER MONEY raced up close
between rivals then took a stalking position, traveled on the fence around the bend, got boxed in from upper stretch to the sixteenth pole, then weakened
late. OOBUBBAKAKAYO chased outside a rival at the back, ran up on heels and steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend two then three
wide, cut in at the top of the stretch and could not threaten.

Footnotes
SHARP AZA TACK was closest in pursuit to the outside of the pacesetter to the stretch, drew alongside at the top of the lane, gained command at the
eighth pole and drove clear under right handed encouragement. MACKINNON stalked the pace from inside and finished willingly up the fence for second.
ZOFFARELLI (IRE) stepped to the front from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, lost command at the eight pole and flattened to third. LINCOLN HAWK
(IRE) dropped back early, angled to the inside, advanced along the rail through the turn, tipped out into the stretch and summoned a mild response to round
out the superfecta. TIME TO PARTY chased off the pace then ran up on heels at the half-mile pole, had to pause again when running up on heels at the
three-eighths pole, chased three deep between rivals and bobbled approaching the quarter pole, brushed outer rival shortly after, kept trying in the lane but
failed to threaten. ESCAPE ROUTE tracked outside rivals, went four wide into the turn, brushed with TIME TO PARTY near the quarter pole, came five wide
into the lane and lacked rally. MYNUMEROUNO (AUS) got put in tight between rivals early, raced in range between foes into the turn, lost positions around
the bend and weakened. NABOKOV stalked off the inside, went three wide or three deep around the bend and faded down the lane.

ROBERTA'S LOVE broke out but was away alertly, raced up close three deep early, chased three wide into the turn, bid outside the leader at the quarter
pole, dueled into the final furlong and proved best in the late stages. BIT'S TIGER MAGIC dueled between foes early, inched ahead at the half-mile pole,
cleared into the turn, moved over to the rail, challenged again around the bend, dueled into the final furlong and yielded to the winner. EPIONE broke a step
slow, chased four deep to the turn, three deep into the lane and finished willingly for a clear third. SKY SAILING dropped back early, trailed along the rail
through the turn and was never a factor. WISHES TO RICHES dueled for the lead inside a pair of rivals then chased into the turn, saved ground around the
bend and faded down the lane.

STAY AND SCAM stalked outside a rival then two wide on the turn, drew alongside CHANCERY WAY at the quarter pole, dueled across the dirt and into
the lane, cleared inner rival while having the rider lose his whip in upper stretch, then held gamely under strong handling in deep stretch. CHANCERY WAY
cleared early and moved inside for the turn, confronted by STAY AND SCAM at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, chased the new
leader into the final furlong, then kept to task along the fence and came back on late. CHISMOSA chased two wide into the turn, tipped outside the top pair
at the quarter pole, jumped onto the dirt crossing fighting three deep for the lead, lost touch with the winner approaching the eighth pole, stayed on well
through the final furlong and got outkicked for second. MADIHA stalked the pace from inside, saved ground through the turn, roused entering the lane,
moved out a bit in upper stretch and gained ground late. ALL DIALED IN trailed in the early going, went inside a rival entering the turn, saved ground
through the bend, moved out a bit in the drive and summoned a mild rally. SCARY FAST RIDE unhurried in the beginning, went three wide into the turn,
moved out to the five path around the bend, took an awkward step crossing back onto the turn, kept trying in the lane but needed to find more late. ROSE
MADDOX tracked outside a rival, took the turn three to four wide and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
DEPARTURE away quickly and led two wide into the first turn outside a rival, lost command and pressed the new leader from outside, lost touch with the
pacesetter around the far turn, chased two wide into the lane, came back on in midstretch and edged away late. THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) showed
early speed inside DEPARTURE and took over around the clubhouse tun, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, cleared with a quarter mile left to
run, challenged again by DEPARTURE in midstretch, resisted into the final sixteenth and yielded late. CANDY FOR CARMEL stalked three then two wide
early, moved inside and saved ground around the far turn, steered out in the lane and finished willingly for the show honors. MIDNIGHT FURY tossed his
head and broke a step slow, stalked outside a rival four then three wide early, continued three wide into the far turn, moved into the two path around the
bend, tipped back out entering the stretch and finished evenly late. GRANADA FLAVOR chased three wide into the clubhouse turn then shifted to the two
path, moved out wider on the backstretch, rounded the far turn four then thee wide and lacked a rally. ZIMBA WARRIOR sat off the pace on the rail, trailed
into the far turn, continued along the inside on the second bend, came out at the top of the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LIVING LIFE unhurried in the early going and tucked inside at the back, moved out on the backstretch and drew closer outside rivals, advanced four deep
on the far turn then was driven three wide into the lane, chased three deep into the final furlong, drew alongside CALM SEA with a sixteenth left to run and
dug in to best the runner-up. CALM SEA away quickly from inside and took control under pressure from MO REWARDS, cleared briefly into the backstretch
then took pressure again from that rival in the middle stages, held a short lead through the far turn, cleared again in upper stretch, tested by LIVING LIFE at
the sixteenth pole and got outkicked in the end. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) stalked from inside through both turns, looked to tipped out but got boxed through
the stretch and finished willingly without ever getting a clear run. MO REWARDS prompted the pace from outside, lost contact briefly into the backstretch
then went up to apply pressure again in the middle stages, kept the heat on CALM SEA through the far turn, lost touch with the leader approaching the
eighth pole and could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. RECKLESS SPIRIT reserved in the early going and moved inside, trailed into the
far turn, continued to save ground to the stretch, then moved out in the lane and needed to find more late. ORDER AND LAW stalked the pace between
rivals, got put in a bit tight approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide turning for home and lacked a rally. NASHOBA'S JOY stalked while racing keenly
in hand outside a pair of rivals first time through the stretch, continued thee wide into the far turn, got put in a bit tight approaching the quarter pole and
weakened down the lane.
