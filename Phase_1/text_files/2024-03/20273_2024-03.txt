Footnotes
RACKATAPTAP stalked the pace off the inside, continued closest to the leader the middle half, engaged that one from the outside turning for home, wore
that same rival down under firm handling. CHELSEA DAGGER settled off the pace inside, came in the two path for the drive, steered out wide, drifted out a
bit past the furlong marker, up late for the second spot. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke on top, set the pace while in hand, continued to rate into the far turn,
responded when confronted by the winner late in that bend, dueled upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, caught late for
the place. VINCENZINO within striking distance off the rail, continued three wide, came up empty for the stretch run to finish up evenly. CHISHOLM TRAIL
four wide into the first turn, raced in the two path through the second bend, lacked a closing response. GALACTIC EMPIRE made little impact while saving
ground. RED DEVIL broke back, was finished early, far back, jogged in.

JUST AN OPINION in the second flight off the inside, moved closer three wide exiting the turn, outside bid, kicked clear under steady handling. SHE'S NOT
A JOKE pressed the issue off the inside, challenged inside the winner and between horses into the stretch, proved no match the final furlong, remained
clear for the place. SPACITYGAL in the second group inside the winner, continued to save ground through the turn, along for the show while not a serious
threat to the top two. BUSINESS AS USUAL off a step slow, raced back off the pace, steadied in some traffic early in the turn, two path into the stretch,
slowly gaining for the show. ST. OLAF ROSE unruly in the gate, went one paced while racing three wide. DEVIOUS DIVA broke back, raced outside, four
wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. MISS CLASSIFIED behind the pace while racing toward the inside, had little for the drive. WEST COAST
HARBOR broke back, was used to advance up the inside, showed the way into the turn, began to weaken when confronted by the top two entering thge
stretch, continued to falter in the run to the wire. MISS TERRE off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BAYRON void of early foot, improved inside of horses into the lane when advancing, moved out slightly then dropped back to the rail with less than a furlong
remaining, closed with good resolve up the rail to be in time. RAYMOND behind the pace, clipped heels, lost irons briefly turning for home, regained, bid
between horses, led late, nailed. LAMUTANAATTY last away, back off the pace inside, swung out abruptly four wide to avoid trouble turning for home,
rallied midtrack, late bid outside, hung in the final strides. PROVOST prompted the leader in the three path and the outside, bothered briefly when the runner
up clipped heels and took up late in the turn, regathered, took over outside and showed the way past the furlong marker, weakened soon after. WILDWOOD
MINISTRY back off the pace while three wide, lacked a closing response. GOOD HEART broke on top, set the pace in the two path, gave way in upper
stretch after the incident late in the turn. STRINGS in mid pack early while racing off the inside, staged a steady retreat after a quarter. FOLLOWING A
BRIEF STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN OUT OF THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ZIPPY MARK with the pace while three wide and between horses up the backstretch and into the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, drew well
clear under firm handling through the lane. YOUNG JONESBORO bothered soon after the start, raced well back off the pace and the inside, two path turn,
rallied and closed with good resolve to gain the place inside of a pair of rivals, not a serious threat to the winner. STILLBILLY in mid pack while just off the
inside, came three wide for the drive, not enough late for the place while prevailing for the show. DALTON'S RUTROW pressed the pace four wide into the
turn, continued forward and outside through the bend, chased the winner past the furlong marker then weakened late to close a couple of positions.
PERSCRIPTURE broke back, lacked speed off the rail, improved position through the lane without posing a serious threat. BET ALL THE GOLD came in
soon after breaking forwardly to tighten up a couple of rivals, cleared, showed the way into the turn, vied through the bend then began to weaken when
headed by the winner late in the turn. MR. BENNY saved ground to no avail in finishing up evenly. WELCOMETOARKANSAS reluctant to load, broke on
top, pressed the pace off the inside, briefly vied between horses early turn then began to weaken. CRIME ZONE broke back, bothered in the early going,
void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. LITTLE BISCUITS dwelt at the start, sluggish to fall well back, never involved while
racing off the inside. MONEYSTRIKE behind the pace toward the inside early, moved out to be four wide late in the turn, faded. WON NINETY off the pace
well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE with the early pace outside, vied three wide through the turn, held a slim advantage into the stretch, well clear by the furlong marker,
enough left to hold off the runner up. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL behind the pace inside, steered out to the two path and between horses turning for home,
slight drift past the furlong marker, missed. BLOW TORCH lacked speed, came four wide through the turn, rallied for the show, not a serious threat to the
top two. JUNIOR BUG bobbled to be off slowly, moved out, four to five wide through the turn, improved position. STELLAR TAP in the second flight off the
inside, three wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. IAN GLASS pressed the issue early in the two path, vied between horses through the
turn, faltered in the drive. LARRY'S LEGEND was never a factor while racing toward the inside. GOOD SCOUT flashed brief speed along the inside and
stopped.

MO MOVES dueled up front off the inside, alternated into the far turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane in the three path and drove well clear.
STRASSE broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn while a bit keen, dueled the middle half, proved no match for the winner through the stretch,
narrowly gained the nod to save the place. GOLDEN DIVERSION chased the dueling leaders toward the inside, moved out and was three wide and behind
the winner turning for home, could do little with that one in the run to the wire, missed the place. STRICKLAND bothered to be off slowly, raced back off the
pace, advanced in the three path through the second turn, continued to improve position through the lane. BIG ANDY MORT five wide into the first turn,

Footnotes
GAME KEEPER outrun early while in hand, moved into a contending position with a good rain off the inside through the second turn, collared the leader
inside the furlong grounds and drew clear late. MONEYSHOT took command after the start, set the pace while rating inside, extended advantage 2nd turn,
offered brief resistance to the winner late, clearly second best. MILITANT in mid pack while racing outside, four wide far turn, mild rally to finish up best of
the rest. TOP OF THE STREET went one paced while racing toward the inside. CHUN MONEY settled off the pace while outside, continued four wide
through the second bend, made little impact down the stretch. MR SCATTER fell back to trail after the start, continued back the middle half mile then
improved position the final quarter with some mild late interest. MANFREDI four wide through the first turn, moved inside to save some ground through the
second bend, lacked a rally in the drive. ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT pulled early when chasing the runner up, continued to pursue that one in the run up the
backstretch, gave way in the final turn. JUST BE HAPPY remained always back in failing to threaten. BRAVEN forwardly placed for a half while three wide,
gave way far turn.

Footnotes
INSENSITIVE in the second flight off the inside, closer midway on the final turn, idled along behind the lead flight late in that bend, moved out three wide,
inside bid, gained the nod at the wire. PARIS STYLE (FR) lacked speed, tipped out to be four wide turning for home, challenged on the outside inside the
furlong marker, late duel, just missed. FLASHY LASS forwardly placed while three wide, took over turning for home, briefly clear past the furlong marker,
could not contain the top two. MY GOOD FORTUNE off a step slow, raced back, rallied mildly three wide out of the final turn to improve position. TYRONA
pressed the leader from off the inside, weakened when called on for the drive. MAKEMEBELIEVE saved ground well off the pace, continued inside second
turn, lacked a closing response. GHAALEB'S RANGER lacked speed while racing off the inside, made little impact. XYLOPHONE in mid pack and four wide
through the first turn, continued outside and raced in the four path through the second bend, came up empty for the drive. TOO PRETTY broke on top,
cleared to the inside, set a pressured pace four six furlongs then gave way when headed. MY MY void of speed, was never involved. DREAM STREAK in
the second flight along the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
DICEY WAGER closest to the leader off the inside up the backstretch, continued to pursue that in the two path through the turn, bid between rivals entering
the stretch, gained the advantage and held off the runner up after an extended drive. GREAT BARRIER in the second flight three wide and outside,
challenged in the three path into the lane, extended drive to the wire, outkicked. SUNDAY SPIRIT also in the second group for a half while inside, waited
behind horses into the stretch, lacked a closing punch when clear. PREACHER'S KID in mid pack along the inside, went evenly through the stretch in also
lacking a closing kick. AMAZING SUCCESS in the second group while between horses for a half, steered out to be widest for the drive, lacked a finishing
response as well. CLASSIC CINEMA sprinted clear after the start, set the pace for a half along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner in upper
stretch. SWIFT KEY went one paced while saving ground throughout. SAFETY dwelt at the start, raced back, failed to menace. PREPAREDNESS void of
speed, continued to race back when steadied when in some traffic three wide late in the turn, remained back. TOMMY TRI finished early, four to five wide
late in the turn, stopped in the drive and jogged in.
