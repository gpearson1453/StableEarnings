Footnotes
ELLE'SBIGSEACRET stalked outside, closed to the front three wide approaching the head of the lane and was steadily handled to hold on well. RUFFNER
exchanged light contact with GUN FACTOR on the chute then pressured that one through the backstretch, contested the rail on the turn and cleared second
past the eighth pole. The latter came away a bit awkwardly and exchanged light contact with Ruffner on the chute, set a pressured pace inside but was met
two deep while between horses midway on the turn and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. SPIRIT OF WINDSOR gave chase, raced off the rail on the
turn and showed little in the lane. PINK DINGHY gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane.

BAYTOWN FROSTY gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in for the lead nearing mid-stretch and was steadily
handled to widen later yards. GOLDEN KEY set a pressured pace inside, rounded the turn near the rail, drifted leaving the turn but lugged in and made
sharp contact with AMIDSHIPS in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, then flattened late yards. The latter gave chase and raced near the rail on the turn, dug in
leaving the turn but was bumped sharply and checked in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and showed little more. ROCKET APPEAL angled to the outside
and gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and closed the gap in the lane. PIT STOP MAN chased inside through the backstretch, was roughed
at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, angled out toward the quarter pole and raced wide on the turn. The Stewards reviewed the incident at the sixteenth
pole, but took no action.

SHEWEARSSTILETTOS chased the pace inside, angled outward toward the head of the lane, left the turn outside and dug in to get up the final strides.
WINDSOR'S MEMORY moved to the inside and set a pressured pace, raced with the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch
encouragement but was caught in the final strides. DIXIE YODELER raced well back from early contention, rounded the turn near the rail, angled to the
outside past the eighth pole and finished well to take third the final strides. PLAYING FOR TWO gave chase and dueled to even terms while drifting outward
toward the head of the lane, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened the final yards. LIL BOUGIE gave chase, entered the turn about the
five path, angled in midway through the turn and weakened the final sixteenth.

NOCASHREFUNDS stalked off the rail the first turn, started his bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead in the three path at the quarter, contested
the edge through the turn and dug in from the head of the lane to move clear later yards. ESPRESSO stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged
nearing the three eighths pole and had a slim lead approaching the five sixteenths, but was met at the quarter, remained close at the rail from that point but
relented later yards. SUMMONING DENIS saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and improved his position, raced off the rail on
the far turn then flattened stride later yards. STROLLINGINTHEWIND saved ground on the opening turn then moved to the outside into the backstretch,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and showed little more. TREASURER settled off the rail the first
turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened. SCARE DEM was shuffled back soon after the start,
saved ground racing well back on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM stalked inside, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened past the five sixteenths. BERTRAM FLIGHT veered out leaving the gate then moved to the inside and
rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths and faded readily at the rail.

QUALIFLY raced with the early pace two deep, took the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, put Too Bad Justice
away midway on the far turn but picked up the challenge of Gabriel's Wing at the same time, dug in to clear that one past the eighth pole and held on under
steady handling. CAPE LOOKOUT settled off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, was
carried out into the far turn but angled back to the four path toward the head of the lane and finished well to take second late yards. GABRIEL'S WING
stalked from the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew to near even terms midway on the far turn, but, dropped
back past the eighth pole and flattened stride later yards. BUSTIN PIETRE saved early ground close to the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, bore outward into the far turn, corrected course to the three path then flattened while in an outward drift through the lane. HIS ROYAL G saved ground
on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. HOT N SPICY LOVE was not a factor. TOO BAD JUSTICE set the early pace inside,
was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened.
