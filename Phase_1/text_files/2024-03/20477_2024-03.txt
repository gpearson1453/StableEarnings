Footnotes
ANOTHERDAYGONEBY raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two
path coming around the far turn and kicked clear in the lane. SING SCAT saved ground early, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and chased on to the wire. DRILL'S VALENTINE raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, came
around the turn in the two path and improved position in the lane. CUPIDS DREAM raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and faded in the stretch. SNEAKY CHEEKY raced in the three path early, settled in the
middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and tired in the lane. SUWANNEE
CHICK raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and was never a factor.

LITTLE VIC chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground late to pull clear. DOCTOR OSCAR led the
way on the inside early, battled from the two path around the bend and continued to battle to the wire to get caught late. SPIKEZONE pressed the pace on
the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and into the stretch and gave way late. ABSOLUTE GRIT veered out
leaving the gate, raced off the pace through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path and never threatened. ROSES BY LIAM trailed the
field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
