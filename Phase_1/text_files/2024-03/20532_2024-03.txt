Footnotes
BRAHMS IMAGE with the pace from the start after an alert break, dueled into and through the turn, headed by a second rival when straightened for home
between calls, regained the advantage soon after, kicked well clear under steady handling. HOPPIN JOHN lacked early foot while between horses, closer
three wide late turn, shifted out, rallied for the place while not match for the winner. RUDIANO behind the dueling leaders in the three path, advanced on
that pair turning for home, briefly put a head in front upper stretch then began to gradually weaken, saved the show. PEPPERONIKID broke back, lacked
speed toward the inside, steered out five wide late in the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position, no real threat. THIRD WATCH stumbled to be away
slowly, trailed for a half, came in the two path for the stretch drive, improved. PARTYINTHESTREETS in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through
the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. SIR PEEL back off the pace, angled out four wide late in the turn, had little left for the drive.
SECRET TAVERN tired while racing inside. VYING EDGE restless gate, broke in good order, dueled up front in the two path, stopped.

Footnotes
GO CATS last to leave, moved up to mid pack inside, moved out a bit for the middle half, idled in traffic late in the final turn to upper stretch, split foes past
the furlong marker, gained the advantage, came out late under a pair of late handed crop strikes to pinch back BEN DREAMING then was edging clear late.
UNSTABLE PRINCE trailed early, steered out three wide when advancing late in the final turn while mired in some traffic, rallied while widest down the lane,
up late for the place. CALRISSIAN in the second flight while inside, continued to save ground second turn, crept closer and improved into the lane, lodged a
rail bid inside the furlong grounds, outkicked late. BEN DREAMING within striking distance in the three path, moved closer into the lane, stalled midstretch,
rebid late, pinched back when GO CATS came out in the waning strides and was forced to check up. QUINCY MARKET dueled up front while racing off the
inside, continued to vie into the lane, remained closest to the leader with a furlong to run, faltered in the late going. PHILHARMONIC moved up to duel along
the inside, continued to narrowly set the pace the next half mile, allowed CALRISSIAN the inside as he was being challenged from the outside, with less
than a furlong remaining, also faltered in the late going. FIGHT'N READY lacked early foot, fanned five wide out of the final turn when attempting to make a
run, came up empty for the stretch run. NACHO CHROME was finished after a half, trailed home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BEN DREAMING AGAINST GO CATS FOR INTERFERENCE, THE
LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
THORNY close from the start off the inside, moved to engage the leader into the far turn, dueled through that bend under confident handling in the two path,
quickly kicked clear in upper stretch and extended that advantage while being shown a left handed crop to win ridden out. AUNT ALEX in the second flight
while between horses, followed the winner in the two path into the lane, set down, no match, clearly second best. PRINCIPAL ANITA bothered to be off a
step slow, raced back, four wide through the second turn, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. VALERIE BLUE off slowly then was pinched back
to trail early, improved position without posing a serious threat. PEPPERS GIRLFRIEND back off the pace while just off the inside, in the two path through
the second turn, roused turning for home, failed to muster a significant response to finish up evenly. ANNAMARIA broke on top, set the pace inside, dueled
with the winner through the final turn, first to blink into the lane, continued to weaken through the lane. LOST LOVE four wide into the first turn, remained
outside the middle half while in the three path, gave way through the stretch. CRY IF I WANT TO in the second between foes into the first turn, forwardly
placed, began to fade after a half. ELUSIVE EMPRESS in mid pack, was finished after half.

Footnotes
CYBERTOWN forwardly placed from the start, took over in the two path before a half, saved ground when showing the way into the stretch, kicked well
clear under steady handling. POINT BLANK settled behind the pace while five wide into the first turn, advanced into contention four wide turning for home,
no match for the winner, far clear of the rest. WATER TO WINE shuffled back from a forward position late first turn, mid pace, two path through the second
bend, improved position. MR WORKS within striking distance while six wide into the first turn, remained in a forward position while angling in a bit, vied
between horses and outside the winner second turn, weakened in the drive,. HOWL YEAH void of speed while three wide through most of the first turn,
continued back, three wide second turn, improved position with some mild, belated interest. MR. COUGAR well back off the pace, swung five wide into the
stretch, improved position with some modest late interest. KINFOLK went one paced while racing three wide, lacked a closing response. MADMARTIGAN
raced in mid pack while off the inside, four wide into the lane, had little left for the run to the wire. SINGING GROOM set or forced the pace early while
angling toward the inside, began to weaken when headed by the winner just before a half. FETCHS BRAHM bumped at the break, raced five then four wide
first turn, continued outside, four to five wide second bend, remained back. ROYAL DE BE bobbled then bumped with FETCHS BRAHM at the break to be
away slowly, never close. WICKED PRINCE vied early between horses, stopped.

Footnotes
MYSTERY MO stalked the pace inside, advanced and challenged along the rail in the second turn, drew out at will through the lane won geared down and
ridden out. AWESOME FAMILY lacked speed while four wide through the first turn, three wide through the second, rallied for the place, no match for the
winner. CANADIAN GAME prompted the pace in the three path, carried five wide turning for home, came up empty for the run to the wire. BOLDISH void of
speed, swung out four wide turning for home, displayed some mild interest to improve position. GALACTIC EMPIRE in mid pack while off the inside, lacked
a response to finish up evenly. EVERLOVINGHAND broke on top, set the pace in the two path, allowed the winner the inside far turn, got out soon after,
backed up through the stretch. PROMISING SHOES squeezed back to trail after the start, remained back in lacking a rally. DREWPOWER in mid pack just
off the inside, had little left for the drive. RED DEVIL remained always back, jogged in.

Footnotes
STORM STRATEGY outrun in the early going off the rail, advanced two to three wide second turn, bid, extended duel, proved best in determined fashion.
DOUBLECHECK forwardly placed off the inside, collared the two leaders three wide midway on the second turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch
between calls, hooked up with the winner inside that one, dueled to the wire, outkicked. GET AWAY WITH IT void of early foot, continued back, angled four
wide into the stretch, rallied to be clear for the show, no match top two. MANSOURA broke well, fell back while five wide into the first turn, three wide while
still in mid pack second turn, went evenly through the stretch. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT chased the early leader inside, moved out and challenged that rival in
the two path far turn, dueled inside the runner up late in that bend then began to falter. SPEAKING LOUD three wide first turn, one paced, dropped inside
second bend, no late kick. BRAHMS JR. last away, raced back, improved position three wide while not a serious threat. TOMMY TRI void of speed, made
little impact while racing in the two path. MR. BENNY off the pace, floated out five wide turning for home, lacked a closing response.
WELCOMETOARKANSAS rank, clear early, stopped, when headed far turn. BIG ANDY MORT devoid of speed, angled in toward rail late first turn, lost
action five furlongs out, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
BRESLAU forwardly placed from the start, moved closer in the two path by late in the turn, engaged the leader soon after, lone duel to the wire, dug in late
to narrowly prevail in game fashion. CHATTALOT broke on top, cleared early inside, continued to show the way by a diminishing margin through the turn,
reacted when confronted by the winner late in the bend, raced on equal terms with that one to the wire, outdueled late. PAYNE in the second flight up the
backstretch, shuffled back between horses late in the bend, lost position as a result into upper stretch, coming again late to finish up willingly. G T FIVE
HUNDRED in the second group inside up the backstretch, encountered some traffic with a half mile to run, continued to save ground through the turn,
closed the gap a bit on the top two late while being caught for the show late. MANTA REY within striking position while racing three wide through the turn,
lacked a winning kick. INFILTRATOR broke back, lacked speed, steered in late turn, failed to menace. ROB THE RICH in the main body outside, four wide
through the turn, failed to muster a rally. VODKA MARTINI veered in at the break, remained always back while racing inside.

TWEETSTER broke back, moved up to chase the lead pack up the backstretch and into the turn, continued to pursue that trio through the bend in the two
path, got through a large opening in upper stretch, collared the leader inside the furlong marker to win going away. HURRICANE FIRE broke on top, vied up
front closest to the inside, shook off the other speed into the lane, no match winner, saved the place. BARSTOOL BABE in the main group off the inside,
three wide into the lane, rallied and was getting to the runner up late. VICKI ROSE brushed at the break when off a step slow, raced back, three to four wide
into the lane, improved upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. GOLDENSHUGA came out, bumped CHURCH SERVICE after the break, came in
the two path for the drive, improved slightly, never dangerous. RUBY QUEEN brush at the break, raced four wide late turn, also bettered herself a bit without
posing a serious threat. CHURCH SERVICE bumped soon after the start, dropped to the inside turn, lacked a closing kick up the rail. CALIFORNIA ROLL
void of speed, fanned six wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. MOR HAPPY HOURS in the main group outside, five wide midway on the turn, faded
through the stretch. BABY AVERY broke well, vied up front three wide for a half and gave way. ALESSIA also away in good order, contested the pace while
between foes, also backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MASQUEPARADE settled off the pace and the inside, began to advance in the two path under some clever handling into a striking position through the third
turn, moved back and set sights on the leader when straightened for home, nailed that rival in the final jump. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY cleared to the inside
into the first turn, showed the way under stout restraint past the wire the first time, continued to set a semi pressured pace the middle half mile, clear again
into the stretch for the final time, nailed in the very late going. SPEED BIAS within striking distance off the inside, remained within contact while three wide
through the final turn, lacked a closing punch in the drive. RED RUN broke with the runner up, chased that one under restraint most of the way, weakened in
the drive. O P FIRECRACKER settled in mid pack, advanced and loomed a threat four wide turning for home, hung in the drive. GAME KEEPER worked
way to the inside about halfway through, continued one paced to the wire in lacked a closing response. COMMANDPERFORMANCE four wide through the
first two turns while well off the pace, three wide through the third, also failed to produce a rally. STRONG TIDE saved ground to no avail throughout.
MASTER GAME forwardly placed early outside, remained four wide and tired. DOUBLE CROWN was always back to be outrun. DECISION MAKER was
last away, was never close.

Footnotes
NEOM BEACH forwardly placed inside, continued to track while saving ground through the final turn, switched out past the furlong marker, closed with good
energy to be in time. PROMISEMEANEMPIRE settled off the pace and the inside, four wide turning for home with advancing, continued well to the end to be
up for the place. MERASOL SUGAR broke on top, set all the pace, rated middle half, faltered in the late going. I'M A MESS in mid pack and off the inside,
staged a mild rally to improve a bit in the drive, no real threat to the top three. LOOKSTER chased the leader while off the inside, weakened when the real
running began at the head of the lane. IN GOOD TASTE one paced while racing outside. MIWOMAN void of speed, swung out turning for home, showed
some belated interest while not a threat. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU in mid pack, gave way while racing four wide in the second turn. DIVINE GAL in the
second flight, steady fade after a half. BROUGHTY FERRY last away, carried out five wide into the lane, remained always back.
