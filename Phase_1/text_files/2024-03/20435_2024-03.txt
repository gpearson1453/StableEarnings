Footnotes
MEETMARYSMAN saved ground on the opening turn, closed toward contention through the backstretch then waited for room rounding the far turn, dug in
at the rail leaving the turn, took the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. CURB THAT TIGER settled two deep on the first turn, gave chase into the
backstretch and steadily improved, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out past the eighth pole then dueled through the stretch for second. ASTRAYAL
raced well off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the outside
leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. Wearing no front shoes, THUNDERHOUSE raced in the five path the opening turn then
stalked outside into the backstretch, challenged at the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn and remained a factor to late
stretch before flattening stride. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE stalked the early pace three wide then took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole, dug in to the
challenge of Thunderhouse leaving the three eighths, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, kept the edge through the upper stretch but was met
mid-stretch and flattened late. ONE CANDY CASTLE raced off the rail the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, had range on the leaders in the four path on the far turn but weakened toward mid-stretch. HE'S CLEVER raced with the pace inside on the first turn
but steadied at the rail leaving the turn and showed little response through the backstretch. J. WICK raced with the early pace two deep while between
horses, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

Footnotes
YO VINNIE raced in the four path the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, circled rivals in the five path on the far turn, took over toward the
head of the lane, raced clear past the eighth pole and widened under steady handling. JUDY'S ARMY rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn, relented to the winner past the eighth pole
and had to settle for second best. REBEL WARRIOR rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the
rail approaching the head of the lane, flattened past the eighth pole and just lasted for third. TREJO raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. NET WORTH was bumped leaving the gate then steadied while
attempting to bear out the first turn, left the turn in mid track, gave chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and passed some
rivals. SHAMELESS APPEAL stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but flattened near the rail on the far
turn. RAINBOW DAY rounded the opening turn in the three path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened
stride in the five path on the far turn. AGAIN WE MEET angled to the inside after the break and never factored. ADIOS COOL ARROWS came away
awkwardly and made contact with Net Worth, stalked off the rail the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
CAYENNE CREEK settled in the four path the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path the far turn, dug in under
steady handling leaving the turn and took the nod in the final strides. ROYAL THUNDER rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the quarter
pole, raced at the rail through the turn and dug in under steady handling, but was caught in the final strides. NEVER CHANGE raced in the three path the
first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, lugged inward under left hand urging through the
lane, but finished evenly. BERNIE'S ON FIRE raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path but flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. MYSTIC POINT raced in the four path the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. MISTER WINSTON stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the
rail on the far turn. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail
on the far turn.
