Footnotes
NOTACRY prompted the pace five wide outside rivals, was floated out by SCOPELLO when challenging inside the furlong grounds, kept on determinedly
under pressure and just got up. SCOPELLO took over early, set a rated pace off the inside, was guided further out entering the lane, wandered outward
under left handed asks nearing the sixteenth marker, continued gamely and just missed. FULL BORE attended the pace four wide between foes, steadied
lacking room when SCOPELLO drifted nearing the sixteenth pole, altered inward and finished well. COASTAL FOG tracked towards the inside, swung well
wide soon into the lane but could only muster up a mild response. PASSION OF JOE'S broke slowly, lost contact with the field after a furlong, was pulled up
and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of FULL BORE, SCOPELLO was disqualified from second and placed third for
causing interference in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGER HUNTER steadied back from between rivals soon after the break, regrouped and settled well off the inside, commenced a run leaving the far turn,
rolled up six wide entering the lane to engage rivals, forged to command nearing the sixteenth marker and eagerly widened under a drive. HEARTBREAK
KID vied five to six wide outside a rival, gained a slim lead leaving the three eighths, dug in when collared from the outside near the quarter pole, clung to
command inside foes nearing mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. PHILBIN ROAD , five wide, moved up to threaten near the five
sixteenths, vied between foes in upper stretch then was out finished. START THEM UP , towards the inside chasing the leaders, rushed up near the half,
briefly threatened, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and weakened. SHADYFIED prompted off the rail and inside runners, offered a mild challenge
between rivals near the half mile marker then tired. JOHN GREY grabbed command into the first turn, handled outside pressure while well off the rail,
dueled leaving the far turn, stayed on to about the quarter pole then succumbed.

Footnotes
SOL DEL SUR , confidently handled four wide outside the leader, moved to command in upper stretch, rapidly widened once given his cue and proved
much the best under a steady hand ride. SHIP IT RED , bumped at the break, was taken to rate early while off the inside, advanced five to six wide nearing
the lane and gave willing pursuit to the wire. O'BANION (IRE) , towards the inside chasing the leaders, failed to initially quicken under a hearty ride exiting
the far turn, swung out to be seven to eight wide in upper stretch and finished with interest. BEDROCK sped to the early lead, ceded command heading to
the half, stayed on towards the inside to prompt, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. FAR BEYOND , bumped at the start, raced forwardly while
between runners, failed to go on in the drive and faded. STAY HAPPY hopped at the break, regrouped and rushed up between foes to poke a head in front
nearing the half mile pole, took outside pressure around the turn, ceded the lead into the stretch and tired through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ROCKY BAY RAE , snugly rated between rivals nearing the turn, steadied back off foes soon after, angled out and gathered momentum six wide into the
lane, surged to command outside MUSICAL DIVA nearing the sixteenth pole then drew off under a solid hand ride. MUSICAL DIVA vied two to three wide
inside a rival, was roused clear soon into the lane, wandered outward near mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. MY BELLA FOR LISA , brushed at the
break, chased outside rivals early, moved up five wide under a ride into the lane, shifted in leaving mid stretch and kept on with effort. WILD RULER rated
off the pace, came about six wide for the drive but lacked a solid rally. MY QUIET PLACE disputed the pace three to four wide outside MUSICAL DIVA,
angled in with chase near mid stretch and faded. MAYA D drifted out some after the break, corrected to chase to the inside of a rival and gave way.
PRAIRIE MOON drifted out at the break and brushed with MY BELLA FOR LISA, was taken well in hand while off the inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BIG BELL , in a bit tight at the break, raced between foes into the turn, swung out well wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly under pressure and forged
to command outside rivals to get up late. DAWN AT LAST , taken up sharply at the break, moved up four to five wide and to the inside of a rival nearing the
lane, closed in under pressure, threatened between rivals in deep stretch and earned the place. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND , four wide outside a rival, took
command into the lane, shook clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, clung to lead to deep stretch, was taken on by the top pair to her outside and
gave way grudgingly. LUCKY STEPPER , off the pace while saving some ground, moved off the inside around the turn, swung out for a clear run near mid
stretch and rallied. PALACE STAR chased off the inside and came up empty. BINALLOVERDRINKEN chased well off the inside, circled six wide into the
lane and faded. SHOUT IT OUT , inside foes near the three eighths, shifted out then lacked room with run nearing the sixteenth marker. JUMPING JILL
FLASH sped to the early lead, set the pace off the rail while pressured, ceded command into the stretch and weakened. THE REIGN SONG , towards the
inside leaving the far turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR attended the pace five to six wide outside rivals, bid near the three eighths, dueled in upper stretch, took over a furlong out and drew
clear late under a drive. MR. CLUTCH rate close off the inside, bid between foes leaving the far turn, battled four to five wide while between foes into the
lane, could not quite go with the winner nearing the sixteenth marker but finished gamely to be second best. SPEEDING STYLE had speed to lead early,
sparred between runners leaving the far turn, fought on the inside of the top pair near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. LIE AND DENY chased the
pace came about five wide for the drive and closed steadily. MORE HONOR , three wide behind the embattled leaders, faded. MY CALL lagged back, raced
very wide in upper stretch and got past fading foes. TEXAS HEDGE steadied at the break, raced four to five wide in upper stretch then lacked some room
near mid stretch. LITTLE CASINO altered in early and moved up to the inside of runners to contest the pace, raced between runners leaving the far turn,
fought on to the inside of horses nearing the lane then weakened. WEAR THE CROWN broke a step slow, was used inside to threaten nearing the turn,
vied to mid turn then gave way.

Footnotes
AVALON KING cleared early and set a rated pace, came three to four wide into the lane and held firm under a drive. PLAYOFF BOUND saved ground,
edged up nearing the half mile marker, chased, moved up to threaten the winner from his inside in mid stretch, could not quite kick on with that one but
stayed gamely to hold down the place. MR NAVIGATOR , four wide advancing to the far turn, gave hard pursuit from there but came up empty very late.
KALINE , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and offered a mild rally. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) saved ground, was under pressure leaving the far
turn, eased out and offered a late run between foes. MOVE OVER (GB) , five wide heading to the half, came up empty. ZUMURUDEE , wide for the drive,
was not a factor. HOLY EMPEROR steadied off heels heading to the first turn, raced about two wide past the five eighths but failed to generate a rally. MAD
LUTHER , wide, was not a factor. BEAT THE HEAT failed to menace. PONTI PRIDE , three to four wide, was not a threat. SMOOTH PAPA chased the
winner and faltered.
