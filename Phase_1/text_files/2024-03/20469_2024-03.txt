SAPPHIRE BEAUTY stalked the early pace three wide, made a three to four wide bid nearing the bend, then was guided out to the five path off the turn
while clear, then drifted about in the furlong grounds but kept clear to the wire to prove best, driving. LUNITA was settled early, was two to three wide on the
turn and swung out six wide leaving the turn, shifted farther out to close well getting the nod for the place award. ICE CUBE BABY was off about a length
and a half slow, then was ridden along on the turn four wide, came six wide off the turn and finished willingly, shifting in leaving the sixteenth marker and
missed the place award. LUCKY LORRAINE was reserved early, inside on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a good late rally. A GIRL
NAMED JAC was settled early and saved ground on the turn, remained on the rail but had no kick in the drive, even effort. CALYPSO GHOST dueled for
the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane. GRANDIOSELY dueled for the lead two wide and tired.

bend, then came five wide off the turn and shifted in a bit nearing the furlong marker, then battled with MARTY'S MAGIC in the furlong grounds and
switched back over to the right lead late to prevail late under a strong urging. MARTY'S MAGIC pressed the pace from the outside, made a three wide bid
nearing the quarter pole to vie for command, then was between rivals nearing the furlong marker and fought on to the wire but was out-gamed by the
winner, good effort. CAVENDISH vied for the lead in between rivals, made a bid on th e turn to vie for command on the inside off the turn but faded in the

WHIRLWIND RIDE set the early pace while clear on the inside, then was headed off the turn and weakened in the final furlong, lost show award late.

SUPER SIMPLIFY was well placed on the inside, eased out nearing the bend and made a four wide bid off the turn and edged clear to prove best under a
drive. LOTTIE DENO threw head at the start and was off slowly, then advanced on the outside and made a three wide move on the turn to gain a short lead
off the turn, but was out-kicked by the winner while staying on. KILO ROAD set a pressured pace and then dueled for the lead on the inside but faded late.
ENEMYNUMBERNINE was reserved early and two wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the urn and had a late rally. GETTOTHSTORYIMDONE
was settled early, two to three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had a mild late rally. YINGLE BELLS pressed the pace and made a
two wide bid on the turn to duel for command but weakened. HOT DANCE was settled back on the inside, angled out in the lane and was not a threat. BEA
STREET was reserved on the inside and failed to menace.

DETERMINED DRIVER stalked the early pace setters three wide and in the clear, made a outside bid in hand to take over by the quarter pole, then drew off
to prove much the best while being ridden out. KISSEDBYANANGEL rushed up the inside to vie for the lead early, then set the pace on the inside, shifted
out to the two path byt the five sixteenths, then came three wide off the turn while chasing the winner, proved to be no match for that rival while winning the
place battle. AOIFE'S MAGIC vied for the early lead two wide, then stalked the pace two wide, dropped to the inside when the pacesetter shifted out on the
turn, then was out-kicked for the place award in the final furlong while clearly besting the rest. KISS FOR LUCK was bumped at the start, chased the pace
on the inside and was ridden along on the turn and tired. GO SHERRY GO was bumped at the start and then checked, then settled three to two wide and
was not a threat.

Footnotes
COPPER TAX was settled along the inside early, eased out on the turn and came six wide into the lane, closed well to get up in time to prove best, driving.
INVEIGLED tracked the pace and rated kindly, made a three wide bid off the turn and continued the bid to th wire but was outfinished to just missed in
between rivals late. SPEEDYNESS was three wide into the first turn, then went ahead to set the pace on the inside, then was pressured and made a bid
leaving th e turn to shake clear, then dug in by the sixteenth marker but was caught late. CIRCLE P was four wide into the first turn, then had an outside
pursuit on the backstretch, advanced on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and finished well late but needed more. STARTSWITHADREAM was
bumped at the start, settled three to four wide, then dropped to the inside on the far turn, advanced by the quarter pole, then tipped out leaving the turn and
bumped POINT DUME while making a bid but flattened out. SPEED RUNNER passed the tiring rivals. POINT DUME pressed the early pace three wide,
then two wide and was bumped hard off the turn and tired. CELTIC CONTENDER was fractious in the gate, off a step slow and bumped after the start, then
reserved on the inside and tired. I KNOW MAP was settled back two to three wide and never factored.

Footnotes
SHORT OF DINERO set the pace while in the two path, shook clear off the turn and then dug in to maintain a sade margin to the wire to prove best, driving.
JOB'S NOT FINISHED was rated along two wide, angled out for aim leaving the three sixteenth and finished willingly but could not get to the winner while
being second best. PEACHESSWEETNOTION stalked the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, but flattened out, bested rest. RIA
FORMOSA tracked the early pace from the outside, then was three wide on the turn, shifted out by the three sixteenths and bumped DIVINE SPIRIT but
had no rally. COAL'S MAGNOLIA was well placed on the inside early and weakened. DIVINE SPIRIT was off a half a step slow, then advanced five wide by
the quarter pole and came wide into the lane, then was bumped by the three sixteenths and tired.
