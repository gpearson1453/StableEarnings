GAME'S KARTEL was quick to begin from the outside, challenged near the eighth pole and held safe under steady handling. WANTABE pressed the early
leader from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. TIZ RED TIME was hustled along, raced near the inside
throughout and had not enough in the drive. SCORE MCCOY was off slowly, raced three to four wide in the lane and never threatened. BUY NOW was
hustled throughout, raced four wide around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
SAMURAI'S GRANDSON rated along early, made a good rail bid around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to prevail under strong handling.
TIZKANDOIT pressed the early pace from the outside of foes and finished gamely to the wire. LONG COOL stalked the pace from the outside of rivals,
loomed four wide around the far turn and flattened out. MEET GEORGE JETSON dropped back to race mid pack, raced three to four wide and closed in
mildly. DADSAMUMBLER hustled early, raced five deep into the upper stretch and raced evenly to the wire. CAN DANZER dropped back early, raced five
to six wide around the far turn and never menaced. WATCHNTHETIDEROLL vied for the early lead between down the backstretch and gave way. FRUIT
CUP failed to respond. DONNY'S GOT GAME was shuffled back at the break and never threatened.

Footnotes
RING TAILED TOOTER was bumped soundly at the start, made an early three wide bid near the three eighths pole and finished well to get up under strong
handling. ASTA LAVISTA HONEY vied for the early lead two deep from the outside of rival and kept on willingly to the wire. RYAN EXPRESS was allowed
to settle early, made a three wide bid in the drive and moved up to improve position. SKYLINE was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and closed in mildly. BREAKING THE BANK checked sharply soon after the break, raced three to four wide and had no late rally. CORTE chased
the pace three deep and weakened. LAST NATIVE CAT vied for the early lead near the inside and gave way. R T'S IRON MAN raced two to three wide and
had no response. RISKY SITUATION stalked the pace and tired readily.
