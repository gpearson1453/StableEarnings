Footnotes
MIRAGE CODE forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent early pace then went up to press HAPPY CHAPPY approaching the half-mile pole,
kept close attendance to the pacesetter while two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, repelled into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker,
re-rallied into the final sixteenth, wore down the game runner-up in deep stretch and got up at the wire to determinedly prevail. HAPPY CHAPPY broke
alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a decent early pace while pressured to the half-mile marker, pressed into the turn by MIRAGE
CODE, shook free of that rival into upper stretch and led to the furlong grounds, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, all out in deep stretch while holding a
slim lead, gamely battled to the final strides and nipped on the wire for the win, while holding safely for second. LEEDSTHESKY crowded a bit at the start
and away awkwardly, settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, tipped three wide for the
drive, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not catch the top pair in deep stretch and held well in the end for third. OOPS (GB) bobbled at the start
and off slowly, allowed to settle, steered outside of runners into the turn and went three to four wide to the quarter pole, rallied while widest into the stretch
and missed for show honors. RIVER OF AMBITION close up to the decent early pace, lost ground along the turn and went two wide to the quarter marker,
maintained that two wide path into the stretch and gaining in the final furlong. RICKELLE forwardly placed in the early running, took back off of the decent
pace and tracked into the turn, came under a ride two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, gained ground into the final furlong but failed to threaten.
LADY PROUD unseated the rider prior to the start and ran loose before loading, raced close up to the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn, lacked
a response in the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COME OUT FIGHTING was sent from the outside draw and was first to the turn, then left alone on the lead and allowed to dictate moderate fractions while
leading the field to the far turn, repelled a bid from DADS DREAM near the quarter pole, opened up again at the top of the stretch, drew away under steady
handling and intermittent urging and won well, easily holding the others at bay. CLASSY CITY was slow into stride from the break, spotted the field a head
start then was pushed to regain contact with the field while angling over to the rail, steadily advanced up to mid-pack through the backstretch run then
attempted to start a rally on the far turn but became boxed in, waited for room, rallied up the rail and finished well to gain second. DADS DREAM was
hustled out of the gate but ceded the lead to COME OUT FIGHTING, opting to set a couple of lengths behind for the first half-mile, launched a bid from the
three-furlong pole and loomed a threat nearing the stretch but was rebuffed, then ran on well to the finish but was outkicked in the final yards for the second
spot. BOURBON DANCER broke alertly but was not asked for speed, tracked mid-pack in the three path for the first half-mile, angled in a path for the run
through the turn, started to run on when given the cue passing the three furlong marker, came three wide into the stretch and finished evenly under steady
handling. HELEN'S SUN trailed early and was never a threat.

Footnotes
ROSE OF JERICHO vied for the early lead between runners, ceded the front to AH BIRDY and stalked that rival through decent fractions heading to the
half-mile marker, chased two wide into the turn and took command at the quarter pole, shook free into upper stretch and led to the furlong grounds, drew to
a clear lead while kept to task into the final sixteenth, pulled away under hand urging in deep stretch and prevailed as much the best. SHADOWED
THOUGHTS broke alertly, vied for the early lead from the outside, took back and tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased four wide
into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, battled with ROSE OF JERICHO into the stretch, no match for the winner in the final furlong and
bested the rest. MAMARANDO away in good order, vied for the early lead between runners, took back and stalked the decent pace three deep approaching
the half-mile pole, loomed three wide and between rivals nearing the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and outkicked at the furlong grounds, could not
match strides with the top pair into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and held clear for third. MISS PERU prominent away from the start, tracked
the decent early pace from the inside, got caught in tight entering the turn while behind a tiring rival, shifted two wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly
to mid-stretch and gave way. ANNA'S GIRL took back off of the decent early pace, went three wide into the turn and did not offer a response in the stretch
drive. AH BIRDY vied for the early lead between runners, assumed command and set the pace to the half-mile marker, overtaken into the turn and lost
position nearing the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

SONOMA DREAMING broke out a step at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, assumed early command and set decent fractions approaching the
half-mile marker, extended the lead into the turn, well handled along the bend and carved out a moderate pace heading to the quarter pole, drew clear while
in hand into the stretch, kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth and held sway. SELSAE crowded by SONOMA DREAMING at the start, off a step
slowly and settled while not far back in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, shifted two wide into upper
stretch, chased the winner through the final furlong, could not make headway on SONOMA DREAMING in the late stages and held well in the end for
second. MS FLASHY HARBOR rated just off of the decent early pace, stalked between runners nearing the half-mile pole, maintained a two wide path
between runners and came in tight along the turn, found room in upper stretch, shifted to the inside and lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the
final sixteenth and missed for second, while holding for third. ADAPTED MEMORY showed speed and prominent in the early going, stalked the decent pace
outside of SONOMA DREAMING approaching the half-mile marker, chased the pacesetter two to three wide along the turn, could not keep pace into the
stretch and weakened. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS tracked the decent early pace three deep, chased into the turn and went three to four wide nearing the
quarter pole, widest into the stretch, outrun to the furlong grounds and tired.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST settled into a tracking position behind the early pace duel, saved ground through the far turn, went into a stiff drive from the five-sixteenths
pole, slipped through a big hole up the rail into the stretch when CHIEF JACKSON drifted out on the last turn, was kept to task under steady handling and
intermittent urging, took a short lead in the final furlong and just lasted. KO SAMUI (IRE) got floated three wide through the first turn, then dropped to the
back of the field early, moved a bit closer down the backstretch still racing in the three path, circled the field on the far turn, came into the stretch four wide,
sustained the rally and gained the place. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) lacked any speed from the break and settled at the rear of the field on the inside through
the first turn, continued to save ground on the far turn, had some trouble finding clear run in the stretch but finally did so with a furlong to run and surged too
late but was able to gain the third spot. CHIEF JACKSON was pushed from the break to get forward position, got the inside run through the turn joined by
LYING GHOST to the outside, went clear near the five furlong pole with the rider attempting to temper the pace, held sway through the turn then responded
when set down passing the quarter pole, took a short lead into the stretch and battled gamely with ECOLOGIST making a run to the inside and LYING
GHOST coming back on to the outside, soldiered on but was outfinished in the final yards. LYING GHOST dueled on the lead with CHIEF JACKSON to the
five furlong marker then dialed back and let that rival go on with the lead, settled into a tracking position to the far turn, then started a bid with three furlongs
to run, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch, kept on willingly under strong handling but was unable to pass the rival and weakened in the final furlong.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was content to settle from the break then made steady forward progress racing two to three wide, made a three wide bid through
the far turn and came into the stretch four wide but the rally stalled before mid-stretch and was outrun in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BOLD ENCOUNTER hustled away from the start, forwardly placed in the early stages and stalked the fast pace approaching the half-mile marker, steered
outside of HOT CAKE and stalked that runner two to three wide into the turn, roused into upper stretch and battled with HOT CAKE to the furlong grounds,
repelled that rival and kicked clear into the final sixteenth, kept to task in deep stretch and held safely in a drive to prevail. MISCHIEF'S KING rated nicely off
of the solid early pace, saved ground along the turn, shifted two wide nearing the furlong marker and full of run at mid-stretch, responded to urging and
finished well into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner but could not reel that one in at the finish and bested the rest. LAST BABY prominent away from
the start, tracked the quick early pace from a two wide position, lost ground along the turn, went two to three wide into the stretch and re-rallied at the furlong
pole, needed more into the final sixteenth and outfinished HOT CAKE to secure show honors. HOT CAKE bobbled leaving the start, maintained her balance
and assumed command in the early going, showed good speed and set quick fractions while clear at the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn while
on a clear lead and carved out a fast pace approaching the quarter pole, came under pressure in upper stretch and met the bid of BOLD ENCOUNTER to
the furlong marker, weakened into the final sixteenth and outfinished for third. LIFESBEENGOODTOME made contact away from the start with GALLOPING
MAJOR then jostled by that rival and off slowly to begin, unhurried in the early going, raced two wide to the quarter marker, improved position in the stretch
drive but could not impact the leaders in the final stages. RIVERMARK took back off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and did not factor in
the drive. GALLOPING MAJOR bumped by LIFESBEENGOODTOME at the start, in turn sharply bumped that rival away from the gate and off slowly,
lacked early speed, went three to four wide nearing the quarter pole and did not threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
GROGU was not asked for speed from the break and got caught three wide into the clubhouse turn near the back of the field then pulled the rider forward to
be even with SIX HOT GRANDS after passing the six furlong pole, pressed that foe on the outside while being confidently ridden, took command passing
the quarter pole, responded when roused at the top of the stretch, took command and held on under steady handling to prevail. GOODBYE DAL veered out
after the break and bumped GROGU, angled over to the rail into the first turn, settled mid-pack through the early going, was nudged on to get closer after
passing the five furlong pole, advanced into contention through the turn still racing near the rail, waited for room from the quarter pole then got free at the top
of the stretch, ran on well under strong handling, had some trouble keeping a straight path in the late stages but held on to the second spot. FAR TO LONG
got a good inside run to the turn then raced close up briefly contesting the pace between horses approaching the five furlong marker, backed off a bit and
stalked heading into the turn, went into a drive with three furlongs to run when the pace quickened, loomed three wide at the top of the stretch, was
outkicked in the drive and held well for third. CATALINA COCKTAIL came away well and was taken in hand while settling into a tracking position, then raced
at the head of the tracking group with the rider attempting rating tactics, was let loose near the half-mile pole, made slow but steady forward progress
towards the leaders while three to four wide on the far turn, came into the stretch with good momentum and was slowly gaining ground on the leaders while
never a serious threat. UNION HEIRESS broke slowly and spotted the field a head start, lagged well behind the field through the first turn, pulled the rider
forward down the backstretch still well behind the pack, angled over to the rail, chased the field through the turn, and finished evenly. WHY LOOKY HERE
broke well but caught four to five wide through the first bend, dropped back to last as the field went down the backstretch, came under a drive from the three
furlong pole, did not go on and trailed the field to the wire, passing one straggler in the late stages. SIX HOT GRANDS broke in and bumped CATALINA
COCKTAIL after the break then overcorrected and veered outward into open space, still managed to be first to the turn and opened up on the field early,
was pressed to the outside by GROGU passing the five furlong pole and that rival was a constant shadow to the quarter pole, came under a drive at that
point but was unable to keep up and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MARS ON FIRE prominent away from the start, rated nicely off of the decent early pace, well placed approaching the half-mile marker, went two to three
wide along the turn, loomed three to four wide into upper stretch, took command nearing the furlong grounds, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and drew
away under hand urging in deep stretch. MR. FIGHTER rated off of the decent early pace while never far back, shifted to the two path into the turn and
tracked the pace nearing the quarter pole, came in tight and waited behind runners into upper stretch, found room along the rail nearing the furlong marker
and closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and held well in the end to secure place honors. CURVY CURLS showed
speed away from the start and disputed the early pace three deep, stalked three to four wide into the turn, chased the leading pair to the quarter pole and
asked for run four to five wide into the lane, outkicked at mid-stretch, stayed on well into the final sixteenth and outfinished for second, while holding safely
for third. WESTERN CAPE away in good order, took back off of the decent early pace, tracked from the outside approaching the half-mile pole, raced three
to four wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, brushed with MY BUCKET LIST nearing mid-stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole,
mildly re-rallied into the final sixteenth but needed more in the late stages. MY BUCKET LIST unhurried in the early stages, trailed into the turn and raced
two to three wide to the quarter marker, mounted a three to four wide bid into the stretch, brushed with WESTERN CAPE nearing mid-stretch, could not
sustain his bid into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. CARDINAL TRICK crowded by HOT JOURNEY away from the gate and a step slow to begin,
hustled in the early going and assumed command, set decent early fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, dueled with HOT JOURNEY into the
turn and carved out moderate fractions approaching the quarter pole, overtaken into upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch.
HOT JOURNEY broke in at the start and crowded CARDINAL TRICK, hard sent away from the start and disputed the decent early pace between rivals,
pressed CARDINAL TRICK through moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, vied between runners into upper stretch, lost position at the furlong marker
and gave way.
