EFFICACIOUS sat chilly to the turn, split horses into the stretch and stormed to the front proving tons the best. SQUASH BLOSSOM unhurried to turn,
rallied to chase winner home, bested rest. ROSIA BAY never far back to the turn with a bid into stretch, best of rest. ABITIBI inside speed, dueled to the
turn, could not go on and faded. BEL ARIA outside speed to duel to quarter pole but gave way readily. ALL I WANT IS YOU raced in the two path to turn
while never a factor throughout. MISS FOXANN outbroke the rider from the gate and failed to menace. HONORABLE WOMAN three wide run to turn, used
up and gave way readily in stretch.
