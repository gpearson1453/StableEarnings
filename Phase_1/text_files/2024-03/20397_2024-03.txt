Footnotes
WEGOTTODRINKING crowded a bit leaving the start, was off a step slowly and tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, well placed into the
turn, chased from the two path then waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, slipped to the rail in upper stretch, loomed at the furlong pole,
collared STANDFORGRIT at the sixteenth-marker and edged away to prevail in the final stages. STANDFORGRIT away in good order, assumed early
command and set the pace to the half-mile marker, showed the way while off of the rail into the turn, set down for the drive and held foes at bay nearing
mid-stretch, was overtaken by WEGOTTODRINKING into the final sixteenth and bested the rest. GENTLE JULIA exchanged bumps with SHEZA QUEEN
BEE leaving the start and was away slowly, settled toward the rear in the early stages while never far back, went three wide into the turn and raced in traffic
nearing the quarter pole, found room into upper stretch, finished evenly in the final sixteenth and held well for third. A PERFECT PATH prominent away from
the start, stalked the decent early pace outside of STANDFORGRIT, chased the pacesetter three wide approaching the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the
stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and weakened. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, chased
four wide along the turn, maintained that four wide path into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally. LOCHMARA tracked
the decent early pace from the outside, chased five wide to the quarter marker and raced widest into the stretch, could not muster the needed late response
and flattened out. SHEZA QUEEN BEE exchanged bumps with GENTLE JULIA leaving the start and away a bit slowly, settled off of the decent early pace,
saved ground into the turn and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
ALPHABETICAL ORDER off a step slowly away from the start, tracked the solid early pace then rushed to contention approaching the turn, was taken to the
outside and chased the leading pair three wide to the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and confronted TIMELY COMFORT nearing the furlong
marker, dueled his stablemate into the final sixteenth, wore down the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and won the head nod at the finish to prevail.
TIMELY COMFORT showed good early speed and was prominent away from the start, contested the solid early pace outside of WESTERN SIERRA,
pressed that rival into the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, assumed command into upper stretch, was confronted at the furlong
marker by ALPHABETICAL ORDER, met his stablemate's bid while on the left lead heading into the final sixteenth, battled stubbornly into deep stretch and
was bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for second. THECHIEFHASTRICKS broke alertly, raced close up to the solid early pace, chased
three to four wide into the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, maintained an outside path into the stretch and was outrun nearing the furlong marker,
re-rallied in the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides to secure third. UPDRAFT took back off of the solid early pace, raced two wide into the turn,
offered a mild rally in the stretch and missed for third at the finish. WESTERN SIERRA sent away from the start, assumed early command and set a quick
pace while pressured to the half-mile marker, set solid fractions while pressed into the turn, was overtaken into upper stretch and gave way in the final
furlong. R HEART OF GOLD bumped away from the start and off a bit slowly, settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn, angled three
wide for the drive and did not threaten in the late stages.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) was content to settle well behind the pace for the first half, made an eye-catching move three wide into contention after passing
the three-furlong pole, still in hand, came three wide into the stretch, responded nicely when set down approaching the furlong marker and drew off under
strong handling and intermittent urging, drifting in towards the rail in the late stages. WORK TO LIVE was hustled to get forward position from the break but
got caught three wide, backed away from a potential speed duel and settled mid-pack, was content to remain there to the far turn, then went after the
weakening pacesetter from the seven-sixteenths pole, joined to the outside by NAUGHTY NADINE (GB), the pair dueled for the lead turning for home, came
under pressure and was unable to match strides with that one in the stretch but kept to task and held the place. SKY MAKER raced at the rear of the field
inside of BOLD DAUGHTER, went into a drive with three furlongs to run, tipped out to the four or five path for the stretch run and gained the third spot with a
large gap back to the next horse. SUNGLASSES (GB) was hustled from the gate and was able secure the rail going into the first turn, began to pull away
and open up on the field approaching the six furlong marker then cruised to an uncontested lead down the backstretch, started to get out and drifted to the
center of the track, then angled back towards the rail entering the far turn, still with a clear lead, began to weaken approaching he quarter pole, did not
respond to the urgings of the rider, shortened stride and was not persevered with late. BOLD DAUGHTER raced at the rear of the field to the outside of SKY
MAKER for the first half mile, was pushed to get close heading into the turn, tried to rally four wide through the turn but was unable to quicken and finished
out one-paced to the wire. PROOF OF JAZZ broke well and was between horses in a trio battling for the lead into the first turn, ceded the lead to
SUNGLASSES (GB) and took up a tracking position well behind that one while under some restraint, was turned loose passing the half-mile marker and
was getting closer racing inside through the turn, but was unable to quicken when put under pressure near the five-sixteenths marker and came up empty in
the stretch.

Footnotes
GRIT AND CURIOSITY rated nicely off of the fast early pace, stalked from the inside nearing the half-mile marker and was well placed into the turn, saved
ground while stalking the leading pair approaching the quarter pole, loomed into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, drew to even terms
with AMANOFMYSTATURE and took a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, determinedly kept to task in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish.
AMANOFMYSTATURE crowded a neighboring rival at the start, was hustled away from the gate and assumed early command, showed good speed and set
quick fractions while pressed to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and carved out a fast pace to the quarter pole, led into the stretch while a path
off of the rail, confronted at the furlong marker by GRIT AND CURIOSITY and battled that rival into the final sixteenth, was overtaken into deep stretch,
came back in the final strides and just missed for the win in a game runner-up effort. BIG DON'S SMILING away in good order, showed good early speed
and vied for the lead in the opening furlong, ceded to AMANOFMYSTATURE and pressed that rival through quick fractions nearing the half-mile marker,
kept close attendance to the fast pace into the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and chased to the
furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and held for third at the finish. REFI NOW tracked the solid early pace from between runners, maintained
that position into the turn then came in tight at the quarter pole while two to three wide and between rivals, angled four wide into upper stretch and was
outkicked at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth but needed more in the late stages. MY SUNSHINE squeezed at the start and was away a
bit slowly, void of early speed, saved ground into the turn, shifted to three path into upper stretch and did not factor in the drive. SUNNY SPOT chased the
solid pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three to four wide along the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and did not threaten in the final furlong.

RALPH to the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took command at the furlong marker, drew clear into the final sixteenth and pulled away
under mild urging in deep stretch. EL JOY settled leaving the start, raced two wide and between runners into the first turn, tracked the decent pace three

HOT BETTY veered outward after the break to avoid contact with CLARE'S BABY, cut off PETITE DANCER, straightened then was content to settle
mid-pack, cruised into contention up the rail on the turn, briefly waited for room at the quarter pole, got a nice seam to run through at the three-sixteenths
pole, responded when set down and won driving under strong handling. CLARE'S BABY broke out and bothered HOT BETTY causing a chain reaction to
the adjacent starters, sped clear before the five furlong pole, repelled a pair of challengers near the quarter pole, came into the stretch with a short lead,
finished gamely under strong handling and intermittent urging but was unable to hold off the winner in the final yards. ELWOOD ROAD broke inward and
made some light contact with PETITE DANCER, raced on the outside of the trio chasing the pacesetter, dropped off the pace passing the half, made a mild
rally through the turn thee to four wide then swung five wide into the stretch, finished well under constant handling and gained third. FIREWORK dropped
behind after the break and lagged near the rear of the field to the turn, dropped to the two path and came under a drive from the five-sixteenths pole, dove
to the rail for the stretch run, finished willingly under strong handling and improved position while no threat to the top pair. MARS MAGIC broke in a the
break and was a little slow to find her best stride, raced close up inside of a trio chasing CLARE'S BABY, went into a drive from the five-sixteenths to bid for
the lead, came into the stretch on the wrong lead, lost momentum and faltered in the stretch. CANDY LITZ lacked early speed, moved in to the two path for
the run through the turn, made a mild rally in the stretch but was never a threat. SIMPLY GRACIOUS raced close to the pace between horses in the tracking
group, moved up three wide near the quarter pole to bid for the lead loomed a big threat then suddenly flattened out near the three-sixteenths pole and had
nothing to offer for the stretch run. PETITE DANCER got squeezed after the break, steadied and came away a bit slowly, moved over to the rail when clear,
then was outrun down the backstretch, continued to chase the field through the turn and into the stretch and was never a factor.
