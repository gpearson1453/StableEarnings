EL ARE EM stalked the pace, made a quick move down the backstretch to press the early leader two deep and finished well to just get up under all our
pressure. WILLHE LOVE showed good early foot along the inside, dug in late and missed in a game effort. LEGEND OF GOLD was allowed to settle early,
raced four wide in the lane and moved up to improve position. GAME'S KARTEL drifted a bit around the first turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
raced even with no closing run. FIRESPITTEN KITTEN stalked the pace along the inside and weakened. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN was off slowly and
trailed.

moved up four wide into the upper lane and rallied well to narrowly get up for the place position. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN showed good early speed and gave
way grudgingly late. KISS RIDE GOODBYE was allowed to settle early, made an inside bid but had not enough in the drive. SHE'S MY PRIORITY was
unhurried early, raced three to four wide and had no late rally. SUNSHINE EMILY stalked the pace and tired. CAL'S GIRL was done early and failed to
