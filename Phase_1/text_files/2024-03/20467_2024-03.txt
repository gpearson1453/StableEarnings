Footnotes
RISKY BOY dueled for the lead from along the inside, responded to pressure and proved best under strong handling. BREAKING NEWS vied for the lead
throughout from between horses and held on well for the place in a game effort. HINK'S PALADIN was forwardly placed while racing four-wide and finished
in a mild rally. DYNABLUE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled further out during the drive and finished full of run. ALPINE
GHOST settled in the middle of the field, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly. UPBEAT MELODY was prominently placed early, dropped back
on the turn and lacked a rally. LYRICAL POET vied for the lead to the stretch while three-wide and tired during the drive. ONE LAST HAND dropped back
early, raced six-wide on the turn and was not a factor. SON OF GRACE broke out then was in tight from between horses shoirly after the start and failed to
seriously threaten. GREELEYS ICE was off a step slow then moved up to racing the middle of the field to the stretch and gave way.

CROWN ROYAL KID saved ground setting the pace under pressure from MINING CAMP and gradually edged clear late. MINING CAMP bobbled at the
start, then disputed the issue from along the outside, was unable to stay with the winner late but held on gamely for the place. FIRE WIRE saved ground
chasing the top two, angled out during the drive and was gaining late. GOD GUNS N GUTS bumped at the start with LATE BLACKSMITH then was allowed
to settle, came six-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. PONCHO ATTACK broke in to bump with MY TENNIS SHOES having his rider lose the
inside iron, then was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. MY TENNIS SHOES was bumped at the start by PONCHO
ATTACK then dropped back, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a threat. SAN RONIN saved ground while being allowed to settle early and failed
to be a factor. LATE BLACKSMITH hopped at the start then bumped with GOD GUNS N GUTS, dropped back, came seven-wide into the stretch and failed
to menace.

MOON was bumped at the start by INSIDE THE CIRCLE then was forwardly place while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. DASTARDLY
DEEDS was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BLEEDING BLUE raced four-wide on the turn, came six-wide into the

RUNWITHHEART set the pace while racing slightly off the rail, responded when head by GIANNO nearing the eighth pole and came again to prove
narrowly best. GIANNO saved ground while being reserved off the pace, slipped through along the inside entering the stretch, moved up to take the lead
nearing the eighth pole but was unable to match strides with the winner late. WOLF HUNTER was allowed to settle early was racing along the inside, angled
out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. REGIMENTAL was forwardly placed while racing between horses, steadied in tight
while lacking room nearing the quarter pole, angled in slightly and finished willingly when clear. ELECTRIC CHARGE broke in to bump with
PERFORMANCE PLUS then settled in the middle of the field, was five-wide nearing the quarter pole, angled in during the drive and was gaining slightly
late. PERFORMANCE PLUS broke out to bump with ELECTRIC CHARGE then was allowed to settle, came six-wide into the stretch and improved his
position. TIGGER ATTACK dropped back while saving ground and was not a factor. DEFIANT MALICE was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. WICKED GUS prompted the early pace from along the outside and tired. MONEY AGENT was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide and gave way nearing the stretch.

GOOD APPLE saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win as the rider pleased. DOUBLE DRIBBLE saved ground chasing the pace, angled out
nearing the eighth pole to split rivals and finished well in the place. NAGY AND DA BEARS prompted the issue racing three-wide and held on well for the
show. TEMPLE FOOL was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. WHOLE LOTTA
LUTE was fractious prior to the start, then prompted the pace while racing two-wide from between horses to the stretch and tired. HAND OVER MY HEART
was forwardly placed while racing two-wide but lacked a response when asked. STANCE saved ground while being allowed to settle early but was not a
factor. SPAN dropped back early then was five-wide on the turn and failed to threaten. BEST MAN SPEECH lacked early speed while racing three-wide and
failed to menace. LONE RETURN was four-wide while racing in the middle of the field and gave way nearing the stretch.

ECHO DREAMER was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth and win going away. MAGGIE E dueled
with ANNA AFTER MIDNITE for the early lead, opened a slight advantage during the drive but was unable to resist the winner late in a game effort. ANNA
AFTER MIDNITE dueled for the lead with MAGGIE E into the stretch and held on well during the drive for the show. MADELYN ATTACK saved ground
while being prominently placed and went evenly late. ARRINGTON was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch and gradually improved her
position. GOLD OAK settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide but lacked a rally when asked. HOLY STAR saved ground while being reserved
off the pace and failed to seriously threaten. JOCELYN saved ground while being unhurried and was not a factor. GLITTER BOMB was four-wide on the
turn, came five-wide into the stretch and gave way. BABAS GAL dropped back early, raced five-wide on the turn and failed to menace. HARPER BRIANA
bore out on the turn and was distanced before unseating her rider in upper stretch and was walked off then was picked up by the outrider and walked off.
