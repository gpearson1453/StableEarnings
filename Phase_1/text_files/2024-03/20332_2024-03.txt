STEP AHEAD broke in front, set all the pace, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, was put to right handed urging and just lasted while under a strong
hand ride in the final stages. INSACIABLE PRINCE trailed for five furlongs, swung wide, loomed boldly in the eight path nearing the furlong marker then
couldn't get past the winner. DOMI stalked the early pace three wide, drew closer to the winner entering the far turn, swung out to the seven path entering
the stretch, shifted inside the winner late and was outfinished. SMALL SAILOR hopped at the start, offered a strong bid inside rivals in upper stretch then
came up empty. HEART OF THE BEAST pressed the early pace two wide, stopped on the far turn and jogged to the wire.

and proved best by a narrow margin under strong handling. PRETTY PATTY away alertly, opened a daylight lead under a hold soon after the start, set the
pace along the inside, dug in gamely when challenged by the winner in upper stretch and just missed hanging on. WILLIAMSBEACHBABE stalked the pace
three wide into the stretch, dropped to the rail and finished determinedly. TWENTY FOUR KARAT hopped at the start then failed to menace.

POLYESTER BRIDE allowed to settle, advanced four then three wide through the far turn, shifted from the five path to the rail passing the furlong marker,
made the lead late and drew off under left handed urging. MAMBO KITTEN stalked the pace for four and one half furlongs, surged three wide to make the
lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. TONALA slow early, found her best stride late five wide. FABIOLA PRINCESS
pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn then weakened. WOLF EYES failed to menace. LUCKY ROAD set a pressured pace two wide for four
and one half furlongs, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then was used up.
