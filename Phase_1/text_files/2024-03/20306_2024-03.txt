Footnotes
SPANKSTER outrun in the early going off the inside, three wide into the lane, worked way to the rail by late turn, roused into the stretch, closed with good
energy to win going away. JACKMAN dueled up front along the inside up the backstretch, headed by a pair of rivals midway on the turn, regained the
advantage inside the furlong grounds, proved no match for the winner late while edging away for the place. ATTA PARTY dueled off the inside, held a slim
advantage past the furlong marker, weakened in the late push to the wire, saved the show. SPEIGHT AND MALICE off the pace and the inside, steered out
to be three to four wide turning for home, managed little in the way of a closing kick. MACRON stalked the two leaders early out in the strip, challenged
three wide midway on the turn, got out in upper stretch to lose the advantage, continued to weaken the final furlong. PAPA ROCKET last to leave, was
floated out into the five path into the stretch, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW ZIP in the second flight while between horses for a half, tipped out three wide turning for home, bid between horses inside the furlong grounds,
dug in late to narrowly prevail while fully extended. CHUPAPI MUNYAYO off a step slow, raced back just off the inside, steered out widest when
straightened for home, rallied, challenged outside the winner in the late going, outkicked at the wire. BRAHMS IMAGE broke on top, dueled up front closest
to the inside, put the other speed away to be clear a furlong out, responded when challenged by the top two with a sixteenth to run, proved stubborn.
WATER TO WINE in mid pack early in the two path, dropped to the inside midway on the turn, improved up the rail while not a threat to the top three.
SECRET TAVERN closest to the dueling leaders in the two path up the backstretch, had little left for the drive. RUDIANO lacked speed inside, came in the
two path for the drive, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. HOPPIN JOHN in the second flight while three to four wide in the turn, tired in the
drive. MR. COUGAR hesitated at the break, void of speed, failed to muster a rally. VYING EDGE dueled up front in the two path for a half then gave way.
ARKANSAS ZONG remained always back to be outrun.

Footnotes
HIGHER STANDARD closest to the leader in the two path, continued to pursue that one through the turn, asked along turning for home, engaged that
leader when straightened for home and edged clear under steady handling. JUILLIARD in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground
through the turn and into the stretch, lodged a rail bid inside the pacesetter for the second spot past the furlong marker, could not get to the winner late.
IMPROBABLE JOURNEY broke on top, clear to the inside soon after, set a semi pressured pace for a half, offered brief resistance to the winner into the
stretch, yielded to that one and the runner up approaching the furlong marker, comfortably saved the show. RITHM NIC in the second flight three wide, went
evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. UNDER OATH off a step slow, raced back and three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to better
his position. TIM TAL fell back to trail for a half after the start, steered out three wide late in the turn, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. BACKSIDE BUZZ in the second flight while racing four wide through the turn, had little for the drive. ABSOLUTE CHAOS in the second flight early
while between horses, began a steady fade before a half. NELSON AVENUE was finished early inside.

Footnotes
BLACK APPLE outrun early along the inside, moved out to be three wide into the far turn, rallied four to five wide into the stretch, bid between horses, late
duel, nod at the wire. DINNER AT CRUMPIES back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the far turn, rallied in the six path outside the winner turning
for home, bid, missed the nod at the wire, well clear of the others. TOPF ROAD RULES in the second flight off the inside, closer three wide into the stretch,
challenged between horses into the lane, proved no match for the top two late. BETTYS CASH prompted the pace off the rail, continued to chase the middle
half, advanced and took over into the stretch, showed the way past the furlong marker then faltered in the late run to the wire. SHAKE UP went one paced
throughout while racing toward the inside. MAN IN THE CAN in the second group three wide, ranged up to challenge with a brief bid four wide exiting the
final turn, gave way. SISTERSOUTTACHROME broke a step slow, trailed much of the way, failed to make an impact. MACHO RONNIE moved up to show
the way early, set a glib opening quarter, continued to show the way, stopped when headed in upper stretch. ALLO ENRY within striking distance, saved
ground, also gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane.

HUMOR ME JIM broke alertly toward the inside, cleared toward the rail, set the pace and held the runner up safe the final furlong under steady handling.
PIONEER PARADE in the second flight three wide, chased the winner into the stretch, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly second best.
LIL TOWN SIS in some traffic in the main group late backstretch, angled out four wide when making a mild advance exiting the turn, along for the show, not
a threat to the top pair. SUBWAY SUSIE broke out, void of speed toward the inside, moved to the two path around a tiring rival midway on the turn, dropped
back inside for the drive, mild rally up the rail. JUBILANT JOANIE in the second flight while closest to the inside, weakened in the drive.
THISONESFORLOVE broke back, lacked speed outside, carried out five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. TIFF WITH JIMMY in the second flight
while between horses for three furlongs, faltered in the tdurn. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT was finished early along the inside. MAMBA OUT in mid pack off rail,
began to back up while three wide late in the turn.

Footnotes
LITTLE JAMIE broke alertly, soon clear into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, let out a notch in the second turn, drew out through the lane
under steady handling in a solid effort. FLASHY DANCER pinched back at the start to be slow away, moved closer along the inside late backstretch, chased
the winner in the two path into the lane, proved no match for that one through the stretch, fully extended to save the place. UNDER THE PALMS pushed in
to the rail soon after the start, void of speed, saved ground second turn, moved out a bit for the drive, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the runner
up. AVA MOON PIE lacked early foot, advanced inside some traffic in the second turn, closest to the top two with a furlong to run, flattened out a bit to lose
the show late. AMY Z in mid pack and three wide first turn, remained outside and raced three to four wide through the second bend, lacked a closing kick in
the drive. CATALYST off the early pace, moved closer to head up the second flight into the far turn, began to falter late in that bend and continued to
weaken down the stretch. SOCIAL AFFAIR fell back before a half, went flat while four wide through the second turn, no threat stretch. LADY ARIEL
forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half. SUENA fell back after the start to trail, was always outrun. TAKER BACK came in early, raced
rank in the first turn, chased the winner for a half and began to give way.

Footnotes
ZAP MOTION away in good order, set the early pace, dueled the middle half along the inside, disposed of that rival turning for home, held the runner up
safe while kept to pressure. LIL SWEET THANG never far back off the rail, crept a bit closer late in the final turn, could do little with the winner, well clear of
the others. RUNNINGFORCASH pressed the winner early, dueled outside that one the middle four furlongs, first to blink into the lane, gradually weakened
through the stretch but managed to save the show. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE back off the early pace in the two path, continued back up the backstretch,
improved while still in the two path second turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. SEVEN FLAT back off the pace in the three path, stayed clear in that lane
through the second turn, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. LEGENDARY LORE broke a bit back, improved position by saving some ground
into the first turn, continued to save ground in an even effort. DOG RED off a step slow, lacked speed inside, continued to save ground second turn, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. JEWELSTOWN raced in mid pack outside, four to five wide out of the turn, between horses into the stretch,
lacked rally. JIM AND JIM off a step slow, remained always back while four wide through the turns. DESERT WOLF five wide into the first turn, continued
outside, fanned six wide into the stretch, remained back. SPEITFUL SAM closest to the dueling leaders off the rail, four wide through the second turn,
stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
NATIVE LAND outrun early inside, two path onto the backstretch, moved out while in hand with five furlongs remaining, five wide into the far turn, angled in
a bit three wide midway on that bend just before unleashing a sudden burst and angling out turning for home to quickly reach a contending position, kicked
strongly clear to win going away in a sharp effort. YELL COUNTY forwardly placed early inside, continued to track backstretch, moved up inside to
challenge into the far turn, dueled into the lane, put that foe away just as the winner came calling, no match for that one, held sway for the place while
drifting a bit. RIYADH MOON prompted the issue up front in the three path, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of the rest. DJANGO back off the pace
while moving inside first turn, continued to save ground, improved inside of horses second turn, not enough late for the show. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN fell back
to trail after the start, three wide into the far turn, dropped inside to ride the rail into the lane, improved without posing a serious threat. ALWAYS BE SMART
hit gate to be off slow, raced back, bettered position while also not a significant factor late. ELKO COUNTY mid pack early off the inside, four wide through
the second turn, fell back into the lane then picked off a couple of faltering rivals late. HIGGINSVILLE balked at loading, four wide when within striking
distance first turn, continued outside, four wide into the stretch and began to tire. MELT WITH YOU settled off the pace and the inside, had little left for the
stretch run. RONALDINHO set a quick tempo early in the two path, allowed the runner up the inside late backstretch, dueled with that one the next quarter
then caved late. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS finished early, three to four wide trip, stopped, jogged in.

Footnotes
TINY TEMPER hesitated at the break, raced back early three wide onto the backstretch, worked way to the rail while still lagging second turn, eased out a
bit and challenged between horses nearing the furlong grounds, wore down the leader to be up in the final strides. MISTY VEIL in some traffic into the first
turn, settled in the second flight along the inside into and through the second turn, challenged inside the leaders into the stretch, gained control, briefly clear
inside the furlong marker only to be nailed in the final strides. BELLAMORE with the pace along the inside into the first turn, alternated up front in the run up
the backstretch, continued to vie through the final turn, continued on into the stretch, proved stubborn to the end while drifting out. SHOTGUN HOTTIE
prompted the pace, closer and challenged three wide second turn, floated out four wide into the lane to slow ground to the top three, went evenly to the wire
in lacking a closing punch. HOT AND SULTRY broke alertly, set or forced the pace off the inside, showed the way into the stretch three wide, continued to
hold a narrow lead past the furlong marker, faltered from between horses. SOUL OF AN ANGEL broke back, void of speed, continued back second turn,
swung out four wide into the lane, improved only slightly with some mild interest. COMPARATIVE in some traffic when toward the front between horses first
turn, raced in the second flight the middle half, had little for the stretch run. SADDLE UP JESSIE in mid pack off the inside, five wide into the lane, threw it in
reverse through the stretch to trail home.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BAND broke on top, dueled up the backstretch, headed midway on the turn, continued to duel upper stretch, battled back and edged clear late
under firm handling. FILLY CRYSTAL alternated up front outside the winner for a half, showed the way into and through upper stretch then could not match
that one late to be outfinsihed. BANTERRA forwardly placed toward the inside, in some traffic into and through the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive to be
three wide, lacked a closing kick to be best of the rest. BLAME DAY fell back after breaking with the leaders, mid pack turn three to two wide, staged a mild
rally through some traffic while not a serious threat. MISCHIEVOUS GAL settled in mid pack three wide, in some traffic into the bend, remained in the three
path through the turn, went evenly through the lane in also lacking a closing kick. BLESSED ASSURANCE off a step slow, well back, six wide out of the turn
carrying an outer foe with her, improved with some belated interest midtrack. KEY TO SUCCESS broke back, raced well back outside, carried out seven
wide by BLESSED ASSURANCE turning for home, also bettered herself a bit through the lane. PATE fell back to trail, remained back for a half while in the
two path through the turn, picked off some tiring rivals while never a threat. CONDIMENT GIRL forwardly placed outside, lodged a mild bid four wide
midway on the turn, faltered in the drive. SISTER KISSES in mid pack for a half inside, backed up through the lane. PACHANGA LOCA forwardly placed
while four wide through the turn, gave way through the stretch.
