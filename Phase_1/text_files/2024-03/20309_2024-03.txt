Footnotes
CANE CREEK ROAD prompted the early pace between foes, continued prominently bit off the rail,. tipped out three wide, took an awkward step and had
rider lose his outside iron in upper stretch, never regained that iron but still rallied under few right handed taps and strong had urging to be along in time.
GIVE ME THE LUTE tossed his head and broke slow, hugged rail into the lane, split foes late and gained second in final yards. DISKO TRIBUTE tracked
the paced from the inside, swung out four wide exiting the turn, remained well off the rail and rallied strongly in the final sixteenth to grab third. DEVIL
MOON forced the early pace then gained advantage from off the rail, angled in bit and edged away on the turn but weakened in the drive. BARRISTAN THE
BOLD (GB) stumbled leaving the gate, stalked while two or three wide, was fanned out five wide entering the stretch, continued outside DISKO TRIBUTE in
the stretch and went willingly to the wire. SILARDI showed good speed from along the fence, forced the pace into the turn, dropped back bit then re-rallied
and poked his nose in front in upper stretch from the inside but failed to sustain effort. KANDEREL was off slow, trailed from the inside, dropped back further
into the turn, later came off the fence but failed to reach contention.

rivals, roused and surged inside sixteenth marker and collared inside pair in final yards. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE stepped to the front, controlled pace from
the inside, resisted when challenged into the stretch, found back inside, could not stave off winner late but gamely held second. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER
prompted the pace into and through the backstretch from two path, moved up and bid between foes past quarter marker, poked nose in front at eighth pole
briefly, battled outside IRREISTIBLE FORCE later in the drive and could not get past that rival late. IRISH PATSY reserved while crossing over early, saved
ground while trailing, came out three wide leaving last turn, shifted our further in upper stretch and closed strongly late from the outside. MADIHA bit keen
and pulling some into the backstretch, stalked leaders from the inside, came out slightly but lacked room behind rivals in the drive, finally came out some
late and finished with interest. REAL FIRE close up from off the rail, stalked three wide to far turn, moved up and engaged leaders while three deep entering
the stretch but weakened in final sixteenth. CORNELIA FORT was fractious in the gate, chased while outside winner into second, shifted three then four
wide into the stretch and was between rivals in the lane. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER chased while outside rival, later angled over, continued inside through
the stretch and was no threat. ALTERNATE ROCK stalked from two path, came out slightly leaving late turn, shifted out further in upper stretch and

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO quickly established control, carved out fractions from the inside, resisted when challenged passing quarter marker, re-established lead in
upper stretch and stubbornly lasted under strong handling. DANCING BUCK pressured the pace from outside pacesetter down the hill, bid between rivals
and outside winner into the stretch, dropped back bit in upper stretch, continued on same path in the lane, battled back gamely and held the place. LANE
WAY stalked from between rivals and bit off the rail, paused momentarily waiting behind wall of rivals past dirt portion, came out slightly, continued willingly
and held third. SUMTER was bumped offstride in initial strides from the gate, settled well off the pace, chased outside rival then three wide into the stretch,
rallied on the four path in the lane and just missed third. IRIDEO (ARG) reserved from the inside, chased from along the rail down the hill then between
rivals and went willingly to the wire. OTTOMAN PRINCE (IRE) broke inward and bumped inside rival at the start, tracked leaders from the inside and just off
the rail, regained the inside and weakened. AIR FORCE RED forwardly placed and outside DANCING BUCK down the hill, moved up and bid three abreast
crossing dirt portion before weakening in the drive. DANIEL'S MAGIC settled outside and off the pace, raced four wide off the rail down the hill, continued on
same path into the stretch and lacked any late punch.

Footnotes
SWEET AZTECA quickly stepped to the front, deftly rated while controlling the pace from the inside, roused nearing the stretch and into the lane while
padding cushion then responded from strong urging to safely stave off late bid of ADARE MANOR. ADARE MANOR settled off the pace and tracked leader
from the inside, hugged the rail into and around the final bend, tipped out in upper stretch then whittled gap on the winner in final sixteenth. GREEN UP
forced the pace into and through the backstretch while outside SWEET AZTECA, came under ride to remain close around final turn, dropped back some in
upper stretch and held for third. DESERT DAWN between rivals early, continued off the rail and outside runner-up to the second turn, tipped out three wide
entering the stretch and was turned back in the drive for the show.. WINDOW SHOPPING off a step slow, caught four wide into initial turn, remained well off
the rail, was four deep leaving the backstretch, later angled inward and failed to threaten in the stretch. COFFEE IN BED settled inside, hugged the rail
around first bend then angled out approaching the backstretch, chased four then five wide, came in slightly into the stretch and was no threat.
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM was off a step slow, also four wide early, then three deep into the backstretch, remained off the rail and also weakened.

front inside 1/16 and pulled clear. JANE KENDEIGH broke in and bumped with HAVE PATIENCE, chased three then four wide into the lane, bumped with
CASTAGNA near sixteenth marker, came back in and bumped with that rival again, recovered and edged away late for second. BREEZY BLUE chased
from off the rail or between rivals, remained on three wide path into stretch, bumped by CASTAGNA nearing sixteenth marker, recovered and came in some
and rallied late to grab third. CLUB TEASER hopped then in tight to be off behind the field, chased from the inside, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and
closed willingly from the outside. CASTAGNA attended the early pace from the outside, bid three deep on the turn, gained lead and edged away, drifted out
nearing sixteenth marker, bumped with JANE KLENDEIGH, came back in and bumped with BREEZY BLUE then lost placing late. HAVE PATIENCE
bumped at the break, was keen from along the rail, was pulling into and early on the turn, trying to get out later on the bend, lacked room behind rivals in the
drive, finally got free in late stages. ANNIE FOX broke alertly, rushed up inside, was keen then forced to checked off heels into the bend, came off the rail,
continued inside and forced to check off heels of CASTAGNA nearing the wire. PIPPA PHILIPA off a step slow, chased from the outside, continued three
then four wide into the stretch and weakened. R MARILYN LONHRO chased from the inside or just off the rail and failed to threaten. ENVISIONED dueled
