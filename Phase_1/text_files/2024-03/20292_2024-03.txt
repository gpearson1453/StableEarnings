stages and just missed from outside winner. PUDDIN HEAD JONES was off bit slow, trailed from bit off the rail, swung out five wide entering the stretch,
gained slight advantage, drifted inward and bumped with inside rival, was straightened away and then outfinished. TAKAMAKAHARA was off alertly, dueled
from between rivals, held short lead from the two path into the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. GOOD AT BEING BAD forced then

Footnotes
CORPOSO bobbled leaving the gate, prompted the pace from outside rival, asked for more on the last turn, challenged outside same rival, hooked up in
prolonged stretch duel, drifted out slightly nearing the wire and won bob at the finish. BONAQUA stepped to the front, dictated pace from the inside, resisted
when challenged nearing the top of the stretch, dug in gamely then exchanged bobs through stretch duel, drifted out slightly in deep stretch and lost narrow
decision on the wire. BLUE FASHION reserved in the two path, angled in side a pair of rivals past the three-eighths pole and hugged the rail through the
stretch while winning the battle for third. BRUNCH WITH AMY settled inside, chased either along the rail or on two path into the stretch and was out finished
for minor award. QUEEN GIRVIN stalked from off the rail, remained three wide to the second turn and into the stretch and also weakened. RUNAWAY
KITTEN caught four wide into first turn, moved up briefly between rivals, was four wide heading into second turn, dropped back readily around that bend,
was eased in the stretch and walked off.

FLYING DRUMMER stalked from inside then shifted to the two path around the first turn, challenged the leader from outside on the far turn then vied
between rivals, took over approaching the quarter pole, dueled inside GINOBILI into the stretch, responded well when asked right handed in upper stretch to
shake free from outer rival, then powered away under steady handling late. OVIATT CLASS trailed four wide on the first turn then steered to the two path on
the clubhouse turn, angled back out the four path on the second bend and was along for the place. GINOBILI raced in range from the three path early, bid
outside the top pair on the far turn, dueled with FLYING DRUMMER past the quarter pole, was no match for that rival in upper stretch and flattened to third.
HERO STATUS stumbled badly in the beginning, stalked from inside to the far turn, lost ground through the bend, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and
weakened. IT'S MY HOUSE stepped to the front and moved inside on the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, tested by outer rival early on the far
turn then vied with a pair of rivals, lost command with a quarter mile remaining and faded down the lane.

STOP AND A TRES stalked three deep early, bid from outside in the two path on the second bend and inched ahead at the quarter pole, shook free in
upper stretch, drifted out in the furlong grounds but remained clear to the wire. DERECHO DANDY chased on the inside into the first turn then eased over to
the two path, rounded the far turn two then three wide, tipped out at the top of the stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong but could not reach the
winner. WORSE READ SANCHEZ stalked between rivals and got put in a bit tight midway around the clubhouse turn, moved out into the clear and
continued within striking distance up the backstretch, put in a mild bid three deep on the far turn, could not stay on with STOP AND A TRES at the top of the
stretch and flattened to thid. HARD MISSION coaxed from the gate, stalked inside a pair of rivals along the rail on the first turn, chased inside a rival up the
backstretch, lost ground on the far turn, came out in upper stretch and weakened. BILLY'S BET led two wide into the first turn then along the rail, confronted
outer rival early on the far turn, fought inside a pair of foes before being overtaken past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the new leader into the lane and
gave way. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) was off slow to begin, trailed from inside then in the two path, moved out wide on the backstretch, remained wide
through the far turn and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
IRISH WAHINE settled inside near the back, lacked room behind a rival on the turn, gained an opening approaching the quarter pole and started to gain,
surged clear with a furlong remaining and drew away in deep stretch. VELLA chased two wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail then back to the
two path around the bend while drawing closer, showed a mild rally in the stretch but was no match for the winner. LA PALOMA BLANCA located towards
the rear early on, advanced two, three, then four wide around the bend and was along for the show. TROUBLE N PARADISE showed early speed and was
closest in pursuit of the pacesetter up the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, bid two wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and faltered in
the furlong grounds. STORM D'ORO broke alertly and went up to take control while drifting out a bit early, set the pace two wide then along the rail around
the bend, threatened by TROUBLE N PARADISE entering the stretch, came out a bit at the top of the stretch, relinquished the lead to the winner nearing
the eighth pole and weakened. KEEP YOUR COIL sat off the pace well off the rail, took the turn five then six wide and failed to menace. DALLAS ALICE
trailed wide up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn then dove down to the rail to save ground, came back out some in upper stretch and was never
a factor. FAMILY TRIPS stalked the speed outside a rival, brushed with inner foe entering the turn, rounded the bend four then five wide and weakened in
the stretch run. BLACKENED stalked three wide into the turn, bumped with FAMILY TRIPS early on the bend, dropped back between foes, spun four wide
into the lane and faded. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, TROUBLE N PARADISE HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
DON'T SWEAR DAVE stalked outside a rival four wide early on the first turn then dropped back a bit and moved down to the two path, gained through the
far turn while angling in then back off the rail, took aim three wide into the stretch, headed the runner-up at the eighth pole and proved edged clear in the
final furlong. MARKS HIP dueled into the first turn then cleared around the bend, remained unchallenged to the top of the lane, put to left handed urging
when confronted by the winner in upper stretch, clung to a narrow lead at the eighth pole, lost command shortly after and stayed on well for a clear second.
GENERAL MATHIS stalked three wide early on, stayed off the rail and came four wide into the stretch and never produced a bid. ATOMIC DROP showed
early speed then ceded command to MARKS HIP around the first turn and stalked from outside, pushed on leaving the far turn and weakened down the
lane. BEE CATCHER tossed his head at the start to come away a bit slow, trailed on the inside through both turns and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BARELY FUNTIONAL settled off the pace in the two path, drew closer up the backstretch, waited for room behind the leader on the far turn, tipped out at
the top of lane, put a head in front at the eighth pole and drove clear. CITY OF ANGELS stalked the pace from inside, came with a rail bid at the
three-eighths pole, took over midway around the bend then drew clear approaching the quarter pole, challenged by BARELY FUNTIONAL in upper stretch,
relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and stayed on to hold second. SPEED GRAZY broke a step slow on the outside, trailed six wide into the clubhouse
turn then angled into the three path around the bend, chased three deep before tipping four wide on the far turn, rallied to offer a challenge in upper stretch
but was outkicked in the furlong grounds. MYSTIC FLYER forwardly placed two wide, had to steady on the first turn then began to pull, continued to tug the
rider along early on the backstretch before settling into a smooth stride, got boxed in between rivals through the far turn, cut to the inside in upper stretch
and finished willingly for a minor award. NAUVOO dueled briefly then cleared around the first turn, headed by inner rival near the three-eighths pole, lost
command shortly after, chased three wide and got put in tight entering the lane and churned on through the final furlong. BRAZENLY off slow to begin,
chased five then four wide early, ridden along five deep on the far turn and flattened down the lane. CALIFORNIA TIGER showed early speed then stalked
off the rail, bid three deep on the far turn, chased two wide into the stretch and weakened. ON THE WHIM tracked three deep in the early stages, kept off
the inside up the backstretch, ran into traffic four deep on the far turn and also weakened down the lane.
