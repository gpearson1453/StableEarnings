Footnotes
GOLDEN PLATE pressed the leader from off the inside, took over from that one midway on the final turn, showed the way into the lane, responded to an
inside bid by the runner up soon after, long duel to the wire, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. GREERS FERRY back off the early pace, moved a bit
closer along the inside late backstretch, steered out to the three path midway on the final turn, dropped back to an open rail late in the bend, moved up
inside the winner to challenge upper stretch, spirited duel to the wire, outkicked. SHATTUCK lacked early foot inside, steered out a bit around a faltering foe
midway on the final turn, staged a mild rally to be up late for the show, no match for the top two. AMBIGUOUS raced in mid pack just off the inside, floated
out four wide in the second flight turning for home, went evenly to the wire to be outkicked for the show. P R CALL ME MAYBE fell back to trail after the
start, swung out five wide turning for home, passed some tiring rivals to improve position. SILVER TONE off a step slow, raced back and outside, four wide
onto the backstretch, advanced four wide into the far turn, briefly challenged on the outside with five sixteenths remaining, gave way in the drive. STORM
CAT EYES within striking distance three wide early, began a steady retreat before a half. ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR took control after the start, set the pace for
five furlongs, stopped far turn when headed, jogged in.

Footnotes
SHUFFLE DANCE broke alertly, cleared to the inside, rated in the run into the turn, shrugged off nearest pursuer when straightened for home and drew out
outside steady handling. PERMAFROST in mid pack early, moved closer in the turn while in the three path, chased the winner into the stretch, had little for
that one in the run to the stretch, remained clear for the second spot. KID SHELLEEN lacked early foot off the inside, came three to four wide for the drive,
slowly getting to the runner up late. VALE behind the pace along the inside and in hand, two path into the lane, came up empty when clear for the run to the
wire. SIR broke back, void of speed off the inside, five wide exiting the turn, bettered position down the middle of the strip with some belated interest.
PLATINUM GHOST chased the winner early while between horses, shuffled back into the turn, went evenly out of the turn and through the stretch in the two
jpath. LORD GRANTHAM broke back, raced three to four wide out of the turn, made little impact. RED LINE OVERDRIVE tired while racing inside. IGNITIS
in the second flight while racing off the inside, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
TABLE MONEY broke on top, allowed the early pacesetter to go early inside, joined that one and dueled through the turn, disposed of that same rival into
the lane, drove clear through the stretch. LAKE RADIO also away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch inside, dueled through the turn, could
not match the winner through the stretch, held sway late for the place in determined fashion. CITRUS BAY back off the pace and the inside, raced three
wide through the turn, closer then made a bid for the second spot a furlong out, not enough for that spot while prevailing for the show. SLAM DUNK
SERMON off the pace while racing outside, four path through the turn, lacked a closing punch. INVARIABLY off a step slow, lacked a closing response in
the three path. GOLD BARON also away slowly, remained back as well. OTIS OTIS OTIS within striking distance along the inside, faded.

Footnotes
BALSA moved up after the start to contest the pace backstretch, fell back off the leader through the turn, moved off the inside, rebid outside that same rival
with less than a furlong remaining, wore that one down late to prove best. CANAVALL narrowly set the pace late backstretch three wide, dropped to the
inside when clear late in the turn, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late while holding the place. PASS LINE four wide up the backstretch when off the
pace, dropped inside turn, improved into the lane, steered back outside past the furlong marker, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the top pair late.
MORE THAN FIVE lacked speed, angled out for the drive, was also going well at the end to be closing the gap. MAHONEY ROAD back off the pace and
the inside, three wide through the turn, light bump in upper stretch, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. ALL CHOKED UP broke back, raced back
and off the inside, improved a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. TIRICO forwardly placed for a half, came three wide for the drive, had little left
and retreated down the stretch. WESTERN GHENT in the second flight, steered out three wide early turn, four to five wide into the lane, bumped slightly
with MAHONEY ROAD in upper stretch, faded to the wire. DUTCH MILLS last away, got out in the run up the backstretch, pulled up through the turn,
vanned off.

Footnotes
DELTA MOON broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, put away the other speed through the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage through the
stretch under steady handling. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN in the second flight up the backstretch, chased the dueling leaders three wide early turn, could do
little with the winner through the lane, clearly second best. GOLD STRATEGY lacked early foot well wide, five path through the turn, along for the show
down the middle of the strip while not a serious threat to the top pair. MAGNOLIA MAE back off the pace, between horses early turn, two to three wide turn,
mild late interest, not enough for the show. DAT DARES RIGHT fractious in the post parade, broke in good order, dueled inside the winner, first to blink
midway on the turn, continued to weaken through the stretch. BETTY JO went one paced along the inside, steered out a bit into the stretch, lacked a closing
kick. MIRACLE SHOES fell back to trail after the start, three to four wide turn, passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. MISSY PIGGY broke back,
failed to menace while racing off the inside. DIXIE GIRL TO in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, in a bit tight into the stretch then retreated.
LITTLE BURRITO hesitated at the break, moved up a bit inside, saved ground to no avail. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN three wide and off the pace for a half,
brushed upper stretch when four wide, gave way.

Footnotes
AUGUSTA MELODY lucked behind the lead flight up the backstretch well out in the strip, advanced while five wide early turn, challenged in the three path
outside the leader in to the stretch, put that rival away and kicked clear. MASTER OF ARMS pressed four wide up backstretch, ranged up to take over in the
turn, responded when the winner came alongside into the stretch, dueled through upper stretch then could not keep up, held the place. OWN THE FIELD
void of speed, in the two path through the turn, steered out four wide when beginning to rally late in the turn, continued with interest to the wire to be getting
to the runner up. COLD AS HELL vied up front in the run up the backstretch three wide, dueled inside the runner up by late in the bend, weakened through
the stretch. J J'S JOKER shuffled back at the break, continued to trail turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. AL'S
ROMEO flashed speed for three furlong along the inside, gave way. EASY OPERATOR vied in the two path for three furlongs as well, also faltered in the
turn.

Footnotes
LACIE BE GOOD closest to the leader, took over from that one late in the final turn from the outside, shrugged off a a mild and brief bid from the runner up
soon after, increased advantage the final furlong under steady handling. WILDWOOD BYE forwardly placed just off the inside early, tipped out three wide
when moving a bit closer out of the final turn, lodged a mild, brief bid outside the winner early, proved no match in the run to the wire, held sway for the
place. LET'S DUET off a step slow, lagged for three quarter, swung out sharply to be five wide into the lane, finished willingly down the middle of the strip,
too late for the place. MALIBU SMART settled in mid pack while off the inside, came three to four wide out of the final turn, lacked a closing punch.
MARSHSIDE MAMA back off the pace while out in the strip, four wide through the second turn, lacked a serious closing bid. UNSTABLE PRINCESS one
paced while racing toward the inside, remained in the two path, failed to respond in the drive, vanned off. DELPHIA broke on top, sprinted clear, set a
modest pace, faltered when headed. WHAT'S TO DO lacked speed outside, four wide through both turns, failed to muster a rally. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER was
finished after a half, faded.

Footnotes
GUN PILOT last away, raced reserved toward the inside, steered out three wide by late in the turn, shifted out a bit further when straightened for home to
have a straight run, finished with good energy to win going away. EXCESS MAGIC behind the pace off the inside, challenged three wide and between
horses into the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late. SIR WELLINGTON within striking distance
well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, challenged on the outside into the stretch, raced on equal terms with the top two nearing the furlong ground,
no match for that pair late, remained clear for the show. MAJOR BLUE in the second flight up the backstretch, shuffled back between horses into the turn,
remained four wide through the bend, came five wide for the drive, lacked a significant closing kick. LARK'S MISCHIEF forward and inside, slipped through
along the rail to lodge a brief bid into the lane, weakened. TYLER'S TRIBE took command after the start, showed the way up the backstretch and into the
turn in the two path, headed exiting the bend, gave way, returned bleeding.

Footnotes
PENZIG behind the pace well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, advanced four wide into the stretch, outside bid, long drive, edged away late. SHE'S
TABOO behind the leaders along the inside, boxed in much of the turn, steered out, bid between foes and inside the winner inside the furlong marker, could
not match the winner late, held gamely for the place. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN broke on top, set the pace along the inside, slightly larger advantage nearing
midstretch, responded when the top two challenged while inside those two, gave ground grudgingly to the wire. ART QUEEN back off the pace and the
inside, three wide through the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to close the gap a bit. PADDY GAL off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, saved
ground into the stretch, went evenly through the stretch. MAREBELL failed to menace while racing two path. JONESBOROHURRICANE off a step slow,
void of speed, moved inside, passed some tiring rivals. RITA'S REVENGE away with the leaders, pressed the issue for a half in the two path, gave way in
the drive. SECRET CITY broke in good order, prompted the issue up front in the three path, also had little left for the stretch run. BABAS GAL broke out,
raced four wide and was never a factor. ANGELIC VISION was rank and off slow, finished early while racing inside.
