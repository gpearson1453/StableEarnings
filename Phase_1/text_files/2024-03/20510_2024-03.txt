CHLOE ROSE stalked the pace, bid three wide on the far turn, took charge, drew off under some mild urging, then widened in hand. MERCY MERCY set
the pace on the inside, dueled into the far turn, steadied while dropping back a bit, then came again in the final furlong and got up for second. MS
MERRABEL pressed the pace, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled, could not go with the winner, then dug in and lost second at the finish. A BIT BAD
N BOUJEE broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside, gained mildly and bested the others. CLASSY MISS raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off
the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CARLY HUSTLE raced three wide early, two wide off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and
failed to threaten. BRODY SLAM raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and improved her position. LONDONDERRY was off slowly, raced
three wide on the first turn, came four wide into the lane and did not factor. CINNAMON DREAM raced off the pace inside and gave way.

DESANTIS quickly pulled clear, widened on the final turn and just lasted while weakening in the final furlong. SUIGU STAR lacked speed, advanced wide
on the final turn, closed well but just missed. WE BE THERE broke slowly, angled inside after half a mile, loomed a threat but flattened out late. MERU
settled off the leaders inside and raced evenly through the stretch. THAT'S MY BUSINESS prompted the winner for half a mile and gave way. UNCLE YUDI
dropped back early and was never in contention and returned bleeding from the nostrils. LORD MIO flashed speed outside for half a mile then stopped
abruptly.

TURN ON THE CHARM set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused, pulled away and widened under
urging. MISS CHAMITA raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, angled out in the stretch run, rallied outside and was along for the place spot.
BOSSYNESS stalked close up two wide, chased the winner on the far turn, dug in through the lane and lost second late. SALAGADOOLA raced two wide
off the pace, gained mildly and got fourth. GAMESTONKS raced off the pace inside, then two wide on the backside and gained mildly inside in the stretch.
PEACH PERFECT raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MAGNIFICENT PEARL raced two wide off the
pace, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and faded. WESTERN DREAM tracked on the inside, chased entering the far turn, then checked on the turn
and dropped back. GINGERS WISH raced off the pace and did not factor.

JESUS' DREAM stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled with YULETIDE GALLOP passing the furlong marker, battled heads apart with
that rival in the final sixteenth and got the nod at the wire. YULETIDE GALLOP dueled inside for command, gained a short lead on the turn, dueled again
into the stretch, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the final furlong, battled to the wire and just missed. EDDIE W raced off the rail, off the pace, came
four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. DOS DE OROS raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally.
GRAHMALAMADINGDONG raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. CHECKING BOXES dueled two wide, dueled on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
PERFECT DAY quickly moved clear, controlled the pace then drew away through the stretch under moderate urging. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN stumbled
badly at the start causing his rider to lose his irons briefly, split foes rallying in the lane to gain the place. BAAFEED lacked speed, moved very wide on the
turn and stretch closing the gap. DADASHEV prompted the pace three wide between rivals and continued willingly. VIOLENT TURBULENCE forced the
pace along the inside then proved empty in the stretch. BO'S BOURBON was urged close up to the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. GABE chased
inside and was never involved. PICTOR was eased back and steered wide on the turn then weakened. MUNDO MIX prompted the leader five wide down
the backstretch and gave way.

NATURAL HARBOR raced close up three wide between foes, bid into the stretch and narrowly prevailed after a long drive. NINJA PRIZE prompted the
pace in the two path and continued gamely to the finish. CAPITAL CONQUEST lacked speed, moved very wide into the stretch and closed well. UNIFIED
BY CANDY led under pressure inside and battled gamely to the finish. RESPIRATOR dropped back early, advanced inside then went evenly late. CAPT.
CANDY in tight early, angled to the rail, moved closer on the turn then weakened. YO NESSROUNDONKERN trailed far behind and was never in
contention. DANCE CODE prompted the pace five wide down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, angled out, rallied in upper stretch, then angled back to the rail, closed
willingly inside of CAUSES TROUBLE and proved best. CAUSES TROUBLE set the pace, shook free going into the turn, responded when roused, dug in
gamely in the stretch run, dueled outside of the winner in the final sixteenth and yielded. MR. ROUNDTREE was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn,
angled out at the eighth pole and rallied mildly for third. SPLENDOR BEAUTY was bumped at the start, stalked two wide, chased on the turn, came three
wide into the lane, made a mild bid, then flattened out. BATTER UP BUD was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the
lane and closed belatedly. SHERIFF RONNIE stalked three wide, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. LILTONYTWOPHONES
tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, made a bid and weakened. FATIH chased two wide and tired.
