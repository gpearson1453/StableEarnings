Footnotes
MAGGIE D'CAUSE was off slowly, raced three wide between near the three eighths pole, waited for racing room near the five sixteenths pole, eased out
four deep in the drive and got up under strong handling. SAYAAD AIN'T SO showed good early foot along the inside to set the pace and gave way
grudgingly late to the wire. ACELA EXPRESS stalked the pace, moved up four wide between rivals around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire.
SERENDIPITY COCO dropped back early, was near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out into the upper lane and made a good late gain. GREEN
LIGHT GIRL raced five deep around the far turn and had no rally in the drive while racing from the outside. FLASHY GAIL chased the pace three wide and
was empty in the drive. The five eighths internal fractional time was unavailable.
