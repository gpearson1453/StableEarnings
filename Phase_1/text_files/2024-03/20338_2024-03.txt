Footnotes
LOVELY LUCY hesitated leaving the gate but got immediately into stride and pressured the pace, took the nod three wide passing the five sixteenths pole
and contested the edge two deep on the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. BOBBI TWO STEPS angled in on the chute then set a pressured
pace, was met at the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and remained a factor through the upper stretch
before relenting. GOLDEN RUN exchanged contact with NOBLE OBSESSION leaving the gate then pressured the early pace inside, dropped back at the
rail at the five sixteenths pole and flattened stride into the lane. The latter exchanged contact with Golden Run leaving the gate and was shut off on the
chute, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the stretch. TIDBIT gave chase, rounded the turn about
the four path then angled in and finished evenly near the rail. SHARP CHEDDAR saved ground. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Bobbi Two Steps for interference on the chute, lodged by the rider of Noble Obsession, and disqualified the former as a result.

Footnotes
CAFFEINENNICOTINE stalked two deep then raced at even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn, dug in for the nod mid-stretch and held well while inching further ahead. BRADLEY DO RIGHT took over while tapering to the inside and rated the
pace, was met and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch before
relenting. TOWN HOT raced off the rail the first turn then eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and came
along to take third the final strides. GHOSTLY LEO settled in the three path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path then flattened in the lane. SUAVE STORY rated close to the early pace inside but faded leaving the nine sixteenths pole. A FAIR
NOTION broke a bit awkwardly and showed brief early speed while stalking three wide the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded
toward the far turn.

and was steadily handled to hold on. DOCTOR PARDO saved ground, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and
finished well at the outside flank of the winner. ALDRINALINE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn four wide then flattened later yards. MEETMARYSMAN settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
ran through the far turn about the five path and finished evenly. PINNACLE REEF stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened near the rail on the far turn. JEFFERSON SECURITY raced well back while saving ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole and could only improve his position. CHARITABLE WINDSOR stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but faded three wide on the far turn. I SEE NOTHING raced in the six path the first turn and never factored. JOOBY DOOBY DOO rounded

determined stretch handling and took the nod in the final yards. RIDE THE BRAND stalked two deep on the first turn, took the lead into the backstretch and
came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, dueled clear toward the quarter, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in from the
head of the lane but was caught in the final yards. YACHTSMEN exchanged contact with Seattle Prince leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead in the five path on the far turn and finished well while gaining on the top two. DANTE'S
INFERNO was shuffled back early then saved ground racing well back, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and
finished well. CANDY MAN CAN raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn about the four path,
moved toward the inside entering the stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. UNDERBOSS rounded the first turn about the four path then stalked three
wide into the backstretch, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back nearing the quarter and weakened at the rail on the far turn. SEATTLE
PRINCE ducked in and exchanged contact with Yachtsmen leaving the gate then set the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch, gave chase from
that point but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
YOUNG TURK took the lead at the three quarter pole then angled to the inside entering the first turn and rated the pace, was hand urged into the far turn
then kept alert in the lane. SCHMEAR raced off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and settled for second best. CHROME HEIR raced well back off the rail the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily
improved, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished evenly to take third mid-stretch. SCOTCH NO ROCKS was bumped
outward and raced in the six path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and passed some
rivals. LET FREEDOM SPRING stalked inside on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
ALPHA WHISKEY drifted and made contact with Assert Dominance into the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
in the four path on the far turn. STAVANGER raced well back off the rail the first turn and bid only mildly leaving the seven sixteenths pole. ASSERT
DOMINANCE was forced outward and into Scotch No Rocks into the first turn and raced in the five path through the turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but weakened toward the quarter. AKINGISALWAYSKING entered the first turn off the rail, eased out entering the backstretch and gave
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response.
