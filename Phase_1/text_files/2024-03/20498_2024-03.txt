MY QUIET PLACE sped clear soon after the start shifting in to set the pace nearer the rail, drew off in upper stretch, held safe. PRINCESS K settled off the
pace and racing off the inside, gaind the place. SILVER MATY chased the eventual winner from off the inside, weakened, lost place late. SHILSHOLE BAY
chased from near inside, switched out, failed to rally. KARMA DE VILLE chased while advancing a bit outside heading into the turn, bore out midway and
again leaving that bend, faded.

Footnotes
FINNLEY'S KITTEN shifted in leading them to the first turn, ceded the lead content to track in behind, shifted six wide turning into upper stretch, struck the
lead soon after and kicked clear. PANCAKES AND BEER was under a strong hold in the early going stalking in behind two to three wide, bid at the top of
the stretch, was outkicked. M G BIG MARIA settled well back, saved ground near the rail throughout, improved position. HELLO BABY stalked from outside
three to four wide, came out six wide in upper stretch, ran on. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY stalked mostly two to four wide, asked for more while shifting out six
deep coming to the quarter pole, flattened out in the drive. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE switched out on the first turn, moved to the lead early up the backstretch to
force the issue, was clear midway on the far turn, faltered in the stretch. MEAN ELENITA switched out in the early going racing about three wide and at the
back, failed to rally. UPTOWN RHAPSODY raced at the back near the inside, came out at the top of the stretch, was not a threat. DORITA'S HAPPY pulled
to the front entering the first turn, set the early pace, faltered and faded.

MR NAVIGATOR stalked the leading pair mostly four to five wide, moved to the lead at the five-sixteenths, drew clear and held. MACEDONIAN RULER
(AUS) settled outside, fanned ten wide, gained late. BEL RAGAZZO settled off the pace, fanned eleven wide for the drive and ran on mildly. BOYFRIEND
MATERIAL pressed the pace from outside four wide, bid at the three-eighths, had a narrow brief lead then switched out past the quarter, ran on and
exchanged a light brush in late stretch. AVALON KING quickly moved to the lead while coming out several paths, set the pace about three deep with outside
pressure, weakened and exchanged some brushing in the lane. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was in just a hair tight at the start, was never near enough to
threaten while racing off the inside. MONGOLIAN MOON bumped with a foe at the start, raced outside mostly three to four deep on the turns at the back
and was not a threat. SUMMER SHANDEE bumped with a foe at the start, raced near the rail, was not a threat.

Footnotes
DIRT FLIRT shifted in settling at the back, angled five wide leaving the far turn, took the lead a furlong out, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and kicked clear.
RIVETING SPIRIT was under a stout hold early up the backstretch when in tight between runners, stalked about two to three deep, angled out leaving the
far turn, bid at the eighth pole mildly but was second best. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL tracked from inside, came out in mid-stretch, kept on. INVINCIBELLA
(GB) set the pace from off the rail, weakened. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) tossed the head at the start, settled outside at the back, fanned six wide into upper
stretch, failed to rally. HIGH GUNNER stalked three deep then edged nearer on the far turn to be within range of the leader coming to the quarter pole,
lacked the needed late kick.
