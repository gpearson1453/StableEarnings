Footnotes
MAGIC SPIN prompted the early pace from the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn and continued that bid to get up late after a long drive to prove
best. GOT THUNDER was bumped at the start, pressed the early pace from between rivals, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command between
rivals by the quarter pole, then gained a short advantage and fought on to the wire but was out-kicked to miss. ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS was rated along
two wide, came three wide into the lane and was in striking range, angled out nearing the sixteenth marker for racing room and was gaining late. CAMULUS
set a pressured pace early two wide, then vied for the lead on the inside by the quarter pole but faded late. NOBLE JON chased the early pace and was four
to five wide on the turn, made a outside bid leaving the furlong marker but hung late. PORTAL ONE was settled early on the inside, came three wide into the
lane and had a belated rally. TOWN'S WARRIOR pressed the early pace on the inside and stopped. PER RULING ECM2024-120/ECM FROM THE
PENSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION GOT THUNDER DQD FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

KEEPING IT COUNTRY was well rated early on the inside, shifted off the inside and advanced four wide by the half mild marker, made a three wide move
on the turn in hand and took over leaving the five sixteenths, then drew off to prove much the best in the lane while being wrapped up. CAJUN OCCASION
tracked the pace three wide, then two wide by the half mild marker, three wide on the turn and finished willingly while no match to the winner, second best.
HONORABLE AVENUE lunged at the start, then went up to set the pace while getting to the inside, then was headed on the turn and could not go with the
winner and weakened, held show award late. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY was four wide into the first turn, settled back, came four wide into the lane and had
no rally while just missing the show award. LORD WINSALOT was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide and tired.

Footnotes
SHATTER ME was away alertly to set the pace in the two path, then drew out leaving the turn and remained clear to the wire to prove best under a drive.
KATY THE CAT was rated along two wide, then was three wide by the quarter pole, then finished well to be clearly second best. HELLO GRACIE stalked
the pace three wide and faded in the drive, bested rest. ROSES FROM HEAVEN was settled early, four wide on the turn and came five wide off the turn but
had no kick. SCOREBOARD LILY was settled early between rivals, three wide on the turn and had no rally. DAILY BRIEFING was settled early on the
inside, three wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally. HIGHWAY QUEEN tracked the pace on the inside and weakened.
