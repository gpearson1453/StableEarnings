Footnotes
RB MAMA WINGATE maintained a steady pace well ahead of the pack down the backstretch and throughout the turn, was threatened by an inner rival in
the early stretch, but kept on determinedly to the wire to prove best and claim first victory for apprentice TERESA SALAZAR. UPTOWN MON AME tracked
the pace from the inside down the backstretch and throughout the turn under a steady drive, then dug in in the upper stretch but did not have enough to
catch the leader in the end. WMA TORCH LIGHT bumped foe at the start, saved ground while racing at the back of the pack down the backstretch, then
was gaining ground down the lane but it was not enough in the end. WMA ATLAS bumped inner foe at the start, then raced in the middle of the field at a
moderate pace throughout and needed more in the stretch. WMA DIAMOND GIRL broke inwardly, then bid briefly down the backstretch while two wide and
towards the back pack, then stopped at the top of the turn and flattened out in the final furlongs.

Footnotes
CASHMERE DANCER was well reserved along inside in the early furlongs, then moved up on the far turn while passing rivals from the four path, dug in
gamely and edged clear in the late stretch to prevail in the end. IN OPEN COURT saved ground in the furlongs, then advanced on the far turn along the rail
and inside of rivals, was under a gamely rally in the early stretch and was up for the place prize in the end. MISS CARMEN CIBO set the pace from the
inside into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a hard drive leaving the far turn and while being confronted by rivals on both sides, could not retain
bid and was out finished in the end and best for third pla. ELMO'S SECRET chased the pace from the two path, then menaced gamely on the fat turn and
into the home stretch and needed more in the end. CAPETOWN CANDY chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid strongly on the far
turn to gain second position, could not catch the leader and gave way in the final furlong. LEPRECHAUN CHARM was allowed to settle along the inside
throughout the early furlongs, then bid leaving the far bend and came up empty in the end. MISS GOLD was pinched back at the start, the settled in the two
path at the back of the pack, made a mild bid on the far turn then drifted out in the late stretch and made no impact in the end. LEOPARD BAIT chased the
pace while three wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn before giving way in the home stretch.

SWEET N SALTY led the way from the inside, cleared the turn and held sway down the lane to prove best in the end. IN A MINESHAFT was off well, then
raced while three wide mid pack, then bid on the turn and gained second position entering the stretch, lacked the winning bid and bested the rest for the
place prize in the end. THAT'S ABOUT IT raced towards the back of the pack while four wide, then bid gamely leaving the bend and came up evenly in the
late stretch. MAGENS BAY was bumped at the start, then chased the pace while two wide under a hard drive in the early furlongs then flattened out in the
stretch. MEDAGLIA'S SONG broke outwardly and bumped rival, then was allowed to settle while three wide, bid on the turn and came up flat in the stretch.
LAST PENALTY urged eagerly from the inside leaving the gate and at the back of the pack, then stopped on the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch.

lead in the early stretch under a gamely rally then was caught in the end and was second best. CASINO QUEEN stalked the pace from the three path, then

drive leaving the bend in attempt to bid for the lead, could not retain stride and gave way in the end. CANADA CANDY chased the pace while three wide
mid pack, then was gaining ground mildly in the late stretch but was not enough in the end. RUMPUS chased the pace from the inside in the second flight of

KENTUCKY ICE moved up to set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn and held sway down the lane under a confident hand ride to prove much the
best. WITT'S JERRY tracked the pace while two wide, was in a long drive leaving the turn, was met with an outer rival to duel for second position down the
late stretch and was up for the place prize. UNCLE CHAN stalked the pace while four wide in the early furlongs, then dug in gamely in the early stretch,
battled for the place prize and just missed in the end. LET ME LOVE YOU broke inward and bumped rival, then was allowed to settle along the inside, split
rivals in the late backstretch to bid from the inside on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. PRINCE CURLIN broke outward and bumped outer foe,
then settled along the inside, bid leaving the turn, split rivals in the early stretch and closed too little too late in the end. DREAM TIME raced in the middle of
the pack from the inside, then settled back on the turn, re bid in the upper stretch and still came up flat in the end. LEXINGTON RIVER raced in the middle
of the pack while four wide, then bid at the top of the turn and did not fire in the stretch. VICKIE'S GOLD stalked the pace while three wide, was in a hard
drive leaving the backstretch to gain second position momentarily then stopped at the top of the turn and had no final bid. TEXAS REIGN was cut off at the
start and failed to rally. ALPHABET ADAMS was off slowly, then pulled up on the backstretch and walked off in the end.

Footnotes
SHOTSHELL led the way into the first turn, maintained a steady pace throughout and was kept to task till the end to prove best. MUFFIN NUTS saved
ground in the early furlong while racing towards the back of the pack, came out four wide leaving the turn then closed. LIONS NOT SHEEP was allowed to
settle while three wide, then rallied gamely on the turn to close willingly down the home stretch just missing the place prize in the end. TOTAL SURPRISE
tracked the pace from the inside while maintaining second position down the backstretch and throughout the far turn, was in a long drive then was over
powered by outer rivals mid stretch and gave way in the end. BIG BERNIE raced in the middle of the pack and between rivals, then urged steadily on the far
turn to rally in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. THUNDER ROAD was unhurried early, raced behind the field down the backstretch, then bid
mildly leaving the far turn and came up empty in the end. SEIZE THE TREASURE raced in the middle of the field while three wide heading into the
backstretch, then rallied on the far turn, was used up and weakened in the home stretch. MY BROTHER KEITH raced in the middle of the pack from the
inside throughout the first half, then faded on the turn lacked rallying in the home stretch.
