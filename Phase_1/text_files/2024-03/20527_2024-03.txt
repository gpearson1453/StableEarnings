Footnotes
WE CAN broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile
marker, chased three wide into the far turn, asked for run leaving the quarter pole and loomed three wide into upper stretch, took command and drew to a
clear lead at the furlong marker, drew away under mild urging into the final sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish to prevail as much the best.
VERITAS AEQUITAS took back off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, improved position into the backstretch run and saved all of the
ground nearing the quarter pole, chased into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and
was best of the rest. BROTHER O' BRIEN settled off of the early pace, raced a bit in tight entering the first turn and was shuffled back leaving the
seven-furlong marker, tracked the moderate pace three wide approaching the half-mile pole, improved position into the far turn, rallied three to four wide in
the stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and was up in time to secure show honors. BEAU BRUME prominent in the early going, stalked the pace from
a ground saving position into the backstretch run, chased two to three wide into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and lost position at the
furlong pole, weakened into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third. SIX HOT GRANDS forwardly placed into the first turn, assumed command and
set the pace while off of the rail heading into the backstretch, set moderate fractions nearing the half-mile pole, showed the way into the far turn, was
overtaken into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. GALLOPING MAJOR settled off of the moderate early pace, tracked the pace between
runners nearing the half-mile pole, lost position into the second turn and chased two wide to the quarter pole, was outrun in the lane and did not threaten.
RED RAJ lacked early speed, lost contact along the backstretch run, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
BEAT OF MY HEART broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, was engaged by PASSANDO nearing the half-mile marker and set solid
early fractions while pressured into the turn, shook free into the bend and was well handled while showing the way to the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead
into the stretch, kept to task into the final sixteenth, maintained a clear lead into deep stretch and held sway. CLARINA hit the gate at the start and was off a
bit slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from a ground saving position, chased into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, tipped two
wide into upper stretch, could not impact the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. CHARLOTTES DELIGHT lunged at the start and was
away slowly, was green in the early going and trailed nearing the half-mile pole, was taken to the outside entering the turn and chased four to five wide
nearing the quarter pole, raced widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for
third. KEEPYOURPRANCEON close up to the decent early pace while between runners, chased three to four wide into the turn and lost ground at the
quarter marker, spun four wide into the lane and was outkicked at mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. PASSANDO
crowded a bit by a neighboring rival at the start, rushed up in the early stages and pressed the pace approaching the half-mile pole, kept close attendance to
BEAT OF MY HEART into the turn, chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch and tired in the drive. LOVELY
JOSEPHINE chased the solid early pace from between rivals, lost position into the turn, ran in pursuit into upper stretch, could not find a response in the
final furlong and gave way.

Footnotes
POKER ALICE off a step slowly leaving the start, was unhurried into the first turn and trailed into the backstretch run, chased two wide into the second turn
then angled three wide at the quarter pole, was asked for run into upper stretch and loomed nearing the furlong marker, drew to even terms with
ACCLAIMED PREACHER past mid-stretch and battled that rival into the final sixteenth, repelled the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and edged away to
prove best. ACCLAIMED PREACHER put into a bit of tight quarters leaving the start, rated just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn,
advanced into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, took command into the second turn and drew to a clear
lead at the quarter pole, led into the stretch and was confronted by POKER ALICE nearing the furlong marker, met that rival's bid and battled into the final
sixteenth, was repelled by the determined winner in deep stretch and was second best. CEE'S THE IMAGE broke alertly and established the early lead,
ceded into the first turn and stalked the pace into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, chased two wide to the quarter pole
and vied between runners into upper stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong pole, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and was well clear in the end for
third. PRINCESS BELLE squeezed a bit by neighboring rivals at the start, was keen while between runners heading into the first turn, settled off of the early
pace and saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked while not far back nearing the half-mile marker, maintained an inside path into the far turn and
gained ground at the quarter pole, tipped two wide into upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response and passed tired rivals in the final stages.
DESERT RUMBLE bothered by neighboring rivals a bit leaving the start, was forwardly placed in the early stages and tracked the pace two to three wide
into the first turn, tracked from an outside position approaching the half-mile pole and mounted a three wide bid into the far turn, could not sustain that run
into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. BETTOR BET'R prominent in the early going, assumed command into the first turn and drew to a clear
lead into the backstretch run, set decent fractions while controlling the pace heading to the half-mile marker, was overtaken into the second turn, dropped
back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

FAYRUZ TRIBUTE a step slow leaving the start, settled outside of runners in the early stages and went three wide into the first turn, advanced into the
backstretch run and tracked three wide nearing the half-mile marker, chased into the second turn and swung four wide for the stretch drive, rallied and came
within aim at the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, wore down foes into deep stretch and held for the win at the finish. DONTIM
hustled to be forwardly placed leaving the start, was prominent into the first turn and stalked the pace four wide into the backstretch run, prompted the
modest pace heading to the half-mile marker, pressed into the second turn and vied between runners into upper stretch, took command and held a narrow
advantage at the furlong marker, stubbornly battled into the final sixteenth, was overtaken in deep stretch and re-rallied in the final strides to be clear for
place honors. MR. MENDELSSOHN forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the pace three wide into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run
and stalked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased into the second turn and gained ground three wide at the quarter pole, vied for the
lead into the stretch, battled between runners into the final sixteenth, outkicked in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for third. FINCAIRN broke
alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the pace while saving ground into the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into
the far turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into upper stretch, could not muster a rally in the final furlong and passed a tired rival in
the late stages. STEVE'S BIG TICKET asked for speed leaving the start, assumed command into the first turn and set the pace while between rivals
heading into the backstretch run, set modest fractions while prompted to the half-mile pole, pressed into the far turn, was overtaken into upper stretch and
tired in the drive. WHAT A RELIEF rated off of the early pace while not far back, tracked two wide and between runners into the backstretch run, chased
three wide into the second turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, gave way in the stretch and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
MAGIC CHROME broke alertly and was forwardly placed without being asked, settled into a tracking spot on the rail to the turn a couple of lengths behind
the lone pacesetter, was sent after the lead from the five-sixteenths pole, slipped out a path near the furlong pole and finished out under steady handling
and intermittent urging to prevail while drifting out a little in the final yards. . ELEGANT SWAY raced near the back of the compact field but in the clear three
to four wide to the outside down the backstretch, angled five wide into the stretch and finished with a strong rally under steady handling to just miss.
HONORABLE GAL crowded some at the start and was last into stride the rushed up to stay close to the leading group thorough the early stages, moved out
to the three path for the run down the backstretch, remained in mid-pack through the turn, started a three-wide rally from the three-furlong pole, finished well
but came up a bit short. LADY GREGORY broke well and took the early lead, opened up on the field after a furlong, held sway to deep stretch while racing
on the wrong lead through the stretch run, then was overtaken inside the sixteenth. BLURSDAY was one of the first into stride but ceded the lead to LADY
GREGORY through the initial furlong then went after that rival from the seven-sixteenths pole, had some trouble changing leads at the the top of the stretch,
raced within aim into the final sixteenth but could not muster the needed late response. MASTERY KAT outrun from the break, raced in last position but was
close up in the compact field to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, was gaining in the final furlong but failed to make a late impact.

Footnotes
DRIVER'S ED sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace while prompted to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn and
set the pace a bit off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, set down into upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong marker and was kept to task into the
final sixteenth, dug in while under pressure in deep stretch and held for the win at the finish. EDDIE CROSSWIRE bumped then shuffled a bit leaving the
start, was a bit slow away from the gate and was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced outside of rivals into the turn and improved position three wide
at the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and just
missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure place honors. LUCKY LAD close up to the decent early pace, tracked from the inside at the half-mile
pole and saved ground into the turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter pole, tipped two wide into upper stretch and found room heading to the
furlong marker, loomed at mid-stretch and responded into the final sixteenth, was outclosed in deep stretch and just missed for the win and place, while
holding clear for show honors. DUPLICATION squeezed at the start, was off slowly then rushed up in the early going and tracked the pace between rivals
nearing the half-mile marker, went two to three wide into the turn and was boxed in at the quarter pole, was blocked into upper stretch and lost position at
the furlong marker, navigated traffic into the final sixteenth and was gaining in deep stretch, while unable to impact the leaders at the finish. JERSEY BABE
prominent away from the start, tracked the decent early pace from a three wide position nearing the half-mile marker, chased into the turn and went three to
four wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. NUESTRO
ENGREIDO took back off of the decent early pace, tracked between runners heading to the half-mile marker, shifted to the inside entering the turn and
chased to the quarter pole, was asked for run into upper stretch and did not offer a late response. ELCONDOR hustled away from the start, was prominent
in the early going and stalked the decent pace outside of DRIVER'S ED heading into the turn, kept close attendance to the pace while two to three wide
nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way.

HALLISAR veered out at the start then raced between horses early as one of several contesting the early lead, pulled away from the rest at the half-mile
marker, was well-handled to the quarter pole, responded when set down in the stretch and held clear to the finish. DUNGARVAN OAK broke a step slow
then raced boxed in but patiently ridden between horses through the far turn, angled out about four wide for the stretch run, finish well and was gaining on
the winner at the wire. HOT GOBLIN veered out bumped lightly with SLEWSCION a couple of strides out of the gate, then raced towards the inside in fairly
tight quarters to the turn, then was boxed through the turn, swung out two to three paths for the stretch run, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and was
edged for place honors, while holding clearly for third. SLEWSCION took a light bump from HOT GOBLIN after the break, then was outrun to the half, made
a three wide rally through the turn, loomed five wide into the stretch then lugged in, avoided contact with GRAND SLAM KID, angled back out to the five
path into the clear and continued to run on to improve position. MR. DUFF broke quickly but opted not to get involved in the early pace scramble, followed
GRAND SLAM KID as that one quickened to challenge for the lead, went into a drive from the five-sixteenths pole and raced erratically in the stretch.
GRAND SLAM KID broke well and raced close up early on the outside of the scramble for the early lead, went after HALLISAR after passing the
three-furlong pole, took up slightly to avoid clipping heels with HOT GOBLIN in mid-stretch, lost momentum and finished evenly. LETSGOTOTHEBAR broke
well and briefly had the lead in the early stages, was overtaken, dropped back to last on the turn, was no factor from that point but managed to pass a
stablemate just before the wire. PAKAS SECRET broke alertly and was up close to the half, dropped back to last then attempted to rally back to regain
contact with the field, was unable to do so and was outrun down the stretch.
