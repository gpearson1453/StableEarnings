Footnotes
BIG GEORGE unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the backstretch run and was content to trail approaching the half-mile pole, improved
position four wide into the far turn, was asked for run while widest into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, overtook MR. MENDELSSOHN at the
sixteenth-pole and kicked clear in deep stretch. MR. MENDELSSOHN settled off of the early pace while not far back, went four wide into the first turn and
raced widest into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, improved position two to three wide along the far turn, was asked
for run into the stretch and took command approaching the furlong marker, was overtaken by BIG GEORGE into the final sixteenth, could not match strides
with the winner into deep stretch and held clearly in the end for second. DONTIM took back off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, never
far back through the backstretch run, chased two wide into the second turn and encountered a bit of traffic at the quarter marker, shifted three wide into the
stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong and got up for show honors in the final strides. FINCAIRN showed good speed and assumed command away
from the start, drew to a clear lead along the first turn and set the pace into the backstretch run, carved out moderate fractions while controlling the pace to
the half-mile marker, showed the way while clear into the second turn, came under pressure into upper stretch and was overtaken nearing the furlong
marker, gave way into deep stretch and was outfinished for third in the final strides. COPPERTUNITY was prominent leaving the start, ceded the early lead
and stalked two wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the second turn and chased to the quarter
pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, the rider lost his crop at mid-stretch, lacked the needed late response
and weakened into deep stretch. CANTILEVER settled just off of the early pace, tracked between rivals into the first turn and raced three wide into the
backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, was well placed approaching the second turn and chased three wide and between rivals
heading to the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.

backstretch run, drew to a long lead while controlling the pace approaching the half-mile marker, was clear into the far turn and was kept to task into upper
stretch, held the oncoming runner-up at bay into the final sixteenth, was fully extended into deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. WE CAN settled
just off of the early pace, drifted out along the first turn and carried out a rival leaving the seven-furlong marker, raced three wide into the backstretch run
and was content to track the solid pace heading to the half-mile pole, chased two wide into the far turn, made a steady advance on RIGHT HAND RYDER

three wide at the quarter pole, offered a mild bid into the stretch and was well clear in the end for third. RIVERMARK prominent away from the start, came in
a bit tight entering the first turn and steadied at the seven-furlong marker, tracked the pace into the backstretch run then chased the solid pace to the

Footnotes
BACALAR hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out moderate fractions while pressed to the
quarter pole, shook free into upper stretch and kicked to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task under right-handed urging into the final
sixteenth and maintained a clear lead to the finish to hold sway. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN away a step slowly from the start, recovered and tracked the decent
early pace while not far back, improved position into the turn and chased two to three wide approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly while in pursuit to
mid-stretch, split rivals and rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and won the nod for second at the finish. MISTICAL
SURPRISE prominent away from the start, tracked the decent early pace from the inside and saved ground into the turn, chased to the quarter marker and
maintained an inside path into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed well into the final sixteenth and just missed for place honors at the
finish, while clear of the rest for the show. RIVIERA SUNRISE took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and trailed to the quarter
marker, swung four wide for the stretch drive and found her best stride late. DRAW NEAR showed speed away from the start and disputed the decent early
pace, pressed BACALAR through moderate fractions while two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, lost ground to BACALAR into upper stretch and
chased that rival to the furlong pole, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and gave way.

and chased the decent pace to the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the drive and vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with BROADWAY TIGER to
the furlong marker, shook free of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and drew clear to prevail in the late stages. BROADWAY TIGER broke alertly and
assumed command away from the start, was engaged by TOUR QUEEN in the early running and set a pressured pace to the half-mile pole, shook free into
the turn and drew to a clear lead at the quarter marker, was confronted by ARCTIC BREEZE into upper stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong
grounds, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished into deep stretch, while well clear of the rest for second. TOUR

the end for third. LADY GOOD TROUBLE raced close up to the decent early pace while between rivals, tracked the pace heading into the turn and chased

BLETCHLEY PARK was prominent away from the start and stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, maintained that three wide path into the
backstretch run and prompted the modest pace to the half-mile marker, pressed MOTHER'S PRAYER into the far turn and battled for the lead with that rival
into the stretch, took a slim lead at the furlong marker, kept to task while holding a narrow advantage into the final sixteenth, kept foes at bay into deep
stretch and held in a drive at the finish for a determined win. LOVE CANDY threw his head at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled just off of the early
pace and went two wide and between runners into the first turn, tracked the modest pace between rivals approaching the half-mile pole, was guided two to
three wide into the far turn and encountered traffic at the quarter pole, angled out into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, responded to
urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while earning the nod for place honors at the finish. ROYAL
'N RANDO was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace from an inside position along the first turn, was well placed through the
backstretch run and tracked the modest pace to the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into the second turn and advanced at the quarter marker,
mounted an inside rally into the stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, battled gamely into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top
two in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. RIMPROTECTOR unhurried while not far back in the early running, saved ground into the
backstretch run and tracked the modest pace to the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well into
the final sixteenth, encountered traffic in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. KENNEBEC tracked the early pace three wide into the first
turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run and maintained an outside path into the far turn, mounted a three to four wide bid at the quarter
marker, raced widest into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, could not muster a response into the final sixteenth and flattened out. MOTHER'S
PRAYER broke alertly and was hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace while off of the rail into the first turn, dictated terms
into the backstretch run and set a modest pace to the half-mile pole, came under pressure into the second turn and met the bid of BLETCHLEY PARK into
the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
J T'S WATCH was allowed to settle into stride from the break, steadied slightly approaching the six furlong pole then settled mid-pack about two off the rail
racing between horses down the backstretch, waited patiently for room through the far turn and was rewarded when a hole opened up turning into the
stretch, responded to strong handling, gradually cut into the lead of a stubborn HARBOR OUTLAW, gained the lead yards from the wire and prevailed by a
long neck. HARBOR OUTLAW broke alertly and went straight to the front without much prompting, traded punches with BRONZE WARRIOR through
modest fractions while alternating the lead through the first half-mile, responded when set down from the quarter pole, opened up on the field turning for
home, ran on determinedly and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was floated four wide through the clubhouse turn,
continued to race wide down the backstretch but in the clear, started a long rally after passing the half-mile marker, came five wide into the stretch and
continued to run on, was getting to the top two but came up a bit short. TWIRLING DERBY broke well and got a nice tracking trip along the rail, was always
close up, responded to steady handling when set down for the stretch run, finished well but could not find another gear when needed in the late stages and
was outfinished. BUTTONWOOD TREE came away well and was forwardly placed through the clubhouse turn, raced about five down the backstretch while
pulling the rider up towards the leaders, became boxed in on the far turn and had to wait for racing room, was still behind horses turning for home then split
a pair in mid-stretch and finished evenly. SUGAR BEETS was off a beat slow and was next to last to the first turn, settled near the rear through the early
stages, started to advance while racing four to five wide through the far turn then floated about six wide into the stretch, was making some late gains but had
too much ground to make up. PLAYBOY STYLE lacked early speed and raced at the back of the field through the first turn, tried to launch a wide rally from
the three furlong pole, came seven wide into the stretch and showed some late interest but was never a threat. GALLANT WARREN raced four wide
through the first half-mile while under some restraint, then pulled to make steady forward progress down the backstretch racing four to five wide, went after
the leaders with three furlongs to run, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch then flattened out, finishing evenly in the final furlong. LOOKOUT POINT was
mid-pack through the first turn but gradually dropped back and was in last heading down the backstretch, started to lose ground once past the halfway point,
came under a stiff drive on the far turn but was unable to make up any ground the rest of the way. BRONZE WARRIOR was hustled to get forward position
early but was beaten to the turn by HARBOR OUTLAW, raced two to three wide and traded the lead with that foe through fairly moderate fractions to half
mile marker, hung in there when the pace picked up through the far turn, started to weaken near the quarter pole then had little to offer in the stretch.
