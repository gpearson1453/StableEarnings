Footnotes
UPSWELL bumped and put an inner rival to crowded quarters at the start, set a pressured pace along the inside, led just off the fence into the lane, shook
free of an outer rival nearing midstretch and held sway. KAZILLION brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, sustained pursuit to
claim place and tip outside of the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, but needed more to offer a bid. CAPELLA RED bumped an outer rival at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three path crept closer under urging turning for home in the four path, and ran on mildly to edge show in the final sixteenth. NOBLE
BERNADETTE took contact from an inner foe at the start, tracked two to three wide around the first turn, stalked before progressing to press in the three
path into the far turn, had aim within range entering the lane, but failed to achieve even terms before giving way leaving upper stretch. PLAYMATE bobbled
slightly and brushed with an inner foe before bumping an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, pressed tucking two wide early down the backstretch,
but yielded between horses around the far turn, yet sustained a chase through the lane. GATHER THE FACTS pressed outside of the leader approaching
the first turn, but was restrained back between horses entering the backstretch to track two wide and among foes, but tired nearing the lane. INSPECTOR
PENNY was bumped and put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, trailed in the two path, moved out of last in the three to five path around the
far turn and lacked a rally. MONTANA ROSE broke inwardly, lacked speed along the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
F T W SLAM prompted two wide, dueled around the turn, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, drifted out briefly leaving the furlong grounds but
straightened course and held sway. HARDLY ABLE set the pace inside of the eventual winner, dueled with that one around the turn, got headed at the three
sixteenths pole, fought on grudgingly while hanging on his left lead and saved place. FORTY THREE stalked outside of the top pair, chased dropping back
into the turn, yet sustained stride as the leading pair slowed in the final furlong, came again but missed reaching place. GOLDENLUTE bumped with an
inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, pursued along the inside around the turn, then lacked a bid hanging on his left lead.
CPRIORITY laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. IRON N STEEL bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside and
weakened around the turn. HEZA SEXY ZONG trailed in the two path, moved to the five path entering the lane and was outrun.

Footnotes
SPRINGTOWN stalked the embattled leading pair from the three to two path, tipped to the four path to take aim outside of them entering the lane, sustained
steady progress to bid at the furlong grounds sparking a duel with an inner rival, leaned in sparring through the late stages and brushed his counterpart
while narrowly prevailing in the head-bob. MONSIEUR CANDY dueled for the lead along the inside, shook free in upper stretch, dug in to resist an outer
challenge in midstretch, gamely clung to an advantage through deep stretch but got nailed and brushed at the wire. CHASTE ONE trailed in the two to three
path, split foes launching a rally in upper stretch and ran on hanging on his left lead to edge show at the sixteenth pole. JOSIE'S PRIORITY tracked from the
four to five path and gave way while drifting out. CAPTIVATING STAR bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path and improved
position. GORDITO HERMOSO tracked along the inside, chased turning for home and weakened. LEISURELY laid off of the pace in the four path and
failed to factor. BACK BAYOU bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from the five path and tired. GUS'S DREAM WORLD came out at the start,
dueled for the lead two wide and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KYLE BEAUTY tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to bid outside of the leader in upper stretch, assumed command and the three sixteenths pole
and drew off handily. COUNTRY LADY stalked three wide, got outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch and ran on. CAJUN CATALINA showed the
way along the inside, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge at the three sixteenths pole and gave way. COPPER MOON pressed two wide, but
yielded three wide and between horses in upper stretch. HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY leaned in and bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace
in the four path and failed to menace. OURS AND THEIRS leaned out and bumped with an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three to five path and failed
to factor. MISS KENNEDY lacked speed in the two to four path and made little impact. COMMERCIAL FLASH pursued from off of the pace along the inside
and tired.

Footnotes
ZAICI set a clear pace in the three to two path, kicked away from an outer chaser in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. CLASSIC KING tracked in the
three to four path, pursued under urging in the three path around the far turn, then chased the clearing leader through the lane to prove second best.
HAMMERIN AAMER settled well back along the inside, advanced splitting rivals two wide at the five sixteenths pole, and ran on to edge show entering the
final sixteenth. KEYS INCLUDED stumbled at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, spun into the lane in the three path, shifted out in upper stretch
and moved up. I WILL STAND stalked inside of the leader and from the two path, chased along the inside turning for home and faded. NATE'S ATTACK
pursued from midpack in the four to five path, tracked outside of rivals around the far turn but faded. PAYNT BATTLE lacked speed in the five to four path
around the first turn and failed to factor. BONUS APPRECIATION raced off of the pace in the two to three path and made little imapct. MAX PANDOWDY
raced at the rear remaining in the four path and got outrun. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN pursued from midpack along the inside, weakened turning for home
and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
HIGH TIDE settled well back in the three path after breaking a step slow, advanced along the inside around the far turn, sustained progress to bid inside of
the leader in upper stretch and kicked away. HE'S GOT THIS saved ground well back, then rallied up the rail to gain place at the sixteenth pole and held
that position late. BOURBON DAY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around the far turn,
but got outmoved by a ground-saving rival while fanning five wide entering the lane, then ran on but needed more for place. FIREWATER JAKE stalked
tucking to the inside around the first turn, tipped to the three path and between horses entering the lane but only managed to chase thereafter. BIZZEE
CHANNEL stalked three to two wide around the first turn, sustained pursuit before being floated to the four path entering the lane, and yielded between
rivals. DUKE OF CARTHANIA bumped with an outer foe leaving the gates, laid off of the pace shifting from the two path to the four path entering the
backstretch, inched closer under urging in the five path turning for home, but fanned to the six path entering the lane and flattened out. HIGH CRUISE
showed the way along the inside, but got headed by a rail bidder in upper stretch and weakened between horses. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) was outrun.
PARROT HEAD pursued from the three path, but was through early and eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
LETMIKEFIGUREITOUT bumped an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, cleared entering the lane and lasted hanging on his left lead.
TAUREAN was brushed by an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride moving to the four path nearing midstretch and
offered a belated kick to reel in place while running out of ground. CATALINA DAY stalked the embattled leading pair from the two to three path, chased the
clearing eventual winner through the lane while hanging on his left lead and lost place late. SAUCER EYES lacked speed along the inside and moved up.
COUNTRY CHOICE chased from the three path and failed to menace. PUT IT BACK DAVE broke a step slow before being bumped and put to crowded
quarters between horses at the start, rushed forward to track from the five path into the turn, but tired hanging on his left lead. MEASURE OF FAITH was
bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses but made little impact. J L PAC MAN broke
inwardly, dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner but weakened entering the lane. CLEMENT'S NOTE brushed with an outer rival at the start and
failed to factor from the six path. PURRRFECT RHYTHM was knocked off stride by outer rivals soon after the start and got outrun.
