Footnotes
SCHMOOZIN was forwardly placed while racing four-wide on the turn, moved up to take the lead leaving the eighth pole and gradually drew clear.
COALMINER'S KITTEN vied for the lead from along the inside from the outset, responded when asked and held on gamely when headed. EMPTY
HOLSTER was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished well for the show in a steady effort. RED HORNET stumbled badly at the start to
get away well behind the field, then dropped further back while saving ground, angled out to be five-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished
willingly. SLAVA UKRAINI was close up early while racing five-wide but lacked a late response. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN saved ground while being allowed to
settle, slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out during the drive. READY MADE prompted the early pace while three-wide
and weakened. SOVIET STANDARD vied for the early lead racing two-wide while between horses and tired.

READTHETRANSCRIPT prompted the pace set by ALYANAABI racing two-wide from between horses and wore that one down in the final sixteenth to
prove narrowly best. ALYANAABI saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when asked but wasn't quite able to resist the winner late.
FEROCITY was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to off a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive. D' YANK
was allowed to settle while racing two-wide and went evenly late. MISTER CHARMING saved ground while being reserved off the pace but lacked a rally
when asked. COPPER CROSSING was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.

PURPLE OCTOPUS stumbled at the stretch then quickly recovered to open a clear lead, saved ground setting the pace and drew of to win as much the
best. LARRY'S LUNCHBOX was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished well for the place without threatening the winner.
RAISERICHIESRANSOM chased PURPLE OCTOPUS while racing two-wide and held on fairly well for the show. GUYDON was forwardly placed while
racing three-wide but lacked a rally. EIGHT MAY settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and went evenly. CHERRY ORCHARD was
reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ARTIE AND JESSIE dropped back while saving ground and failed to

GIMME THE CANDY saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. MOONLIGHT ROAD was reserved off the early pace, moved up
three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bid approaching the eighth pole but was unable to reach the winner while finishing well for second.
SKALKAHO saved ground chasing GIMME THE CANDY and held on well for third. PIRATE MARMALADE was allowed to settle early, came tree-wide into
the stretch and went evenly. I AM LOWKEY saved ground racing in the middle of the field but lacked a rally when asked. POND dropped back early while
saving ground and failed to menace. SKYPASS bobbled from between horses entering the turn unseating his rider, then was picked up by the outrider
following the race and walked off. THE SHEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING SKYPASS, BUT AFTER VIEWING

Footnotes
IMPULSIVENESS was off a step slow then dropped further back, moved forward along the inside on turn, altered course to be five-wide leaving the eighth
pole for room and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth and win going away. FLASHY RICHIE saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved
through to the lead entering the stretch but was unable to resist the winner late. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was forwardly place from the start, came
three-wide into the stretch then angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. MILLARD'S SMILE was unhurried early, angled out to be
five-wide nearing the quarter pole and gained his best stride too late. KEEN RESPONSE was reserved off the pace while two-wide on the turn, came
three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. ONE WAY HOME prompted the pace while racing three-wide and weakened. GEORGE'S VISION
raced in the middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch, steadied from between horses leaving the sixteenth pole in tight and finished willingly when
clear. HURTS SO BAD set the pace to the stretch racing slightly removed from the rail and tired. REMEMBER THE MAINE raced four-wide and failed to
threaten. BLURT was forwardly placed for six furlongs while three-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
BALADINE saved ground setting the pace under pressure from XPRESSIR, shook the one off nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. CLYDE'S
GREEN GO broke through the gate prior to the start, was quickly retained and reloaded then was reserved off the pace, came six-wide into the stretch and
finished fast. XPRESSIR brushed with EL MUCHO at the start then disputed the pace into the stretch from along the outside and held on well during the
drive for third. SILVER CHILLER was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. EL MUCHO broke in to brush with XPRESSIR
then was allowed to settle while two-wide, offered a mild bid entering the stretch and then flattened out. ANCIENT MAN saved ground while being unhurried
and gradually improved his position. TIZWOW was prominently placed while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. CHARLIE'S BEACH dropped
back early and failed to seriously threaten. SPANISH KISS gave way after showing brief early speed.
