Footnotes
GAMBLER stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied four wide turning for home and steadily advanced to prevail late in the drive. AMERICAN
NIGHTMARE wel rated to set a comfortable pace, responded when called upon at the head of the lane, dug-in through the drive and was caught in the final
yards. FRANCO reserved off the early pace, held up off heels leaving the first turn, angled inside, saved ground, made a theatening bid in upper stretch to
briefly take the lead and flattened out late. EXALTED JOY raced wide through the first turn, settled into a tracking position down the backstretch, and lacked
a response when called upon entering the final bend. LAUTREC went one-paced as a non-threat.

QUICKSTYLE raced up the fence to take the lead in the first turn, set a well controlled pace to upper stretch, dug-in when challenged, lugged out twice
down the lane, the second time drifted from the five path to the ten path bumping the runner-up nearing the wire and prevailed in the drive. BROADWAY
CHARM settled early to stalk the pacesetter to the far turn, gradually closed ground to engage the leader in mid-stretch, dueled to the final hundred yards
when bumped by the winner and kept on willingly. TEST YOUR FAITH chased the pace and steadily faded on the final bend. THE STEWARDS POSTED
AN INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF BROADWAY CHARM CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE

BIG BANG BLUE set a well moderated pace under slight pressure to the top of the lane, quickly spurted away to a clear lead and was never threatened in
the stretch. THEODOROPOULOS reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied six wide making a steady advance down the lane to be up for the place. FALL
CAMPAIGN prompted the early pace to the turn, lost position on the bend and kept grinding through the stretch to be best of the rest. CONTESSINA stalked
the pace to the turn, rallied on the bend to loom at the quarter-pole and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. CANTHO well placed throughout, made a four
wide bid on the turn and flattened out coming home. C C'S WORLD saved ground through the turn to be in striking distance turning for home and lacked a
closing rally.

BISCAYNE BAY tracked the leaders through the turn while saving ground along the rail, cut the corner to take command in mid-stretch and finished in a
drive to prevail. JETTIN PEGASUS settled off the pace down the backside, circled six wide to close steadily on the outside and be second best. LADY
ABRIL pressed the early pace, took command in the turn and flattened out in mid-stretch. OUT FOR FUN bumped at the start to drop back and trail the field
and passed weakened rivals down the lane. DANCIN' ROSIE bumped her outside rival leaving the gate, rushed up the rail to take the lead to the turn and
faded coming home. DIVA POWER chased the leaders from three wide on the turn to be prominent at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
KENNEDY'S CAMELOT reserved off the early pace, rallied on the far turn splitting rivals, saved ground turning for home and wore the leader down inside
the sixteenth pole. GHOST OF LONDYN prompted the pace from three wide down the backside, pressed on through the turn, took command in upper
stretch, drifted out down the lane and was caught late in the drive. RAISE YOU ONE slow early to trail the field, steadily made up ground on the bend and
finsihed best of the rest. MY HOMBRE set a pressured pace to midway on the far turn and weakened. MY TICKET raced near the rear of the field
throughout and passed tiring rivals in the lane. FORMYBOYS well placed to contend down the backside, rallied on the bend to be in striking position and
llattened out in the stretch. EQUITY CAT showed speed from between rivals for a half mile and came up empty tiring badly.

Footnotes
MOBIL CHIC stalked the pace throughout, made a steady advance, grinding down the lane and wore the pacesetter down in the final yards. BANK BUSTER
sped off to the lead into the first turn, set a well measured pace, held a clear advantage to upper stretch, dug-in gamely though the lane and tired in the final
strides to be caught. SCOOP THERE IT IS tracked the leaders down the backside to be well placed into the final turn and lacked a closing kcik finishing
evenly. IMA SURE BET went evenly and never posed a threat. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE raced in contention between rivals down the backstretch, was in close
quarters leaving the half mile pole, taken in hand to drop back into the turn, re-rallied on the bend and flattened out in the stretch.

MY SUZIE Q stalked the leader through the turn, rallied from seven wide at the head of the lane and closed well to be up in the final strides. GETAWAY
BAY sped to the lead from the gate, opened a clear advantage quickly while well in hand, responded when called upon turning for home but could not hold
off the winner when weakening in deep stretch. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK taken in hand early to angle to the outside down the backside, chased the
leaders to the turn and faded. OH ATLANTA was never a factor.

SHORTLY broke alertly to take control from the gate, set a well rated pace while well in hand, responded when called upon turning for home and held the
closers safe down the lane. ROCKY'S EXPRESS stalked the pacesetter from three wide through the final bend, rallied willingly in the lane to repel the show
finisher but could not gain on the winner. FINISTERE unhurried early, rallied five wide on the far turn to threaten in upper stretch and failed to sustain the
bid. WILEY T went evenly failing to menace. C C'S CLEAR CREEK showed early foot to be prominently placed for a half mile and faded. LANEHAYA trailed
as a non-factor.
