Footnotes
AMIGO'S AFFAIR broke alertly to take the lead away from the gate, set a well rated, well measured pace, repelled the challenge of the presser turning for
home and held the closers safe in a determined drive. ROCK ON KITTEN stalked the leaders from the fence through the turn saving ground, rallied up the
fence down the stretch and finished well in a good try. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO tracked the pace to midway on the bend, rallied four wide in the lane and
closed well to be gaining late. UNIDENTIFIED MAN pressed the pace throughout, made a bid nearing the quarter pole to threaten, could not go with the
winner and was outfinished by the closers down the lane while keeping on. SECRET LIFE STYLE trailed as a non-factor.

BUCKEYE RED took a clear lead on a well rated pace, widened turning for home when called upon and was never challenged in the stretch. GOOD MUSIC
reserved off the pace to track the leaders down the backside, rallied four wide to loom at the head of the lane and finished willingly to be second best while
no threat to the winner. OHIO STRONG stalked the leaders to the turn, made a five wide bid to upper stretch and failed to sustain the rally in the lane.
TAMMY'S TOY showed speed to prompt the early pace from the rail and faded in the turn as a non-threat.

LADY FORTUNE stalked the pacesetter to the turn, rallied three wide to take command midway on the bend and drew off as much best in the lane.
SCARLETT'S AWISH sped to the early lead opening a clear advantage to the three-eighths pole, chased the winner in the turn while no match and finihsed
willingly to hold the place. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE reserved off the pace to five-sixteenths pole, commenced a bid from there and made a steady advance to
the wire. COWCHI tracked the leaders from the fence and kept on evenly lacking a closing response. BOOGIE BOOGEE hustled early to gain position from
the gate, settled to be well placed down the backside, made a four wide bid on the turn and flattened out coming home. CATABOUT failed to menace. I
GOT HOPE trailed throughout as a non-factor.

UNEEDTOCOMEHOME stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide down the lane and wore the runner-up down in deep stretch to be pulling away
late. STARS N SPACE prompted the early pace, took command into the turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and could not hold off the winner in
a good effort. RED HOT POWER well placed tracking the leaders from the rail, saved ground on the bend, angled out in upper stretch and failed to gain
ground on the top pair. NOSEY POWER raced mid-pack throughout and lacked a closing kick. SMOOCHER unhurried early to be near the back of the field
and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. ANIMO ROBERTO failed to menace. NO MAS CERVEZA broke a step slow giving the field a couple lengths and
raced as no threat. THANKSDAD flashed brief speed to lead for three-eighths and steadily faded coming home.

MAKING ME CRAZY unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, circled five wide on the turn under a steady advance and closed well to be up in deep
stretch. GOLDEN SPOKE sped to the lead froom the outside, opened a clear lead in the turn, maintained the advantage to mid-stretch and could not last
late in the drive. KERANOS trailed to the turn and showed some late interest to pick up the show. TWO GUNS was in tight quarters leaving the gate to be
last away, rushed up from between rivals down the backside and flattened out. ANOTHER BREEZE prompted the early pace and faded. MALIBU CLASSIC
lacked a response when called upon and posed no threat.

IT'S OFFICIAL stalked the pace from four wide under stout restraint for the first half mile, moved with the runner-up to duel from the three-eighths pole
home, exchanged the lead several times through the turn and down the lane and prevailed in the final strides. RAVEN MOON tracked the pacesetters
through the first turn, was held up off heels leaving the first turn, made an early bid splitting rivals down the backside to take the lead, battled with the winner
through the turn to the wire and was out-finished nearing the wire in a game effort. SEND ME ON unhurried early to trail the field into the final bend and
showed some late interest in the lane. VISUAL MISSION reserved off the pace to the far turn and made a mild bid in the lane. MISTER MOBIL set the pace
for a half mile and weakened. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY showed early interest, gave way into the far turn and was eased to the wire and walked off.

GOING IN STYLE took command from the gate, opened a clear lead on the turn, weakened through the lane, dug-in late nearing the wire and just held.
THE EQUINEST unhurried in the early going to trail, circled six wide on the turn and closed best of all down the stretch to be up for the place and just miss
the win. RED GUN stalked the pacesetter into the turn, made an early bid to engage the leader turning for home and battled through the lane but could not
get passed. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL showed brief speed to prompt the pace and was through early.
