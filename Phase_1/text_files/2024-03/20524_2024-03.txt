Footnotes
MIGHTY LES stalked the pace, hard ridden two wide between near the three eighths pole, dug in late and just got up under strong handling. PRINCE
COLTON set a pressured early pace, dug in late and missed in a game effort. GOLDEN BUCK chased early on, dropped back a bit into the far turn, raced
from the inside into the upper stretch, shifted out three deep through the drive and finished gamely to the wire. NO MANCHES dropped to the rear early,
advanced into the turn, swung five to six wide in the lane but needed more in the drive. HEAVY HITTER was coaxed along early, raced three wide near the
three sixteenths pole and weakened. MOON CHARGER raced mid pack early, angled in down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn into the
lane and lacked a bid. COMMANDER'S COIN raced three to four wide in the lane and never menaced. KLIMTSTER was off slowly, saved ground and never
threatened.

strong handling. SUNDANCE FEATURE pressed the early leader two deep from the outside, dun in between rivals through the stretch and kept on gamely
to the wire. DEE MINUS showed good early foot to set the pace from the inside and gave way grudgingly to the top pair the final eighth of a mile.

bumped rival at the start, raced three to four wide and had not enough in the drive. ILLUSION raced three wide around the far turn, angled out in the drive
and raced even with no closing run. ELLIPTIC dropped back near the rear early, raced four to five deep around the far turn and had no late rally. DREAM

STORM CHARGING dropped back off the early going, advanced into the far turn, circled rivals six to seven wide and finished well to prove best under
strong handling. MISS FOXANN stalked the pace from the outside, made a good three to five wide bid and finished gamely to the wire. JURADICIAL broke
awkwardly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, made a strong rally through the far turn, raced in tight quarters near the three sixteenths pole,
was five deep between late and finished gamely to the wire in a troubled trip. FRACING NASTY set a pressured early pace and weakened a bit the final
eighth of a mile. LADY LIVERMORE void of early speed, swung widest into the stretch to race from the far outside and moved up to improve position.
GATITA SUAVE settled off the early going, raced three wide near the quarter pole and was even with no closing run. TABOO HOO pressed the early leader
two deep from the outside and faded. SPARE A DIME had a hard chased near the rail and faded in the drive. SASSY AND BOLD chased two to three wide
and was empty late.

Footnotes
ADIOS GARY tracked the pace on the inside under a snug hold in early stages, rode the rail around the turn, tipped two wide entering the head of the lane,
roused forward to challenge for the lead, dug in gamely deep stretch and prevailed under a drive. NASTY HABIT was not too far back on the inside in the
opening quarter, shifted out and made a move four wide late on the turn, vied for the lead in the stretch run and just missed. ZARTOWNIS prompted the
early pace, made a move two wide near the quarter pole, vied three deep a furlong from home then evened out in final stages. EGON dropped back after
the start and lagged briefly before picking up the pace and reaching the field, hustled along four to five wide heading into the lane and had a mild improve.
OLAZABAL sped to the lead soon after the start and continued to lead the way under pressure around the turn, battled for command past mid-stretch then
gave way. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON raced off the front runners in the early going, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.
DUNEDIN was not too far back in the opening quarter, raced in range 2wd around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. ALL JOKES ASIDE was
forwardly placed, raced in tight quarters between rivals near the quarter pole, continued in range upper stretch then steadily faded.
