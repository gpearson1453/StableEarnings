Footnotes
CHAOS REIGNS off step then brushed with STRICKLAND, moved up quickly to show the way into the first turn off the inside, rated in the run up the
backstretch, remained clear into the lane, held the runner up safe late under steady hand ride to win ridden out. SATURDAY STARTER settled off the pace
and the inside, stalked the winner three wide up the backstretch, crept a bid closer late in the final turn, stalled past the furlong marker then was coming
again late. STRICKLAND broke back, lacked speed while along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, staged a mild rally up the inside to gain
the show. MY BROTHER MIKE in mid pack outside, four wide into the far turn, crept closer along with the runner up outside that one turning for home,
flattened out, caught late for the show. BENZODINI chased the winner along the inside through the first turn and onto the backstretch inside and under a
snug hold, raced in the two path final turn when beginning to tire, continued to fade through the lane. NATIVE MOONSHINE void of speed while four wide
through the first turn, remained back while three wide second bend, outrun.

Footnotes
EVIE'S ENCORE outrun in the early going, advanced four wide second turn, took over into the stretch, drew clear under steady handling. PIVOSKY
forwardly placed off the inside, challenged between horses second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, narrowly persevered for the place.
SWEET SWEETFANTASY in mid pack while off the inside, rallied three wide into the lane, continued to advance, missed the place. MARCO SUNSET in
the second flight through the first turn while three wide, continued outside, three wide through the second turn, moved to briefly challenge into the lane,
chased the winner past the furlong marker and weakened to lose a couple of spots. ROYAL LAUGHTER last to leave, raced back, angled out four wide
turning for home, picked off some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. WHAT'S TO DO broke back, raced four wide through the second turn, went flat
through the lane. CROWN THIRTY chased early along the inside, began a steady fade before a half. HAYEK broke sharp, got clear early, set the pace
toward the inside, gave way when headed turning for home.

MOONLIT LADY away in good order, dueled up front through some quick early fractions, put the other speed away midway on the turn, clear into the lane,
extended that advantage past the furlong marker, then had enough left late to withstand the runner up. LOVELAND outrun early, moved out to be widest for
the drive, roused, finished willingly while too late, well clear for the place. WHAT'S HER NUMBER last away, well off the pace in mid pack inside, continued
to save ground turn, finished up best of the rest. PEWTER'S PROMISE chased the dueling leaders off the inside, three wide through the turn, closest to the
winner a furlong out then had little left late. BOLD APPEAL dueled up front while racing outside the winner, helped set those glib fractions for four furlongs,
first to blink. CHAR balked loading, veered out break, trailed well back.

Footnotes
DIVA TREVA broke out, bump, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, given a breather through the turn while remaining just off the inside,
shook well clear through the stretch while kept to pressure. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, made
a late run through traffic to earn the place. MISS DISTINCTIVE within striking distance just off the inside, in some traffic entering the turn, two path into the
lane, outkicked late for the place. WAR MUSIC last to leave, void of speed, moved outside, five to six wide exiting the turn, improved position down the
middle of the strip. MUSICMANSANDY chased the leader while racing three wide, weakened in the drive. LADY ASTRID in the second fight outside, four
wide into the turn, three wide exiting, gradually weakened through the lane. CHECKCASHINGCONNIE forwardly placed while racing toward the inside,
retreated through the stretch. NORTHERN DIAMOND bumped at the start, raced back and outside, four path through the turn, lacked a closing response.
AWESOME VIEW was finished early while racing toward the inside.

ALPINE THUNDER void of speed, raced five to six wide out of the turn when beginning to advance, rallied down the middle of the strip and closed well to be
up in time. MAC DADDY TOO bobbled at the start to be off a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight and in traffic into the turn, four wide exiting the
turn, challenged when straightened for home, showed the way past the furlong marker but could not contain the winner late, clear for the place. SHACKS
WAY lacked speed, five wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally behind the winner, finished clear of the others. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) back off the pace
toward the inside, moved out three wide late in the turn, displayed some mild interest to improve position late. HI YAH narrowly showed the way up the
inside, vied into and through upper stretch, gave way the final furlong while remaining inside. SHADY EMPIRE pressed early in the two path, vied between
foes through the turn, also faltered the final furlong. TABLE MONEY broke alertly, raced inside and forwardly, boxed in turn, backed up through the lane.
MONEY RUN prompted the issue up front three wide, vied outside turn, gave way from between horses and inside the runner up nearing the furlong
grounds.

Footnotes
ROMAN GIANT close from the start, pressed the issue from between foes, battled between horses into the stretch, long, spirited duel closest to the inside,
dug in late to narrowly prevail in a game effort. PRESSURE prompted the issue while on the outside, vied three wide into the lane, hooked up with the
winner in a long, spirited duel to the wire, outgutted late. SHUFFLE DANCE off a step slow, raced outside, four to five wide through the turn, mild rally to
finish up clear of the others. SUPER CONSTITUTION lacked speed, in the two path into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. CITY
OF CLOUDS in mid pack off the rail, shuffled back in some traffic into the bend, three wide out of the turn, went evenly through the lane. JUST BATTLE
back off the pace and the inside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing response. HUSKER BUTCH off a step slow, remained back, four to five wide
through the turn, remained back. COLORFUL NATIVE broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace for just over a half, gave way when headed by the
top two entering the stretch. DOG RED shuffled back early, trailed most of the way to be always back. FIRE BRYAN forwardly placed early toward the
inside, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
PIONEER PARADE broke alertly but outward, was straightened, clear early toward the inside, continued to set the pace in the two path turn, extended
advantage past the furlong marker, enough left late to gain the nod. POPPERINA last to leave, raced back, moved out three wide far turn, came in the two
path for the drive, dropped to the rail and rallied up the inside to finish willingly to miss the nod. NEVER SWAY bothered at the start, moved up to prompt the
winner three wide into the lane between calls, saw that progress stall past the furlong marker, closed gap on that same rival late while caught for the place.
DE' ANS EIGHTY bothered at the break, recovered to race in the second flight three wide, went evenly through the lane in lacking a winning kick. LITTLE
SISTER SUE bothered at the start, lacked speed inside, traffic late in the bend, came in the two path and improved slightly. LADY COMMANDER in mid
pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing rally. BERTIE'S CAUSE broke out, bothered rival, raced back, three to four wide turn,
remained back. STAY FABULOUS forwardly placed toward the inside early, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
NATORADE settled in mid pack, steered out three wide into the lane, shifted out widest, rallied midtrack to be up in time. HAYAHLOOKATME within striking
distance on the outside up the backstretch, four to three wide turn, roused, rallied with the winner while inside that one, missed between rivals. CLASSIC
CINEMA broke very sharp to quickly clear, set a lively set of fractions, remained clear past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going while closest to th
inside of the first flight at the wire. STRING THEORY was squeezed at the break to be off slowly, raced back, waited briefly in some traffic early turn, moved
inside, back out three wide into the lane, improved with some mild interest. PREACHER'S KID chased the leader in the two path for a half, came up empty
through the stretch. AMAZING SUCCESS forwardly placed along the inside for a half, also weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane.
SAFETY broke in to bother a couple of inner rivals, was straightened to track the pace three wide, had little left for the drive as well. CLEAR ECHO dropped
inside midway on the turn, lacked a response in the drive. GETTY'S REVENGE made little impact while three wide. YEAGERS STRATEGY sandwiched at
the start, off slowly, trailed most of the way. BET ON TIZ was finished early along the inside.
