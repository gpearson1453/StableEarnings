IRON LOTUS pressed Hey Roxy from the outside two deep near the three eighth pole, had command mid way on the far turn and held gamely to prove best
under strong handling. SARA'S SAPPHIRE stalked the pace, was five to six wide into the upper stretch and closed in gamely in the final stages. HEY ROXY
set a pressured early pace along the inside, dug in through the stretch drive and kept on willingly to the wire. COZZOLANI dropped back to race mid pack,
raced two to three wide in the drive and had no final winning bid. FACESTER swung wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit through the drive.
ACERTIVE MISS dropped back early, was six wide near the three sixteenth pole and lacked a bid. BEBOP BABY settled off the early going, raced three
wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. The five eighths internal fractional time was unavailable.

RACE DAY REBAL showed good early speed and drew off to be well clear in the drive under all out pressure. EMERGENCY RESPONSE rated three wide
down the backstretch, angled out through the stretch drive to race well off the inside but was no match for the winner. CHEROKEE LEGACY rated along the
inside, ridden near the three eighths pole and weakened a bit through the drive. GOSPEL BUZZ stalked the pace, was near the rail past the quarter pole,
angled out and had no late rally. DISCOVERY PEAK void of early speed, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. TRUE DOMINUS

GOSPEL SPEAR dropped back off the early pace setters, moved up three wide between near the quarter pole and finished well in the lane to edge away
racing two deep under strong handling. AUNT KENDRA stalked the pace, swung wide to race well off the inside in the lane and finished gamely to the wire.
OKIE HOPE settled off the early pace, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and made a late gain while racing from the outside. MIA IS SHORT set a
pressured early pace two deep and weakened through the drive. YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN trailed early on, swung wide to race from the far outside and
never threatened. LITTLE MO BROWN pressed the pace from the inside and weakened. O S U BUDKE stalked the pace, lost his whip nearing the three
sixteenths pole and faded along the inside.

Footnotes
RAHM was off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, advanced through the far turn, circled the field six wide and drove clear late. AWESOME
OUTLAW stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and kept on gamely to the wire. DISCO DANZING
chased the pace from the inside and finished willingly to the wire. EL CHIHUAS dueled near the rail and weakened through the drive. BLAKE FROM TISH
settled off the early pace, had an inside run and not enough in the drive. IRA CHAMP raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no response.
MISTER TYRO dueled two deep from the outside of foe and faded. FATHER PATRICK was slow early and never threatened.

in the lane and showed good late interest. LIQUOR CAT showed good early foot along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. PRINCESS BALL
hard chase early, raced four wide around the far turn and weakened. SULPHUR SUE stalked the pace from the outside, was seven deep into the upper
stretch
