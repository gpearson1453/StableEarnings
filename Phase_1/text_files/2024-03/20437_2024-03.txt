Footnotes
MACKMAN pressed the issue up front off the inside, moved to challenge second turn, dueled into the lane, drew away steadily through the lane under right
the the left handed pressure. CROSSING showed the way along the inside, firmly rated onto the backstretch, continued to set the pace into the far turn,
responded when the winner came alongside soon after, dueled into the lane, could not match strides with the winner in the run to the wire, clearly second
best. RELAMPAGO VERDE void of early foot in trailing off the inside, two path second turn, dropped to the inside for the drive and rallied up the rail for the
show, not a threat to the top pair. ROCKET NIGHT off a step slow, raced back for three quarters inside, improved position through the stretch without posing
a serious threat. FIRST OF HIS NAME forwardly placed while racing three wide and between horses, began to weaken midway on the final turn. BRIO
covered up while inside of horses through the first turn, remained in the pocket up the backstretch and into the far turn, came up empty when clear late in
the second bend. MOUNT CRAIG prompted the issue up front while four wide through the first turn,continued outside, four wide again into the far turn,
stopped in the drive, crossed the wire wrapped up.

Footnotes
SPEITFUL SAM broke back, moved up to head up the second flight inside, steered out three wide turning for home, engaged the leader past the furlong
marker, proved best under firm handling. FORSAKEN away in good order, pressed early outside, bid, dueled through the turn, disposed of that rival entering
the stretch to be clear between calls, responded when the winner came calling past the furlong marker and proved stubborn to the end. COMMUNICATION
MEMO back off the pace while along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, getting to the top two late while continuing up the rail. ASPEN
CLUB last to leave, trailed early outside, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally while remaining well out in the strip. MISTER SHARPIE stumbled at the
start, quickly recover to race in mid pack off the inside, came four wide for the drive, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. REUP
broke on top, dueled up front along the inside, alternated through the turn, gave way into the lane. EASY BIG BOY within striking distance off the inside, had
little for the drive. WARHORSE WEST lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a rally. ROSIE'S BOY away in good order, began a steady
fade before a quarter, finished early.

Footnotes
PLEASINGLY broke alertly, pressed the issue off the inside, took over midway on the turn while still in hand, kicked clear under mostly her own courage
through the lane to win ridden out. DANCE MY WAY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch inside, steered out to be three wide turning for home,
could do little with the winner through the stretch, remained clear for the place,. SKY RAVEN away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch along
the inside, yielded to the winner the last half of the turn, could not contain the runner up late, saved the show. TEXAS SEQUOIA raced in mid pack while
outside, raced three wide through the turn, slowly gaining for the show late while not a serious threat. READY FOR WINE squeezed at the break to be away
slowly, saved ground throughout in an even effort. ART QUEEN in a bit tight at the start, raced back and off the inside, made little impact through the
stretch. GRACEFUL MOON remained back throughout in failing to threaten. FIRST CLASS GIRL staged a steady fade while racing in the two path. SUGAR
COATED in tight, off slowly trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HUGE BIGLY closest to the leader in the two path, continued to pressure that one in the run up the backstretch, bid second turn, put a head in front entering
the stretch, continued to narrowly show the way past the furlong marker, edged away late while drifting in a bit. CAMP DAVID broke on top, showed the way
into and through the first turn inside, continued to set the pace under loose restraint, responded when the winner challenged in the second turn, gave ground
grudgingly to that one through the stretch. SAQEEL in the second flight along the inside, continued to race within striking distance while saving ground, had
little for the top two through the lane, lasted for the show. UNINVITED GUEST in mid pack and traffic into the first turn, steadied, continued to race in close
quarters through the rest of the first bend, traffic again into the far turn, checked up, dropped inside, slowly gaining for the show late. CATDADDY off a step
slow, trailed inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals through the stretch while never a threat. ROMAN CENTURIAN in the second flight while four wide
through the first turn, remained outside, four wide again through the second bend, tired through the stretch. RUNWAY MAGIC in the second group while
racing three wide, steadily faded.

Footnotes
KONTEEKEE close from the start, advanced on the leader in the two path turn, showed the way into the lane, shook clear and maintained daylight to the
wire under a firm, steady hand ride. SIR OTTO forwardly placed in the second flight in the two path, moved closer on the winner just inside the furlong
marker, drifted in a bit then could not muster much late gain. ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT came out early to bother QUEBRANCHO, was then floated out into
PATRIOT HILLS and bump, raced in midpack into the turn, three wide into the lane, displayed some mild late interest. THANKS FRANK came out early,
second flight three wide, came four wide for the drive, lacked a closing kick. QUEBRANCHO bothered early, fell back, dropped inside turn, traffic late in that
bend, improved position through the lane when clear. SUPERHERO lacked speed while racing outside, four wide turning for home, had little for the stretch
run. THIS TIME BLUE lacked speed while racing three wide, lacked a closing response. CISCO KID broke on top, set the early pace along the inside,
weakened when headed by the winner midway on the turn. PATRIOT HILLS bumped and bothered early, steadied, raced in midpack and failed to threaten.
MIRAGE off a step slow, trailed.

Footnotes
HUSH IT HONEY broke back, moved up to show the way up the backstretch, firmly rated into the turn, let out a notch midway on the bend, got out a bit
turning for home, drew off under token encouragement to win ridden out. SPIN THE BREEZE last away, moved up inside to a forward position behind and
to the inside of the winner, brief rail bid midway on the turn, proved no match in the drive, proved game for the runner up spot. JUST AN OPINION prompted
the pace while three wide, remained within striking distance out of the turn behind the winner, long drive for the place, outkicked. READY FOR TROUBLE
within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. JANUARY JUBILEE fell back soon after the start, never
menaced. HITTIN MY STRIDE shortened stride soon after the start, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
PUNCHY GIRL in the second broke in, bumped PATTERN BET, was straightened to settled in the second flight while three wide, outside bid inside furlong
marker, proved best under firm handling. MUSIC MISTRESS veered out break, was quickly straightened to race within striking distance inside, rail bid
turning for home, could not match the winner late, proved determined for the place. HEATED ARGUMENT prompted the issue while racing four wide, bid,
took over turning for home, outkicked by the top two in the late going while between that pair at the end. UNBRIDLED TWISTER lacked speed, four wide
into the stretch, staged a mild rally. RUN FEARLESS pressed the issue for a half between horses and then weakened in the drive. CHAI TEA broke back,
continued to lack speed off the rail, never threatened. PATTERN BET bumped, off slowly, also remained always back. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER took
command soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, allowed the runner up the inside as he was headed turning for home then gave way.

Footnotes
CATTY CRUISE in the second flight early along the inside, roused, rail bid late, up in the final strides. RED VOLTA moved up to show the way after the start
along the inside, continued to show the way into and through much of the stretch, allowed the winner the inside late, outkicked in the waning strides. TIZ A
STRATEGY lacked speed toward the inside, dropped inside for the drive, late rally up the rail to annex the show. WILD CHEROKEE chased the leader
outside, continued to track that one into the stretch, remained closest to the that same rival past the furlong marker, came up empty in the run to the wire.
MISS TERRE in mid pack while racing off the inside, came three wide for the drive, improved position slightly. SAFECRACKER SUE in the second flight
while racing outside, three wide through the turn, found lacking through the stretch. LIL' BIT OF CHROME void of speed off the rail, three to four wide into
the stretch, bettered position a bit while not a serious threat. RAETASTIC in the second flight while racing in the two path, tired through the stretch. BODI
ODI mid pack and outside, four wide through the turn, had little for the drive. JONESBOROHURRICANE void of speed, four to five wide out of the turn,
failed to muster a closing kick. FIRST DIAMOND in mid pack early, staged a steady retreat. BEE BRANCH off slow after breaking in the air, trailed
throughout to be always outrun.
