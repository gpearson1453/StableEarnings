Footnotes
RB MARY LYLAH was forwardly placed along the inside in the early furlongs, then continued to track the leader down the backstretch under a steady drive,
inched up to grab command heading into the far turn, maintained the lead while drifting out slightly in the early stretch and was kept to task to always prove
best in the end. RB MALEXIS saved ground in the first t half of the course then advanced on the fart turn to gain second position in the early stretch and
was gaining in the home stretch but it was not enough in the end. SCORCHED tracked the pace while two wide heading into the backstretch, then bid on
the far turn to rally in the early stretch, lacked the winning bid and was best for the show prize. LIKE MOULIN ROUGE raced in the middle of the pack while
two wide at an evenly pace throughout the early furlongs and needed more in the final furlongs. RB BILLIONS was unhurried early, then was allowed to
settle while two wide down the backstretch, rallied on the far turn and into the home stretch and came up empty. BASEQ AND BAKE led the way into the
first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive before being met with incoming rivals on the far turn and gave way heading into the stretch. WMA
COUNTRY STAR chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, was in a steady drive down the backstretch then faded on the far turn.

LEA ME BE broke inwardly at the start and bumped rival, then remained well rated down the backstretch along the rail, dug in gamely leaving the bend and
surged down the lane to be up at the wire. BOUGIE JOE prompted the pace from the inside, took command in late backstretch, then vied to keep the lead
with outer rivals leaving the turn, held on gamely in the early stretch before being out finished in the late stretch. SOLDIERS SACRIFICE was bumped at the

Footnotes
ALL OF US pressed the pace into the turn while two wide, settled back momentarily before rallying in the early stretch and drew clear in the final furlong to
prevail in the end. MESSAGE DISCIPLINE was rated while four wide down the backstretch, reserved ground while racing at the back of the pack on the
turn, then found more in the early stretch to close willingly while surpassing rivals. MIDNIGHT MONEY chased the pace while two wide under steady drive in
the early furlongs, then rallied in the stretch and needed more in the end. JERSEY JIM led the way from the inside, continued to maintain the lead on the
turn while coming out five wide then faltered in the late stretch. VALDINA DREAMS settled in the two path at the back of the pack, then advanced on the
turn to menace in the early stretch before giving way in the end. LOVE SPELL was fractious in the gate, then was unhurried early, raced a moderate pace at
the back and needed menace in the end. BRAVE MAGIC chased the pace from the three path early, then bid mildly on the turn before flattening in the
stretch. CLIPPER COVE pressed the pace into the turn while three wide and in a hard drive, was used up and weakened in the stretch.

LUNA MOTH was under a steady drive while racing in the four path and towards the back of the field, then urged eagerly on the turn, came out five wide
and dug in to spar with an inner rival in the final sixteenth and was up at the wire. MIZ CALI saved ground early in the middle of the pack, then bid gamely in
the upper stretch, took command at the eighth marker, was challenged by an outer rival in the final yards and just missed in the end. GO BETTY JO led the
way from the inside under a strong drive into the turn, then gave way in the early stretch and held onto the show prize. DIAMONDS N ACES pressed the
pace while three wide, then menaced on the turn before flattening out in late stretch. CARRY ON was bumped at the start, then trailed behind the field then
made a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty. HOLLY DOLLY pressed the pace under a hard drive and while two wide, was used up after the turn
and tired in the lane. DIXIE CARROUSEL bid from the inside early, then stopped and was no menace.

TEXAS HOLDEM tracked the pace in the middle of the field while three wide, then urged steadily on the turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch and edged
clear in the final yards to prove best in the end. RECKLESS RED was off well, then stalked the pace from the two path, moved up to meet with the pace
setter, sparred briefly then gain command at heading into the stretch then was surpassed in the end from the outside and was second best. FORT HOOD
moved up to lead the pack from the inside into the turn, then dueled with an outer rival leaving the bend, couldn't retain bid and gave way while holding onto
the show prize. AMERICAN FOREST reserved ground early, then rallied gamely leaving the bend and was closing well in the late stretch. LUCKY
PROMISE chased the pace while two wide, bid on the turn and came up flat in the stretch. GRAMI'S BOY chased the pace from the inside, then settled
back on the turn, re bid in the early stretch while four wide and came up evenly. SWEET TAPIN MORO was unhurried early then bid too little to late in the
stretch. TEXAN FARMER chased the pace while four wide, was in a hard drive on the turn, was used up and weakened in the late stretch.

Footnotes
ZAVALA contended with an inner rival down the backstretch and into the turn, was met with incoming rivals on both sides in the early stretch, found more
and kicked clear to succeed under a strong drive. JOSH'S DREAM raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, then rallied leaving the bend, gained
second position, kept on gmely but could not catch the leader in the end. CARBON STRYKER tracked the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, bid
leaving the turn and needed more in the end. BLING MOUNTAIN reserved ground in the early furlongs then rallied leaving the bend while two wide and was
closing willingly down the lane. GUITAR BOY chased the pace while three wide, then made a mild bid leaving the bend and came up empty in the end.
SUNDAY BLING dueled with an outer rival in the early furlongs, was in a long drive heading into the stretch then was out kicked in the stretch. MY BOY
BLING chased the pace while two wide, then continued to bid gamely on the turn before giving way in the stretch. CANATLAN was unhurried early, then
raced down the backstretch, passed a few rivals then lacked rallying in the stretch. RED SUMMERBIRD failed to rally.

Footnotes
PHANTOM RIDE tracked the pace from the inside down in the early furlongs, remained in a steady drive throughout the far turn, then dug in in the early
stretch to duel with an outer rival and was just up to prevail. BRUCELEA broke inwardly then stalked the pace from the inside, moved up on the far turn to
lead briefly, then was confronted with an inner rival to duke it out in the late stretch and hung in the end. WHISKEY NOT WINE was impeded at the start,
then settled along the inside towards the back of the pack, moved up on the far turn and closed well for the show prize in the end. EYE DEE KAY was
pinched pack at the start, then raced behind the pack in the early furlongs, rallied from the inside heading into the home stretch and closed willingly. TEJAS
tracked the pace at a moderate pace while four wide down the backstretch, came out seven wide leaving the far bend and was closing well in the end.
RUDDY BUDDY tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then flattened out on the far turn and needed rally in the stretch. WIN WORTHY
was allowed to settled while two wide, the bid on the far turn but did not fire in the stretch. GOLD MONEY broke outwardly then led the way into the first turn
to set the pace down the backstretch, cleared the far turn, lost momentum and tired in the home stretch. RUSSIAN TANK stalked the pace while three wide
and at a moderate pace, then bid strongly on the far turn was used up and weakened in the home stretch.
