BIG EFFECT prompted the pace in the three path, took command in the two path midway around the turn, kicked away under coaxing in upper stretch, and
held sway. SECRET CHAT had a slow start, chased in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, swung from the five path into the
stretch, and ran on for place. SOUND OF THE BEAST stalked inside, came under a ride going into the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane,
and kept on for show. LASSO raced off the pace in the six path and never threatened from the nine path in the stretch. ALWAYS A WAY trailed out in the
eight path, tipped into the five path rounding the turn, but never menaced. FOR SOME REASON showed the way in the two path but yielded along the

BLUE SLIDE PARK was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up and clear late. BREEZE THE
BAYOU set the pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. CAJUN FOOL stalked the pace inside and was one-paced through the lane to maintain the
show. KINSMAN REDEEMER chased the pace two wide and faded in the stretch. BLUE SKY'S SYL saved ground off the pace, angled four wide turning for
home, continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened. JOEL'S BOY was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
STAR OF SATURN bobbled at the start, was prompted along while in range from the two path, had to wait rounding the turn, tipped out to the four path at
the top of the lane, and kicked on between foes to get up around the sixteenth. SING A LITTLE SONG raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden into
the turn, took aim in the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. CARESS laid up close in the three path, bid midway around the turn, floated
out to the five path at the top of the lane, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but evened out between foes for show. MISS JUSTIFY tracked inside,
tipped out to the five path under coaxing midway around the turn, fanned out to the nine path entering the stretch, but made no impact. KHOZALL got sent
to set the pace inside, was roused early into the turn, but yielded in the final furlong. RUNAWAY DIVA rated in the four path but failed to menace.
MYSTIFYING chased in the five path, was driven four wide around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. ABOVE THE SUN was off slow and trailed
throughout around the two path.

NO WASABI FOR ME trailed in the three path, was cued midway around the far turn, took aim in the five path at the top of the lane, and drew past an inner
trio in the final furlong. CUMBERLAND FALLS stalked in the four path, bid midway around the far turn, ran on from the four path into the stretch, briefly led
around the sixteenth, but was overtaken by an outer foe late to place. FAST KIMMIE bumped with an outer foe at the start, showed the way in the two path
turning into the backstretch, gave up the lead to an outer foe willingly passing the half, was roused to retake the lead early around the far turn, stayed on
from the two path in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer pair late to show. KILKENNY BELLA bumped with foes on both sides at the start, rated in the
two path, was ridden from the rail into the far turn, but got in tight around the eighth pole, and flattened. STARSHIP LEGEND bumped with an inner foe at
the start, got keen going into the first turn and pulled while pressing the pace in three path entering the backstretch, stuck her head in front passing the half,
but backed up between foes around the far turn.

Footnotes
PHILEAS FOGG set a rated pace in the two path and widened under a drive. MERLIN chased the winner two and three wide and kept on to be clearly
second best. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) went evenly inside. KURAMATA (IRE) was off a bit slowly, raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the
left lead in the lane and passed tiring rivals while lugging in a bit. SAFE CONDUCT saved ground and failed to menace. HOT BLOODED played no factor
while racing two wide. OCALA DREAM was outrun while racing two and three wide. YACOWLEF (IRE) stalked the winner in the three path in the clear and
weakened in the drive. UNO TIGER was outrun inside. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND made little impact while racing three wide.

Footnotes
COTTON tracked in the four path, was nudged along in the three path around the turn, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, and inched past the inner
pacesetter late. COMEDY TOWN set the pace in the three path, tipped to the two path going into the turn, was cued turning into the stretch, dug in passing
the eighth pole, but was edged out in the final sixteenth to place. VOLKERT bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the two path, was
cued along the inside early around the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and chased on for show. ZYRAMID stalked inside, was coaxed
nearing the quarter, tipped out to the seven path entering the stretch, but flattened on his left lead. NIGHT JUMPER rated in the four path, was cued midway
around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but never threatened on his left lead. DOC AMSTER bumped with an inner foe at the
start, raced off the pace in the three path, got put to a ride in the four path midway around the turn, but failed to bid. THE CONNECTOR bumped with an
outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path and never menaced. UNDALAY bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two path but was empty
entering the stretch.
