Footnotes
THINKITASADONATION tracked the early leader two deep and finished well to draw clear under steady pressure. PALM COURT stalked the pace, made a
four wide bid in the lane and finished second best. REINA DEL SUR was allowed to settle early, moved up three to four wide and improved position. T R'S
FIRST was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and was gaining ground late. SHACKED STATESIDE sprinted clear from the outside and was empty in
the drive. DOLLY DIMPLE raced mid pack early, was near the rail around the far turn and never was a factor. BREW CASA chased the pace from the inside
and weakened. STREAKIN' EASY failed to respond. SECRET MISTRESS saved ground and never threatened.
