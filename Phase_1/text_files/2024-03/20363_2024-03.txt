Footnotes
LILLY'S JOURNEY crowded at the start and away a bit slowly, settled while never far back in the early running, went two wide into the turn and gained
ground at the quarter marker, roused three wide into the stretch and loomed at the furlong grounds, took command past mid-stretch, kept to task into the
final sixteenth and drew away in deep stretch as much the best. DIVINE PASSAGE lacked early speed, trailed into the turn and saved ground to the quarter
marker, tipped two wide into upper stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and outfinished the rest to
secure place honors. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT tracked the solid early pace from inside of an outer rival, chased three wide into the turn and well placed at
the quarter marker, encountered a bit of traffic while between runners nearing the top of the stretch, lost position approaching the furlong pole, needed more
into the final sixteenth and outfinished for second. JIM'S JET tracked the solid early pace from the outside, ran in pursuit four wide nearing the quarter pole,
ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. ARRIVAL IN STYLE broke alertly, assumed early command and sped to a clear lead heading to
the half-mile marker, dictated terms while carving fast fractions to the quarter pole, came under pressure into the stretch, could not hold off the winner inside
of the furlong grounds and gave way in the final sixteenth. FLY SOUTH a step slow away from the start, chased the solid pace from the inside, saved
ground into the stretch and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
AFTER MY OWN HEART broke a bit awkwardly and away a step slowly, was unhurried into the first turn and maintained a three wide path into the
backstretch, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, was roused four wide into the far turn and loomed into upper stretch, confronted VIOLET
THUNDER into upper stretch, battled with that stubborn rival into the final sixteenth, repelled the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to
prove best. VIOLET THUNDER forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the moderate pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run, advanced
nearing the half-mile pole and stalked the pace into the second turn, pressed three wide nearing the quarter pole then gained command into upper stretch,
met the bid of AFTER MY OWN HEART nearing mid-stretch and battled that rival into the final sixteenth, was bested by the winner in deep stretch and held
safely in the end for second. SILVER FLIRT settled while never far back in the early going, well placed through the backstretch run, saved ground into the
far turn and maintained an inside path into the stretch, outkicked at the furlong grounds, finished evenly into the final sixteenth and well clear in the end for
third. LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, content to trail to the half-mile pole, saved ground
into the far turn, swung to the four path into upper stretch, could not muster the needed response in the lane and passed tired rivals in the final sixteenth.
BREVILLE broke alertly, showed early speed and assumed command leaving the start, drew to a clear lead into the first turn and set a moderate pace into
the backstretch run, set all of the pace into the second turn, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and overtaken into upper stretch, chased the
leaders to the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. APRICOT BRANDY broke out at the start and off a step slowly, recovered to track the early
pace three wide along the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into
upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
WIRLY GIRLY forwardly placed leaving the start, took back off of the moderate early pace and tracked from the inside heading into the turn, saved ground
along the bend then waited for racing room at the quarter pole, found a seam three wide and between runners into upper stretch, split rivals and took a
narrow lead at the furlong grounds, was kept to task under firm urging into the final sixteenth, dug in in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final stages to
prevail. TAMARANDO COAST prominent away from the start, vied for the early lead then ceded the front to VALERIE heading to the half-mile pole, shifted
to the outside and stalked the pace two to three wide into the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker and vied between runners into upper
stretch, battled three wide at the furlong grounds then chased WIRLY GIRLY into the final sixteenth, was kept at bay by the winner in deep stretch and was
second best. SMILE AND PROFILE bobbled leaving the start and raced a bit in tight in the early going, tracked the moderate pace from the outside, gained
ground while widest approaching the quarter marker, maintained an outside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, weakened in the final
sixteenth and outfinished VALERIE to secure show honors. VALERIE asked for early speed leaving the start, assumed command and set the pace into the
turn, carved out moderate fractions while a bit off of the rail nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure into upper stretch and lost the lead at the
furlong pole, gave way into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. PARTY TIME GAL broke out at the start and off a bit slowly, chased the
moderate early pace from the rear, ran in pursuit two to three wide along the turn and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
DANZING REBEL broke sharply but veered inward at the break, opted not to join the developing speed duel and tracked close up three wide, patiently
withstood a couple of bumps near the half-mile marker from a keyed-up MR. BIG HEART, then launched a bid from the three furlong pole, pulled even with
suddenly lone leader EN TU HONOR BRO near the quarter pole, took command under intermittent urging passing the furlong marker and won clear.
COOLWIND shied from DANZING REBEL after the break when that one came over, was outrun in the early going and dropped far behind the field, found a
good rhythm and made a three to four wide bid through the turn, then swung seven wide into the stretch and continued to rally strongly down the middle of
the track to be along for second, drifting in a bit in the final yards. EN TU HONOR BRO was off a bit slowly then rushed up and dueled with HALLISAR
through the early stages, got the best that foe near the five-sixteenths pole then was taken on to the outside by DANZING REBEL, battled on to mid-stretch
but could not match strides in the final furlong and weakened. MR. BIG HEART broke awkwardly, then took up when HALLISAR took the path after the
break, spotted the field a head start, then became keen and hard to place pulling the rider up to the leaders, bumped DANZING REBEL twice after passing
the half-mile pole, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, looked to angle towards the rail at the top of the stretch then switched to the outside, did not
respond to strong handling and finished evenly. CRYSTAL COWBOY tracked four wide for the first quarter mile then dropped over to the rail near the
seven-sixteenths, came under pressure passing the five-sixteenths pole, did not respond and finished one-paced, passing only the rapidly fading HALISAR
in the late stages. HALLISAR broke in at the break but went quickly to the front, dueled inside of EN TU HONOR BRO to the turn, weakened approaching
the five-sixteenths pole then had nothing left for the stretch run.

CHAMAVILLE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to BRONZE GIRL and stalked that rival through moderate fractions heading into the turn, went up and
pressed BRONZE GIRL approaching the quarter marker and battled with that foe into the stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker and fought gamely
into the final sixteenth, found more in deep stretch, took command in the late stages and kept to task to the wire for a determined win. HOT AND SPICY
took back off of the moderate early pace, saved ground into the turn then waited behind runners nearing the quarter marker, circled the field and mounted a
five wide rally into upper stretch, loomed into the stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, battled while widest into the final sixteenth, outkicked
by the winner in deep stretch and held well in the final strides for second. BETTOR BET'R stalked the moderate early pace from the inside, well positioned
into the turn then became boxed in at the quarter pole, angled three wide into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, battled between runners
into the final sixteenth, outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and well clear in the end for third. BRONZE GIRL hustled away from the start, a bit green
in the early running and attempted to duck in at the gap, assumed command and set a moderate pace into the turn, pressed to the quarter marker by
CHAMAVILLE and battled with that rival into upper stretch, vied along the rail at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave
way. ANN stalked the moderate early pace from an outside position, gained ground into the turn and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker,
swung four wide for the drive then came in a bit tight and checked in upper stretch, lost position heading to the furlong pole and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
MAJOR TOM forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the solid early pace three wide into the turn, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter pole,
made a sustained bid three wide into the stretch, drew to even terms with TOWN PERFORMER inside of the furlong marker and dueled with that rival into
the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and determinedly held for the win in the final strides. TOWN PERFORMER prominent away from the
start, ceded the early lead to PETER FLIES and stalked that rival through solid fractions heading into the turn, roused nearing the quarter marker,
confronted PETER FLIES two wide and between runners into the stretch, assumed a narrow lead approaching the furlong pole, met the bid of MAJOR TOM
past mid-stretch and dueled that rival into the final sixteenth, gamely bested in the final strides and clear of the rest for second. NORTH COUNTRY hopped
at the start and away slowly, settled off of the solid early pace while never far back, roused four wide nearing the quarter marker and rallied while widest into
the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth while on the left lead, outkicked in deep stretch and held clear in the end for third. PETER FLIES assumed
command away from the start, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the half-mile pole, set a solid pace into the turn, confronted and overtaken
into upper stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong marker and faded in the final sixteenth. TOUCH OF ZEN threw his head at the start and away a step
slowly, void of early speed and climbed while trailing to the half-mile pole, outrun into the turn and did not factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CODE RIBBON unhurried early, settled well behind the field down the backstretch under a snug hold, saved ground while launching a rally through the turn,
found a nice seam at the top of the stretch, angled four wide then ran on well under steady handling and intermittent urging get up in time. TIGER QUEEN
broke well and pressed HEART ON THE RUN on the inside the first quarter mile then backed off the pace, moved out a path into a stalking position through
the turn, went to re-engage near the five-sixteenths pole, battled to mid-stretch and got the best of that rival at that point, drew away under strong handling
and intermittent urging but was unable to fend off the winner. MO TOWN GAL was crowded after the start when MAJESTIC GIG came over, lost some
momentum then recovered and then made steady forward progress down the backstretch, was just behind the leaders passing the three furlong marker
then had to wait for room behind horses until the turn for home, found a seam in mid-stretch and finished well under strong handling but came up a bit short.
HEART ON THE RUN broke best and hustled to the front, set a pressured pace while being dogged by TIGER QUEEN early on then opened up a clear
lead passing the half-mile pole, battled back when that foe re-bid near the quarter pole, held gamely to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong.
MAJESTIC GIG broke well and was pushed to vie for the early lead from the inside, dropped back off the pace at the seven-sixteenths marker and altered
course to the two path, went into a drive from the three furlong pole, loomed a threat and bid three wide into the stretch but was outkicked in the final
furlong. GRAZEN DEB broke alertly but had no interest in contesting the early pace, raced mid-pack to the turn, maintained position through the turn, did not
quicken and finished one-paced to the wire. OAT MILK LATTE lacked speed and trailed well behind the field on the run down the backstretch, continued to
trail through the turn, did not respond when asked to go on and raced behind the field throughout.
