Footnotes
FROSTY MAYA , fractious during the post parade, bore out leaving the starting gate disputed the pace three deep, asserted herself the final furlong and
drew clear under brisk urging. CONFLUENCE LASSIE showed speed between horses down the backstretch, dueled inside the winner and weakened.
REZOOM , sent along the inner rail to engage the top two down the backstretch, weakened on the turn and angled out entering the stretch. THREE'S A
CROWD , never a factor, raced inside horses. TROUBLED DREAMS bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the duel off the rail, moved to the inner rail
entering the stretch and gave way. MARTHA'S HEART , three wide around the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
VIKING QUEEN , four wide into the first turn, tracked under nice rating while three wide past the five eighths, went on the attack and overtook the leader
from his outside leaving the far turn, dropped in a bit when going clear, turned away a challenge near mid stretch then kicked back away under a drive.
HAPPY UNION settled off the early pace, eased out for the backstretch, steadily advanced three wide into the far turn then took aim on the winner, was kept
at bay leaving mid stretch but stayed on with interest to hold down the place. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , well placed saving ground, edged up to take
closer order into the far turn, was under pressure pursuing the top pair into the stretch but came up empty through the final furlong. DREAM OF
BLESSINGS lagged off the pace, circled five wide with a mild gain nearing the stretch but failed to follow through. MIRACLE SILVER saved ground, moved
up some past the five sixteenths, chased then faded. TINY TIN , well back to upper stretch, angled out and had a mild response. BERMONDSEY was
nudged clear early, set the pace two wide, was joined from his outside near the half mile marker, gave a little bit of fight into the far turn, could not kick on
with the winner past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
EL DE LARRY , bumped at the start, rated forwardly between foes early on, edged up into the turn and engaged the leader from his outside, prompted the
pace under coaxing past the three eighths, wrested command when set down in upper stretch, drifted in while clearing past the three sixteenths then
widened under a drive. SILVERBULLETTWENTY came in a bit at the break and bumped OMAR COMIN, corrected and cleared then dropped in to set the
pace, was joined by the winner leaving the far turn, handled outside pressure to the five sixteenths, dueled briefly in upper stretch, shifted out after the
winner cleared and drifted in then stayed on willingly to be well clear of the rest. GET LIKE MIKE , four wide outside runners, dropped in a bit and bid three
deep leaving the half mile marker, forced the issue to upper stretch, could not keep up with the top pair in mid stretch, faded and saved the show. DASHING
D'ARTAGNAN , bumped at the break, rated between foes early, drafted back into the turn, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a rally.
WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD flashed speed and held a brief early lead, ceded to SILVERBULLETTDAY then stayed on to stalk three wide and between foes,
came in a path to chase around the turn, failed to kick on entering the stretch and weakened. OMAR COMIN , away last after being bumped and pinched
back, regrouped and moved up between foes, secured the inside and advanced into the far turn, stayed in range to mid turn, lacked a punch into the lane
and gave way. EYES ELEVEN , bumped at the break, raced inside and off the pace into the turn, dropped back mid turn, swung wide for the drive then was
eased late.

Footnotes
RAZORETTE showed speed, disputed the pace outside COAL'S MAGNOLIA and determinedly prevailed in an extended drive. COAL'S MAGNOLIA , near
the inner rail around the turn, battled inside the winner in a game effort. ARROGATES DREAM , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, finished
willingly. JOB'S NOT FINISHED , three deep around the turn chasing the pace, swung to the five path near the sixteenth pole and weakened.
HAPPYINITIATIVE raced along the inner rail on the turn and was no factor. BEST WORST IDEA , steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate,
steadied on heels near the half mile pole, swung wide turning for home and weakened. KANEM stumbled leaving the starting gate and trailed.

Footnotes
NOTTOWAY accelerated clear leaving the chute, was nursed along dictating the pace around the turn, came three wide into the stretch, eagerly opened up
under a drive in mid stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept alert. CAPTAIN CARDO lagged off the pace and under a ride leaving the
far turn, angled out mid turn, came seven wide for the drive and closed steadily to nab the place in the final jumps. MUSICAL HEART , bumped at the break,
advanced four to five wide into the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch then flattened out late. OXIDE , inside of rivals while chasing into the turn, stayed
inside past the five sixteenths, eased out, failed to kick on and faded late. CHARGE TO VICTORY , five wide outside rivals leaving the five eighths, shifted
in nearing the turn and stalked, could not make inroads while four wide past the three sixteenths then weakened through the final seventy yards. SAVOY ,
between rivals early, checked when in tight past the five eighths, angled in and failed to respond. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , two wide between rivals and
in range heading to the half, was under a strong ride mid turn, failed to kick on and weakened. BEE BY THE SEA , bumped and in tight at the break, raced
between runners early, lacked a kick mid turn and faltered.

Footnotes
FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL , three wide the first turn, rated back off of an outer rival leaving the seven eighths, angled out a path then edged up four wide past
the five eighths, joined the pace fray three deep into the far turn, moved to a slim lead outside SOUTHERN DISTRICT while dueling past the five sixteenths,
carried that scrum into the lane, kicked clear under a drive heading to the furlong grounds then steadily widened through the final sixteenth. SOUTHERN
DISTRICT broke slowly, recovered and was sent up four wide outside foes around the first turn, prompted the pace three wide and outside MIDNIGHT CAT,
gained a slim lead between runners around the far turn, emerged in a duel to the inside of the winner past the three eighths, was under strong handling to
maintain position into the stretch, failed to match strides inside the three sixteenths but stayed on well to be well clear for the place. BOBBY G saved ground
while edging up to be close past the five eighths, failed to quicken with the leaders while under a ride leaving the far turn, swung out to be about six wide in
upper stretch then churned on to gain the show. STRONG FINISH , with the pace two wide outside the leader nearing the seven eighths, rated back off foes
soon into the backstretch, was put to a ride as the leaders got away exiting the far turn, shifted out some but lacked a serious finish. MIDNIGHT CAT broke
on top despite a slight hop, set a pressured pace towards the rail, could not go with the top pair as they left the three eighths, chased to mid stretch and
faded. AMPERSAND dwelt at the break spotting the field a lengthy advantage, raced about three wide through the backstretch run and failed to get
involved.

Footnotes
INTREPID DREAM stalked the pace outside DOCTOR ABBIE, stayed in the three path around the turn, secured command near the quarter pole, drifted in
and drew off under brisk whipping. DOCTOR ABBIE made the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch, finished willingly but
was second best. WARRIOR'S RANSOM lacked speed, circled the turn three wide and passed tired horses. CATS INTHE TIMBER saved ground around
the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. LADY BREW , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. MAVILUS lacked
speed, raced in the two path on the turn and swung to the four path turning for home.

Footnotes
G'S FIREBALL , away well, dropped back a bit soon after then edged up four deep heading to the half mile marker, dropped in and moved to engage the
leader near the three eighths, sparred on a slim lead into the lane, opened up after being put to a strong drive in upper stretch then continued to widen while
kept alert. EDESTER , inside a trio of foes nearing the half, chased in the clear mid turn, angled out for the drive and finished with interest. BUCKIN' LUCKY
, well back early after angling to the inside, remained inside to the head of the lane, angled out and churned on to gain the show. DAZZLING DEMELZA
ducked out at the break, recovered and raced off the pace while well wide, circled six wide into the lane, drifted in near the three sixteenths then flattened
out. LEAVE DRAMA BEHIND sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was confronted by the winner leaving the far turn, dueled, ceded command
into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened. VALLEY STAR , three wide between runners giving early chase, dropped back around the turn.
GRACE IN EXCESS , two wide and between rivals heading to the half, failed to kick on under a ride leaving the three eighths and faltered.
