Footnotes
ASADA FRIES stalked the top pair along the fence, waited behind the leader on the far turn, launched a rail bid once gaining a clear opening in upper
stretch, put a head in front at the eighth pole and maintained a short lead over SAFA to the wire. SAFA broke a step slow, got put in tight between rivals and
checked entering the first turn, moved closer three deep in the middle stages, challenged the top pair from outside past the quarter pole, battled ASADA
FRIES in the final furlong but could not get by. PUTT FOR DOUGH chased along the rail, got put in tight and took up into the first turn, continued along the
fence to the second bend, steered out at the quarter pole, summoned a mild rally and gained third. RECALCITRANT broke out to bother rival then went up
to duel from inside, fought along the rail through the far turn, came off the fence in upper stretch, allowing ASADA FRIES to sneak past at the eight pole,
continued to vie between rivals then weakened in the final sixteenth. DORIE MILLER raced on the inside near the back, checked leaving the first turn, trailed
two wide into the second bend, angled out and spun five wide into the lane, steadied a bit in midstretch and failed to threaten. LORETTA LYNN climbed
early while going up to contest the pace from outside, battled to the top of the lane, failed to kick between runners at the eighth pole and weakened. PETIT
FILET away quickly in the beginning, stalked in the two path outside a rival, chased between rivals on the far turn, altered out in the upper stretch and
weakened. SUSHI STICKS got bumped back at the start, tucked inside at the rear then moved off the fence around the clubhouse turn, inched closer up the
backstretch, took the second bend two then three wide, shifted back in at the top of the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
PRINCIP chased the top trio two wide into the turn, roused around the bend while tipping three wide, closest in aim entering the stretch, drew alongside
DISCO BALL past the eighth pole and wore down the runner-up in the final sixteenth to edged past late. DISCO BALL stalked the top pair from outside, bid
three deep into the turn, put away inner rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch, challenged by PRINCIP past the
eighth pole, resisted in deep stretch but succumbed to the pressure late. TOP GUN TOMMY sat off the pace, gained four deep around the bend, chased
within striking range at the furlong marker but flattened in the late stages. BLUE CHEESE OLIVE dueled for the lead from inside, vied with outer pair into the
turn, could not keep pace with DISCO BALL past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. HABEAS hustled from the gate, dueled outside BLUE
CHEESE OLIVE, fought between rivals into the turn, chased the new leader past the five-sixteenths pole and also weakened in the lane. ESTABLISHED
fractious in the gate, broke well then dropped back to last, fell further back on the turn while four then three wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LADY CLAYPOOLE (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and steered to the inside trailing the field, pulled leaving the first turn, advanced inside rivals on the
backstretch, gained from the fence through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and challenged at the eighth pole, took over approaching the sixteenth pole
and drove clear. WELL FUNDED stepped to the front and set the pace along the rail, roused at the quarter pole, tested by the winner at the eight pole,
relinquished the lead approaching deep stretch and stayed on to secure second. NO NO NO NEVER (IRE) tracked on the inside then between rivals on the
backstretch, got shuffled back to last at the quarter pole, angled back to the fence and cut the corner into the lane, finished well in the final furlong and
proved a game third. KELLY'S OUT (IRE) was off slow to begin, stalked along the rail through the early going, ridden along midway on the far turn, tipped
out to the two path at the quarter pole, brushed with outer rival in upper stretch and finished evenly late. DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) stalked two wide early,
chased three deep into the second bend, got bumped by inner rival while four wide at the quarter pole, then flattened in the late stages. LEEZA traveled in
the two path towards the rear around the first turn, exited the backstretch three deep, spun four wide into the lane and failed to menace. GOLDEN SKYLINE
raced up close outside the pacesetter to the far turn, floated out by inner rival and bumped with DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) at the quarter pole, then weakened

Footnotes
FIFTY CINCO showed good early speed to take the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, cleared BENDETTIJOE on the
second bend, met the challenge from TAKE ACTION entering the stretch, put that rival away past the eighth pole and held well over the late run from
SYNTACTIC approaching the wire. SYNTACTIC chased on the inside then two wide early, got put in tight past the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two to
three wide around the far turn, angled in and finished well up the fence but could not get by the winner. SHIP AND SCAM sat off the pace off the rail, was on
the move four, five then six wide on the second bend and kept on willingly in the final furlong to earn the show honors. BENDETTIJOE broke a step slow
then rushed up and had to pause behind the leaders into the first turn, chased three wide through that bend, moved up four deep then bid outside the leader
at the half-mile pole, could not keep pace and chased through the far turn while moved out, spun five wide into the lane and kept on for a minor award.
TAKE ACTION stalked from inside, came under and angled out on the far turn, challenged outside the winner three wide into the lane but was turned away
in the final furlong. ROAD OF LOVE off slow in the beginning, steadied into the first turn at the back, angled six wide on the far turn and failed to menace.
CONFUCIUS brushed with outer rival leaving the gate, raced three wide at the back through the clubhouse turn, continued well back four wide into the
second bend, entered the lane six wide and had little left for the stretch. EAGLES LANDING brushed leaving the gate, pressed the pace from outside then
chased up the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
GENIUS JIMMY bumped leaving the gate, set the pace under pressure from STAMP MY PASSPORT to the outside, carried a short lead through the far
turn, shook free at the top of the lane and held over the late try from the runner-up. CROSBY BEACH stalked on the inside through both turns, chased within
striking distance with a furlong remaining, put in a late bid but was not enough to overtake the winner. TRULY QUALITY sat off the pace outside a rival,
chased three wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and got up for third. STAMP MY PASSPORT pressed the pace from outside to the top of the
stretch, failed to kick on with the winner with three-sixteenths left to run, flattened in deep stretch and lost the show. SEVEN WONDERS broke in and
bumped rival, traveled in mid-pack two wide, moved into range in the middle stages, chased two to three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LIVING
LIFE off slow to begin, traveled three deep at the back early on, stayed off the fence and spun three to four wide into the drive and failed to offer a response
when called on. SHORTMAN had to take up when crowded early, raced along the rail near the back, drew closer on the backstretch, chased two wide into
the lane, altered inward in upper stretch and flattened out. KERRY GOLD took up when crowded along the fence early, raced inside a pair of rivals at the
back, tipped off the rail on the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was not a factor. TESORO broke a bit slow, chased between at the back in the
early stages, got put in tight at the three-eighths pole, angled over to the rail and was failed to threaten after.

Footnotes
IMAGINATION showed early speed outside WINE ME UP then got knocked sideways into the first turn, continued outside the leader into the backstretch,
took over and moved clear at the nine-sixteenths pole before being pressured by WINE ME UP leaving the backstretch, lost command while dueling through
the far turn, fought back to regain a slim advantage in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong and dug in to prevail. WINE ME UP showed good early
speed to take control and moved inside, overtaken by IMAGINATION on the backstretch and chased briefly past the nine-sixteenths pole, re-engaged that
rival leaving the backstretch, put a nose in front while dueling on the far turn, fought head to head with IMAGINATION down to the wire and was edged by
the winner. MC VAY stalked two wide approaching the first turn then had to steady off heels and came out, moved back into the three path around the bend,
chased after the dueling leaders two to three wide on the far turn, could not summon the needed rally to threaten late but finished a clear third. SCATIFY
bobbled slightly shortly after leaving the gate, pulled hard along the rail and shifted out to bump IMAGINATION into the first turn, continued to tug the rider
along through the bend, chased within range in the middle stages, dropped back around the far turn, was coaxed along to the furlong grounds then eased
late and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE RUN INTO THE FIRST TURN AND RULED THAT SCATIFY WAS HARD TO
CONTROL WHILE TRYING TO GO INTO A TIGHT SPOT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
DU JOUR settled in the two path off the pace, gained along the rail then two wide on the far turn, cut back to the fence in upper stretch and surged to the
front, kicked clear past the eighth pole and was kept to busy to the wire. EASTER (FR) broke a step slow, traveled outside a rival at the back of the field in
the early going, steadied behind MACKINNON at the three-eighths pole, chased three deep midway around that bend, swung five wide into the stretch,
finished well through the lane and gained the place honors. AH JEEZ raced along the inside at the back, trailed from the fence through the far turn, tipped
out into the lane, chased between rivals with a sixteenth remaining and gained third. FIRST PEACE was closest in pursuit three then two wide early, drew
closer on the far turn and loomed three wide into the lane, challenged from outside in upper stretch, could not kick on with DU JOUR past the eighth pole
and flattened to fourth. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) stalked between around the first turn then outside a rival on the backstretch, angled out on the far turn
and came four wide into the lane, then flattened in the furlong grounds. GOLIAD sprinted to the front and moved into the two path, controlled the pace along
the inside leaving the backstretch, roused around the far turn, showed the way two wide into the lane, yielded to rivals on both sides approaching the eighth
pole and weakened in deep stretch. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) stalked the pacesetter from inside, inched closer on the far turn, asked right handed leaving that
bend and weakened in the drive. MACKINNON stalked outside a pair of rivals through the first turn, raced off the rail then moved inside on the backstretch,
started to weaken on the far turn and steadied between rivals near the quarter pole and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
NEWGATE chased two to three wide around the first turn, raced between foes into the second bend, was on the move while angling outside a trio of rivals
at the quarter pole, took aim three deep entering the stretch, challenged from outside past the eighth pole, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and got
up in the final moments. SUBSANADOR (ARG) sprinted to the front and moved across to the inside, set the pace under pressure from MIXTO to the far
turn, moved clear approaching the five-sixteenths pole, put to the right hand entering the lane, met the bid from NEW GATE past the eighth pole, resisted
through deep stretch but yielded grudgingly near the wire. REINCARNATE stalked the top pair from inside, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out at
the top of the lane, offered a challenge with a furlong remaining but faltered in the late stages and stayed on to secure the show honors. HIGHLAND FALLS
sat off the pace on the inside in the early going, ridden along on the far turn while steered out to the three path, moved out further in upper stretch and
summoned a mild rally to earn a minor award. MIXTO chased for briefly then went up to press SUBSANADOR (ARG) from outside, could not kick on with
that rival midway around the far turn, chased between rivals at the quarter pole, cut to the inside in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. NEWGRANGE
forwardly placed three deep early, continued outside rivals on the far turn then chased two wide into the lane and weakened. SALESMAN (IRE) raced
outside a rival off the pace, moved out and chased within range in the middle stages, dropped back three, four, then five wide on the far turn and had little
left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
GETTHEMONEY keen early stalking the pace, rounded the bend three then two wide, found traffic in upper stretch, angled inside and closed fast to get up
in time. JUST NAILS dueled for command inside SUMMER LAKE, inched ahead at the top of the stretch, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth and got
nailed by the winner. SUMMER LAKE battled outside JUST NAILS for command, kept the pressure on that rival through the lane and went gamely to the
wire. VITALERA (CHI) stalked in the four path entering the turn, shifted into the three path around the bend, moved back out entering the stretch, challenged
through the lane and got outkicked. SUNSHINE BABE forwardly placed from inside early, saved ground through the turn and into the stretch, chased within
striking distance to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. HAYLEY LEVADE got bumped and crowded between rivals early then dropped back, went three
then two wide on the turn, angled eight wide across the dirt and improved position. PLEASANT WAVE chased between rivals then moved inside, saved
ground around the bend and could not produce a bid in the final furlong. REAL FIRE broke a step slow, raced near the back early on, was hard to ride
around the turn and upper stretch, then straightened out and improved position late. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE pulled early and had to steady, continued to
tug in the two path on the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. NOT NOW got bumped and crowded between rivals early, started to pull and
had to take up along the outer rail prior to the first turn, angled six wide into the lane and lacked a rally. VENGANZA got bumped shortly after the start,
chased four wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and weakened. DON'T JU FORGET broke in and bumped, stalked between rivals, three then two wide
on the turn before angling out to the five path, looked to rally but lacked room midstretch and could not regain momentum.

Footnotes
RUBY NELL sprinted clear and crossed over to the inside, opened up a comfortable lead, held a diminished lead still clear through the far turn, asked right
handed in upper stretch, remained unchallenged into the final furlong, felt MOUFFY looming to the outside entering deep stretch and held well under left
handed encouragement late. MOUFFY took the first turn three then two wide while settling in mid-pack, cut into the lead on the far turn, driven two wide into
the lane, closed in from outside in deep stretch but was not enough to get by the winner. NADETTE (FR) raced towards the rear on the inside early on,
continued to save ground on the far turn, moved out in the lane and came with a late rally to earn the show honors. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) tracked the lone
leader from the rail position, moved closer on the far turn, stayed along the fence in the lane and got outkicked for third. BELLABEL (IRE) was closest in
pursuit a bit off the rail through the clubhouse turn, moved into range on the far turn, asked right handed in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages.
CLOSING REMARKS settled between rivals off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. LUCKY GIRL
(IRE) laid off the pace on the inside through both turns, tipped out in the drive and lacked further response. JUSTIQUE got shuffled back in the beginning,
trailed from inside through the first turn, took the second turn two wide and could not make an impact. LAKOTA SPIRIT chased outside rivals through the
first turn, pushed on two wide around the second bend and failed to menace.
