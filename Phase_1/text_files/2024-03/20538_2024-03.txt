DR. BELLA dropped back off the early going, ridden into the far turn, swung widest through the lane and surged up late to just get up under strong handling.
BLAZINGLY stalked the pace from the outside, had a four to two wide bid around the far turn, experienced slight traffic from the loose horse Bela Aria, led
late and was caught near the wire in a game effort. PINK PARTY PANTS tracked from the outside, checked sharply near the five sixteenths pole, dug in five
wide late and finished gamely to the wire. Jockey of Pink Party Pants claimed objection against the Blazingly for interference around the far turn and
stewards ruled no change. ROLLESTON rated along near the rail, checked near the quarter pole, raced three deep in the drive and flattened out in the final
stages. MY ROSIE set a pressured early pace two deep and weakened near the rail in the drive. QUEEN OF CHILL dropped back off the early going,
advanced into the far turn, carried wide into the upper stretch by the loose horse and had no late bid. MISS GETTY UP settled off the early pace, raced wide
around the far turn into the stretch and had no response. RENAISSANCE (IRE) prompt the early pace near the rail and gave way in the drive. BEL ARIA
was forwardly placed between rivals early, was then put in tight along the far turn and unseated his jockey. DUE TO THE LOOSE HORSE THE FIVE
EIGHTHS TIME AND FINAL TIME WERE READJUSTED.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN PARTY prompt the early pace setter two deep early down the backstretch, dug in from the inside of foe deep stretch and got up under all out
pressure. BIG TAP stalked the pace, moved up three wide around the far turn, was five wide in the lane, dug in between late and missed. ROYAL
DECADENCE rated from the outside, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. CHAPS KNIGHT dropped back to race mid
pack, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up late to improve position. EVERY LOVING WISH was unhurried early, raced three to four
wide and had no response. JACK THE BIRD stalked the pace, veered in just past the three sixteenths pole has his whip was tangled with Palmisano,
checked sharply and weakened. CADE'S GOAL dropped back early and failed to respond. SOLIDIFIED GOLD settled off the early going, was moving up
through the far turn into the upper stretch, checked sharply just past the three sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter. FIRST CHOICE was off very slow,
lost a considerable amount of ground at the stat, raced five deep in the drive and never threatened. BOY WONDER raced five wide on both turns and
lacked a bid. PALMISANO was forced to check sharply between just past the three sixteenths pole as whip got tangled in rein with Jack the Brid and faded.

Footnotes
LADY HAMILTON set her own uncontested pace along the inside, felt pressure from the outside into the upper lane and responded well to edge away under
strong handling. SHEWILLGHOSTU rated early, ridden along two deep near the three eighths pole and finished gamely to the wire. ADDISON void of early
speed, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch moved up to improve position. BOTOX KATIE raced along early to race under a hold, had an inside
run and was even with no closing run. KIT CAN RUN was mid pack early, swung six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid.
ZIGGZAPPA stalked the pace from the outside of rivals and faded. LUNAR ICE settled early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole and lacked a bid.
AUNT RUTH failed to respond.

Footnotes
PARTAKE led the way in opening strides then conceded position to GO GO STAR, pressed the pace two wide under a snug hold then let out approaching
the mid-way point on the turn, vied with E STORMY past the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and finished clear under steady encouragement.
FROSTY TALE tracked the inside on the inside through early stages, made a bid for command late on the turn, bumped with MARGARET'S LADY at the
head of the lane, shifted out wider and got up for place. MARGARET'S LADY raced in range through the early going, hustled along three wide around the
turn, bumped with FROSTY TALE at the head of the lane, drifted in under left handed urging and got edged for place. YZZY'S BOLT raced off the early
pace, urged for response around the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved. E STORMY stalked the top pair through the backstretch,
advanced to duel for the lead with the eventual winner around then turn then gave way in the lane. OUR GIRL FLINT raced in the back, shifted out wider in
upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. GO GO STAR took over the lead soon after the start, set the early pace near the inside, challenged for the lead
mid-way around the turn, lost command and steadily faded.

FOR MAMA moved up to challenge for the lead soon after the start, held a narrow advantage then vied with RAF entering the turn, took on the added
challenge of GREY CHARMER near the quarter pole, dueled inside of rival down the lane, got headed a furlong out, dug back in gamely under strong
handling and proved best. GREY CHARMER sat well positioned tracking the top trio in early stages, edged up and engaged rivals for the lead near the
quarter pole, battled on for command outside of FOR MAMA, poked a head in front at the furlong marker then got denied by game winner in final strides.
MERLIN'S SONG raced in range through the backstretch, saved ground while one-paced around the turn, shifted four wide entering the head of the lane,
roused for more, responded and gained a share. THALBERG rated off the early front runners, hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained bid through
the stretch and had a mild improve. SECRETARY OF WAR hopped at the start and raced off the early pace, saved ground entering the head of the lane
and lacked the needed response for impact. CLEARING WAIVERS raced near the back through the backstretch, hustled along between rivals late on the
turn, shifted wider for the drive and failed to rally. LIEUTENANT JACK raced in the back, came six wide into upper stretch and never menaced. RAF vied for
the early lead, continued to battle with the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive. STRETCH RUNNER hustled along racing off the early
pace, swung five wide into the stretch and had no response. AGADOR SPARTACUS rated near midpack through the early going then steadily weakened.
