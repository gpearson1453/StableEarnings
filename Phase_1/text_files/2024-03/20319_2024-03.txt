Footnotes
RESTLESS stalked the duel to mid turn, eased out three wide approaching the stretch, drifted in when taking a short lead in upper stretch and narrowly
prevailed in an extended drive. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND showed speed along the inner rail, dueled with SUPER NEEDY early, put that one away entering
the stretch then battled inside the winner in a sharp effort. SUPER NEEDY disputed the pace outside SUMMERSTATEOFMIND and weakened through the
stretch. CONNECTAMUNDO chased the pace in the two path around the turn then weakened along the inner rail through the stretch. SIN PERMISO , three
wide chasing the pace, gave way. OWHATANITE broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
GAMBLING TZAR rated along between rivals, took closer order into the far turn, angled out under pressure and emerged as the closest pursuer of the
leader in upper stretch, closed in under left handed asks, took command outside SUCCEED with a sixteenth remaining and edged clear. SUCCEED bore
out at the break, corrected and was used five wide into and around the first turn, cleared into the backstretch and set the pace, was under a strong hand ride
past the five sixteenths, maintained command three wide in upper stretch, dug in when collared a furlong out, fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave
way grudgingly. BOCA GUY , with the pace while between runners into the first turn, rated back off of SUCCEED and dropped in to stalk, edged up to the
inside of rivals nearing the far turn, chased inside a pair of foes past the five sixteenths, entered the lane with aim but one paced through the final furlong.
LONG LIVE NOW lagged back early on and off the inside, was put to asking three wide into the far turn, circled six wide with an advance into the lane,
remained on his left lead and flattened out late. FOOD FOODIE , rated outside rivals, moved up into the far turn, remained in range while under a ride and
four wide into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and gave way. APPENDAGE , away to a brief early lead, ceded to rivals around the first
turn, saved ground chasing past the five eighths, was under a strong ride past the five sixteenths but failed to respond. MAJOR CAM rated off of
APPENDAGE into the first turn, dropped off the pace, raced two to three wide nearing the lane and failed to respond. PER RULING #24-084 FROM THE
MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, GAMBLING TZAR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

CASTLE ISLAND stalked the pace under confident handling down the backstretch, advanced to take a two wide lead on the far turn, pulled away through
the stretch and was under the whip in mid stretch. MARTY'S MAGIC stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the three path between horses
entering the far turn, weakened through the stretch and raced on his left lead in the drive. RUN FOR REAGAN bumped with SILENT MODE leaving the
starting gate, moved up rapidly four deep into the far turn, chased the winner to the stretch, tired and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. STORMY SEAS
sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered on the far turn. SILENT MODE bumped with RUN FOR REAGAN at the start and
trailed.

YOUR ANALYSIS , between rivals into the backstretch, settled off the rail and off of a contested pace past the five eighths, responded when called upon
leaving the three eighths and commenced his run, bid four wide outside the embattled leaders, nearing the lane, forged clear under a drive leaving the three
sixteenths then eagerly widened while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. JOE , four wide to contention, moved up and bid three deep nearing the five
eighths, dueled outside LEGAL DEAL from the half mile marker, battled on a slim lead between foes leaving the five sixteenths, could not quite go with the
winner heading to mid stretch but dug in nicely to be second best. MOSE PERFECT , well placed tracking the pace, was urged along about two wide behind
the leaders nearing the half, remained under coaxing to hold a forward spot past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide for the drive but lacked a serious
finish. LEGAL DEAL , nudged from the gate to be forward, bid between foes in early backstretch, dueled on a short lead heading to the far turn, stayed on to
dispute the issue inside JOE, could not quite quicken with the leaders entering the lane then gave way grudgingly. IRISH BOOLUM , off the pace and off the
inside under asking, raced three wide into the stretch, drifted in near mid stretch then lacked a solid finish. BROTHER BRAD rated inside early, raced about
two wide into the lane, shifted in and gave way. A C EXPRESSWAY took command between runners then cleared into the backstretch, dropped in to set the
early pace, was taken on by a pair of rivals nearing the five eighths, failed to kick on leaving the far turn, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
REE NEE'S SIX , three wide between rivals into the turn, steadily advanced to take aim on BLUE TRILLION near the quarter pole, engaged that one from
her outside in upper stretch, dueled under asking, gained a slim lead a sixteenth out then held sway. BLUE TRILLION accelerated to a clear lead shortly
after the start, set the pace under a some rating and towards the inner rail, maintained command two wide into the stretch, dug in when confronted by the
winner, drifted out while dueling inside the sixteenth marker and continued gamely to the wire. TRUE SUNSHINE , four wide outside rivals and stalking the
pace, edged up under asking into the lane, drifted in briefly near the three sixteenths, corrected and closed steadily. MUCHO TIGGER dropped inside early
on and moved up to stalk, dropped back a bit leaving the far turn, was under pressure to hold position past the five sixteenths, got through along the rail in
upper stretch, angled out inside the furlong grounds but lacked a solid run. FEELIN SO LUCKY lost ground four to five wide and lacked the needed
response. SHEHERHERS broke a step slow, steadied soon after, recovered and was guided towards the inner rail, moved up some into the turn, eased out
mid turn, then lacked a serious finish. LILLY LIGHTNING came out at the break, righted and raced between runners past the half, angled in and lacked a
rally. REMEMBER ME chased the pace two wide, remained forward to upper stretch, failed to kick on and gave way.

Footnotes
SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE , taken to rate off the pace, edged up two wide behind a trio nearing the far turn, eased out past the three eighths, chased the
dueling leaders four wide into the lane, made a grinding run under right handed asks, joined the fray a sixteenth out, took over soon after and held sway.
NINJA ABARRIO , three deep and within range, took closer order leaving the far turn, moved to engage NORTHERN GLOW past the five sixteenths, drew
alongside into the stretch, dueled on a slim advantage past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted late but wasn't quite good enough. NORTHERN
GLOW , three wide to contention, prompted outside SOLVING PROGRESS, applied more pressure leaving the half mile marker, dueled, briefly edged clear
after six furlongs, was taken on from her outside by NINJA ABARRIO nearing the lane, dueled inside that one past the furlong grounds then couldn't quite
go with the top pair in the final yards. BROOKLYN GIRL lagged back off the rail, moved up some leaving the far turn, angled out five wide to continue
progress into the stretch then churned on with some interest. GUN RUNNIN' GAL , between rivals a long way, had aim past the five sixteenths, stayed on
past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. MISCHIEF MOTION , forwardly placed while saving ground nearing the backstretch, steadied off of the
leader soon after, stalked past the five eighths, got caught behind a tiring SOLVING PROGRESS near the five sixteenths, angled out then back in but came
up empty. SOLVING PROGRESS pulled clear early and was a bit keen on the lead, drafted towards the inside through the backstretch then took pressure
past the five eighths, sparred with NORTHERN GLOW past the three eighths then weakened.

Footnotes
VOODOO PRIESTESS , four wide the first turn, advanced three deep leaving the backstretch, secured command mid way on the far turn, raced erratically
in the stretch and prevailed under brisk urging. MUCHO MACHO MRYTLE stalked the pace down the backstretch in the two path, eased out three wide
leaving the far turn and flattened out. COAL'S MAGNOLIA set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead on the far turn and gave way in the drive. BEST
WORST IDEA , far back after being very rank soon after the break, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, passed tired horses and swerved out late.
PREAKNESS PARTY stalked the pace for a half mile, circled the far turn three wide and gave way. NEVERTOOMUCHELVIS , three wide the first turn,
chased the early pace, raced in the two path the far turn and faltered. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the antics soon after the break but no action
was taken.
