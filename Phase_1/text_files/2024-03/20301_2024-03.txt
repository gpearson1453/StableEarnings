Footnotes
IMPERIOUSLY bobbled at the start but recovered well to set the pace along the inside, was cued while floating out to the four path turning into the lane, and
drew clear on her left lead. YLANG YLANG tracked in the three path, was coaxed into the turn, loomed up from the five path turning into the stretch, and
chased on for place. DOVE IN CHARGE raced off the pace in the four path, came under a ride going into the turn, swung from the six path into the lane,
and kept on for show. BEER BALI bumped with an inner foe at the start, then with an outer foe and got pinched just after, raced in the back of the pack from
the three path, was cued midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, and stayed on while hanging on her left lead. TRUE
MARTINI prompted the pace in the three path, was nudged along two wide around the turn, but faded in the stretch. EXECUTIVE EFFECT bumped with an
inner foe after the start, chased in the two path and never threatened. ROUGH ENOUGH bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback along the
inside and never menaced.

Footnotes
SEMINOLE CHIEF set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear under left-handed urging. OSCAR'S WORLD tracked
the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on for the place. BEYOND STOKED rated up close inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, could
not gain on the winner and kept on to maintain the show. THOMAS AQUINAS raced off the pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and
flattened out in the lane. PIPER'S FACTOR was reluctant to load, was off slowly, raced five wide and was no threat. THE PROCESS was bumped and
pinched back at the start, steadied while keyed up around the first turn, raced two wide around both turns and lacked a closing bid. WAITLIST failed to
menace while racing four and five wide. SHERIF ALI broke out and bumped THE PROCESS at the start, raced three and four wide in midpack and had no
response. EDGARTOWN prompted the winner in three path and faltered in the stretch.

around the far turn, and chased on from the inside down the stretch for place. COOL TRICKS hit the outer part of the gate leaving, trailed in the three path,
tipped out to the five path midway around the far turn, got bumped by an inner foe out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. WORLD

Footnotes
TIZ A TALE stalked the pace in the three path, took over in midstretch and edged ahead under a drive. NEOPHYTE set a clear pace in the two path, was
collared by the winner in midstretch and fought on inside. HONESTO raced off the pace outside, was carried out into the five path near the five-sixteenths
pole, steadied and angled in soon after then rallied through the lane to gain the show. JUPITER BLUES went evenly inside. EXCHANGE DAY saved ground
and failed to menace. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. TIZ A PRINCE was outrun while racing two wide. KING
JAMES chased the pace in the four path and faltered in the lane. ENGLISH BOB bore out around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL QUEST rated in the three path, was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, and kicked on to draw past an inner
pair in the final furlong. PRIVATE THOUGHTS prompted the pace in the three path, bid in the two path rounding the far turn, ran on to lead in the three path
at the top of the stretch, but was caught in the closing stages by an outer foe to place. ECHO LANE broke a tad slow, trailed from the three path into the
backstretch, was driven four wide around the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. BRAWN showed the way
along the inside turning into the backstretch, was roused midway around the far turn, but faded in the final furlong. MARCEAU tracked in the two path but
never threatened. SEAT AT THE TABLE stalked inside but weakened in upper stretch. RED WREN raced off the pace in the four path and never menaced.

Footnotes
HAPPY TOGETHER set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. DE REGRESO pressed the winner in the three
path through the opening quarter-mile, rated back to last, circled six wide around the far turn and finished with good energy down the center of the track.
RAINING SUGAR saved ground off the pace, bid in upper stretch, was no match for the winner and was outfinished late for the place. BUBBLY
CHAMPAGNE stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. MADAME MISCHIEF bumped with GOLDEN
CANARY at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. MILLIAT (IRE) raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn
but faded through the lane. GOLDEN CANARY was bumped at the start, raced in range four wide, bid three wide midway around the far turn but came up
empty in the lane. WEE BIT O MISCHIEF advanced four wide around the first turn, pressed the pace down the backstretch, checked near the
five-sixteenths marker and was eased from there.

LUCKY COMBINATION got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, showed the way from the three path turning into the backstretch, lost the
lead while under a nudge midway around the far turn, was cued passing the quarter, dug in to duel with an inner foe in upper stretch, and drew clear in the
final sixteenth. TEXAS SHUFFLE stalked in the two path, slipped thru an opening along the rail to take the lead midway around the far turn, dueled with an
outer foe turning into the lane, but yielded in the final sixteenth to place. HOLY FOLEY rated in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn,
drifted in passing the eighth pole, and got up for show. MARIA'S REVENGE bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path down the backside,
was cued from the two path early around the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but got herded inwards passing the eighth pole,
and flattened. MINT EDITION broke out and bumped an outer foe, then was rank and had to be steadied while off the pace in the two path rounding the first
turn, had to steady again around the five eighths, and never threatened from the six path in the stretch. PEACE SEEKER laid up close in the four path but
backed up between foes in the three path around the far turn.

Footnotes
KINGFISH STEVENS set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. BASKETBALL JONES had early speed inside of the winner, rated back and
angled three wide midway around the first turn, chased outside of the winner from there and held second. BELLY OF JELLY saved ground in range, tipped
out in upper stretch and stayed on for the show. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE had his head turned at the start and hit the gate, raced far back inside, edged closer
three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. KING SILVIO bumped with CHACHARERO at the start, raced in range three wide and lacked the
needed rally. ASK IN MY NAME raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally.
BOLD ADVANCE failed to menace while racing two wide. CHACHARERO was bumped at the start and checked soon after, saved ground well back, angled
out in upper stretch and never reached contention. TRINITY PARK chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. NO REGARD broke a bit
awkwardly and made little impact while racing two and three wide.

COPPOLA laid up close under a hold inside but steadied slightly going into the turn, was coaxed from the rail passing the quarter, tipped out to the two path
passing the eighth pole, and kicked on to be up in the final strides. PANTHER ISLAND chased inside, tipped out to the four path turning into the stretch, had
to alter further out passing the eighth pole, and ran on to split place. YES I AM FREE got bumped but an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path,
was nudged along around the turn, opened slightly in upper stretch, but was caught by the winner in the closing stages, and held onto a share of place. BIG
INVASION raced wellback in the three path, swung out to the six path under a ride turning into the stretch, and stayed on but made no impact. KANTHARI
broke out and bumped an outer foe, stalked in the three path, swung from the four path under drive turning into the lane, but was one paced.
ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA tracked in the three path but flattened from the five path in the stretch. ROCKCREST raced off the pace in the two path and never
menaced. STORM THE COURT got rank and broke slowly, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RED CARPET READY stalked the pace in the three path, angled four wide near the quarter pole, took over in midstretch and inched ahead under a drive.
OLIVIA DARLING pressed the pace in the three path, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, battled between rivals through the stretch and
was game to earn the place. SPIRIT WIND set the pace in the two path, led to midstretch and gave way grudgingly inside of the top two finishers.
UNIFYING saved ground and failed to menace. CHEETARA (CHI) had early speed four wide and steadily faded. LIBBAN gave distant chase four and five
wide and lacked a closing bid. DREAMSTER played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
HUNT BALL was unhurried in the two path early, roused from the three path into the far turn, spit foes while angling out to the five path at the top of the
lane, had to angle further out before the sixteenth, but swept past an inner foe to win going away. ANNOINTED rated in the three path, was driven from the
four path into the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. BLACK DIAMOND tracked in the five path, bid in the
three path around the far turn, was coaxed passing the quarter, took the lead while drifting out to the five path in upper stretch, but was caught buy an outer
pair to show. CYBER ATTACK raced off the pace in the five path turning into the backstretch, came under a drive going into the far turn, but made no
impact. SHALLUS had a slow start and trailed along the inside early, was looking for room while tipping out to the four path turning into the stretch stayed on
between foes, but could not factor. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND pulled around the first turn to set an open pace from inside down the backstretch, was roused
midway around the far turn, but faded in the two path down the lane. I SEE YOU LOOKIN stalked in the four path, was ridden from the two path into the far
turn, but weakened down the lane. FRANK JR raced towards the back of the pack in the three path and never menaced. ACT OF MUTINY chased in the
two path and was empty entering the stretch.
