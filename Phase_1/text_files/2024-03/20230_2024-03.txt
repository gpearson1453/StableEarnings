Footnotes
AA SWEET VICTORY pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied gamely leaving the bend and was able to edge past the pace
setter in the late stretch and be up in the final strides. RB MUNCHIE set the pace while three wide and outside of rivals down the backstretch, continued to
hold the lead throughout the turn, was under a strong drive in the early stretch then was over taken by an outer rival in the final yards and was second best.
UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA raced in the middle of the field while three wide, then was charging up on the turn, gained third position then lacked the
winning bid in the stretch and was best for the show prize. TM PURNCESS pressed the pace under a hard drive into the turn, was used up and weakened in
late stretch. KD DERBY GIRL settled at the back of the pack and was no threat. UPTOWN KEEPMEINMIND was unhurried early and failed to rally.

Footnotes
GET WITT GONE led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the early backstretch, then was confronted by CRAZY RIDGE on the outside heading
into the far turn, sparred grudgingly while bumping said rival down the home stretch and just had more to be at the wire. CRAZY RIDGE stalked the pace
while two wide into the first turn, then inched up in late backstretch to duke it out with GET WITT GONE throughout the far turn and into the early stretch,
bumped and tussled while rallying gamely down the lane but just missed in the end. NIGHTWIND tracked the pace from the inside while saving ground
down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn, shifted out to the three path then closed gamely besting incoming rivals and just missing the place
prize. VICTOR VALENTINO was off slowly, then raced behind the field in the early furlongs, rallied leaving the far turn and was closing with too much too
late in the end. CREDIT RATING chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then menaced on the far turn and into the home stretch and was
gaining ground but it was not enough in the end. TEXAS PRADO settled along the rail between the field then bid on the far turn while two wide and came up
empty. MOROLICIOUS settled along the inside towards the back of the pack and was no menace. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S
OBJECTION following the race, The rider of CRAZY RIDGE claimed foul against the rider of GET WITT GONE for interference in the home stretch. After
reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish.

SPIN WHEEL saved ground in the early furlongs while racing behind the field, moved out of last place while gaining ground on the far from the five path,
then surged down the lane to be up at the wire. NORTHWIND broke outwardly and brushed rival, the led the way into the first turn, was met with an inner
rival to duel down the backstretch, shook clear of that rival to lead the way on the far turn and into the early stretch, was under a strong drive but was caught
in the end. LEVY chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, then rallied leaving the far turn and needed more in the end. KITTER KAT was
forwardly placed along the rail while heading into the first turn, then dueled with an outer rival heading into the second turn, was left in second position
heading into the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. NEPHI tracked the pace two to three wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to gain
third position before giving way in the home stretch. HUMOR ME PLEASE settled along the inside, then bid in the late stretch and came up empty. CROW'S
NEST was brushed at the start, then settled in the path outside of rival down the backstretch, urged steadily on the far turn and needed more in the end.

in late stretch and was best for the place prize. TOO MUCH GUITAR saved ground down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the bend while four wide and
closed willingly to be up for the show prize. CRESSONS LIL CHARM broke outwardly at the start, then chased the pace while three wide, was urging
steadily on the turn to rally in the stretch and missed the show prize in the end. CHARMINGLY WITT settled inside, then bid mildly in the upper stretch and

WILD EXPRESS raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, was well reserved down the backstretch, then bid in the upper stretch, angled out to the
two path and surged past DRENCHED and was up in time to succeed. OUR DAVINA saved ground in the early furlongs, then from the inside leaving the far
turn, was denied room then steadied, angled out to the five path mid stretch and closed belatedly and was up for the place prize once again. DRENCHED
led the way into the first turn, maintained the pace under a steady hand ride into the second turn, was clear in the early stretch then was caught in the end
by an outer WILD EXPRESS. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) stalked the pace while three wide heading into the first turn, then raced in the middle of the pack down
the backstretch, dug in leaving the far bend to battle for the place position but was out finished in the end. CLAIRE JUNE tracked the pace in the two path
while being well rated in the early furlongs then rallied leaving the far bend, vied between rivals for the place position in the final furlong then gave way in the
end. XTRA SPICY hopped at the start, then settled in the two path, pulled up mid stretch and was vanned off. There was an INQUIRY following the race.
After review, no change was made.

ROYA reserved momentum in the early furlongs, then gained ground steadily leaving the far turn, edged past the pace setter mid stretch and held on well to
prevail in the end. PUT A BOW ON IT maintained an easy pace well ahead of rivals down the backstretch, cleared the far turn, was in a long drive in the
early stretch, was used up and gave way in the final yards. ROSES ARE GRAY was unhurried early, continued to race at the back of the back heading into
the far turn then bid in the late stretch but it was too little too late. BETYAR AZETS chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then bid mildly
heading in the early stretch but it was not enough to make a difference in the end. DANZIG UP A STORM tracked the pace from the inside and in second
position down the backstretch, was in a strong drive on the far turn and could not retrain bid and flattened out in the home stretch. WITHHERBOOTSON
settled behind the field and failed to rally.

Footnotes
BOSSADUSU raced towards the back of the pack while three wide, then dug in leaving the bend and flew down the lane, passing inner rivals and was up in
the final strides. BEAUXS ARTES stalked the pace from the inside under a strong drive throughout and was able to hold onto the place prize in the end.
BAYOU BEAUTY staked the pace while two wide into the turn, then rallied gamely in the upper stretch, lacked winning bid and was best for the show prize.
HIT'EM UP chased the pace while two wide at a moderate pace throughout and needed more in the end. APRIORITY GIRL broke outwardly at the start,
then angled inside to set the pace into the turn, held clear heading into the early stretch then was out finished in the end. FLYING I raced in the middle of the
field while four wide, then made a mild bid in the upper stretch but it was not enough in the end. AUNT JANA was unhurried early and no threat. FEARLESS
DIXIE steadied early and did not spark.
