Footnotes
WMA BANDANA sped to the lead shortly after the break, cleared the turn under a steady hand ride, then held sway down the lane to prove best. RB MAMA
WINGATE was away well, then laid off the pace while three wide, dug in in the early stretch but it was not enough to catch the leader in the end. UPTOWN
MON AME chased the pace along the rail into the turn under a steady drive then flattened out in the final furlongs. PEARLS COMET AA stalked the pace
between rivals, then came out three to four wide leaving the bend while flattening out in the stretch. FLYINGJ JOYCE raced behind the field throughout and
needed rally in the end.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY DAWN prompted the from the two wide while being nicely rated into the first turn and down the backstretch, then dug in gamely in the upper
stretch and surpassed the pace setter in the final yards and was up in time to claim the win. HOLD MY BEER BRO was forwardly placed along the inside
into the first, then led the field down the backstretch and into the second turn, was in a long drive before being overtaken in the final furlong by an outer rival
and was second best in the end. PHILANTHROPER was brushed at the start, then raced between rivals into the first turn, steadied at the three quarter
marker, regained stride down the backstretch, then pulled away from rivals on the far turn to gain third position and held the show prize in the end. SPECIAL
STORMY saved ground in the early furlongs, then swung six to seven wide leaving the far bend and was gaining ground in the late stretch just missing the
show prize in the end. WRINKLE ROAD settled inside towards the back of the field in the early furlongs, then was under a hard drive on the far turn to rally
in the upper stretch, drifted out late and came up empty in the end. SNOW KING tracked the leader from the inside down the backstretch, bid mildly on the
far turn while coming out five wide, steadied in the late stretch avoiding drifting out rival then flattened out in the end. PAYNT was bumped on both sides,
then settled inside, came out four to five wide leaving the second turn and was no threat. SKI CAT bumped inner rival at the start, then tracked the pace
while three wide in the early furlongs, bid on the far turn then stopped. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference in the home stretch.
After review, no change was made.

Footnotes
PRINCE RAMA was well rated from two path while pressing the pace into the first turn and down the backstretch, then advanced to gain command at the
five sixteenths pole and held on well down the home stretch to prove best once again. CLIFF DIVER moved up to chase the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, then menaced leaving the far turn but lacked the winning bid in the end and was best for the place prize. GIST was impeded at the start, then
trailed behind the field, came out four wide leaving the far bend then was gaining ground swiftly in the final furlong and was up for the show prize.
CATHOLIC GUILT chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far bend, angled inside then continued to race evenly in
the final yards. ABSAROKA led the way the down the backstretch, was under a hard drive entering far turn, lost command then gave way in the late stretch.
KENTUCKY PEERLESS broke outwardly at the start then settled along the inside, bid leaving the far turn but it was too little too late. DEANOS CAPE
chased the pace from the inside under a steady drive in the early furlongs, then faded on the far turn and had no final bid.

Footnotes
YVONNE'S MISS was well rated along the inside while tracking the pace down the backstretch, then shifted out to the five path leaving the turn and cruised
down the lane, passing the sparring duet and was up in the final strides. ELLE OF THE BALL tracked the pace while three wide, then inched up on the turn
to duel with an inner rival entering the stretch, was under a gamely rally and was able to get up for the place prize in the end. ACCELERATE JUDY dueled
with an inner rival down the backstretch, then gained the lead briefly at the top of the turn, then was met with an outer rival entering the stretch to spar for
the lead down the lane, was surpassed by an outer rival and just missed the place prize in the end. RECLUSIVE was unhurried early, then bid mildly leaving
the bend and into the stretch from the two path and was gaining ground but it was not enough in the end. MARIAH'S CANDY dueled from the inside down
the late backstretch and into the turn under a strong drive, was used up and gave way in the late stretch. EAGLE EXPRESS raced towards the back of the
field, then urged on the turn from the four path to gain third position then gave way in the late stretch. BLUSHING BELLE tracked the pace from the two path
down the backstretch then faded on the turn and had no final bid.

Footnotes
STRIKE THE BELL stalked the pace under a steady hand ride into the first turn and down the backstretch, held the place position throughout the far turn
before being met with two hungry rivals on the outside in the early stretch, tussled grudgingly while brushing outside foe at the eighth maker, but kept on and
just had more in the end to be up at the wire. MADE AN OFFER tracked the pace while two wide in the early furlongs, then menaced leaving the far turn to
battle between rivals down the lane, brushed STRIKE THE BELL on the inside but continued gamely and just missed by a neck in the end and was second
best. PRONUNCIATION chased the pace from the two path in the middle of the pack, then advanced on the far turn to vie with inner rivals down the
homestretch and missed in the end and was best for the show prize. MIDSHIPMAN'S LADY led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the
backstretch, cleared the far turn then was met with outer rivals in the home stretch, then gave way grudgingly. COMMANDEERESS settled along the rail
throughout the first half and into the far turn, then rallied in the upper stretch but it was too little too late. PROSSIMO was shuffled back at the start then
chased the pace from the inside in the middle of the pack, came out four wide leaving the far turn to bid in the stretch and came up empty. MAGENS BAY
tracked the pace from the inside, then bid briefly leaving the far turn then stopped while drifting out in the late stretch. FLAT OUT FANCY broke outwardly at
the start, settled in the two path at the pack of the pack and was no menace. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference between
STRIKE THE BELL and MADE AN OFFER in the home stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish.

drive proving best in the end. PRAYFORPEACE saved ground in the early furlongs, then moved up on the turn from the four path and closed well in the late
stretch and was up for the place prize. DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL chased the pace while two wide, then rallied leaving the turn, gained second position then

Footnotes
ILLUSTRATOR reserved momentum in the early furlongs, then steadily gained ground entering the far bend, angled out to the three path in the early stretch
to edge clear in the final yards and prevail in the end. COASTAL BRINK broke inwardly at the start, then saved ground while racing behind the field, moved
out of last position from the inside on the far turn, drifted out four to five wide in the early stretch then closed willingly and was up for the place prize.
DEVIL'S MISCHIEF set the pace from the inside heading into the first turn and down the backstretch, was under a steady drive throughout the far turn then
was challenged by an inner rival heading in the early stretch to duke it out before being surpassed by ILLUSTRATOR on the outside and was best for third
place winnings. DARYLS TRUMP CARD tracked the pace from the inside, then inched up leaving the backstretch to gain second position on the far turn,
dueled with an outer rival in the upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. VICTORY FOR VETS raced towards the back of the pack while two wide
down the backstretch, then came out six wide leaving the far turn and needed more in the end. DO YOUR JOB stalked outside of the pace setter down the
early backstretch, then slowly lost ground throughout the far turn and had no final bid in the end. JUDGE MCBEE raced in the middle of the pack while three
wide down the backstretch, continued to bid at a moderate pace throughout the turn and needed rally in the end. SPECIAL MEMORY was rank throughout
the first turn, then settled while two wide down the backstretch and lacked rally.
