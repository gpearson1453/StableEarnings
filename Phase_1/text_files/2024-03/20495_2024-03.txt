Footnotes
RED HOT POWER broke outward in front, set all the pace and widened through the stretch while full of run, to win as much the best. ANIMO ROBERTO
was shut off at the start, closed determinedly in the four path through the stretch and finished clear for second. OHIO STRONG broke inward, chased, the
winner two then three wide and was outfinished. HEIDI'S SINATRA slow early, swung wide and found his best stride late in the middle of the racetrack.
TAMMY'S TOY had good early speed two wide then along the inside, dropped back on the turn then came on again late in the five path. ORLEANS STORM
had good early speed along the inside the lacked the needed response. THANKSDAD had brief speed. NOSEY POWER was no threat.

was along in time. BANK BUSTER away alertly, set the pace until late stretch, drifted out and just held on for second. NEAR PERFECT forwardly placed
near the inside, improved position two wide into the stretch, drifted out to the six path under a hand ride nearing the sixteenth pole and just missed getting
up for second. SHAOLIN trailed for nearly a half, closed ground three then four wide into the stretch while outside rivals, checked when NEAR PERFECT
drifted out near the sixteenth pole and lost momentum. LEMON MOUSSE offered a mild bid along the inside before a half then came up empty. SCOOP
THERE IT IS close up outside, was through after a half. THE RIDER OF SHAOLIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF NEAR
PERFECT FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NEAR PERFECT AND PLACED HER

Footnotes
C V DYNAMIC for the lead two wide then entire trip, was well handled while lugging in through the stretch, surged under left handed urging and proved best
while fully extended. SWAYBACK MOBIL unhurried early, found his best stride late three wide. GHOST OF LONDYN battled for the early lead along the
inside, dropped back while in a bit tight midway on the turn, came on again along the rail into the stretch, checked while in tight again through mid stretch
and finished with good courage. OLLIE'S FOLLY bore out at the start, prompted the pace three wide into the stretch then faded. ROLL ON MAX was
squeezed at the start and no factor. DRILIN' FOR GEMS vied for the early lead four wide and was through after a half. EQUITY CAT was outrun.
CATCHING MY WIND broke inward then offered little. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
