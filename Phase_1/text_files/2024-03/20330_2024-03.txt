Footnotes
MARY MARGARET broke out just a bit, stalked the pace from outside, moved five wide on the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch with aim, was kept
busy and edged past late. WORK N FLIRT was carried out a bit in the early going, shifted in heading to the turn, bid inside on that bend taking the lead by
the top of the stretch while drifting out, was in command but outkicked. SUPER ANNIE was forced out in the early going, raced at the rear outside, swung
eight deep for the stretch run, had good late effort to secure show honors. POETIC PURSUIT got away well, pressed into the turn racing three to four wide,
weakened. ROSES FOR SUZZETT was in tight between early then altered in, saved ground near the rail, failed to rally. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES moved
through inside to the lead but while moving out off the rail in the process, set the pace from off the rail, came up empty.

Footnotes
RUBY RAY attended the pace from inside the leader but off the rail, was given some mild encouragement three furlongs out drawing even with that rival at
the five-sixteenths, was in command turning for home, forged clear in upper stretch, lugged out but held sway. BANGIE GO had the early lead outside the
eventual winner going three to four wide on the turn and a bit wider into upper stretch, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. DORITA'S
HAPPY was outpaced in the early going racing three wide into the turn, gradually shifted out leaving that bend coming eight wide into upper stretch, kept on
late to improve. AMARETTO DI AMORE chased from inside on or just off the rail, was never a threat. STAY QUIET chased from outside at the rear, went
four to five wide on the turn, went evenly and did not threaten. GODDESS OF WAR bobbled just slightly at the start, chased at the back going about two
then three wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TENTH STREET DON advanced outside five to six wide on the turn, struck the lead by upper stretch while drifting in, cleared. BUGLER advanced between
runners up the backstretch to a narrow lead, contested the pace dueling inside a foe but off the fence through the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home, was
outkicked. ECHO CANYON broke just a step slowly, raced at the rear off the inside, angled out nine wide in upper stretch and ran on. STABILITY chased
from inside on or just off the rail, failed to menace. ECONOMICAL had the early lead then vied outside through the turn, weakened in upper stretch.
THIRSTY JOHN chased from off the pace, ridden along by the half, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. PRECEDENT was off the pace about
four wide into the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch, was not a factor.

SINGLE LADY was a hair keen in the early going tracking the leader in behind from the two to three path and under a hold, cut the corner turning for home,
bid inside the pacesetter taking the lead in mid-stretch, met the bid of another foe a sixteenth out and held that one gamely. STREET SHADOW hopped
ever so slightly at the start, settled toward the back inside, swung four wide into the stretch, gained steadily making a bid at the sixteenth pole but was
fended off. SILENT GUROO quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail, weakened inside the final furlong. FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) stalked up
close from outside three to four wide, failed to rally. DADDY'S GIRL raced outside at the rear and was never near enough to threaten.

SAILING ALONG settled off the pace, fanned ten wide into the stretch, surged late to get up. ALBERTA SUN stalked early then edged nearer to press the
leader into the turn, floated seven wide turning for home and with the lead, edged clear in mid- to late-stretch but was outfinished. UNRIVALED QUEEN
made an early advance heading into the turn from the outside, was six wide past the quarter pole, drifted ten wide in upper stretch, lugged in a bit in
mid-stretch and kept on well but needed more. BLESSED ANGEL tracked behind the leaders racing up close, was encouraged along a bit past the
three-eighths, made a mild bid in mid-stretch but flattened out. SHE'S RESILIENT broke out a bit, set the tempo from off the rail, was challenged on the turn
and overtaken drifting five wide into upper stretch, came up empty. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY dropped back racing off the inside and never rallied.

Footnotes
LEFT THE BAR quickly moved clear, dictated terms from off the rail, was clear into the stretch, lasted. PERFORMATIVE was strongly ridden, chased, three
to four wide, kept on strongly but was too little too late. FIGHT ME bobbled slightly at the start, settled into stride, shifted seven wide at the top of the stretch,
kept on while no threat to the top pair. LIL LATIGO was reluctant to load, chased the pace four to five wide, weakened. A LATE ONE was hard to load, had
an awkward break and beginning, was caught five wide into the turn, fanned eight wide, kicked on mildly. DAD BOD chased two to three wide, needed
more. LIMITED OFFER chased from inside on or just off the rail, came up empty.

Footnotes
PRINCESS JAYLEEN chased from outside, moved out advancing on the leaders six wide coming past the quarter pole, was guided out further at the top of
the stretch for room, struck the lead a sixteenth out and surged clear. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE stalked up close just off and outside, went four wide making
a bid near the quarter pole, was turned away by the leader in upper stretch but kept on late to re-engage and get up for second while outkicked by an
outside foe for the top prize. LUCY TREASURE was quick to the lead, set the pace from off the rail facing outside pressure, turned away the nearest
challenger in upper stretch but had to contend with that one and another foe later, could not kick on with the top one and yielded grudgingly for the place.
LATER DAYS chased from inside, moved out on the turn, raced into upper stretch seven deep and came again to finish strongly but too late. MAYCEE JO
bumped a rival at the start, was caught wide mid-pack into the turn going five to six wide, floated eight deep for the drive, ran on with mild interest. THREAD
COUNT was bumped lightly at the start, raced up close chasing three wide into and on the turn, paused just briefly near the quarter pole and moved out,
needed more. ELDORADO DREAM bumped a rival lightly at the start, raced near the rail but was one-paced. MAMALONA chased in behind going about
three wide on the turn, weakened. WHERE'S FRANKIE was bumped into a rival at the start then exchanged another bump with that one and steadied
sharply, raced toward the back off the inside, angled nine wide at the top of the stretch, failed to menace. FEEL FREE was bumped a couple times at the
start steadying slightly and not a threat. JADED TIGER broke a step slowly and was never a threat. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THREAD COUNT
AGAINST GHOST OF GENEVIEVE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
