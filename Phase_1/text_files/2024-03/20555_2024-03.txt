PAPER MANSION raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside the first time by and around the second bend, led on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path, kicked clear in the lane and held off a late closer to the wire. ARIANA VALENTINA saved ground
early, trailed the field through the opening mile, navigated the final bend from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late.
EXCEPT TEMPTATION saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside from there, began to move up while saving ground around the
final turn and kept on in the lane. INANNA'S QUEST saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside the first time down the stretch, continued to
save ground around the second bend, swung out to the three path coming around the last turn and weakened in the lane. NOTHINGMAKESENSE raced off
the pace on the outside through the opening mile, swung out to the four path coming around the third turn and made no bid. UNWHIRLED raced in the three
pay early, chased the leader the first time down the homestretch, saved ground around the second turn, dropped back while racing in the four path around

to get up for the win late. WAIT A SEC bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
two path and battled gamely to the wire to just miss. CALENDULA chased the leader on the rail through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend
and kept on to the wire. RUBYSA raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position in the stretch.
SERENADE A KITTEN bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to track the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the
bend in the three path and then weakened from there. SHALL RETURN trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and
never threatened. EAST WING bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled on the rail through the opening stages, saved ground around
the turn and tired in the lane. KENYA SUN bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out

weakened in the lane. DENYING raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening mile, came around the final bend in the four path and
never threatened. LORD OF THE NILE was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for
the next mile, continued around the far bend in the two path and made no bid. DIAL HIM UP saved ground at the back of the pack throughout and was
never a factor.
