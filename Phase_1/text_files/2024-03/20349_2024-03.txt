Footnotes
FORT CHARLES bumped with EXCLUSIVE DANCER at the start, prompted the pace four and three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker,
continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off while being ridden out. BLAZING TYREEK pressed the pace inside, took the lead nearing the half-mile
pole, vied inside of the winner around the turn and was clearly second best in the lane. EXCLUSIVE DANCER bumped at the start, raced two wide and was
along for the show. TORREFACTOR failed to menace while racing two wide. MAX FORWARD SPEED chased the pace inside and came up empty in the
lane. BOLKIN broke through the starting gate but never escaped the assistant starter's grasp, set the early pace in the two path and retreated around the
turn. UZZIAH played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
CHRISTENSEN chased in the two path, was ridden into the turn, swung out to the five path turning into the lane, and kicked past an inner foe just before the
sixteenth to win going away. SOUPER SUNSHINE stalked inside, was roused passing the three-eighths, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch,
and ran on for place. DON'T ANSWER rated inside, was ridden in the three path around the turn, got herded outward in the final furlong, but rallied to be up
for show. GRAND BEY got fractious in the gate, raced wellback in the two path, was driven along the rail around the turn, but drifted out in the final furlong,
and evened out late. GRAN ROQUE set an open pace in the two path, was roused turning into the stretch, hung on his left lead, and yielded inside the final
furlong. MIDNIGHT CHAOS tracked in the three path, was cued passing the three-eighths, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but flattened.
TEJOTA trailed in the three path, was coaxed along in the four path rounding the turn, but never threatened. PEACH NECTAR was prompted along from up
close in the two path, but got carried out to the six path just after the quarter, and weakened in the stretch. JOYFUL SURPRISE raced off the pace in the
four path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but failed to menace.

CHAPLIN set the pace along the rail and edged clear under a drive. READIER broke in and bumped at the start, pressed the winner two wide, was unable
to reel that foe in but held safe for the place. SECRET THREAT was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide
nearing the eighth pole and ran on for the show. DEVILMENT was bumped at the start, saved ground in range, angled three wide in upper stretch and was
one-paced through the lane. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
PROVERB bumped with an outer foe at the start, pressed the pace in the five path, took a narrow lead while in the three path early into the turn, was cued
approaching the quarter, floated back out to the five path in upper stretch, and drew clear. DOUBLE PLAY KING laid in range in the four path, was coaxed
in the two path passing the three-eighths, and kept on for place. URANIUM trailed in the four path, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, fanned
out to the nine path entering the stretch, and passed tired foes for show. STORM BRAVE bumped with an inner foe at the start, moved up outside of foes
from the seven path to stalk the pace before merging to the four path entering the turn, tipped back out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but flattened.
STAR SIGN raced off the pace in the five path, was driven in the three path around the turn, but never threatened. CAJUN BROTHER bumped with an inner
foe at the start, set the pace in the three path, but lost the lead along the rail early around the turn, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and faded.
VIKRAM hopped at the start and bumped with an outer foe, chased in the six path and never menaced from the eight path in the stretch. COBBLE ROAD
tracked in the two path but backed up around the turn.

GOODBETTERBEST set the pace in the two path, was roused while just off the rail midway around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held
sway. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) stalked in the three path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and chased
on for place. HITS DIFFERENT rated in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, angled out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show.
KANTBACKOFF tracked in the three path, was cued early around the far turn, tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly.
DUBSTEP had a slow start, trailed in the three path, fanned out to the nine path under a drive turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. I BELIEVE IN
MAGIC laid in range along the inside down the backstretch but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ART set the pace in the two path and held firm between challengers in the lane. GILDED AGE settled off the early pace two wide, advanced four
wide around the far turn, rallied outside but could not quite get to the winner. SURROGATE prompted the winner in the three path and was one-paced
through the lane for the show. DON'T LET ME DOWN stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out a bit late.
EXULT saved ground off the pace, edged closer three wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. MEDIA SENSATION chased the pace
two wide and lacked a closing bid. MIDWAY MISCHIEF exchanged bumps with FLATTER ME the first time through the stretch, saved ground and never
threatened. FLATTER ME exchanged bumps the first time through the stretch, saved ground around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and
never menace.

Footnotes
GUNESH tracked in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the turn but got stymied passing the quarter, angled out to the six path
entering the stretch, had to alter further out passing the eighth pole, and rallied to get up in the closing stages. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU stalked in the four
path, loomed three wide around the turn, took the lead while floating out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on, but was caught late by an outer foe
to place. COUSIN KRISTI bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace under a hold in the three path, bid two wide rounding the turn, and kept
on from the four path down the lane for show. AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace inside, was cued early around the turn, but faded in the stretch. OLGA
bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off the pace in the four path but never threatened. SOPHIA'S STORM rated in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
ROSCOE VILLAGE settled off the runaway pacesetter in the clear in the two path, cruised up in the three path around the far turn, seized command nearing
the quarter pole and quickly cleared. CARRINGTON saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch, lugged in in midstretch, tipped back out, rallied
between foes and was just up for the place. REFUGIADA raced off the pace two wide, moved up two wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner,
battled inside of foes late for the place and just missed. LADY CHA CHA raced off the pace two and three wide, rallied outside and just missed second.
SADIE THE GOAT failed to menace while racing three wide. BEIRA played no factor while racing three and four wide. SPECIAL AFFAIR raced off the pace
two and three wide, was forced in nearing the eighth pole and retreated. SKINNY COSMO sprinted clear in the two path and faltered after six furlongs.
