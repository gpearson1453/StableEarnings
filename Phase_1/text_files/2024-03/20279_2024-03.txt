Footnotes
YOU'RE FOREVER broke out then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch and just held under strong urging. CRACKLIN CAT broke awkwardly and a step behind
the first two opponents to leave at the gate, was urged early then well placed just off the pace, climbed some into the kickback near the nine-sixteenths, was
roused near the half-mile pole, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final
sixteenth, gained on that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. NATURAL FACT stood in the gate and was off very slow, spotted the front many
lengths, was urged along while well behind the rest of the field, shifted from the two path to the four path early on the turn, gained late on that bend, came
five wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable striking position into the final furlong, lugged in significantly in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and flattened
out while clear for the show. NAY SLAYER was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was asked while along the rail on the turn,
lost the lead to the winner outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. CLASSIC CARA broke a step behind the first two
opponents to leave the gate, was urged along on the outside, moved from the three path to the rail while dropping back on the turn and failed to respond.

RESERVE CURRENCY chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying in tandem with the runner up to flank the leader inside the eighth pole and was just up in the last jump to prevail. MAGIA NERA chased along the
inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying inside the
leader to seize narrow and brief command seventy yards from home, then got nailed on the wire. COLLECT FROM IKE traded a bump at the start with
PETROLO, dueled early on along the inside before establishing sole command while under pressure from that same rival to the outside, remained patiently
handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch having shaken away a bit, dug in between foes under challenge from flanking rivals inside the
eighth pole, got collared seventy yards from the finish while well clear of the rest for the show honors. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, WANNA
WINNA chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, got paused when off the heels of the
drifting out PETROLO with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the late stages. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS chased just off the inside down the backstretch
and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PETROLO
traded a bump at the start with COLLECT FROM IKE, dueled early on three then two wide with that rival to the inside, got shaken off a bit and prompted the
pace from the two path coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and drifted an additional path straightened
away forcing WANNA WINNA to pause in behind, then weakened through to the finish.

COMPLETE AGENDA was taken up briefly while in tight after the start, raced under urging early then settled well off the pace, went three wide under
encouragement on the turn, rallied in the final furlong, gained under extra right-rein pressure into the final sixteenth and closed fast to get up and prevail.
UNION LIGHTS settled on the far outside, was roused four wide on the turn, chased the leading duo into the final furlong, gained the advantage into the
final sixteenth but was denied while just able to get the place. DISAPPEARANCE was urged along well off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch, remained on his left lead while on the far outside until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, rallied outside to
make a bid late and just missed while narrowly able to get the show. STOP THE SPREAD came inward at the start then was corrected by the rider and
hustled, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside under extra left-rein pressure into the final furlong, fought on well to the finish and just missed the trifecta. PREDICTED
went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, was asked under threat in the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths,
battled on well in the stretch but missed. MILANO settled off the pace, moved closer outside the five-eighths pole, was urged along in the two path on the
turn, pursued the vanguard in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. FLASH KISS broke out and bumped with an opponent, settled in a good position,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. STRONG LIGHT was bumped at the start and off a bit slow, dropped
well behind the rest of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

BEST BET established the front shortly after the start and showed the way rated on the pace three then two wide, got roused spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. ICE ROAD hustled from the start, chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the
place honors. UNCLE WATER FLOW chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on
to secure the show honors. PAPI ON ICE chased seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SCOTTO chased three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths and weakened in the stretch. HONED chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the
turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

MARKET ALERT chased early while hustled from the gate, was taken in hand when the pacesetter crossed in front outside the five-eighths pole, raced just
off the pace from that juncture, drafted inside to the two path under snug restraint on the turn, was asked while finding clear room at the quarter-pole, rallied
inside of foes to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and determinedly prevailed under strong urging. AMUNDSON chased the early pace, bumped with a
foe and was taken in hand outside the five-eighths pole, went three then four wide on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths pole, took a short lead
at the quarter-pole, came in and bumped with a rival near the furlong marker, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the
place. BRONX BOMBER chased the early pace, was taken in hand off heels when the pacesetter crossed in front outside the five-eighths pole, dropped
back in the two path leaving the backstretch, shifted four then five wide before the three-eighths pole, circled to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled
outside of foes into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. WARRIORS REVENGE bumped with
an opponent outside the five-eighths pole, moved up to press the leader on the outside, dropped from the four path to the three path early on the turn,
passed the five-sixteenths pole on even terms for the lead, was bumped while dropping back into the final furlong and tired. TOMMY GUN was hustled from
the gate, angled in while going to the front, crossed in front of the other rivals outside the five-eighths pole, was asked under threat while inside on the turn,
lost the advantage near the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
IN A MINUTE showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to be near the inside through the turn, remained
patiently handled taking the inside route into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held
well and safe to prevail. JANSSEN five wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in willingly at the end. SOLO TONIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased
four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors.
HAIR ON FIRE coaxed from the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SEBA M got bumped at the start by TRIPLE WORD SCORE and then
ricocheted off FINANCIER bumping TRIPLE WORD SCORE back when pinched out at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outfinished in the late stages. DIANNESRETIRING chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. TRIPLE WORD SCORE broke in at the start bumping SEBA M into FINANCIER, then got bumped and squeezed out when that middle
rival bounced off FINANCIER, chased five paths off the inside until tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. BIG HUTCHY chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. FINANCIER got bumped at the start by SEBA M due to pressure from TRIPLE WORD SCORE
breaking inwards and bumped that foe back outwards when under coaxing, chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, tipped four wide
into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. MONTAUK SURF veered in at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home and trailed throughout.
