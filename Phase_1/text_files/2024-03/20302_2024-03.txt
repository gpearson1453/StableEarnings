LET'S DO THIS set a pressured pace and contested the edge off the rail on the turn, dug in under steady urging leaving the turn and held off SCARLET
REBEL, who pressured the pace inside, raced close at the rail on the turn and remained a factor to deep stretch before flattening stride.
JACKYSINTHECASTLE gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. PATTI BLUE EYES lunged leaving the gate, picked up the
chase leaving the chute, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little more. TINA'S SONG dropped well back early.

CASSIUS was bumped leaving the gate then stalked off the rail the first turn, pulled himself to the front approaching the five sixteenths pole, widened at the
rail on the far turn and further extended his lead to win handily. ASPENDOS rated the early pace inside, was met nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave
chase from that point but proved no match and had to settle for second best. TAPPEDWITHSUCCESS was bumped inward and into Cassius leaving the
gate then rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane.
MANSION PARTY lugged in early and made contact with Tappedwithsuccess, raced in the three path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three

leaving the far turn and earned the nod in the final strides. SKYLAR'S SISTER exchanged contact with BRIGHT MOON leaving the gate then stalked two
deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep approaching the quarter, was met at the rail entering the stretch and dug in gamely
from that point, but relented the edge in the final strides. The latter exchanged contact with Skylar's Sister leaving the gate then settled in the three path the
first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths and cleared third
mid-stretch. PUSH rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met approaching the quarter, dropped back at the rail
midway on the far turn and weakened. LA CORONA saved ground.

TRITONE GAL took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and
was steadily handled in the stretch. GILDED QUEST saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved
from that point, raced in the three path on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. JOYA DEL SUR stalked three wide on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. TOUGH ENOUGH stalked two
deep the first turn, chased approaching the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. SAVE THE FLAG raced off the rail the opening turn then eased out
past the half mile pole and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths, came through the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed
little further. SNEAKY LYNK rated off the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. LIVE AID settled in the

JUDGEMENT DAY took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested even terms
nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold on. MR. DUMBLEDORE settled off the rail the first turn then eased out and gave chase into
the backstretch, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn and stayed on gamely through the stretch.
LIEUTENANT BROWN rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and just lasted
for third. O'RIGSBY rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, ran
evenly through the lane and just missed third. HARPERSGONEFISHING stalked off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch but faded leaving the three

Footnotes
HERE COMES RUSTY raced in the four path the opening turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path,
dug in to meet MACHISTO in later yards and eked out the nod over that one the final yards. The latter raced off the pace about the four path, started a bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead toward the five sixteenths and raced clear into the far turn, widened at the rail and dug in from the head of
the lane but was met in later yards and ceded the nod nearing the wire. DOWSING ROD raced off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, drifted to the outside entering the stretch and finished evenly. RUM CUP dwelled at the
break and never factored. EAST TO BEAST stalked off the rail on the first turn, moved to even terms past the half mile pole and had the nod toward the
three eighths, but was met approaching the five sixteenths pole and faded at the rail. TIZAWINNER raced well back off the rail the first turn, showed little
response through the backstretch, collided with ALLIGATOR ARMS and lost his rider after that one bounced off the rail past the five sixteenths pole and
started to collapse while bearing out. The latter came away sharply and rated the pace inside, was met past the half mile pole and gave chase toward the
three eighths, appeared off stride and bounced into the rail past the five sixteenths pole, bore out into the far turn, collided with Tizawinner and collapsed.
The Stewards posted the inquiry before declaring this race official.
