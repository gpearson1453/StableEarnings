Footnotes
GIANT KID took back off of the early pace, well placed into the turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, went widest into the stretch
and loomed nearing the furlong marker, confronted ALONG CAME JOANN past mid-stretch and battled with the stubborn runner-up into the final sixteenth,
took a narrow lead in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. ALONG CAME JOANN prominent away from the start, stalked the early
pace from a three wide position, pressed the pace into the turn and took command while three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, led into upper stretch
and was confronted past the furlong marker, met the bid of GIANT KID into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for
second. SWEET LAKER bumped at the start, was off a step slowly and recovered to settle just off of the early pace, saved ground into the turn and was well
placed at the quarter pole, ran evenly while within aim approaching mid-stretch, angled out at the furlong marker, was green into the final sixteenth, could
not impact the top pair in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. ROSE OF MOONCOIN assumed a narrow early lead, set moderate fractions
while pressured into the turn, set the pace while a bit off of the rail nearing the quarter marker, lost the lead approaching the top of the stretch, battled into
upper stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. ADJUST THE HEAT pressed the decent pace between
runners, disputed the pace between rivals and two to three wide along the turn, was shuffled back a bit nearing the quarter marker and lost position into the
stretch, lacked a response in the final furlong and gave way. SOUTHERN BLESSING lacked early speed and did not factor.

Footnotes
MOVIETIME forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked
the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, raced outside of rivals into the far turn and was asked for run three to four wide nearing the quarter
marker, loomed into the stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, made a quick move and took command past mid-stretch, was kept to task
into the final sixteenth and held in a drive to prevail. BALLROOM PRINCE crowded a bit leaving the start, recovered and was forwardly placed heading into
the first turn, stalked the early pace from a ground saving position into the backstretch run, attended to the moderate pace nearing the half-mile marker then
went up to contest the pace entering the second turn, took a narrow lead nearing the quarter marker and was set down into upper stretch, met the bid of
MOVIETIME nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch for place honors.
FANTASTIC DREAM broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed the way into the first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, was
confronted nearing the half-mile marker and set a pressured pace into the second turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter pole and chased two to three wide
into the stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while getting up in time to secure third. LOVE OF THE SPORT settled off of the
early pace and saved ground into the first turn, not far back through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the second turn then came in tight
nearing the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth and missed for third at
the finish. LORD OF LIGHT tracked the early pace from a two to three wide position, was well placed into the second turn, encountered traffic and waited
behind runners nearing the quarter marker, shifted out into upper stretch and found room nearing the furlong marker, improved position at mid-stretch and
was outfinished in the final stages. WINTER SOLDIER allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run, mounted a four to five wide rally at the
quarter marker, went widest into the stretch, could not sustain his run into the final furlong and flattened out late.

Footnotes
MACLEAN'S RHYME assumed early command, set a prompted pace into the backstretch run, contested the modest pace with COPPERTUNITY
approaching the half-mile pole, disputed the lead with that rival into the far turn and held a narrow advantage at the quarter marker, battled into the stretch
with COPPERTUNITY and held a short lead at the furlong pole, dueled into the final sixteenth, lost the lead in deep stretch, came again in the final strides
and determinedly prevailed at the finish. COPPERTUNITY away in good order, was prominent in the early stages and attended to the pace three wide into
the first turn, contested the moderate pace into the backstretch run and took a narrow lead at the half-mile pole, battled with MACLEAN'S RHYME into the
second turn and dueled with that rival into upper stretch, fought gamely into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch, hung in the final strides
and was nailed on the wire for the win, while holding safely in the end for second. UPRIGHT broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the pace two
wide into the first turn, was well positioned into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace from between runners nearing the half-mile pole, chased
two to three wide into the second turn, raced a bit in tight at the quarter marker and shifted out for the stretch drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed into the
final sixteenth, could not catch the top pair in deep stretch and held for third at the finish. REEF CITY never far back in the early running, saved ground into
the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained an inside
path into the stretch and made a sustained run into the final furlong, could not muster the needed late response and was outkicked in deep stretch.
CANTILEVER settled off of the early pace while not far back, maintained an outside position along the first turn and raced three to four wide into the
backstretch run, made a middle move and came within range of the lead approaching the half-mile pole, chased three to four wide into the far turn, lost
position into the stretch and tired in the final stages. CALLUM allowed to settle, went three wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch
run, saved ground into the far turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke sharply, sprinted clear and opened up on the field approaching the half-mile marker, repelled a bid by PRETTY THIRSTY
near the quarter pole while still in hand, was set down near the three-sixteenths pole, sprinted clear under strong handling and won well. PRETTY THIRSTY
was pushed on from the gate then pulled into a stalking position behind REDSTWIRLINGDANCER, inched closer two wide through the turn under a hand
ride, bid in earnest near the quarter pole but was rebuffed but finished well to hold clear for second. WESTWARD BREEZE took up a few jumps out of the
gate when A ROUSING BABE came over, lost some momentum and was last in the early going. started to make some forward progress from the half mile
pole saving ground on the rail, responded to steady handling in the stretch and improved to grab the third spot. A ROUSING BABE took a bump from
SUPERSONIC FLYER at the start and was forced into the adjacent runner, took up and spotted the field a bit of a head start, advanced steadily down the
backstretch then regained contact with the tracking group just past the half-mile pole, became boxed in approaching the stretch, tipped out about four wide
into the stretch, responded to steady handling but flattened out late. SUPERSONIC FLYER broke out at the start then bumped A ROUSING BABE, forcing
that rival into WESTWARD BREEZE, rushed up to put some pressure on REDSTWIRLINGDANCER in the initial furlong then, took up near the
nine-sixteenths pole and again a half-furlong forward, tried to re-rally through the turn but was unable find another gear when needed and finished evenly.
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN broke well but could not keep up with the early pace, and was at the back of the pack passing the half-mile pole, came under a ride
with three furlongs to go, produced a mild rally in the stretch but was never a threat. TRULY FABULOUS broke a beat slow but set out immediately to join
the early fray, chased four wide to the turn, launched a bid from the three furlong pole and advanced on the leader to outside of PRETTY THIRSTY, came
under a ride and lost ground to that foe before the quarter pole then faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
SATANTA unhurried in the early going, trailed into the turn and raced two wide to the quarter marker, was roused five to six wide into the stretch, was full of
run while widest at the the furlong marker, inhaled foes past mid-stretch and took command into the final sixteenth, drew clear into deep stretch and was
hand urged to the finish. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the dueling pacesetters approaching the half-mile marker,
chased two to three wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, asked for run into upper stretch, loomed nearing the furlong marker and took
command past mid-stretch, was collared by the winner into the final sixteenth and held safely for place honors. ALTRUIST off a step slow to begin, tracked
the solid early pace from the second flight, improved position into the turn and raced three to four wide to the quarter marker, rallied into the stretch, was
outkicked into the final sixteenth and held well for third. GRAZEN SUN rated off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn, shifted two wide for the
drive and gained ground at the furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. THUNDER OF ZION hard sent away from the start,
engaged with BOSS OF THEMOSS in the early going and contested the solid pace with that runner heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the turn and
disputed fast fractions approaching the quarter pole, battled with BOSS OF THEMOSS into the stretch, was overtaken past the furlong marker and faded in
the final sixteenth. BOSS OF THEMOSS showed good speed away from the start, engaged with THUNDER OF ZION in the early stages and disputed the
solid pace with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the turn and contested quick fractions approaching the quarter pole, battled into the
stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch. GONNA GETCHA GOOD chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost
position at the quarter marker and shifted two wide into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABU DHABI broke alertly, took back off of the decent early pace and tracked from the outside approaching the half-mile marker, well placed into
the turn and improved position three wide nearing the quarter pole, roused into the stretch, vied for the lead four wide at the furlong marker, took command
past mid-stretch and led into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held on for the win at the finish. ZEUS' WAR rated off of the early
pace while never far back, tracked two wide into the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter marker, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and loomed
approaching the furlong pole, finished well into the final sixteenth, just missed for the win at the wire and was second best. PROOF HE RIDES close up to
the solid early pace, stalked three wide nearing the half-mile marker and was well placed entering the turn, contested the solid pace two wide approaching
the quarter marker, gained command into upper stretch and held a narrow lead at the furlong grounds, overtaken past mid-stretch, was outkicked into the
final sixteenth and held clear for third at the finish. SIR GREYSON sent away from the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace nearing the
half-mile marker, went two wide into the turn and carved out solid fractions while pressed to the quarter pole, battled into upper stretch, lost position at the
furlong pole and weakened in the final sixteenth. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the turn, swung five wide for
the stretch drive and offered a mild late rally. PEACEFUL WATERS hustled away from the start, pressed the decent early pace inside of SIR GREYSON,
lost position into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GALLANT WARREN content to trail early, stayed in the clear down the backstretch while making steady progress to regain contact with the pack, waited
patiently behind horses through the turn then swung four wide into the stretch, responded to an aggressive hand ride down the stretch, battled with
WALKING BOSS to the wire, gained a slight advantage in the final yards and held on. WALKING BOSS unhurried from the start, was content to trail the
field to the far turn, quickened on cue after passing the three furlong marker, made a five wide sweeping move to get into contention then five to six wide
into the stretch, finished willingly under steady handling while battling with GALLANT WARREN to the wire but came up just short while drifting out a bit in
the final yards. CARSON'S LEGACY raced in the middle of the field through the early stages, attempted to launch a rally from the five sixteenths marker but
had to wait for room, split horses turning into the stretch, took a brief lead to the furlong grounds but was outfinished in the late stages by the top pair.
TWIRLING DERBY broke well and got good inside position into the first bend, moved a little closer passing the half mile pole then became stuck behind
horses in the far turn, did not get clear until mid-stretch, finished with some interest but was not enough. LOOKOUT POINT settled along the rail after the
start and allowed the pace scenario to play out up front, raced near the rear of the field to the half, went into a drive from the three furlong pole, idled a bit
behind horses through the turn, found best stride in the final furlong but was along too late. LOLO PANIOLO was quickly to the front but ceded the lead to
JEDI KNIGHT, checked slightly off heels going into the first turn when that foe cut over a little too soon, shifted out a path then pulled forward to press that
rival on the outside while under some restraint, continued to pull hard while pressing the pace going into the far turn, pulled even at the five-sixteenths, got a
neck in front turning for home but was beset by a host of challengers and weakened in mid-stretch. OH GREAT (IRE) got floated very wide going into the
first turn then circled the field to get up with the leading group for the run down the backstretch, stalked the two pacesetters to the far turn still racing very
wide, got closer on the far turn and loomed a threat with three furlongs to go but did not go on when asked. JEDI KNIGHT was hustled from the gate and
gained the early advantage, was left to set the pace but felt some pressure from an eager LOLO PANIOLO to the outside, responded when asked to
quicken passing the three furlong pole then gave way readily at the top of the stretch and faded to last.
