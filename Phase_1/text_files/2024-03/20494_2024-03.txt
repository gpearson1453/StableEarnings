Footnotes
PASSIONFORTREASURE unhurried in the early going tracking the pace from four wide, made a steady advance on the far turn to engage the leader in
upper stretch and closed well to be clear at the wire. TIZ HERSELF stalked the pacesetters down the backside, idled in the turn when called upon losing
ground, angled to the clear down the lane and found best stride late to be gaining in deep stretch. AFERDITA prompted the pace to the far turn, took
command on the bend and could not hold on late in the drive. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL took the lead from the gate, set a well rated pace and lacked a
response when called upon. PRINCESS TENKO went one-paced never posing a threat. IRAZU trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
BINGO STAR stalked the pace to the turn, rallied four wide to take command in upper stretch and pulled clear to the wire convincingly. VINGATIVA
reserved off the pace into the turn, saved ground on the bend and closed belatedly up the fence in the lane. EILAT set a pressured pace to the turn, shook
free briefly on the turn, responded gamely when called upon and weakened late in the stretch. WHATS GOIN ON tracked the leaders through the turn from
the rail, made a threatening bid turning for home and failed to sustain the rally. WIN OR CELLAR slow early to trail, rallied on the turn and passed weakened
rivals in the lane. TOODALOO Y'ALL failed to menace. NICE BABY pressed the pace to midway on the turn, lacked a response when called upon and
faded in the stretch. DANCE STEP was not a threat. LIL ANNIE ROSE chased the pace early and flattened out on the turn.

Footnotes
CARTUCHO broke a step slow, settled into stride while unhurried early, rallied four wide on the turn to engage the leader in mid-stretch and drew away as
much best. LIKEBELIVINGNMAGIC pressed the pacee from between rivals through the turn, took command nearing the quarter pole, finished willingly to be
second best while no match for the winner. SALACIOUS set a pressured pace from the fence to midway on the turn, failed to respond when called upon and
finished evenly. SMOOTH PLAYER trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. FAITH'S SPIRIT tracked the leaders to the turn and had
no closing kick. INTO YOU stalked the pace from three wide into the turn, made a bid to loom at the top of the lane and flattened out in the drive.

THAT MAGIC MOMENT stalked the leaders on the turn, angled four wide to mount a rally, engaged the leade in mid stretch and prevailed in a determined
drive. IM STILL BRAVE reserved off the pace down the backside, rallied up the fence to the cut the corner turning for home, loomed from the inside in the
lane and was out-finished late. TESTA DURA settled early to be mid-pack, made a steady advance two wide into the turn, angled out through the lane and
kept grinding to be along for the show. HORSESHOE PATSY unhurried in the early going, swung eight wide turning for home and rallied mildly through the
lane. DOUBLE WARRIOR pressed the pace to midway on the turn, took the lead at the quarter pole and flattened out down the stretch. SEAX raced near
the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals through the stretch. HERCULES N LOVE went one-paced failing to mount a rally. GRAND FESTIVAL failed to
menace. CITY HUMOR showed speed to set a pressured pace and was through after a half mile. DASH TO FINISH contended for a half and faded.
SPEEDY PIEDY broke slow and trailed throughout.

KLICKITAT stalked the pace to midway on the far turn, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and prevailed in the drive from between
rivals. YOU MUST CHILL tracked the leaders from the fence through the final bend, cut the corner turning for home, angled out in the lane and closed well
to just miss. CANNON'S ROAR set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead, responded when challenged turning for home, dug-in gamely theough the lane
and was just out-finished. INITFORTHELOVE tracked the pace from four wide, loomed turning for home and kept-on down the stretch. MR. KRINGLE
unhurried early while well in hand, rallied turning for home under a steady seven wide advance and closed willingly. GRADED ON A CURVE well placed in
mid-pack along the fence and failed to mount a closing bid. FATIMA'S BLESSING raced well of the leaders to the top of the stretch and showed some mild
late interest. COLPO D'ORO raced mid-pack without impact. INDY LYON tracked leaders through the far turn and failed to respond when called upon. IN
HONOR OF ARTIE was not a threat. TOMMY BEE was not a factor. DAZZLING TRUTHS contended early chasing from the outside and dropped back to

CRYSTAL QUEST rated in mid-pack while well in hand, rallied on the far turn from five wide to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and prevailed in a
determined drive. PREVENT took command away from the gates, rated well on a clear lead through the first turn, widened the advantage down the
backside, was still clear at the head of the lane and responded well coming home and could not hold off the winner in a game effort. NINJA STAR reserved
off the pace near the rear of the field through the final turn and finished willingly up the fence. AND UWISH stalked the pace from the fence to the far turn,
rallied on the turn, angled out turning for home to loom boldly and was out-finished through the stretch. LORD KNOWS prompted the pace for three-quarters
and weakened coming home. LENA'S JAZZ trailed throughout and never posed a threat.

MISH prompted the pace to the turn, took command from two wide on the bend, opened a clear advantage quickly in upper stretch and was geared down
late. IF NOT FOR LUCK tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied four wide in a steady advance and finished willingly for the place. ZYDECEAUX set a
pressured pace to midway on the turn and kept on evenly coming home lacking a late response. DEAN DELIVERS slow early to trail the field, swung wide
turning for home and made up ground late without impact. THE DISTRACTOR raced along the fence off the pace down the backside, was checked leaving
the half mile pole, gathered together splitting rivals with an early bid into the turn and flattened out. BOUNCER chased the early pace and faded.

PURE CLASS rated off the pace behind a wall of rivals down the backside, rallied splitting horses three wide on the bend, angled to the clear and finished
well finding his best stride late. SUGAR BOY stalked the pace on the turn, rallied to engage the pacesetter midway dwon the lane to take the lead and was
out-finished in deep stretch. EVERDOIT reserved off the pace to the top of the lane and rallied well in the stretch to gain the show. SAYBROOK set a
pressured pace to the top of the lane while under an early drive on the bend, opened the advantage in upper stretch and weakened through the lane.
JIGSAW tracked the pace down the backside, mounted an early four wide rally on the turn to loom and flattened out in the drive. BANDED ROCKET passed
tiring rivals. SQUINTS was not a factor. SNOWNAME flashed brief speed to be on the early pace and came up empty.

CHARLIE'S WISH stalked the pace from the rail, saved ground in the turn, tipped out to run down the pacesetter and held the closer safe late. MOHAWK
TRAIL unhurried early to be the trailer, commenced a rally in the turn and closed with a belated rush down the lane. BABY STEPS set the pace on a clear,
comfortable lead, responded when called upon and weakened in deep stretch. SWEET DANI GIRL went evenly lacking a closing bid. PRETTYKEEN was
not a threat. TIME PASSAGE prompted the pace to the far turn and faded having bled.

Footnotes
GENERAL COMMAND rated off the early pace, commenced a steady rally on the turn to take the lead in mid-stretch and cleared off late in the lane.
SUNYANI stalked the pace while well palced three wide, made a bid in upper stretch to battle down the lane and was outkicked in deep stretch in a game
effort. CIRCLE THE MOON pressed the pace through the turn, took command at the head of the lane, dueled through the stretch and was out-finished.
WOW WISH settled off the early pace, was taken in hand down the backside to angle in off heels to save ground, made a steady rally three wide between
rivals on the turn, made a steady gain through the lane while angling to the rail through traffic to be gaining late. FIRST PLACE G chased the pace from the
rail in the turn and lacked a response when called upon. BAD HENRY went evenly without impact. JEST ABOVE broke alertly, was taken in hand to settle
off the leaders and failed to mount a rally. BLUE LIEUTENANT contended early to be prominent, was hard to handle in the turn attempting to get out the
entire time and leveled off coming home. DRUM AND DRUMMER showed brief speed and was through after a half. ACTION DREAM was not a factor.
POWERTRAIN failed to menace and tired through the stretch.
