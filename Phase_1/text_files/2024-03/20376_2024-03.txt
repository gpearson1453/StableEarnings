Footnotes
LOCKBOX was away alertly, showed the way while off the rail, went around the turn in the two path, was headed by the runner-up when that foe slipped up
the rail outside the quarter-pole, came out into upper stretch, dueled on even terms into the final sixteenth, fought outside the runner-up to the finish and
prevailed under steady urging. MAGGIE T was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came through a rail opening to make a bid near the
five-sixteenths pole, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, spun off the rail into upper stretch, dueled inside of the winner to the finish and missed while well
clear for the place. ROJA LIGERA was taken in hand when foes crossed in front early then settled off the rail, passed the half-mile pole under urging, went
around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SIMPLE SUGAR stalked the pace
on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead until the furlong
marker, came inward in the process, swapped to the proper lead just inside that marker and tired. DEVILLY was hustled from the gate then tracked the
pace, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, spun five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. LUNA LOCA was urged along at the rear,
moved to the outside late on the backstretch, went five then four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT KITTY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
got roused at the three-sixteenths, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. SHIGEKO coaxed from the gate, chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, kept on to the finish clear for the place
honors. SHOOPTHEREITIS four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. FANCY FELINE chased inside briefly before tipping out five wide down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide into the turn and came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and offered no response. MEMENTO MI prompted the pace three then two wide for the
opening half mile, came under coaxing at the half mile pole and chased through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired in the drive. ICE
LOVE coaxed from the start, chased six then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout.
Please note that MEMENTO MI ran for purse money only when discovered to have lost a rear shoe in the paddock.

Footnotes
MANNY PENNY broke a half-step slow, moved up on the outside with five furlongs to run, made a bid leaving the backstretch, took a short lead in the three
path midway through the turn, responded well when roused for his best in upper stretch and just held under vigorous urging. SAVAGE SPIRIT was coaxed
along early then well placed just off the pace, dropped back along the rail leaving the backstretch, was roused inside the seven-sixteenths pole, shifted three
then four wide on the second half of the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch and closed well to just miss while narrowly up for the place. ARCO AUGUSTA
pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, took the advantage outside the five-eighths pole, vied inside under urging on the turn, lost the lead to the winner
near the three-eighths pole, fought on well while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and just missed while clear for the show. IRIE MAN stumbled at
the start then ducked in while recovering, was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, moved out then was urged along while last but one, shifted
from the rail to the two path while gaining ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the top three in the stretch and finished
willingly while flattening out some. TRIPLE WORD SCORE broke in and was off a bit slow then dropped back quickly under strong urging, went around the
turn in the two path and was no factor. HAIR ON FIRE was sent hard from the start, chased the pace while hard ridden, dropped back midway down the
backstretch, fell further back while moving from four to two wide on the turn and retreated. JEFFERSONS OCEAN set the early pace under pressure to his
inside, lost the lead outside the five-eighths pole, dropped back into the turn, floated from the three path to the five path while retreating fast on that bend,
moved to the four path into the stretch and faltered.

OUSTER chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away to the finish to prevail. LIFE CHANGER chased four to five wide down the
backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, got let out spinning five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. ALTERNATE REALITY coaxed
from the gate, dueled from the five path down the backstretch with MIDLANER to his inside, tucked three wide through the turn and came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and kept on to preserve the show honors. MIDLANER coaxed from the start, dueled four then two wide with
the aforementioned foe to his outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
caught near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. JOKING WAY chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened. BEACHWALKER coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

WHAT A BLAST showed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths pole,
spun four wide into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and just held under steady urging. BARNSTORMING broke out and bumped with a foe,
was well placed towards the front, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth,
gained on that opponent late and just missed while clear for the place. INDEPENDENT PAUL broke in and bumped with a foe, tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked while four wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
tired while able to get the show. SOUTH STREET settled off the pace, was roused while inside to the two path for most of the turn, shifted three then four
wide late on that bend, moved to the six path into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. I LOVE CARA bumped with
opponents on both sides at the start then was pinched back, raced under urging at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and was no factor. ARREBATO contested the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, vied in the three path on the turn
and capitulated. BATTUTA D'ORO bumped with foes on both sides at the start then was squeezed back, settled on the outside, went three to four wide on
the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to respond.
