THAT'S THE WAY unhurried early, closed willingly three wide through the stretch, split rivals inside the furlong marker under energetic handling and was
along in time. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE pressed the early pace three wide, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, drifted out to the six path and dug in late for
second. SHOW SLIDING HOME pressed the pace along the inside down the backstretch, dropped back a bit on the turn, came on again under right handed
urging to make the lead past the three sixteenths pole then was outfinished in the final stages. SURROUNDER away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide
into the stretch and weakened late. PECKS NOT BAD had good early speed four wide then faded. ROSCO P. COLTRANE failed to menace. DASH OF

ONEMORANDTHECHECK unhurried early, began to close ground two wide through the turn, dropped to the rail at the top of the stretch, rallied
determinedly under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. CONSIDER ME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace and just
missed hanging on in the three path. SCRATCHOFF chased the runner up two wide and finished determinedly in the four path. THE EQUINEST went
evenly. TOYI vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch then faded. NATURE OFTHE BEAST was no factor. AWESOME ENOUGH offered a mild bid
four wide on the turn then came up empty. UNBRIDLED VICTOR dropped back from an alert start and trailed.

SENSEI LAWRENCE prompted the pace two wide into the turn, dropped back a bit and angled outside the leader, drifted to the six path entering the stretch
giving up ground then responded under left handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. WILDCAT
EXPRESS away alertly, set a pressured pace three wide into the turn, edged clear, maintained his advantage until mid stretch then was no match for the
winner while well clear for second. FIRST SONG pressed the pace along the inside into the turn and faded in the stretch. EL MARRO failed to menace.
MUTINY went evenly. MAS ORO was no factor. CAPTURE MI had speed four wide through the turn then wilted.
