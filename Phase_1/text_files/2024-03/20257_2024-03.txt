Footnotes
REASSESS prompted the pace in the four path, bid early into the turn, was cued in the five path turning into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe just after
the eighth pole, and inched ahead in the final sixteenth. REVOLU set the pace in the three path, was nudged along into the turn, dug in while dueling with
an outer foe from the three path turning into the stretch, bumped with that foe just after the eighth pole, and was outlasted in the final sixteenth to place. MY
SWEETHEART DANI got fractious in the gate, chased in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, and kept on along the inside down the lane for
show. TOUCHED BY QUALITY tracked in the four path, was coaxed in the five path midway around the turn, but faded in the stretch. TOO HOT TO STOP
briefly got loose on the way to post, then trailed throughout from the five to two paths.

Footnotes
THE MONOPOLY MAN settled off the pace while racing two wide, made good progress around the turn, split foes in upper stretch, took over near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. ONE SHARP COOKIE broke inwardly and slammed RAGS SPECIAL into FINGER ROLL, disputed the pace
in the three path to the sixteenth pole and was second best late. PRACTICALLY DARK raced in range four wide, edged closer nearing the quarter pole but
flattened out in the stretch. TROUBLEMEISTER disputed the pace inside of a foe in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. FINGER ROLL was
bumped at the start and appeared to clip heels just after, raced off the pace inside, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. HALVERSON was
outrun while racing two wide. AWESOME WIND had only brief speed three wide. RAGS SPECIAL was pinballed at the start, raced four wide and was never
involved.

Footnotes
JUST A PHOTO chased in the three path, was driven around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and drew past inner foes in the closing
stages. BROKEN SPUR stalked in the three path, came under a ride midway around the far turn, bid turning into the stretch, and ran on for place.
CARTOGRAPHER showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backside, was cued passing the quarter, kept on entering
the stretch, but was caught by an outer pair to show. BE LIKE CLINT trailed in the three path, tipped inside entering the far turn, but had to steady around
the five-sixteenths, then angled out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and stayed on. BACKCHAT tracked in the two path, tipped out to
the four path and was under coaxing passing the quarter, but faded in the stretch. SUNSHINE FROLIC got bumped by RIGEL at the start, rated in the two
path down the backstretch, but got bumped by the loose RIGEL again and had to steady midway around the far turn, then failed to menace. RIGEL broke in
and bumped an inner foe, causing him to stumble and lose the rider, gamely completed the circuit, was caught on the gallop out, and walked off. NO
CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE START,

DAZZLING MOVE set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. SIDAMARA pressed the winner in the three path
and was clearly second best. EXHILARATE raced off the pace two wide and bested the rest. BLUE TOPAZ chased the pace three wide and faltered around
the turn. IKRAN played no factor while racing three wide. SECRET SAMARITAN had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
K CROWN broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, was cued turning into the stretch and drew clear. MY LIFE STORY had to steady at the start,
stalked in the four path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, and kept on for place. CACIQUE ABARRIO pressed in the four path, was cued in the three
path midway around the far turn, but evened out for show. DONTBESOOGROUCHY rated in the three path, was coaxed in the two path passing the
quarter, angled out to the six path at the top of the lane, but flattened. IKE'S GAMBLE tracked in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn,
but weakened in the stretch. SUMMER STORM STRIC raced off the pace inside, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but never menaced.

SALS DREAM GIRL tracked the pacesetter while racing in the two and three paths, took over in midstretch and drew clear under a drive. WICKED
MERCURY had his head turned at the start, saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and rallied to gain the place late. BIG BAND
LUZZIANN set the pace in the two path, was collared in midstretch and held well enough for the show. LUCKY PERIDOT raced off the pace two wide,
swung five wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. SANDPIPER MEMORIES chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the lane. CURRENT
SITUATION saved ground and failed to menace. STARSHIP NANA played no factor while racing three and four wide.

REFUEL set the pace in the two path, was roused turning into the lane, opened slightly approaching the eighth pole, and held sway. AND UWISH stalked
inside, angled out to the three path under a ride passing the quarter, and ran on for place. MACKVILLE tracked in the two path, ranged up in the four path
around the turn, and kept on for show. BILLY THE GREEK chased in the three path, was ridden in the six path turning into the stretch, but drifted out and
was no factor. KING OF THE TRACK trailed in the two path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, but got herded outwards
and never threatened. BANNEKER prompted the pace in the three path, but had to check between foes passing the quarter, and gaveway.

Footnotes
CASTELLANA set the pace along the rail, was briefly headed near the five-sixteenths marker, shook clear turning for home and held safe under a drive.
LADY MONIQUE stumbled at the start, raced off the pace two wide and rallied through the lane. SHE CAN SCAT raced off the pace four wide and ran on to
gain the show. KHOZANKA pressed the pace two wide, could not keep up nearing the five-sixteenths pole, swung four wide turning for home and churned
on for a minor slice. MY SARASOTA QUEEN stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker pole, briefly led, dueled outside of the
winner to upper stretch and tired. ROYAL UPSTART veered out at the start, aced off the pace outside, angled to the rail early on the turn and never
threatened. KAP HOORN played no factor while racing three wide.
