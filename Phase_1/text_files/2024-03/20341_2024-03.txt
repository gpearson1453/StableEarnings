TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT was well placed tracking the leaders on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive, dueled through the
final furlong and was going best late to prevail. SETTE STELLE set the pace on the inside while being pressed, dueled on the far turn, then battled it out
through a long stretch drive and dug in gamely between horses to the finish. MCMAGIC pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the far turn,
dueled, dug in gamely outside in the stretch run and battled on to the finish. LAST DREAM stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, came three wide into
the lane and lacked a rally. EXCLUSIVE ORDER raced off the pace inside and did not factor. BOINTHEBACK stalked three wide, chased on the far turn,
came four wide into the lane and tired.

MERRYCHILL settled between rivals off the pace, advanced on the final turn, offered a late surge and wore down the leader in the late stages. KOKOPELLI
GIRL moved closer outside before the half, led midway on the final turn, rallied clear but could not hold off the winner. PROBLEMS ABOUND saved ground
in second flight, remained prominent to the stretch then faded. DREAMINGOFFREEDOM broke alertly and raced three wide and continued well and was no
factor. STEAL THE DEAL dropped back early, angled wide and lacked a response. STELLA MIA chased along the inside and was never involved.
MUMMALICIOUS quickly sprinted away, was collared midway on the turn and gave way. XERCES trailed early and was never in contention.
WHISKEYSTREETBLUES moved four wide on the first turn and stopped abruptly.

AMBITIOUSLY PLACED stalked the leaders, moved up three wide on the backside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled, took over, responded when
asked, drew clear under urging and held well late. JUST STAY HOME raced off the pace inside, then two wide, moved up three wide at the quarter pole,
rallied outside, finsihed well but second best. WESTERN DREAM set the early pace, then vied two wide for command, dueled inside of the winner on the far
turn, weakened in the stretch and held third. BEYOND A MILLION was fractious in the gate, then broke in the air, pulled her way into contention along the
rail on the clubhouse turn, vied inside, then chased and tired. TOMARIE trailed the field and did not factor.

TRUMPET CALL settled off the pace three wide, bid on the turn then wore down the pacesetter in the final furlong. EVOLUTIONARY quickly moved clear,
widened on the turn then weakened in the stretch losing the advantage. SHEER DOMINANCE lagged far behind, rallied wide in the stretch with some
energy. LORD IT'S CHILLY dropped back between rivals then inside and lacked a response. COMPETITIVE DADDY was urged off the leaders in second
flight and was never a factor. WHY STOP THERE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then proved empty in the stretch. FIRE ARMY chased very wide
and weakened steadily. JAKNAVA steadied inside into the far turn then had no further response.

CENTRE COURT CHAMP rated inside the dueling pacesetters, slipped through at the top of the lane, surged and quickly pulled clear in final eighth.
BEACH DAZE raced off the pace, angled out rallying in the stretch and finished strongly. NEW HIRE vied along the inside, moved briefly clear before the
half and continued gamely to the finish. SWEET WILLEMINA dropped back early in the chute, awaited room on the turn then offered a mild rally when clear.
WARRIOR'S RANSOM made a menacing four wide bid on the turn then flattened out in the lane. GIRL TROUBLE prompted the pace outside to midstretch
and weakened. EARLY EDITION dropped back outside and was never in contention. SOCIAL SUCCESS stalked the pacesetters four wide to midway on
the turn and gave way.

remained clear for the place spot. DRIVEN TO SUCCESS was bumped at the start, outrun early, advanced on the turn, rallied mildly and got third.
WINBORI steadied at the start, was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn, moved up between horses entering the stretch and gained mildly inside.

turn and faded. LADY SHEBOYGAN stalked three wide, chased and gave way.
