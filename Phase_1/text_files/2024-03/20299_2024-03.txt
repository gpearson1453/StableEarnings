COPANELLO BAY tracked the early leader two deep, asked through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. MAGNOLIA SPEED
showed good early foot along the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. TIZNOWS GRANDSON was coaxed along from the outside of foes
down the backstretch and weakened through the drive. ROWDY GALE dropped back to race mid pack, saved ground and was even with no closing run.
ONE PRETTY GIRL settled near the rear, raced four wide into the upper stretch an had no response. SASSY B KEEN saved ground and never threatened.
WIKING was off slowly, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened.

LODE OF BLARNEY pressed the early going two deep between rivals around the far turn and finished well to just get up under all out pressure. HUEY
DUEY chased the pace from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. JONO showed good early foot to clear off
early and gave way to the top pair grudgingly. LOVER BOY raced near the inside at the three sixteenths pole, swung out five wide and had not enough in
the drive. MONTEREY PENINSULA was hustled along, had an inside run and never threatened. SEA FORCE raced six wide into the upper stretch and
lacked a bid. MISTER MCLEAN dropped back early, raced four to five wide in the lane and never was a factor. DOGE OF VENICE failed to respond.
THUNDERSHOOK saved ground and never threatened.

HASTINGS SUNRISE pressed early, had full command near the three eighths pole and held gamely to prove best under strong handling. DIAMOND CITY
stalked the pace between rivals, made a three wide move through the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. MR CREED was allowed to settle early,
angled to the inside down the backstretch, continued an inside run into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. EXOTIC'S BEAR stalked the
pace from the outside and had not enough in the drive. SISAWAY NOW showed good early foot along the inside and gave way. LITTLE BITOTHUNDER
raced three to four wide in the drive and had no late rally. BELLAMYS ROAN dropped back early, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. SCHMOOZE stalked the pace three wide and faded. JAMES'S MOONSHINE settled off the early going and failed to respond.
