Footnotes
RB MARY LYLAH led the way into the first turn, then continued to press the pace down the backstretch while two wide, resumed command heading into the
far turn then drew off in the home stretch to always prove the best in the end. RB MALEXIS was nicely rated in the four path while racing close behind the
leaders, then gained second position on the far turn, attempted to take command heading into the home stretch under a gamely rally but could not catch
stablemate and was second best in the end. AA SWEET VICTORY chased the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn, lacked the
winning bid and kept on for the show prize in the end. WMA BIG BABY saved ground in the early furlongs while racing towards to back of the field, was
moving on the far turn while four wide to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. TM PURNCESS chased the pace while three deep down the
backstretch, then bid on the far turn from the two path, angled out in the early stretch and came up empty in the end. UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA chased
the pace from the inside, then settled back on the far turn, rebid in the early stretch but lacked responding in the end. RB MAMA WINGATE was allowed to
settle while five wide and towards the back of the pack and was no threat. WMA TORCH LIGHT was unhurried early, then trailed behind the field and was
no factor. RB MUNCHIE was forwardly placed inside in the early furlongs to set the pace down the early backstretch, then faded on the far turn.

BOUGIE JOE bumped foe at the start, then tracked the pace from the inside, came out to the three path leaving the bend and edged clear in the early
stretch and held on well to prevail in the end. SOLDIERS SACRIFICE saved ground in the backstretch, then drifted out four to five wide leaving the bend
and closed willingly down the lane and was best for the place prize. KENTUCKY ICE pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then battled
with inner foes on the turn, gained command at the quarter pole momentarily, continued to vie in the early stretch then was out kicked by an outer rival and
held the show prize in the end. BALI ROLLING TIDE pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, then battled between rivals on the turn before
giving way in the stretch. BRAZIL NUT was unhurried early, then rallied from the inside in the late stretch but it was to no avail. KLIMTOMANIAC was
allowed to settle while two wide at the back and showed little in the end. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO bumped foe at the start, then set the pace from the inside,
vied to keep the lead with outer foes on the turn, was extinguished and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHINING EXAMPLE remained nicely rated while two wide, bid along the inside leaving the bend, then shifted out mid stretch to go shoulder to shoulder with
an outer rival and was up at the wire to claim victory. MY LUCKY BREAK stalked the pace while four wide, then urged eagerly on the turn, rallied in the early
stretch then duked it out with an inner rival in the final yards and hung in the end. SHARP LIKENESS stalked the pace from the inside, then settled back on
the turn, re rallied in the upper stretch and kept on for third place in the end. BIDOFHONEY was away alertly to lead the way while two wide, cleared the
turn, maintained the lead in the early stretch under a strong drive then was out finished by outer rivals in the end. POETIC UNION was allowed to settle
while two wide, then came out six wide leaving the bend and was improving in the final stages. GO GO GO raced while four wide towards the back, bid
mildly on the turn to rally in the upper stretch and needed more in the end. BOSSADUSU was allowed to settle along the inside, then swung seven wide
leaving the turn to bid in the stretch but it was not enough to make a difference. CRIMSON LADY chased the pace while five wide, was moving up on the
turn while improving position to menace in the early stretch, then gave way in the end. SHEZA HUNK urged briefly along the inside then stopped on the turn
and lacked rallying in the stretch. SWEET SLEW pressed the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then stopped. There was a STEWARD'S
INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of MY LUCKY BREAK claimed foul against the rider of SHINING EXAMPLE for
interference in the stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made.

Footnotes
ABSAROKA showed the way from the inside and was unchallenged throughout to prove best in the end. BIG ROJO tracked the pace while two wide, then
sparred for the place prize in the stretch and was at the wire. WEIRD YEAR tracked the pace from the inside, could not catch the leader and dueled for the
place prize in the stretch and missed in the end. COLONEL KLINK settled along the inside, bid leaving the turn while five wide, lacked the winning bid and
bested the rest of his foes in the end. BREW CREW chased the pace while three wide and in the first flight of rivals, then bid in the upper stretch and came
up empty. STANS HOME RUN settled while three wide, bid in the upper stretch while six wide and made no impact. TEXAS TITAN raced in the middle pack
of rivals while four wide, lost crop at the top of the stretch, continued to urge down the stretch but it was to no avail in the end. FOREVAMO raced in the
middle flight of rivals while two wide, then bid leaving the turn and into the stretch and came up empty. BIG POWER RED was allowed to settle while two
wide and was no threat. REQUISITION raced from the inside in the middle pack then flattened out on the turn. HIT ONE OUT settled in the four path and
was no menace. TACTICIAN chased the pace while four wide in the first flight of rivals then flattened out on the turn and lacked late rally. SIMPLY
SPEAKING bid briefly from the inside in the middle pack of rivals then stopped.

Footnotes
RUBIANA broke inwardly and bumped rival, then dueled from the two path into the turn, inched away to gain command heading into the stretch and held on
well until the end to conquer over all. BLUE HEAVENLY was bumped at the start, was well rated in the two path and between rivals into the turn, then dug in
gamely at the top of the stretch and closed willingly in the final stages and scored the place prize in the end. BLING ON THE LIGHT brushed foe shortly
after the start, then stalked the pace from the inside, rallied gamely in the upper stretch to gain second position then was surpassed by an inner rival and
missed the place prize in the end. CROSS CLAIM was bumped on both sides at the start, then raced mid pack while five wide and closed well in the late
stretch despite prior circumstances. CAJUN DOLL was shuffled back at the start, was unhurried early, came out eight wide leaving the bend to bid in the
stretch but it was not enough in the end. LIBBIES BABY was bumped at the start, then chased the pace from the inside, rallied mildly in the early stretch and
came up evenly in the end. THE NEXT BIG BLING broke outwardly and bumped rival, then pursued the pace while four wide while in strong bid then
flattened out in the stretch. SUCCESSFULPATH nose dived at the start, was unhurried early, then rallied mildly in the late stretch but it was too late to make
a difference. SALTAMONTES DIVA broke inwardly and bumped rival, was allowed to settle while three wide, drifted out eight to nine wide leaving the bend
and came up empty. SING IT BESSIE settled in the four path and was no threat. DULCE AMANECER YG raced at the back of the pack and failed to rally.
PHUNK was brushed shortly after the start, then dueled from the inside, was in a hard drive on the turn, was used up and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
RESOURCE saved ground in the early stages, circled six wide leaving the far turn, then surged down the lane and was up at the wire to prove best. MADE
AN OFFER led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch then was caught at the
wire and was second best. UTSIRA chased the pace from the inside, continued to urge eagerly on the far turn to menace in the stretch and was able to
close gamely just missing victory in the end. SKYVIEW DRIVE pressed the pace while three wide throughout the first three quarters, then dug in gamely
leaving the far turn but could not catch the leader in the end. TIZ A KNOCKOUT was allowed to settle along the inside, then rallied leaving the far turn,
angled out to the four path in the late stretch and closed willingly. KARA was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack, came out five wide leaving the far
turn, brushed rival in the early stretch, shifted outward and closed willingly down the lane. CLIMB TO GLORY chased the pace while three wide, then rallied
mildly leaving the far turn, met traffic in the early stretch and came up empty in the end. FICKLE MISTRESS saved ground in the early furlongs, bid leaving
the far turn from the two path, was in tight and steadied in the early stretch and lost momentum in the end. WHAT A RIDE pressed the pace from the two
path into the far turn while in a hard drive, was used up and weakened in the home stretch. LEONE was allowed to settle in the two path and was no
menace in the end. PALACSINTA chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn and did not respond in the stretch.
CHARMING LEAH raced in the middle of the field from the inside at a moderate pace and did not fire in the home stretch.
