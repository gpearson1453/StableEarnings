AMERICAN SYMPHONY stalked two deep the first half mile, took over at the nine sixteenths pole and dug in to the challenge of RUN FOR REAGAN
leaving the three eighths pole, raced with the advantage at the rail on the far turn and dueled determinedly to keep that one at bay. The latter saved ground
early then eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, challenged at the three eighths pole, remained a factor at the rail on the far turn
but hung at the outside flank of the winner through the stretch. BOOK RUNNER settled off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. SHARP STYLE settled well back off the rail then eased out into the backstretch and gave chase
past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. ICETECA saved ground early then eased out into the
backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SOMEBODY LOVES ME mostly
saved ground. LET'S EAT set the pace inside for a half mile then faded through the backstretch.

leaving the eighth pole and held on well. SILIPO settled off the rail the first turn, raced boxed in three wide off the heels of MISSIONSNINETYNINE from the
three eighths pole to the quarter pole, dug in off the rail through the turn, eased out past the eighth pole and got up to take second late stretch. The latter

MARSHALL PEANUT set a pressured pace two deep, contested the advantage off the rail through the turn and held well with mostly, a vigorous hand ride.
TEACHINTHERELEASE gave chase, raced close off the rail on the turn and held on for second. HOPPING HENRY gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly to take third late. EL LUCERITO chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened stride
late. EPIC TIME chased through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn, was bumped entering the stretch and weakened. GOLD FIBER became
a bit anxious in the gate then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, checked off the heels of the errant path of GUN FACTOR entering the stretch,
steadied while making contact with Epic Time and weakened. The latter pressured the pace, steadied at the rail midway on the turn, drifted entering the
stretch then weakened. The Stewards reviewed, and rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Marshall Peanut for alleged interference midway on the
turn, lodged by the rider of Gun Factor.

Footnotes
MISS ANTIETAM stalked off the rail the opening turn then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms leaving the three eighths, took
the nod two deep past the quarter and dug in determinedly to edge out the game effort of NANA'S BOOPA, who moved inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms leaving the three eighths, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on
the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. HONEYCAMP rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and ran evenly through the lane. DALLAS raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished evenly. SUMMERTIME ROSE hesitated at the break and was strung in the six path the first turn,
gave chase into the backstretch, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little further. SISTER SPIRIT raced in the four path the opening turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path then flattened mid-stretch. WAVERLEY settled off the rail the first
turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY saved ground early and raced wide on
the far turn. HOVEL mostly saved ground. LADY CINCO DE MAYO saved early ground and showed little response through the backstretch.
