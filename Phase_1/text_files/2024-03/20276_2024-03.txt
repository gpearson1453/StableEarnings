Footnotes
TULSAN advanced willingly outside heading into the turn, bid four wide taking the lead past the seven-sixteenths, was clear in upper stretch, lugged in a bit
in mid-stretch, held sway while geared down at the end. EL JOKER pressed the early pace, bid between foes coming past the seven-sixteenths but was
readily overtaken by the aforementioned winner, was put in tight quarters by that one nearing mid-stretch and altered out at that juncture, was second best,
vanned off. COPPER STATE was urged strongly from the start but lacking speed, swung seven wide turning for home, proved no match for the top pair but
was best of the rest. HAPPY SLAPPER was just off the leaders stalking in behind, came out four to five wide into upper stretch, ran on. CHARLIE THYME
soon led, set the early pace inside on or just off the rail, faded.

Footnotes
I WIN LIKA GIRL stalked just off the leaders, advanced while fanning six wide into upper stretch, bid at that point, dueled, was under a long drive before
finally surging past late. QUITE LOVELY attended the pace from outside a foe, took command about the half, led into upper stretch, was challenged,
dueled, held until late then was outfinished. OUR SOARING ANGEL was in tight in behind and between runners into the turn, altered outside foes coming
seven to eight deep to the top of the stretch and in striking range, kept on evenly to be best of the rest. SPECIAL PRIDE was well-placed early, came into
the stretch four to five wide having raced off the inside throughout, ran on evenly late. LA DIAMANT failed to menace while racing off the inside. RAISE
OUR FLAG was urged forward inside taking the lead after the opening furlong, set the pace briefly, retreated. MADDIE POPPE broke just a step slowly,
moved up inside, was never near enough to threaten.

DAVE'S ENCHANTMENT stalked the leaders, fanned seven wide into upper stretch seeking room, had aim outside foes, took command in mid-stretch,
drew clear then held. AMERICAN SOLO bobbled at the break, raced toward the rear, swung eight wide into upper stretch, ran on well but too late. OL'
MCCLINTOCK tracked in behind racing off the rail on the turn, angled in at the quarter pole cutting the corner to advance inside foes in upper stretch, made
a mild bid nearing the eighth pole but evened out. DIM THE LIGHTS chased from outside four wide into the turn making a bid past the three-eighths, was in
contention floating six wide turning for home but could not sustain the effort. LEAVE THEM BEHIND had the early lead then pressed into the turn, bid
between runners past the three-eighths, lacked the needed late kick. TEE ROY moved the lead inside after the opening furlong, set a pressured pace on
then just off the rail, faded. DANJERUS STORM chased from off the inside, came into upper stretch five deep, had no rally.

Footnotes
DESERT SPIRIT settled off the pace, advanced willingly outside on the turn four wide, took the lead about the quarter pole, moved clear, held.
SUPERCENTS settled off the pace near inside, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied between foes at that point to get into the second position but was
no match for the winner. JEDI JENNIE stalked in pursuit of the leaders, was about one-paced on the turn moving out from four to five wide on that bend then
further still for the drive, kept on but needed more. MIDNIGHT SUSI attended the pace, moved nearer contending for the lead between foes about the
five-sixteenths and racing three wide, came in a bit in upper stretch and needed more. BERNICE WHO was very fractious in the gate flipping over backward
hitting the ground with her rear then popped back up to hang her head out over the front of the gate, was backed out of the stall once calm and then
reloaded, lacked early speed, swung eight deep for the stretch run. PARCO moved forward inside foes to a narrow lead after the opening furlong, set a
pressured pace on or just off the rail, tired.

Footnotes
BYE BYE BROOKY settled off the leaders, saved some ground on the turn, bid inside foes by mid-stretch, prevailed. ATTILAS GAL stalked before moving
three to four wide, took the lead, was outfinished. HEAR ME ROAR settled just off the leaders in behind, advanced between foes midway on the turn,
sought room at the top of the stretch, moved out five wide to obtain it, once a clear path was available ran on willingly to be best of the rest. SHELL GAME
chased four to five wide on the turn, floated seven wide in upper stretch, kept on. OUR ISLAND GIRL broke a step slowly, moved forward while forced five
to six wide on the turn fanning eight deep into upper stretch, ran on. PREMEDITATED LILY moved clear quickly, set the pace inside but off the rail, was
overtaken. FLOWER POWER broke a step slowly, was forced six wide on the turn fanning nine deep into upper stretch, was not a threat. REAL ME chased
from inside near then further away from the rail, tired in the stretch. WILEO PROCEED broke a step slowly and lost the path at the start, was outpaced,
swung ten wide, finished up willingly but too late. PER RULING ECM2024-109 FROM HIWU, BYE BYE BROOKY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM BULL stalked early while four to six deep, took closer order into the far turn pressing three furlongs out, took the lead by the quarter pole, drew
away in the stretch while drifting out a bit. EVERYROSEHASATHORN set the pace from well off the rail in the three to four path, weakened but held place.
CHARLIE DYNASTY settled at the rear, swung nine wide into the stretch, gained late on all but the winner. READS PET ZENON switched outside a foe and
gained forward position two to three wide between foes early up the backstretch, dropped back from the leaders on the far turn, came out in the stretch, kept
on evenly. NACHO GRANDE broke just a step slowly, was under a hold in the early going while also in a bit tight racing four to five wide, moved out eight
wide swinging out the far turn, ran on mildly. SHAME ON SAM bobbled slightly at the start, was up close racing near the rail in the early going, steadily
dropped back heading to the far turn, failed to rally. LET EM RIP was caught five to six wide on the first turn, took closer order seven wide up the
backstretch, continued five to six deep on the far turn, faltered and faded.

I GET STORMED settled into stride, fanned nine wide into upper stretch for room, engaged in a prolonged drive and surged past late. SUERTUDA chased
while switching out, came to the quarter pole five wide under urging, was seven wide in upper stretch, took a narrow lead, was outkicked. EMMYS SILVER
broke just a step slowly, settled at the back, fanned ten wide, gained late. MARQUEE'S STORM moved forward to the lead to force the issue three wide
heading into the turn, contended inside foes but off the fence, was outkicked. JUST KEEP LAUGHIN settled racing near the inside on the turn and stretch
and improved position. WHY FOR moved forward to vie about four wide between runners coming to the five-sixteenths, needed more. JASMINE BABY
chased from outside and was in contention five deep coming to the five-sixteenths but faltered in upper stretch. POW WOW saved ground, was not a threat.
SPICEY SECRET moved forward inside to briefly set the pace just off the fence, was in tight entering the turn dropping back at the seven-sixteenths, came
out in upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
IMA BLING CAT stalked from outside, went five to six wide on the turn moving nearer the lead, floated seven wide into upper stretch, took charge at that
point and drove clear. CYCLONE MESA was urged at the start moving through inside to the lead to set the pace from off the rail, drifted five wide leaving
the turn, was no match for the winner but kept on well enough to secure the place. CHARLIE'S GHOST stalked three wide into the turn and in between
runners, floated six wide into upper stretch by the drifting leader, needed more. MASK OFF broke well but settled into stride dropping back off the leaders on
the turn, was forced six to seven wide outside foes on the bend, floated eight wide into upper stretch, ran on. BLUEGRASS FAITH broke in the air, settled
outside at the rear, moved forward on the turn five to six wide, angled nine deep at the top of the stretch and ran on. DUBRONSKY shifted in, saved ground
near but off the rail through the turn but was not a threat. STYLE BENDER was up close stalking into the turn, went four wide on that bend, faltered and
faded. SMOOTH BLUES lacked early speed, shifted in a bit for the turn racing in the two to three path, was not a threat. BULLAWAY broke in the air,
chased from inside, raced off the rail dropping back on the turn, came out further in the stretch, was not a factor.

Footnotes
GONE KAT settled off the pace, advanced between foes mid-pack at the five-sixteenths, began to shift out past the quarter pole coming into upper stretch
seven wide with momentum, took the lead by mid-stretch and forged clear. ZAPPIN soon led moving through inside, set the pace, drifted out leaving the
turn, was no match for the winner but kept on to preserve the place. POQUITO LADY made an early advance outside the leaders five then four wide into the
turn taking a narrow lead past the three-eighths, evened out in the stretch. BLAME GAME chased just off the leaders, raced mostly four to seven wide and
kept on late. SNOWBIRD was well-placed up close and outside, shifted in from six to four wide while dropping back on the turn, altered back out and in
through the stretch and ran on. LILY J lacked early speed racing off the inside at the back, swung out six to seven deep for the drive, kept on. PARK IN THE
DARK veered out at the start, fanned eight wide into the stretch, ran on. TAMMY MACHO chased from inside, faded. ROCKETT'S RED CITY was
forwardly-positioned three to four wide heading to the turn, steadied when in tight at the seven-sixteenths dropping back numerous lengths, failed to rally.
STEPMONSTER was forwardly-positioned two to three wide, stoutly urged by the five-sixteenths in pursuit of the leading duo, came out a bit while turning
for home but checked sharply when in tight between the leaders, dropped back and faded. CAVIAR APPEAL was outpaced and not a threat.
