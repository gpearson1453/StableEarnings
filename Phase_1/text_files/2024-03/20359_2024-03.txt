Footnotes
PREDICTED bobbled just after the start, went to the front then moved clear inside the three-quarter pole, extended the advantage in the two path on the
turn, drew off under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, was kept to the task to the sixteenth-pole then eased up while much the best. THISTLE was
coaxed along just off the early pace, moved to the outside near the five-eighths pole, was hard ridden in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and willingly earned the place while no match for the winner. DISAPPEARANCE was slowest into stride then dropped well behind while showing no
speed, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and was along for the show. MIDNIGHT WORKER stalked the pace on the outside, was urged
along passing the nine-sixteenths pole, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and tired. FIGHT FIERCELY was well placed
just off the early pace, dropped back under urging inside the five-eighths pole, fell further back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn
and failed to respond.

A T chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. HYDRA chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming

TRIPLE P, chased five then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TRIPLE P broke

before settling into stride, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out,
went five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDTOWN ROSE chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the

by the rider and was expertly pulled up just inside the three-sixteenths and was subsequently vanned off.

SHESALITTLE EDGY angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch
and proved much the best under steady urging. ICY REPLY settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path,
pursued the winner to the finish and proved no match while willingly holding the place. PRETTI XTREME dropped back quickly while showing no speed,
saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place while able to get the show. TAMING THE
TIGRESS settled off the pace, was roused in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. REMAIN
ANONYMOUS was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn and tired. JACKIE THE JOKER was carried in
early then well placed just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. TAMING THE TIGRESS

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S MIST came in shortly after the start leaning briefly on APOLLONIA VITELLI before taking over her lane, then got clipped behind by that rival,
dueled from the six path down the backstretch with SARATOHA SMOKESHOW to her inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and steadily shook off that
rival, swung four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole and held well to the finish kept to task. APOLLONIA VITELLI got
leaned on at the start by DELL ARTE, then had the aforementioned foe briefly lean on her from the outside before taking over her lane directly in front,
clipped heels with that rival and bobbled conceding two lengths of ground near seven and a half furlongs to run, raced eight to nine paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick to be along clear of the rest and second best. EAST HARBOR got bumped at the start by SARATOGA SMOKESHOW, who broke outwards, chased
five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SARATOGA SMOKESHOW broke out at the start bumping EAST HARBOR, dueled from the four
path through the opening half mile, tucked inside into the turn and got steadily shaken off under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. DELL ARTE broke out at the start and leaned on APOLLONIA VITELLI, chased eight paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired. FRANKIE'S ROSE
chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. SONG OF SOLOMINI broke in at the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four to
five wide into the turn and shortened stride, got eased up midway on the turn, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish
well behind. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of APOLLONIA VITELLI alleging interference against POSEIDON'S MIST soon after leaving the
gate. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
DAZZY moved up after going about a furlong to get the lead, showed the way with company to her outside, inched clear while inside on the turn, lost the
advantage in upper stretch, fought back in the final furlong, regained the lead in the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. FIRST CLASS CAT
was well placed just off the pace, came under strong encouragement while inside to the two path on the turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole,
drifted out while taking the advantage into upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but
was caught while well clear for the place. DOLCE SERA dropped back early then angled out while guided to the outside, was urged along on the far outside,
went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. GHOSTLY GIRL pressed the pace on the
outside, chased two to three wide on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and came up empty. PAUCILOQUENT showed early speed then
dropped back under urging, went four then three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STJAMES chased six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch detached at the tail of the field early on, tucked three wide into the turn and was
placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths straightened away, closed well outside to issue a
challenge nearing the final sixteenth and was up in the final jumps to the finish to score. ASSUME NOTHING broke in at the start bumping GRANDPA'S
KID, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from MIGHTY ATLAS to the outside, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing near
the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair of rivals clinging to command, then got caught in the last
strides to the finish while just preserving the place honors by a sliver. GRANDPA'S KID got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking inwards,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and lugged in from just
outside the eighth pole to near the sixteenth marker despite a left handed crop and correction, placed MIGHTY ATLAS in tight near the sixteenth pole,
forcing that foe to pause between rivals, then ran on to just miss for the place honors. MIGHTY ATLAS prompted the pace of ASSUME NOTHING from the
outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on between foes
from just outside the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker, when brushed and placed in tight as GRANDPA'S KID lugged in from the outside, then got shaken
off in the late stages when weakening to the finish. PROVEN HOPE chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. KANT BEAT THE ROCK chased along the inside under coaxing from midway on the
turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, weakened.

Footnotes
MIDTOWN LIGHTS was well placed just off the pace, chased while moving from the inside to the three path on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch,
made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, drifted out while taking a short lead near the furlong marker and held under steady urging. RACING COLORS
was last to commence, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied into the final
furlong and finished fast to get the place. KHALI MAGIC was sent hard to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn,
lost the advantage under a drive near the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the show. RIBOT'S VALENTINE broke through the front of the
gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, settled just off the pace, chased while saving ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. GONE
AND FORGOTTEN dropped back near the three-quarter pole then was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. MY FIRST LOVE moved up near the three-quarter pole then was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four then five
wide on the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead nearing the sixteenth-pole and had
nothing left. AMITY ISLAND settled well off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. APRIL
ANTICS was urged along while pressing the pace on the outside, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the drive
and capitulated.
