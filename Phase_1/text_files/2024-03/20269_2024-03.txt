Footnotes
LEXI'S SPIRIT bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three path, was coaxed along in the four path rounding the turn, took aim in the five path
at the top of the lane, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. BIG DREAMER set the pace inside, opened up under confident handling
around the turn, was roused from the three path at the top of the stretch, but was overtaken by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. SUPER SPIN
prompted the pace in the two path, was roused from the three path into the turn, but drifted in while hanging on her left lead in the stretch, and evened out
for show. BULLET ON TARGET bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path but did not factor in the five path down the lane. INFINIOUS
had a slow start, raced off the pace inside but never threatened. IT'S ONLY WORDS broke out at the start, then trailed throughout from the two to four
paths.

SASSY MELISSA tracked in the four path, was ridden into the turn, ranged up in the six path at the top of the lane, bid passing the eighth pole, and inched
clear in the final sixteenth. DRINKS ON ME chased in the two path, was driven in the three path around the turn, and ran on between foes into the final
furlong to get up for place late. ABOVE PAR prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, was coaxed passing the quarter,
floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but evened out in the final sixteenth to show. RUNAWAY BREEZE raced off the pace in the three path,
was driven in the two path around the turn, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, and stayed on but couldn't make an impact. SIX FEET
APART set the pace in the two path, was cued along the inside early around the turn, fought on from the three path in upper stretch, but faded in the final
furlong. BARBARA hopped and got pinched at the start, then always trailed from the two to three paths.

WONDERFULVENEZUELA stalked the pace inside, angled out near the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch and drove clear. TIME MISS set the
pace in the two path, led to upper stretch and held well to remain well clear of the rest. MATHURINE stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace with
the top two in upper stretch and lasted for the show. JESS'S MOMENT saved ground off the pace, was no threat to the top two and lost the battle for the
show. SPANISH GIRL chased the pace two wide and faded in the drive. MISS G MONEY trailed while racing in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
TATANKA showed the way around the first turn to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, was nudged along into the far turn, cued passing the
quarter, opened slightly from the two path in upper stretch, and held sway. SPACE LAUNCH chased in the two path, was roused along the inside midway
around the far turn, tipped out to the three path and bumped with an outer foe at the top of the lane, but ran on for place. TARTUFO rated in the two path,
was ridden into the far turn, shifted out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY stalked in the two path, bumped
with an inner foe while under a drive in the four path at the top of the lane, and evened out in the final furlong. CYCLONE RANGER trailed in the two path
down the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, but made no impact. ROCK THE STARS raced wellback in the four path, fanned out to the
nine path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. ROUGH DRAFT tracked in the three path, but weakened from the seven path in the stretch.
VLADISLAV raced off the pace in the three path, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was no menace.

CHLOE'S TOY set the pace in the two path and held safe under a drive. STARSHIP NEBULA stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, was gaining
through the lane but was held at bay. NO ACTION chased the pace inside and finished evenly for the show. MO TOURING steadied soon after the start,
raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and was no threat. GREEK MOJO checked entering the turn, saved ground off the pace,
swung five wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally. L. E. GRAY steadily faded three wide.

GOOD RAPPORT rated inside, was nudged along around the turn, bid from a narrow opening along the rail passing the eighth pole, and drew away from
the outer pacesetter in the final sixteenth. PRACTIKO kicked away in the opening furlong to set an open pace in the two path, waited confidently early
around the turn before receiving a right handed cue passing the five-sixteenths, stayed on from the two path into the lane, but was caught around the
sixteenth to place. AUSTONIAN stalked in the three path, came under a ride going into the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and was
along for show. LESLIE CHOW raced off the pace in the six path but drifted out in the stretch while failing to menace. UNIKEE was in tight early, chased in
the four path, was driven into the turn, but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SWISS SLANG raced in range three wide, bid three deep rounding the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. EL MATADOR pressed the pace
two wide, bid two wide between foes around the far turn, was outkicked by the winner but stayed on to gain the place. BAYTOWN PARFAIT set the pace
inside, fought on past the eighth pole and was outfinished for the place. FALFURRIAS raced in range two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and was
one-paced through the lane. OLD FLAG (IRE) failed to menace while racing two and three wide. K'S STORM READY chased the pace from the rail and
weakened through the stretch. ALWAYS A WAY played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
KARAYA set the pace in the three path, was cued in the two path approaching the quarter, and kicked away along the inside passing the eighth pole under
a drive. MADNESS stalked in the two path, was roused along the inside into the turn, and chased on from the two path down the lane for place. SCORPIA
laid up close in the four path, was coaxed in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, and was one paced for show.
TAPRIXIE popped the gate open during the loading process, then bumped an inner foe early, tracked between foes in the three path but had the steady
going into the turn, then was driven from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. RAINY NIGHT got in tight while bumping with an outer foe early, then
trailed throughout around the two path.
