Footnotes
GREAT KOSTAS rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was steadily handled to
mid-stretch, then taken in hand later yards. BIG SMILE stalked off the rail, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and settled for second best. GENERAL J R settled back about the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far
turn and showed little more. WILLIAM'S CAUSE raced off the pace about the three path, left the second turn outside and faded through the backstretch.
RING FUND settled in the four path early, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened near the rail on the far turn. CURTEIS was crowded
early then saved ground.

Footnotes
VALHALLA'S PALACE ducked in leaving the gate then stalked two deep into the first turn, took the lead leaving the turn and was urged past the three
eighths pole, cleared UNDERBOSS midway on the far turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in under mostly a vigorous hand ride and drew off. The latter
exchanged contact with I'mlivingthedream leaving the gate then settled off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the
far turn, bore out nearing the head of the lane but dug in from there and dueled for second. DENIZETTI stalked the early pace from the three path, picked up
the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. COLONIAL ROAD was shut
off at the break and saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and
finished evenly while improving his position. LORD CLANCY saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path
on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. I'MLIVINGTHEDREAM exchanged contact with Underboss leaving the gate, was carried out entering the first turn,
left the turn wide and showed little response. NOVEMBER IMPERIUM rated just off the pace off the rail through the front stretch, but drifted into the first turn
and showed little response leaving the turn. SUAVE STORY was carried out into the first turn and was never a factor. MANHATTAN IMAGE took the lead at
the rail approaching the first turn, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the rail nearing the quarter pole and
faded through the far turn.

MIGHTY MINION veered out leaving the gate then raced in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep midway
on the far turn and dug in determinedly to inch clear the final yards. OCEAN STORM rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the five
sixteenths pole, entered the far turn at the rail, was met midway through the turn and remained a factor to late stretch before relenting. LOST WEEKEND

clear third later yards. SIENTE EL AMOR hesitated then ducked out and hit the gate at the break, raced in the three path on the first turn, picked up the
chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the seven path and passed some rivals outside. MY SLICK NICK saved ground on the first

TILTED TIARA tapered in and rated a slim lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dug
in determinedly to eke out the nod over MRS. DEL, who veered out leaving the gate and had her heels clipped, then tapered in and stalked two deep,
challenged leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at a close disadvantage and dueled gamely before relenting the nod. RIDE THE RAPIDS had
a brief early lead then angled to the inside and stalked the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dueled
for third nearing mid-stretch. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and entered the far turn
near the rail, was eased to the four path through the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. FLAT DISCOUNT raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened stride. FORTUNATA ITALIA raced off the rail the first turn then
eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. DIVINE FASHION settled
close in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five path on the far turn. WATERLOO ROSE steadied
and angled to the six path into the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened stride in the six
path on the far turn. COACH RUBE clipped the heels of the errant start of Mrs. Del a stride from the gate then raced in the five path the first turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
REVEIRS MINUTE saved ground close to the pace, started her bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested at a slim disadvantage nearest the rail on
the far turn, took the nod into the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. SOMMER VELVET was forced out leaving the gate then angled sharply to
the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge two deep while between horses on the far turn, gave
up the nod leaving the turn and relented in the duel through the stretch. CALYPSO GHOST settled close off the rail the first turn and left the turn toward the
outside, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, contested the far turn three wide but relented in the duel through the stretch. PRACTICALLY THERE
saved ground racing well back, picked up the chase into the backstretch and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled out leaving the turn but flattened in the
lane. CLEARLY VISIBLE was forced out leaving the gate then checked off the heels of the errant path of Sommer Velvet in the vicinity of the thirteen
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and flattened in
the lane. THUNDERTURTLE rounded the opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the
far turn and weakened in the lane. TESTED POSITIVE saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but weakened at the rail on the
far turn. MISS WILD raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. FASHION DIVA veered out at the break, raced
two deep the first turn and was not a factor. MYGIDGETMARIE stalked from the three path the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
faded past the pole. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Sommer Velvet for interference in the vicinity of the thirteen sixteenths pole,
lodged by the rider of Clearly Visible, and as a result, disqualified the former to fifth place for impeding the path of the latter in the vicinity of the thirteen
sixteenths pole.
