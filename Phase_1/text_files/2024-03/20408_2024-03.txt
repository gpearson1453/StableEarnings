Footnotes
THE BEARRISH ONE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a
bid from the two path coming around the far turn and dueled to the wire to just get the win. WAR NOVEL saved ground around the first bend, led the way on
the inside up the backstretch and around the second turn, dug in gamely in the lane and just missed. WESTOVER saved ground early, raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position in the lane. GOLDEN TONE saved
ground off the pace through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, bumped with BEAST OF FAMINE entering the stretch and was
no threat. DAZZLING TRUTHS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far bend
from the four path, bumped with BEAST OR FAMINE near the quarter pole and made no bid. BEAST OR FAMINE raced in the three path early, chased the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still in the three path, raced in tight quarters and bumped with several horses
entering the stretch and faded from there.
