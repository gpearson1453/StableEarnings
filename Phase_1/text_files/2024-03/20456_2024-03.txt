Footnotes
WE'RE IN TROUBLE brushed the gate and shifted in at the start, raced up close outside the pacesetter for a bit then chased past the half-mile pole, drew
alongside again around the bend, battled down the lane and dug in the last sixteenth to prove best. ALL THAT GLORY stepped to the front and took control
early on the inside while under pressure, cleared past the half-mile pole, confronted by WE'RE IN TROUBLE again on the turn, maintained command to the
top of the stretch, dueled through the lane and got outkicked in the last sixteenth. FAST CHAZ stalked the top outside a rival, rounded the turn two then
three wide and finished evenly for third. METRO got put in tight between rivals early then came in to bother inner rivals, coaxed back into range and chased
along the fence through the turn, then weakened in the stretch run. WESTERN POWER broke slow on the outside, bothered by METRO early and had to
take up, raced on the rail into the turn, moved off the fence around the bend and failed to menace. J B STRIKES BACK brushed the gate to lose a step at
the start, crossed onto the dirt a bit awkwardly to lose some momentum, got put in tight shortly after and had to check near the fence, trailed along the rail
shifted to the two path and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
BACK ON TRACK off a step slow from outside, chased widest up the backstretch, made progress four then three deep around the bend, drew alongside
BELLA VIENNA in upper stretch, took over midstretch and kicked clear to win going away. BELLA VIENNA grabbed the early lead and set the pace up the
backstretch, led two to three wide leaving the bend, challenged by BACK ON TRACK in upper stretch but yielded in the late stages. PUTT FOR DOUGH
stalked off the rail or outside a rival, chased three deep between rivals then two wide late on the bend, churned on down the lane and held the show.
PRANCINGTHRUPARIS stumbled badly at the start, ran up on heels and had to steady slightly early, went between rivals and had to steady when boxed in
behind the leader at the three-eighths pole, angled to the rail, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened. PETIT FILET pressed the pace from inside,
dropped back to last on the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

GYPSY KING dueled outside FAST GISELLE to the top of the lane, put away inner rival in upper stretch, met the challenge from NEON LIGHTS (IRE)
shortly after and gamely prevailed. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) stalked along the rail then chased two wide into the lane, moved out to launch a bid midstretch but
could not get by the winner. INCREDIBLE SHOT climbed a bit across the dirt and crossing back onto the grass, tracked within range, saved ground through
the turn, moved out in the drive, finished willingly but needed to find more late. KIMMER trailed in the early going, saved ground around the bend, moved out
in the lane and passed tired rivals. FAST GISELLE dueled from inside holding a slim advantage over GYPSY KING, lost command leaving the turn, yielded
in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MAGNIFICENT RIDE stalked the top pair outside a rival, took the turn two then three wide while under a
ride, then weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HOT LEGS ROMOLO forwardly placed outside the leader early, drew alongside on the backstretch, kept the pressure on through the far turn, took over at
the top of the stretch and maintained a short lead over RHINO to the wire. RHINO took control early and moved inside, pressured by HOT LEGS ROMOLO
in the middle stages, showed the way through the far turn, was overtaken at the top of the stretch, fought back from inside and finished game second.
BERT'S PROSPECT stalked along the rail, waited for room behind the leaders leaving the far turn, roused in the lane but saw the opening close, gained a
clear path again and finished willingly but was put in tight late. DEFENSOR FORTIS raced up close outside the top pair then became rank when taken in
hand, stalked three wide into and around the far turn and lacked a bid. MAXVILLE sat off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn, steered
out in the lane and lacked further response. RUN BRYCE RUN settled outside a rival then moved out to the three path on the first turn, made progress
outside rivals in the middle stages, chased two then three wide on the second bend and failed to threaten. TOPPERS WAGER broke a step slow then
dropped back and lagged behind early, trailed into the stretch and never got involved. THEGINGERBREADMAN climbed in the two path early, continued to
track two wide on the far turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
BIG NOVEL stalked briefly then went up to dueled around the first turn, inched ahead on the backstretch, put away outer rival at the quarter pole, drew off in
upper stretch when roused and coasted in geared down in deep stretch. GILA gave chase from the two path, moved inside while coming under a ride on the
far turn, churned on down the lane and was along for the place. PROFESSORS' PRIDE sped to the front and led three wide outside a rival on the first turn,
pressed BIG NOVEL up the backstretch and far turn, failed to kick on with that rival approaching the quarter pole, weakened in the lane and lost the place.
LISA'S NONNO chased in the three path on the first turn, two then three wide on the second bend and lacked a response when needed. BELLEO'S
FOREST chased between rivals then two wide into the clubhouse turn, dropped and moved out to the four path around the bend, remained wide at the back
to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS dueled outside FAST INVESTMENT in the three path on the first turn, fought with that rival up the backstretch, cleared with
three furlongs remaining and moved inside, confronted by DARK MARCUS at the quarter pole, battled with that rival in the stretch, dug down to inch ahead
in midstretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. DARK MARCUS off slow to begin, chased three wide into the first turn off the pace then had to take hold
when running up on the heels of SENSE in the four path, on the move through the far turn and drew alongside the leader at the quarter pole, dueled through
the lane but was turned away in the last sixteenth. TAPIT DOWN chased along the rail then had to steady approaching the first turn, raced a bit keenly in
hand, roused two wide on the far turn, could not summon the needed response but churned on to best the others. FAST INVESTMENT went up to
challenge from inside early, dueled up the backstretch, started to weaken on the far turn and gave way while saving a minor placing. DANGEROUS GAME
stumbled leaving the gate, trailed to the far turn, passed tired rivals along the rail on the second bend and could not make an impact. SENSE stalked in the
four path on the first turn in hand, chased three deep into the second bend, weakened around that turn and tired in the lane. THANK YOU HONEY was hard
to ride chasing two wide into the first turn, got shuffled between rivals entering the far turn and had little left to give after.

Footnotes
ANKYRAH bobbled leaving the gate then quickly recovered to take control early and moved into the two path, moved to the rail on the backstretch, set all
the pace unchallenged into the lane, drew away when called upon in upper stretch and padded the lead in deep stretch. MARINAS TINA (IRE) stalked two
wide then between rivals, angled out at the eighth pole and got up for second. WEEMISSGRAMMY away well from inside then rated behind the leader on
the rail, coaxed along at the quarter pole, shoved on leaving the bend, tipped out at the top of the lane and could not produce a bid. ADELIE (IRE) moved to
the rail tracking early, hugged the fence to the lane, chased within range with a furlong remaining but needed to find more late. PRINCESS SNOW stumbled
badly leaving the gate and steered to the inside, went two wide into the far turn, angled out while making progress and chased five deep turning for home,
shifted in to bother a rival in upper stretch and improved position. ASIAN MATRIARCH laid off the pace in the two path, spun three wide into the lane and
lacked a response when called upon. ENGLISH DANGER traveled along the inside near the back, dropped back to last on the far turn, passed a few rivals
in the stretch but was never a factor. NO WAY IT'S TODAY (GB) chased three deep to the far turn, four deep into the lane, got floated in and bumped inner
rival in upper stretch and weakened. DEFICIT MAJA forwardly placed four then three wide early, chased two wide into the second bend, entered the lane
three wide, got bumped and crowded in upper stretch and weakened after.
