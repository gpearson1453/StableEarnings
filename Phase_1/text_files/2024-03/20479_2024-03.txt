Footnotes
J D FACTOR was hustled to the front, showed the way while off the inside, vied inside of a rival while in the two path on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths pole, shook clear at the quarter-pole, responded well when given a pop of the crop in upper stretch and drew off while kept to the task under
a solid hand-ride in the final furlong. FOXHOLE bumped with a rival at the start, brushed with a foe early then steadied briefly while corrected off that
opponent by the rider, was urged along on the outside, chased in the five path on the turn, pursued the winner while remaining on his inside lead to the
furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that point and proved no match while able to hold the place. REMEMBER THE CHIEF was urged along at the
rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths pole, remained on his inside lead until
outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and improved to miss the place while clear for the show. SOUNDS LIKE FUN was urged along
on the far outside, went six wide on the turn and tired. COWBOY CACHE came outward nearing the three-quarter pole, chased the pace, made a bid
leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and weakened. FIRST TRUMPET bumped with a rival at the start
then was hustled, bumped with a foe nearing the three-quarter pole then steadied while between horses in tight quarters, angled in near the five-eighths
pole, chased inside through the turn and had nothing left. GLINT bumped with a foe nearing the three-quarter pole, chased the pace, traveled around the
turn in the four path and capitulated.

Footnotes
M B'S MUNNING chased four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, advanced on the leader in tandem with MESSI THE
MAGICIAN to apply pressure through the latter portion of the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five to six wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under a drive inching away in the late stages to the finish. CLUBHOUSE hustled from the gate, showed the
way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from MESSI THE MAGICIAN to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and came under increasing
pressure from a pair, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded the front a
furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors. MESSI THE MAGICIAN coaxed from the start, prompted the pace of the aforementioned foe from the
outside four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, advanced on the leader intensifying the prompting midway,
swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between rivals to the eighth pole, ran on to the finish clear of the rest for the show honors.
INDEPENDENT PAUL chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DEBATE coaxed from the gate, chased four then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. PERSISTENT DANGER chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
MY GIRL JAL moved out nearing the five-eighths pole, settled off the pace, gained five wide on the turn, rallied to the lead into upper stretch, responded
well under a solid hand-ride in the final furlong and held to prevail. BELLE OF THE BALL established a forward position early, was shuffled back behind
MERAVIGLIOSO near the eleven-sixteenths pole as that foe dropped back in front, settled from that point, was urged in the two path on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, opted against a narrow rail opening outside the furlong marker then altered to the outside and closed with good courage but
was too late while up for the place. MERAVIGLIOSO showed early speed while hustled, was carried in nearing the three-quarter pole then dropped back,
switched outside of the leader then moved up with five furlongs to run, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into the
stretch on even terms for the lead, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the show. LA GROTTE moved in near the
three-quarter pole then bumped with a foe around the eleven-sixteenths, tracked the leader on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased
in the four path on the turn and lacked the needed kick. DUCKPHAT was urged along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into
the stretch and failed to rally. JOLLY MISS JILL was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, skimmed the rail in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. WILL BE FAMOUS went to the front, angled in approaching the three-quarter pole, showed the way while joined on the outside near the
five-eighths pole, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in the two path near the three-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
tired. SHELLY bobbled at the start, settled towards the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the
final furlong and was no factor.

Footnotes
STONEWALL STAR was the only participant to leave the gate cleanly, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, poked a head in
front nearing the three-eighths pole, inched clear when asked for her best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. BUSTIN BAY was bumped hard at
the start then forced into another rival, settled while last but one, was asked in the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, pursued the winner in
the final furlong and willingly earned the place. VENTI VALENTINE bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up when STONEWALL crossed in front after
going about a half-furlong, switched to the outside then moved up to prompt the pace, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a
drive into upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. SECURITY CODE broke out and bumped hard with an opponent, went to the front,
contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, dropped back under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. SWEETEST PRINCESS was bumped hard on both sides at the start then checked while pinched back, settled at the rear, saved
ground while roused on the turn, was urged behind horses into upper stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed response.

stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home under threat to the outside, got caught in the final strides while running on to the finish to be along
safe for the place honors. RUSSIAN REALM got bumped at the start by the veering outwards LAST DRINK, chased five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. SCHLOMO got bumped at the start by PERNO

backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced on the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command with five-sixteenths
to go, swung three wide into upper stretch under challenge, got displaced and was brushed by the lugging in SCHLOMO with three-sixteenths to run, then

paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

upper stretch and weakened. BIG EGO coaxed from the gate, dueled from the three path with PERNO down the backstretch, shook off that rival and was
confronted by YO BANANA BOY, got displaced by that rival with five-sixteenths to run, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. LAST DRINK
veered out at the start forcing a pair of rivals to check in behind before bumping RUSSIAN REALM into FINAL DENILE, chased four then three wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. ROAD SODA got bumped at the start by SCHLOMO due to pressure from the
breaking inwards INONIT, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. PERNO got bumped at the start by INONIT and in turn bumped SCHLOMO into ROAD SODA, dueled
