SUNSET TOWN stalked the pacesetter outside, edged to the front into the stretch and drew off driving. TATUM hustled to the front inside, was collared into
the stretch then held gamely for the place. HOT LOVE saved ground throughout, was in tight briefly at the top of the lane and continued willingly. I DON'T
SEE COLORS stumbled badly pecking the ground at the start, rushed to contention then faded. TRAFFIC MASTER raced close up outside early then gave
way readily. PRIVATE CABANA lagged far behind and trailed throughout. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the second finisher for interference
near the top of the stretch was dismissed.

PEACHY WEACHY raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, angled out, closed steadily outside, moved up on
even terms with GOLDIENESS at the sixteenth marker, dueled to the wire and prevailed. GOLDIENESS set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the
far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run, dueled with the winner and battled on to the finish. TURN ON THE CHARM
pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the far turn, could not stay with the top two, then finished evenly for the show spot. SHELL BELLE raced
four wide early, then three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and had no rally. SAVE YOUR TEARS raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. WESTERN DREAM had a shoe repair in the paddock, then raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and gave way. OBSTINATE raced off
the rail, off the pace and was outrun.
