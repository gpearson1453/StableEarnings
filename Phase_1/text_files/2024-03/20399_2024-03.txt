while well back, swung wide inside the eighth pole and rallied mildly. ELLIE VICTORINA , wide leaving the turn, flattened out. LA SAMANA LAURA , in
range along the inner rail around the turn, eased out in mid stretch and weakened. BABY SOX showed speed outside the winner down the backstretch, was
taken to the inner rail when clear mid way on the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KHOZY COLBY broke on top despite a slight bobble, set the pace just off the inside while shadowed from her outside, dueled between runners from the five
sixteenths to the head of the lane, shook clear under right handed asks, kept on under solid handling through the final furlong and just fended off an inside
run from DETERMINED BLUE. DETERMINED BLUE rated close up while off the inside into the turn, was nudged along tracking the embattled trio of the
leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted in to be closer to the rail in the final furlong, closed gamely and just missed. FLOGE , bumped at the break, rated
outside rivals while four wide heading to the turn, circled five wide under a ride into the lane, came out further for the last eighth and finished well.
NEOLITHICA prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, dueled three deep and four wide into the
stretch, stayed on past mid stretch then faded very late. AT FIRST SIGHT , three to four wide, dropped back some around the turn then showed a bit of late
life through the final sixteenth. REMEMBER ME stalked inside, was sent up to the inside of KHOZY COLBY and NEOLITHICA and joined the pace fray
leaving the far turn, sparred and gained a slim lead near the quarter pole, could not quite quicken with the winner in mid stretch and faded late. TINA TINA
TINA , sluggish from the gate, angled in under a ride around the turn, moved up some past the five sixteenths, chased while saving ground in upper stretch,
failed to kick on in mid stretch then gave way. G'S FIREBALL , soundly bumped at the break, raced off the pace and failed to generate a serious run.

Footnotes
GRAMMY GIRL made the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was asked for run in upper stretch and eagerly pulled away while under encouragement.
AMIE'S SYMPHONY raced in the three path between horses on the first turn, advanced along the inner rail mid way on the far turn, swung outside in upper
stretch, weakened and held the place. AUDIBLY trailed for six furlongs, swung four wide leaving the far turn, raced outside horses and passed tired ones.
VINO FROM ERNIES , along the inner rail most of the trip, failed to rally. SHINING SPIRIT , lapped outside the winner down the backstretch and on the far
turn, was done midway on the far turn and faltered. STYLE AND PROFILE , checked in tight quarters mid way on the first turn, was outrun and saved
ground the far turn. LAUGHING FIT , four deep the first turn, circled the far turn three wide and faltered approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CHELONIAN eased out soon into the backstretch, edged up three wide in hand near the half, was put to solid pressure pursuing the leaders past the three
eighths, shifted out a bit wider in upper stretch, sustained a grinding run to collar UNCLE IRISH in deep stretch, took command and edged away. UNCLE
IRISH was urged to the front, set the pace towards the inner rail, handled outside pressure from the far turn, was guided outward when clearing into the
lane, opened up under a drive inside the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but could not withstand the winner's bid. AMERICAN D'ORO broke a bit slowly,
settled well back while saving ground, gathered momentum along the rail into the stretch, took closer order past mid stretch, eased out and churned on.
BERKS broke inward and was off a touch slow, corrected and was sent up three wide into the first turn, tracked outside UNCLE IRISH, moved under asking
to engage leaving the far turn, forced the pace into the stretch, stayed on with pursuit past mid stretch then faded. UNCAPTURED STORM , off the rail,
failed to respond. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) gave early chase while off the inside then faltered leaving the far turn.

forward factor along the inner rail for six furlongs, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. BRASSTOWN , rank at the break, bore in and hit the inner
rail approaching the first turn, was fanned four wide entering the stretch, angled in near the eighth pole and finished willingly. BAHAMA CHANNEL , outrun,
swung very wide in upper stretch. VIKING QUEEN sprinted clear leaving the first turn, set the pace along the rail to the far turn then tired. KRUG dropped

Footnotes
MINE RUN , with the pace four wide outside foes nearing the half, took the lead between rivals soon after, dropped down closer to the rail and set a rated
pace while handling outside pressure from BOLD HONOR, responded when asked nearing the lane and kicked clear, opened up under right handed urging
near mid stretch then eagerly widened while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. VERBIER lagged off the pace and off the inside, was sent up between
runners leaving the far turn, worked well out in the track for the final furlong and finished with good energy to nab the place. BOLD HONOR , five wide
outside the winner early on, dropped in some and forced the issue outside that one around the turn, failed to match strides leaving the three sixteenths,
remained on his left lead, gave way grudgingly and lost the bob for 2nd. SUCCEED had speed three wide and between runners, rated back off the leaders
leaving the five eighths, drifted six wide pursuing into the lane, corrected and kept on with some interest. PRINS FIRE , six wide outside rivals and close up
into the turn, gave hard chase four wide around the turn and into the lane, lacked a punch leaving mid stretch and faded. ENTRUST was sent up between
runners early and poked a head in front after a quarter mile, took outside pressure then ceded command into the turn, stayed around to chase about two
wide then came up empty through the drive. DREAMS DELIVERED was hard used inside of rivals leaving the chute to take the lead, was headed near the
five eighths, stayed on to prompt inside foes into the turn, dropped back some past the five sixteenths, worked outward in the drive and kept on with effort.
SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE dropped back early, raced wide around the turn and failed to menace. A THOUSAND IDOLS saved ground leaving the far turn
and weakened. OBOY moved up while saving ground to the half, angled out near the three eighths and tired. MOON SIGN , four wide, was done after a half
mile.

out. VANCE SCHOLARS settled in the clear in mid pack, edged up two wide under asking into the stretch, dropped in towards the rail past the furlong

clear around the first turn, dropped in and set a brisk pace, raced off the inside maintaining the advantage in upper stretch, failed to contain challenges from
both sides nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened late. AIN'T DA BEER COLD took over between runners into the first turn then briefly cleared, ceded to
BOB MARCO past the seven eighths, angled out and stalked, was under pressure pursuing four wide into the lane, closed in a bit near mid stretch, failed to
kick on leaving the sixteenth marker and faded. MARTINI MARTIN , off the pace and between runners into the far turn, angled in to make some progress

but failed to threaten. ELDEST SON , to the inside of a rival chasing near the half, angled out, remained in touch four wide under a ride into the lane, failed
to go on nearing mid stretch and faded. DATS MR. MO gave early chase while saving ground, dropped back through the backstretch run, angled out for the
drive and failed to menace. OUTLIER , four wide between runners nearing the seven eighths, checked sharply soon after, regrouped to pursue outside
