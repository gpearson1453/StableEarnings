Footnotes
SOARING LADY chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then inched up on the turn, emerged between rivals and took command heading
into the stretch and held on well tp prevail in the end. ITS MY MONEY TOO was brushed at the start, saved ground early, then moved up while four wide to
gain second position leaving the turn, continued to dig in gamely in the stretch but could not catch the leader and was best for the place prize. SING IT
BESSIE tracked the leader while two wide, then rallied on the turn in attempt to gain command, was unsuccessful and gave way down the lane and
maintained the show prize in the end. MOLA MIA broke inwardly and brushed foe, moved up to set the pace into the turn, was in a strong drive before being
met with outer rivals heading into the stretch then gave way in the lane. BUD GIRL was allowed to settled towards the back of the pack, then bid on the turn
and was gaining ground mildly down the stretch but it was not enough to make a difference. KEEP THE BLING was in a hard drive while chasing the pace
from the inside, was used up on the turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
PAINTBRUSH was unhurried early, then moved up to race in the middle flight while three wide down the backstretch, bid on the far turn to battle with inner
rivals at the quarter marker, cleared one rival, then dueled with QUINN ELLA in the final furlong, kicked clear just in time to be up at the wire. QUINN ELLA
tracked the pace while two wide into the first turn, was in a strong drive leaving the backstretch and inched up on the far turn to battle for the lead between
rivals, then kept on the spar with PAINTBRUSH from the outside in the late stretch then was outkicked in the end. ROYA chased the pace while two wide in
a steady drive in the early furlongs, then rallied leaving the far turn, bested the rest of the field and was best for the show prize. SUPER CINDY settled in the
back pack while three wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn while coming out five wide and closed too little too late in the home stretch.
STREET TAPPER was allowed to settle along the inside in the back pack of rivals in the early furlongs, then moved up gamely on the far turn while splitting
rivals and came up evenly in the stretch. AUTOSTRADA chased the pace from the inside mid pack at a moderate pace down the backstretch and into the
far turn and lacked rallying in the home stretch. SWANAGE led the way from the gate and into the second turn while in a long drive, then battled with outer
rivals heading into the home stretch was extinguished and tired in the end. NORDIC QUEEN settled in the back flight between rivals down the backstretch
and was no threat.

Footnotes
BRATTON was off slow, then moved up to press the pace from the two path under a strong drive, gained command at the quarter then was challenged by
rivals on both sides in the early stretch but held on grudgingly down the lane to prevail in the end. BOARD CERTIFIED was unhurried early, then bid on the
far turn while two wide splitting rivals along the way, dug in gamely in the early stretch in attempt to gain the lead but did not have enough in the end to catch
the leader. CREATIVE MIRACLE was brushed at the start, then settled along the inside, rallied leaving the far turn and was closing well in the lane and was
best for the show prize. DETECTIVE BERNARDO broke inward and brushed rival, set the pace from the inside throughout the first half then faltered leaving
the bend. HARRY was brushed at the start, then pressed the pace while three wide, settled back on the turn, then rebid in the early stretch and came up
empty in the end. BIG PAPER DADDY bid for the lead while four wide early then faded on the turn and lacked rallying in the end.

Footnotes
PINKY RING BLING stalked the pace while two wide then inched up to gain command leaving the bend, continued to lead under a strong rally, drifted out in
late stretch and held on to the wire. AMERICAN CODE was allowed to settle behind the pack, then urged eagerly on the turn, came out four wide, passed
rivals and gained second position, bid for the lead gamely then steadied in the late stretch and was best for the place prize. CROW'S NEST chased the
pace while thee wide, then bid from the inside on the turn and needed more in the late stretch. WORDS OF WISDOM raced towards the back of the pack
from the inside, bid mildly on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. FIRE SWORD led the way from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn in
a hard drive, was used up and weakened in the stretch. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of
AMERICAN CODE claimed foul against the rider of PINKY RING BLING for interference in the late stretch. After review, no change was made.

Footnotes
EMPERADOR was well rated along the inside down the backstretch, was denied room leaving the bend, shifted out to the three path, then exploded and
drew clear in the late stretch to prove best over all. RISKY PRIORITY dueled from the inside into the turn, was met wit outer rivals to battle for the lead at
the quarter marker, was surpassed by an outer rival for the grand prize and kept on for second place in th end. WICKED AGAIN chased the pace while four
wide, then bid on the turn and moved up to vie for the lead heading into the stretch, rallied gamely but lacked the winning bid and was best for the show
prize. HE SAID WAIT dueled while two wide into the turn, then vied between rivals heading into the stretch, could not retain bid and gave way in the end.
FIRST LINE settled in the back trio while three wide, was in a moderate pace throughout and needed rally in the end. GRAPNEL chased the pace while
three wide, then moved up on the turn in attempt to gain the lead at the quarter pole, was unsuccessful then flattened out in the end. BALI ROLLING TIDE
was no menace. FLEET OF HOOF failed to rally.

Footnotes
WAVE AFTER WAVE broke inwardly, then led the way from the inside, cleared the turn then drew off confidently to prove much the best. TIZ FABULOUS
chased the pace from the inside, then bore out three wide leaving the bend and was gaining ground but it was not enough in the end. BABY OF THE
FAMILY was reserved early then came out five wide leaving the turn then closed belatedly down the lane while angling to the inside and just missed the
place prize. BRILLIANT SPIN chased the pace between rivals and while two wide, maintained an even pace throughout the turn, rallied in the early stretch
and needed more in the end. FLASH HUMOR stalked the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn before steadying at the quarter marker, avoiding
inner rival and lost momentum in the stretch. TRAVIS chased the pace while three wide then bid mildly leaving the bend and came up empty in the stretch.
WOODY'S CHOICE stalked the pace while two wide, then bid mildly on the turn before fading in the stretch. ALL JACKED UP was cut off at the start and
failed to rally.
