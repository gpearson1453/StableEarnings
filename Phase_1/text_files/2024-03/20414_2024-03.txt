Footnotes
SWEET BELEN hustled away from the gate to take command, set a well rated, comfortable pace, responded when challenged in upper stretch and drew
clear late. CURT'S ANGEL unhurried early to trail the field down the backside, split rivals on the turn when mounting his rally, cut the corner to engage the
leader in the lane, could not get passed and finihsed willingly as second best. BIRDIE BLUE chased the pacesetter from four wide through the turn, drifted
out turning for home and finished evenly. MOON PARTY tracke the leaders to the turn and lacked a response when called upon. WAR MOON showed
speed down the backstretch to prompt the early pace and faded.

get passed. T MONEY went evenly as a non-threat. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU hustled to press the early pace from the fence and faded coming home.

EL BANDIDO tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied four wide turning for home, found his best stride in the lane and closed well to be going away.
MOON OVER DUBAI unhurried early to trail, made up ground on the field on the turn and continued to finish willingly gaining down the stretch. AKITO set a
pressured pace to the three-eighths pole, opened up on the turn, kept-on through the lane and tired late in the drive. DOMI was well placed in contention to
the top of the lane and failed to mount a closing rally. DONAHUE pressed the pace for a half mile and weakened in the stretch. MIGHTY PELE trailed most
of the way and showed some late interest in the lane.

HOT PRINCESS settled in hand early to be the trailer, commenced a rally on the turn circling six wide, tried to lug-in through the lane, straightened away
when switching leads late and wore down the pace-setter in deep stretch. LIGHTENING LOTTIE was pressured on the pace for the first quarter mile,
opened a clear advantage on the turn and was out-finished late in the lane`. BEAUTIFUL SCORE stalked the pacesetter from between rivals to the top of
the lane and lacked a closing bid. THIRTY SOMETHING tracked leader to be well positioned turning for home and finished evenly. WILD MARIAH pressed
the pace and weakened coming home. SOMETHING LUCKY showed early speed to be in contention and came up empty on the bend.

ARTIES CRYPTONITE stalked the pace to the far turn, mounted a three wide rally to engage the leader at the quarter pole, took command in upper stretch
and held sway. ANGEL'S DESTINY tracked the pace down the backstretch, rallied four wide turning for home and was grinding on the outside to be along
for the place in time. MY PINK BABY BIRD set a slow pace on an easy lead to the final turn, responded when challenged nearing the quarter pole and
couldn't hold off the top pair. STATE OF GRACE well placed to contend into the far turn, rallied on the bend to close ground under a drive and flattened out
in the lane. DEE'S KY WILDCAT was outrun.

the closers safe. COME SEE ABOUT IT tracked the leaders to the top of the lane and made a steady advance down the lane to be second best. R
CARDINAL PRINCE trailed to the head of the lane and rallied belatedly to be along for the show. LOGICO reserved off the pace to the far turn and made a
grinding advance that was no enough to gain a placing in the money. GOING IN STYLE showed speed to be on a clear lead down the backside and
weakened coming home.

POKER PARTNER prompted the pace to the head of the lane, engaged the leader in upper stretch, took command in a determined drive and held the
closer safe. MALIBU ROCK STAR tracked the leaders through the turn, saved ground with a rail rally, closed well and was denied at the wire.
LEFTLANEOUTLAW reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied on the turn to contend and finished evenly through the lane unable to gain on the leader. YOU
BET A FORTUNE flashed speed to set the pace on a comfortable lead, responded in upper stretch to duel and tired inside the eighth-pole. DESTINO
bumped at the break to drop to the rear of the field, continued to be the distant trailer through the turn and showed some late interest down the stretch.
