FRIZZANTE tracked the early leader from the outside of foes, ridden along three deep near the quarter pole, dug in late and just got up in a determined run
under all out pressure. ARROW SPEED settled off the early pace, made a four wide around turn and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. MY NOBLE
KNIGHT raced five wide around the first turn, sent along from the outside to set a pressured pace along the inside down the backstretch and gave way to
the top pair grudgingly late. ROSSO raced four wide around the first turn, raced near the back of the pack early, shifted five wide into the upper stretch and
had no late bid. ATROCIOUS was unhurried early on, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and lacked a bid. CUBANO LIBRE (IRE) pressed the early
leader two deep from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
RETIRED KATHY tracked outside near mid-range in early stages, made a three wide bid on the far turn, reached equal terms for the lead at the head of the
lane then drew clear under a driving finish. LETS GO KOKO settled inside through early stages, had to wait for a clear path near the quarter pole, altered
course near the furlong marker and finished willingly outside. EXPECTING A WINNER raced off the early pace, advanced between rivals late on the
backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, shifted out near the eighth pole and gained position. MY LORDS LADYNESS pressed the pacesetter up the
backstretch, hustled up two wide around the far turn, continued in range until mid-stretch then flattened out. SEAFARER was unhurried through the early
going, roused two wide around the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick for impact. ALTHENA was unhurried in early
stages, saved ground then hustled along into upper stretch and failed to threaten. IT'S GOODTOBE JOSE set the pace soon after the start and continued
on top through the backstretch, remained the leader under pressure around the far turn, got collared in upper stretch and gave way. U LITE UP MY LIFE
tracked the pace around the first turn, advanced into closer contention between rivals mid-backstretch, continued in contention around the far turn then
faded. MYA C stalked the pace and came up empty late on the far turn.

BARBSDREAMCOMETRUE settled off the early pace, made a strong move into the far turn two deep, raced three to four wide in the drive and drew off to
be well clear under steady handling. BETSYLICIOUS vied the early lead three deep from the outside of rivals, led narrowly near the eighth pole but was no
match for the winner late. D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER dropped to the back of the pack early, swung six wide into the lane and made a good late bid. CORINTH
dropped back early, raced near the rail past the quarter pole, moved up into the upper stretch to take aim and flattened out. OBSTREPEROUS coaxed
along early, raced two deep near the quarter pole, angled out in the drive and had no late rally. PEGGYSUE I LOVE U was off a step slow, rushed from the
inside to press early and faded in the drive. AVELLINO pressed the early pace between rivals and gave way.

STRONGER TOGETHER stalked the pace four deep from the outside of rivals, moved up two wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run
and surged up late under strong handling. STAR KANOO showed good early foot to set the pace two deep, was clear inside the eighth pole and wore down
late in a game effort. RECKLESS PLACE stalked the pace, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced from the inside around the far turn and weakened
a bit through the drive. HANK OLLIE tracked two to three wide and faded. FAST PAYDAY was unhurried early, raced near the inside around the far tur into
the lane and lacked a rally. CHIEF ALPHA lost ground to race far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
HERCULES pressed the early pace while racing between rivals, shifted off the rail into the upper stretch, raced four to five wide in the lane and drew off to
be clear under strong handling. STREET GLIDE rated along early under a hold, raced near the inside around the far turn, continued a rail bid in the drive
and rallied to narrowly get up for the place position late. DEEP FAITH stalked the pace from the outside down the backstretch, raced three wide on both
turns and kept on in willingly in the drive. MISSION KEY set a pressured early pace from the inside of rivals down the backstretch and weakened a bit the
final eighth of a mile. ALVY was off slowly, raced near the back after the poor start, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced from the inside near the
quarter pole, angled out through the drive and never threatened. STORM P dropped back near the back of the pack early, swung five to six wide into the
lane and had no late rally. IRISH RIVIERA raced for wide around the first turn, was mid pack down the backstretch, raced near the inside past the quarter
pole and tired in the stretch drive.
