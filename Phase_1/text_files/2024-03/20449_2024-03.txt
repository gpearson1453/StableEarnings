the turn and dug in under steady handling to hold off CURLIN'S THRILL, who settled in the five path, left the second turn outside and gave chase from that
point, raced close four wide on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. POLAR WIND saved ground off the pace, started a bid
nearing the three eighths pole and circled rivals in the five path on the far turn, but flattened in the stretch. URBAN BANDIT rated a slim lead inside, came
under pressure into the backstretch and dueled at even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. MYSTIFIED settled off the pace about the four path, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened leaving the five sixteenths pole.

SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground racing well back from early contention, started her bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved,
raced off the rail into the far turn, angled to the four path leaving the turn, dug in for the lead and widened later yards. DIAMOND'S CABARET saved ground
just off the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was outfinished for the win but came along to
take second from the tiring AVALANCHE IS COMIN, who stalked from the three path, closed to the lead at the five sixteenths pole and ran clear into the far
turn, but was caught flattening stride leaving the sixteenth pole. MALTESE ROSE came away flat footed then ducked out at the start, angled in and stalked
about the four path, took a slim lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, was met at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the
far turn. HONOUR'S CHOICE angled to the inside approaching the three quarter pole and rated the early pace, was met nearing the seven sixteenths and
dueled from that point but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. I LOVE MARIA settled off the rail, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

RUNALDO angled to mid track and gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, moved to the outside entering the stretch,
dug in to take over inside the sixteenth pole then widened later yards. POWERED BY LOVE pressured the pace inside and took the nod at the rail passing
the quarter pole, dueled briefly clear inside the sixteenth pole but was caught flattening stride later yards. O K SMARTY PANTS was bumped on the chute
then took over nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, gave up the lead past the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage two
deep while between horses on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. BERTRAM FLIGHT was jostled on the chute then gave chase, raced
at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, drifted in the stretch and was outfinished in the duel for third. HARDLY EVER BETTER was bumped on the
chute then engaged in close early chase, but dropped back at the three eighths pole, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened the final sixteenth.
DONNIE B angled sharply in nearing the three eighths pole and gave chase, but weakened at the rail on the turn.
