CREME CARAMEL prompted the pace three wide, drifted in at the eighth pole, was straightened and pulled clear to the finish. PARISIAN VIBE led in the
two path in the opening quarter, was collared from both sides on the turn and continued gamely. LEAN ON E saved ground, bid on the turn then weakened
in the final furlong. MRS BELL trailed early, angled out on the turn, was in tight and steadied at the eighth pole then flattened out. LIPLOCK was urged close
up inside then was finished after half a mile. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

BIG CITY BOB controlled the pace, shook loose into the stretch and remained well clear under a mild drive. STAR WEAVER advanced very wide on the
turn and closed well to be easily second best. AMIGOS GUITAR moved closer outside on the turn then weakened in the stretch. STRAWBERRY CONE
trailed far behind then offered some late energy. EMPIRE'S SCORE broke very awkwardly, rushed up inside then faltered. PRIMORDIAL FEAR dropped
back early then lacked a solid rally. JUST A THOUGHT settled three wide down the backstretch and failed to respond. REFUND RIGLER angled inside
early then steadied on the turn. WE READY broke poorly then raced far behind throughout. CAPTAIN CHAZZ flashed speed then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
CORONA CAMPIONE dueled two wide for command, opened up a long lead in tandem with BREEZY DANCE on the backside, chased that rival on the far
turn, re bid in upper stretch, took over passing the furlong marker and edged away, driving. MARIA SAYS SO was outrun early, advanced on the far turn,
came three wide into the lane, rallied outside in the stretch run and earned the place spot. BREEZY DANCE set the early pace, then dueled inside for the
lead, battled on the backside, briefly shook free on the far turn, dug in on the rail in the lane and weakened in the final furlong. NEXT GIRL raced two wide
off the pace, advanced on the far turn, then lacked a stretch rally. LA COLORADA raced off the pace inside and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
DIANE'S MERLOT hustled to the front inside, widened on the turn and remained well clear while kept to her task. BURNING EMBERS pursued the winner
throughout, angled out in the stretch and continued willingly. FAYTASTIC chased outside, rallied on the turn and gained the show late. NEIGHBELLINE
urged off the leaders inside then flattened out in the stretch. GRACE REFORMED dropped back early, moved very wide into the stretch but had no bid.
BAILINTIN lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. APRIL CLOVER chased within range for half a mile then gave way. BAY BAY BIRDIE
moved just off the pace three wide then stopped. SWANS ISLAND prompted the pace wide in the opening quarter then retreated.

IFIHADACHANCE raced two wide off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, commenced an inside rally at the eighth pole, made a late run on the rail and
just missed. CABRA CHICA chased inside, chased on the turn, raced evenly in the lane and held for third. MENDED WE STAND raced off the pace, chased
three wide on the turn, closed belatedly outside and got up late for fourth. CANOODLE chased close up two wide, chased on the turn, lacked a bid, raced
evenly in the lane and steadied in tight at the wire. PEACELOVENKARMA was off a bit slow and passed tired rivals late. BUCKS SOME raced off the pace
inside and did not factor. AKNA chased between rivals, continued between horses on the turn and faded.
