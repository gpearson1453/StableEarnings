rival but prove to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. FASHION LINE chased the pace and tired while besting the rest.

Footnotes
INCLUDE IT was allowed to settle, advanced on the far turn and then closed well to draw way in the stretch to prove best under a drive. AWESOME
ADRIAN was reserved early, advanced after two miles, made a bid over the thirteenth jump and drew clear, but could not go with the winner in the stretch,
clearly second best. CHOSEN MATE (IRE) set the early pace, then was confronted and dueled for the lead with RHYTHMIA, then opened up a big lead
when that rival lost the rider over the tenth jump, but could not maintain that lead and tired. RHYTHMIA tracked the early pace, then went up to duel for
command, bobbled after clearing the tenth jump and lost the rider, was collared and walked off after the race. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HARD STRIKE was allowed to settle early, jumped well throughout, moved closer in the second mile, then made a bid entering the stretch and drew away to
prove much the best under a drive. ANIMAL KINGSTON tracked the early pace and made a bid to shake clear on the far turn, then was confronted by the
winner nearing the last jump, could not go with that rival while saving the place award. THEDA'S BOY was reserved early, then had a good late kick to
clearly best the rest. SHAKA passed the tiring rivals. DON'T SHOUT (IRE) set the early pace while clear, then was headed nearing the two mile mark, then
drew clear again but tired. GLENCORRIB SKY (IRE) was settled early, then was well placed but tired. MEKONG was reserved on the inside and lacked a
rally. UCO VALLEY (IRE) tracked the pace and then made a middle move to vie for command but tired. HAND TIMED
