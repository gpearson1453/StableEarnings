RUNNIN JOKE stalked the loose pacesetter, took over nearing the quarter pole then edged away through the stretch. AFY KID hustled to clear advantage
to midway on the final turn and continued willingly. CHIP'S FRIEND settled off the leaders three wide then went evenly through the stretch. LONG LIVE
NOW dropped back inside then rallied mildly. ROMAN EMPIRE chased four wide within striking range then faltered. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT dropped back
in the two path and was never involved. GALILEE trailed early and was always far behind. INSPECTOR saved ground and gave way readily losing contact
with his field. SALUTE TO AMERICA moved close up inside then was eased when lame in the stretch and vanned off.

LOVELY CHARM rated early, angled out on the turn, quickly swept by rivals, widened and was under wraps in the final sixteenth. MOON AT NIGHT saved
ground, steadied along into the far turn, split foes and rallied while no threat to the winner. WINBORI hesitated at the start then ducked in after bumping then
raced very wide passing rivals. CHEERFUL TROUT raced within striking range inside but lacked a solid rally. PICARDY was urged close up three wide for
half a mile and stopped. MOLLY MALONE bid to the front after half mile on the turn then gave way in the stretch. LA BELLA BOROBETA moved clear initial
quarter mile then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP pressed the pace outside, led narrowly at the quarter pole, gamely held rival safe then just lasted against pair of stretch runners. SAINT
MARCO lagged far behind, advanced on the final turn, closed with a rush and just missed. SOPHOS settled off the pace outside then made a steady gain
through the lane. SEVIER controlled the pace inside, lost the lead nearing the quarter pole, finished determinedly but yielded late. RUNYONESQUE moved
close up inside for three quarters then flattened out in the stretch. I AM THAT I AM dropped back three wide and was never involved.. MIDNIGHT CAT
saved ground just off the pace and weakened steadily.

DREAMING OF GERRY far behind early, angled wide on the final turn, swung even wider in the stretch and surged clear under urging. RON DON
SCORESE settled off the pace three wide, bid on the final turn, continued well but was second best. BROTHER BRAD well placed inside the dueling
leaders, came up empty in the stretch. NOSTALGIC RUN forced the pace outside, moved briefly clear at the quarter pole then weakened in the stretch.
SHPILKES lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. THE KING CHEEK led under pressure inside, dueled and gave way in the stretch.
MIDNIGHT ACT saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. BATON raced off the leaders outside and was never a factor. BUSTIN UP was fanned five
wide on the first turn and was finished after half a mile.
