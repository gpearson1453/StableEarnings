Footnotes
CONDORA set the pace in the two path and drew off while ridden out. RED HOT SPARK came in and bumped FREE CHARGING at the start, chased the
pace four wide, was no match for the winner but kept on outside to gain the place late. TAKING IT ALL prompted the winner in three path, could not keep
pace with that foe from the quarter pole and held third. MISS ATHLETIC chased the pace from the rail and weakened in the lane. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS
saved ground and failed to menace. HOLY KINGDOM played no factor while racing four wide. FREE CHARGING was pinched back at the start, raced three
wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
PERMED bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path early, loomed three wide while being coaxed along around the turn, bid from the five
path turning into the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. QUEEN VALENTINA stalked in the two path, steadied along the inside going into the turn, was
cued midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. OOLONG HAI (IRE) showed the way in the three path
before tipping to the rail going into the turn, was coaxed midway around the turn, tipped out to the three path going into the lane, evened out in the final
furlong, but held show. CALL ME PENNY prompted the pace in the five path, bid two wide rounding the turn, was cued between foes in the four path
entering the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. OLYMPIC ARTIST bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was cued from the three
path into the turn, but failed to bid out around the six path in the stretch. EXOTIC DANCER always trailed while racing out around the seven path.

Footnotes
INSISTING set the pace inside, was cued in the two path at the top of the lane, kicked away in upper stretch, and held sway. MISTER COOPER chased
between foes in the three path, was coaxed along around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the lane, and chased on for place. MOBY WARRIOR
stalked in the four path, drifted out to the six path early into the turn, floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, and kept on while on his left lead for show.
BOURBON WARRIOR raced off the pace in the five path and made no impact around the six path down the lane. ACORUS trailed inside, was coaxed from
the three path into the turn, but never threatened. LEAVE IT BLANK prompted the pace in the two path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
CRIMSON PRINCESS settled off the pace along the inside, advanced between foes around the far turn, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, seized
command in upper stretch, drove clear soon after and held safe late. RECONNECTING bumped with GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES after the start, raced off the
pace two wide, swung four wide turning for home and finished well. PLATINUM ROCKER stalked the pace three wide, was no match for the top two but
kept on well to hold the show. WHAT'S GOOD chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. SISTER NELL broke outwardly and awkwardly,
saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. DOVE IN CHARGE set the pace in the two path and tired in
the drive. ROSY TOMORROWS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES bumped after the start, raced four wide and
never threatened. JOEYBIGNOSE was outrun while racing four wide. MY ROYAL VOW chased the pace from the rail, retreated around the far turn and was
eased in the lane. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM hit the starting gate, chased the pace three wide, stopped nearing the quarter pole and was eased through the
lane.

LOVE HER LOTS trailed in the three path, tipped out midway through the backstretch, circled inner foes from the five path rounding the far turn, kicked
away in the four path in upper stretch, drifted out through the final furlong, but held sway. ROSEBUD'S HOPE tracked in the four path, had to wait in the
three path rounding the far turn, was cued while swinging out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. DON'T GET PICKLED laid off
the pace in the four path, had to wait in the two path rounding the far turn, angled out to the eight path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. ANDIE
ONE stalked inside, was roused from the rail midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, but flattened. LATIN NIKKITA
rated in the five path but made no impact from the seven path in the stretch, pulled up on the gallop out and walked off. DONTMESSWITHTESS laid up
close in the five path, bid three wide rounding the far turn, but weakened from the six path in the stretch. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) broke out and bumped
an outer foe, showed the way in the two path down the backstretch, but gaveway along the inside in the stretch. CINDYLOUWHO got bumped by an inner

BETH'S DREAM set the pace in the two path, dueled inside of SCYLLA from the five-sixteenths pole to the wire, was headed near the sixteenth pole but
fought back inside in the final strides to prevail. SCYLLA stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside
of the winner from there, took the lead near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished late. BATUCADA chased the pace inside, was no match for the top two
but kept on to hold the show. ROSIE'S HALO chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. MIRANDA'S ROCKY played no factor while racing
two wide. KATHLEEN O. failed to menace while racing three wide. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE vied inside of the winner early and retreated two wide around
the turn.

Footnotes
FLAT TOP BOX rated in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, slipped through an opening along the rail to take the lead at the top of the lane, tipped
out to the three path while kicking clear passing the eighth pole, and held sway. ONE BITE laid off the pace in the three path, was coaxed along the inside
midway around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, then drifted in late while
running on for place. CASPIAN SEA (GB) tracked in the two path, was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, bumped
with an outer foe passing the eighth pole, then got herded inwards, and kept on for show. CRYPTONYM was unhurried in the two path turning into the
backstretch, received a right handed cue entering the far turn, but made no impact around the five path down the lane. GUAICAIPURO bumped with an
outer foe at the start, pulled around the first turn to set a clear pace along the inside, but faded from the two path in the stretch. SELASSIE stalked in the
three path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but weakened. HE'S A LUCKY GUY chased in the three path, fanned out to the eight path
under a drive tuning into the lane, but never threatened. BALTIC PRINCE trailed in the four early and never menaced. BOURBON CLEARANCE bumped
with an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack from the four path but was empty entering the stretch.
