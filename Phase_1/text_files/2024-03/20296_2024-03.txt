AUTUMN EVENING pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead under urging inside the five-sixteenths pole, shook
clear under a drive in upper stretch and held under strong urging. ROMAN GRACE was urged on the inside then taken in late on the backstretch, saved
ground while held up under restraint on the turn, waited behind the pacesetter outside the quarter-pole, was roused while angling out in upper stretch,
chased the winner under a right-handed crop to the finish and willingly earned the place. CATCHING HEAT was hustled to the front, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner inside the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back in upper
stretch and weakened while clear for the show. I'M THINKING veered out at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was
asked outside the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and tired. LOOKS FIRST was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, moved up between
foes near the half-mile pole, dropped back while in tight between those horses around the seven-sixteenths pole, was roused in the two path on the turn and
came up empty. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE STEWARDS'

FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, moved clear with three furlongs to turn, came four wide into upper
stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. WATCH HILL broke a step slow then was hustled, raced on the outside while
ridden along, gained four wide on the turn, pursued the winner while outside in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. NEPTUNE BEACH was urged
along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
RING ME was bumped lightly at the start, established a good position behind the leading duo, chased in the four path on the turn, pursued the leader under
a drive into the final furlong and weakened. WAFLR broke out and made light contact with an opponent, was urged to dispute the pace on the inside of the
winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and tired. CHARMING JIM broke out at the start, was urged along at the rear,
moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. QOROKWE leapt tracks nearing the seven-eighths pole, was urged along on the inside of
a rival, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FRANKIE R. hit the inside of the gate but broke with the field, was urged along on the
outside, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

edged clear under a drive to prevail. CAGE MATCH chased five then four wide down the backstretch before briefly tucking three wide with nine-sixteenths to
go, tucked to the two path into the turn, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place
honors. MAJESTIC MICHAEL chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure
the show honors. MIDWAY LIGHTS got away to an awkward beginning, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued
inside into upper stretch and improved position to the wire. PLAY dueled from the three path with MAGIC EXPRESS to the inside, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened. PARTY WITH SMARTY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,

MANDATORY moved up on the outside to press the pace, took the lead at the nine-sixteenths, moved clear in the two path midway through the turn,
responded well under steady urging while drifting out in the stretch and proved best. NOTAH was hustled to the front, lost the lead at the nine-sixteenths,
vied inside on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, kept on well in pursuit of the winner in the stretch and willingly earned the place. KANT
BEAT THE ROCK was well placed in third position, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for
the show. M B'S MUNNING brushed with a foe outside the five-eighths pole, went two then three wide under urging on the turn and lacked the needed kick.
BLUE PLATE SPECIAL was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced at the rear, moved closer while four then five wide on the turn but lacked
the needed response. NIGHT EFFECT was hustled from the gate then taken in hand when the leader crossed over near the three-quarter pole, raced off
the pace under urging, moved from rail to the two path on the turn, climbed some near the three-eighths pole and came up empty. HATCH settled on the
inside under some restraint, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, remained on his
inside lead in the drive and failed to respond.

LOCKE AND KEY coaxed from the gate, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in behind a quartet stacked across in front,
swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged clear to the finish kept to task. PASCHAL MOON hustled from
the gate, led early on before engaging in head to head combat briefly with BOURBON'S HOPE to his inside when four wide down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the turn and vied between foes among a foursome stacked across the track, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
ran on to secure the place honors. BOURBON'S HOPE dueled from the two path down the backstretch before vying inside a trio through the turn from the
two path, the rider sneaking a peek back at P MONEY along the rail midway on the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the front under threat from a trio, had the rider peek inwards and got directed inwards with three tugs to the left
rein forcing P MONEY to steady off his heels just inside the eighth pole, then kept on to preserve the show honors. P MONEY chased three then two wide
before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied up the inside and was
forced to steady just inside the eighth pole when BOURBON'S HOPE was directed in front, lost all momentum as a result conceding two lengths of ground,
tipped out and was re-engaged by the rider but couldn't recover when just salvaging the last major share. KENTUCKY JOKER seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked to the two path nearing the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. MESSI THE MAGICIAN coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before
advancing to vie five wide outside a trio through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the drive. FORTUNE'S NEPHEW five wide in aim of the front, advanced to vie four wide through the turn between foes coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of P MONEY alleging interference against
BOURBON'S HOPE. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

EXPECTED VALUE moved out while urged along well off the pace, advanced closer near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back while four then five wide on the
turn, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up at the finish. VESPUCCI was off a step slow, stalked the pace on the outside, made a
bid near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead inside the three-eighths pole, went clear coming to the quarter-pole, drifted to the
rail outside the furlong marker, remained clear while shortening stride into the final sixteenth, drifted out late and was denied while clear for the place. DUKE
OF GLOUCESTER moved out leaving the chute, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. SUERTE was carried in while showing speed then pressed inside of the leader, dropped just
off the pace inside the three-quarter pole, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and tired. SHIPSATIONAL was urged along towards the rear,
traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and improved position but missed the superfecta. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY broke in at
the start, moved up then was taken in hand near the five-eighths pole, went two then three wide while roused on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
came up empty. MISTICAL CURLIN broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, angled in while going
to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead inside the three-eighths pole, dropped back into upper stretch and
tired. GHOSTLYPRINCE was well placed early, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn and capitulated.
PRINCIPE D'ORO dropped back after the start and showed no speed, settled at the rear, went three then four wide early on the turn, dropped back to the
three then two path later on that bend and was no factor.

Footnotes
HOT FUDGE chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, tipped out shadowing the runner up
and then got carried out an additional path when rallying outside, knocked heads briefly with that rival inside the sixteenth marker and was just up to prevail.
KANT HURRY LOVE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, drifted out three to four
paths before being corrected, seized command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was nailed on the wire. STARSHIP DEFIANT chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while preserving the show
honors on the line. QUICK MUNNY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch,
dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, weakened to the finish. SECRET LOVE chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no headway.
RISK FREE chased five then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. MUSIC CITY
STAR coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside, struck the rail and checked at the half mile pole when briefly in tight and conceded four
lengths of ground to the front before settling back into stride, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SOCIETY MAN was reluctant to load, raced well off the pace under urging, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied five wide at the
quarter-pole, closed fast to get the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the
best under steady urging. TRUE CONNECTION broke in and was off a step slow, was urged along at the rear, raced inside to the three path on the turn,
swung six wide into upper stretch and improved for the place while no match for the winner. GLINT was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced
on the outside under some urging, moved much closer late on the backstretch, chased the leaders in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner into the
final furlong and tired. CUANDO disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the rail while inside of a rival on the turn, came out while dropping back
inside the three-sixteenths then bumped with a foe and weakened. HE HAS IT ALL moved out early, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path
on the turn, was bumped while dropping back in upper stretch and capitulated. COOL OPERATOR was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn
and failed to threaten. FIRST TRUMPET showed speed then chased the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch and came up empty.
