Footnotes
EMILYHASHERTURN vied for the lead two wide and between horses, drove clear in upper stretch and held sway. TALKABOUT tracked the embattled
leading trio from the three path, split foes in upper stretch as the eventual winner kicked clear and was second best. ADIAMONDINTHESTORM prompted
outside of the leading pair, vied turning for home, but drifted out to the five path while failing to keep pace with the eventual winner entering the lane and
yielded. HEY YOU laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the six path nearing midstretch and surpassed a tiring rival. BETONYA set the pace
inside of pair of vying rivals, but gave way entering the lane and weakened hanging on her left lead. LOCO BARN SENORITA dropped back early on, trailed
in the two path around the turn and was outrun. WAKE UP DOLORES raced off of the pace in the three path and tired.

WAR TOURIST tracked two wide and between horses, moved to the four path in upper stretch, rallied to drive past the weakening leader at the sixteenth
pole and drew clear. CECE WAVE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five to six path in upper stretch, offered a late kick
hanging on his left lead to gain place in the final sixteenth, and held from an inner bidder. GAP DADDY brushed with an inner foe at the start, rated off of the
pace along the inside, rallied in the three path entering the final furlong, shifted in before knifing through rivals in the final sixteenth to threaten inside of
place in the closing stages, but missed reaching that position. ZIPPING MOLLY brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from midpack in the
four path, inched closer tipping to the five path entering the lane and ran on mildly. SHO NUFF sped clear early on, maintained a wide margin in the two
path around the turn, but began to shorten strides while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, got caught at the sixteenth pole and faltered. SUM CHARM
broke out and brushed a foe soon after the start, tracked three deep, gained place entering the lane, but hung on his left lead, lost place in midstretch and
folded between horses. MIDNIGHT FAITH was brushed between horses and put to a bit of crowded quarters soon after the start, trailed in the three path,
swung out to the eight path entering upper stretch and improved position. BOSTON BELLE steadied when put to tight quarters by an outer foe at the start
laid off of the pace in the three path, shfited to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factorr. TAKEN IT stalked in the two path and weakened
between horses in upper stretch. BEAT THE DOUBLE laid off of the pace in the two path and tired. JUST ANOTHER WIN tracked along the inside and
weakened.

SHARP FLAME tracked along the inside, split foes two wide in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, and edged past. OH MACARENA vied two wide
around the first turn, cleared his inner counterpart with five furlongs to go, showed the way along the inside around the far turn and through upper stretch,
but met an outer challenge entering the final furlong, got bested soon after and held place. CLEARLY COPPER was slow into stride and trailed early on,
advanced shifting out to the the four path around the far turn, then sustained a rally to gain show in the final sixteenth but needed more to reel in place.
GHEE FOR THE WIN stalked three deep, chased the clear leader around the far turn, but got outkicked for place by an inner foe in midstretch and yielded.
FLATHEAD FINALE laid off of the pace in the two path, attempted to inch closer in the three path around the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch.
CASBY prompted inside of the pace setter before rating to stalk outside of that one approaching the five furlong pole, chased between horses around the far
turn and weakened turning for home. SAINT ISABEL laid off of the pace in the four path and faded around the far turn. ALWAYS AUDACIOUS pursued from
midpack in the three path and between horses early on, but steadily faded down the backstretch.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN BEE brushed with an outer rival before taking contact from an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, progressed to offer a rail bid
inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. DESOTO'S WAR raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, tipped four wide entering
the lane and ran on while hanging on his left lead to gain place in the final sixteenth. GLENN'S JUMPER brushed with an inner rival at the start, showed the
way in the three to two path around the turn, held sway through upper stretch, but was caught by an inner bidder with a sixteenth to go, yielded and lost
place late. THE GREEN CRUSADER trailed in the two path, rallied between horses in upper stretch and sustained a charge to miss reaching show.
ALYANAABI stalked in the three path, chased the leader through upper stretch, but lacked a bid and faded between rivals in the final furlong. COOLCROSS
broke a bit outwardly, pursued from midpack in the four to six path and failed to menace. MISTS OF TIME tracked from the three to four path, but was
floated to the five path by an inner foe entering the lane and gave way. TAPPIN FORA DANCE lacked speed in the four path and improved between horses
late. RUNANDHIDE WIND leaned out along with an inner rival and was forced to brush an outer foe at the start, then got pinched back between horses
early on, raced well back in the two path, entered the lane in the four path and failed to factor. KINGSWOOD laid off of the pace hung in the five to seven
path and faded. HE'S A BOMB was brushed by an inner foe and forced to bump an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside and
weakened.

Footnotes
SAN SIRO settled well back along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, launched a rally in the four path around the far turn, sustained a charge to
reel in the tiring leader late and forged an advantage at the wire. ROCK N ROLL BOLT was bumped between horses at the start, dictated terms with a clear
margin into the far turn, widened his advantage turning for home, but began to weaken entering the final sixteenth, flopped back to his left lead with seventy
yards to go and got nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. GOLDEN ERA bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked the leader from the two path, chased as
that one's closest pursuer around the far turn, but lacked a bid before losing place at the furlong grounds, and kept on. HAMILTON'S WAY bumped an outer
rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, pursued from the two path around the far turn, then moved up between
horses in midstretch. VINCITA saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and improved. SUGAR HOOK tracked along the inside,
chased around the far turn and gave way. IN FORM stalked in the three path, chased failing to sustain position nearing the far turn, and faded between
horses in upper stretch. SPOKEN CODE lagged behind in the four path early on and showed little. IRISH RANSOM steadied into the first turn, pursued from
midpack in the three path around that bend, but weakened between horse at the three furlong pole and was eased through the lane.

COPTER stalked the top pair from the inside, tipped outside of them and to the four path entering the lane, rallied to gain an advantage at the furlong
grounds and held from an outer late bidder. MACHO BEANIE bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from off of the pace in the three path and between
horses, entered the lane in the four path behind traffic, then rallied between horses in the final furlong, progressed to offer a late bid approaching the wire
but came up short. SONOFASHIP tracked along the inside, tipped to the two path entering the lane, encountered traffic trying to advance nearing the
furlong pole, moved between horses at that marker and ran on. LIKE THIS pursued from midpack in the four to five path and chased evenly through the
lane. CRAKEN JAX was bumped by an inner rival at the start dueled for the lead with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inside around the bend,
shook free of his outer counterpart in upper stretch, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and yielded. BIG BOO was brushed by an
inner rival while last away, raced at the rear in the four path, moved to the six path in upper stretch and ran on but failed to menace. EL REAL DEAL dueled
for the lead outside of a foe and in the three path around the turn, but failed to maintain even terms entering the lane and weakened between horses in
midstretch. CAMEO DANCER brushed an outer foe at the start, lacked speed in the two path and got outrun.

Footnotes
SILENT POET set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer presser around the far turn, shook free of that one in upper stretch and gamely held firm
through the final furlong. HAYES STRIKE was a bit antsy in the starting gate, settled off of the pace along the inside, pursued from the three to four path
around the far turn, offered a grinding charge to reach place late and needed more to reel in the leader. ALEX JOON trailed early on, advanced entering the
backstretch to track three wide with five furlongs to go, pressed the top pair into and around the far turn, had aim within striking range along with an outer
foe at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay and outkicked for place in the final sixteenth. REGULAR GUY was restless in the starting gate, pressed
outside of the leader, vied around the far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and yielded. ENGLISH TAVERN was briefly antsy just the before the
start, stalked along the inside early on, chased around the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
HOT PATOOTIE vied two wide and between horses, backed off to stalk approaching the far turn, pursued from the two to three path turning for home, rebid
along with an outer rival entering the lane, led in upper stretch and inched away in the final sixteenth. SABERFIGHT was bumped between horses and took
back at the start, raced well back along the inside, advanced three wide and between horses around the far turn, waited behind traffic in upper stretch, split
foes at the furlong grounds and edged place from an outer rival late. TRINITY HOPE laid off of the pace along the inside, gained in the four to five path and
outside of foes around the far turn, took aim on the new leader entering the lane, but flattened out and lost place late. KAPPA HILL broke out and bumped a
rival at the start, vied for the lead inside of a trio of foes early on, sparred with a single outer rival around the far turn, but gave way to wider bidders in upper
stretch. CAJUN TWO STEP bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the four path around the first turn, advanced saving ground around the far turn,
swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and ran on for a minor share. ARMS APRIORITY bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted four wide, led
tucking two wide down the backstretch, sparred with an inner foe around the far turn, got outkicked by an outer pair entering the lane and faded between
horses. DEBS PRAYER tracked along the inside, chased and lacked a bid. I DONT KNOW EITHER lunged inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, laid off
of the pace two wide, shfited to the five to six path entering the lane and moved up. AGAMI pursued from midpack three wide, checked to avoid a troubled
rival at the nine sixteenths pole, pursued four wide around the far turn and failed to factor. KATIE'S C pursued from midpack two wide and between horses,
took closer order four wide with a half mile to go, but weakened between horses around the far turn and was eased entering the lae. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS
was bumped between horses at the start, raced off of the pace three wide and was done early. THAT IS AWESOME vied three wide and between horses,
steadied back at the nine sixteenths pole, faltered between horses into the far turn and was eased through the lane.
