aim outside of the leader entering the lane, sustained slow progress while hanging on his left lead to bid in the final sixteenth and edged past. BOBBY TWO
SHOT'S stalked four wide, bid outside of the top pair and in the four path with three furlongs to go, vied before forging an advantage entering the lane, held
sway hanging on his left lead, but was worn down by an outer bidder in the closing stages. CAUSEWAY BENNY laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, ran on to bid inside of the leaders in the closing stages but needed more. ALVARADO CAT vied for the lead with an outer pair while a path off of the
rail around the turn, got headed entering the lane, fought on into deep stretch, but yielded between horses late. ORLEANS TOURIST pursued two wide
before being shuffled back entering the turn, chased in the four path around the turn, moved to the six path in upper stretch and pursued one paced. WHO
IS CHIEF bumped with an inner rival then steadied back soon after the start, trailed in the three path and improved between horses in the final furlong.
MIDNIGHT HALO bumped with an outer foe at the start, lacked speed in the five path and moved up. JACKSON D laid off of the pace in the three to five
path and failed to menace. ACHROMEDOUTCAT broke through the gate pre-race, vied between horse and in the three path around the turn, but yielded
before steadying off his outer counterpart's heels at the five sixteenth pole, and faltered. NAVARRIAN laid off of the pace along the inside, steadied hard
approaching the turn, then saved ground to no avail. FRAN'S STAR chased forwardly along the inside and tired. LOST MY BAG bumped with an inner foe
leaving the gates, stalked forwardly three wide and between horses, yielded while uncomfortable among foes passing the half mile pole, and weakened.

CLEARLY A TEST tracked four wide, pressed the top pair form the four path around the far turn, led entering the lane, but drifted out entering the final
furlong, lugged back inwardly nearing the final sixteenth, straightened momentarily before lugging again and bumping an inner bidder inside that marker,
then held between challengers. PLATINUM MINIT tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path entering upper stretch, took aim between horses while
getting floated inwardly by the lugging outer leader entering the final sixteenth, took contact from that one a few strides later, yet sustained a bid but missed
on the wire. SAVED BY GRACE broke a step slow before bumping with an inner foe at the start, trailed early on, pursued from the five path around the far
turn before tipping to the six path entering the lane, stayed on hanging on her left lead through midstretch, changed over entering the final sixteenth sparking
progress, then closed in belatedly and ran out of ground. TOMMIE G laid off of the pace in the five to four path, inched closer in the five path around the far
turn, but flattened out in pursuit nearing midstretch, flopped back to his left lead leaving the furlong grounds, yet kept on between horses late but needed
more. LIGHTOFMAINE pressed outside of the leader and from the four to three path, prompted while pulling under firm restraint down the backstretch,
gained an advantage from his faltering counterpart nearing the lane, but was headed by an outer presser entering it, fought on until flopping back to his left
lead nearing the final sixteenth and yielded. PIP SQUEEK bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, was in a bit of crowded
quarters between horses in upper stretch and failed to factor. EMILY'S BULLET pursued from midpack in the three path and between horse, but lacked a
response to heavy urging around the far turn and faded. SISTER ELLA showed the way inside of a pressing foe while in the three to two path around the
first turn, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole and readily weakened. THE RIDER OF PLATINUM MINIT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, CLEARLY A TEST
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
RAGTIME LADY laid off of the pace in the two path, awaited racing room turning for home, rallied in the three path and between horses to drive past the
leader in the final sixteenth. WAR SIREN (FR) stalked outside of the clear leader, chased that one in upper stretch, sustained stride while getting outkicked
by the eventual winner entering the final sixteenth and edged place. WITHOUT CAUSE set a clear pace, held sway through midstretch, but was collared
passing the sixteenth pole, yielded and lost place late. UNION MIST pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering
the lane and chased willingly. CARNANE (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside, then advanced between horses passing the furlong grounds.
SARANAC LAKE laid off of the pace in the three to two path then improved between horses in the final sixteenth. LADY CHAI steadied keenly into the first
turn, pursued from midpack in the three to four path, floated six wide entering the lane and gave way. PURR FACTOR tracked in the three path, floated to
the five path entering the lane, but lacked a bid and yielded. ARIJANA'S PEARL tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch and faded. JUSTIFY
PERFECTION lacked speed in the three to four path and between horses, then made little impact. MISCHIEF MY WAY hopped slightly while off a step slow
an was brushed to a bit of crowded quarters among foes at the start, then saved ground well back to no avail. WIN FOR SPEIGHT leaned an and was taken
in hand at the start, raced at the rear in the four to five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
DEVILSGOTACAUSE broke a touch outwardly at the start, vied two wide with a narrow advantage over his inner counterpart around the turn, clung to that
margin as that one sustained the battle into deep stretch and inched away late. STINGER BEE sparred for the lead with an outer rival, sustained the duel
through midstretch while being denied even terms, then yielded late to prove second best. IN WRITING stalked along the inside, chased the top pair and
edged show at the furlong grounds. HOUSE UNITED laid off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two path, bumped an outer rival moving to the
four path in upper stretch, then ran on willingly for a minor share. MISTER LINCOLN bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked outside, and in range, of
the top pair around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch and faded between horses. CHARNICO broke a beat slow, pursued from the
three path and between horses, took contact getting floated to the five path by an inner rival in upper stretch and lacked a bid. CORPORAL broke half a step
slow, bumped with an outer rival and was put to subtle tight quarters between horses at the start, trailed in the three path and failed to factor. COACH
CAMPBELL raced off of the pace four wide, floated six wide in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CALICOCO set a clear pace in the two path and held sway. DEVIL'S HARVEST stalked from the two to three path, took aim outside of the leader around
the far turn, but only managed to chase that one through the lane then lasted for place late. QUATERNION took up between horses at the start, laid off of
the pace in the two to three path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, advanced before being bumped to the eight path by an inner foe at the
furlong grounds, yet sustained his rally while hanging on his left lead to gain show at the wire. BROWN LIQUOR MAN brushed with an outer rival at the
start, laid off of the pace in the two path, advanced splitting foes and shifting three wide entering the lane, but leveled off hanging on his left lead and got
nailed at the wire for show. EL PERFECTO settled well back in the two path, advanced inside of rivals nearing the lane, then ran on evenly in pursuit.
BATTLE SCARS lacked speed three to two wide, bumped a rival shifting out to the seven path in midstretch, then failed to menace in tight between horses
before bumping an inner foe in the late stages. FAITH RUNNER tracked along the inside, chased and lacked a bid. ATHENS MOON tracked from the to
four path, chased in the five to six path in upper stretch, but yielded while taking contact to his hind quarters from an outer foe late. SOLID COUNTRY
GOLD laid off of the pace in the three to four path and failed to factor between horses. INTERLOCK EMPIRE trailed along the inside and made little impact.
Z Z'S PRINCE pursued from the three to five path, floated to the six path entering the lane and faded. MOMENT OF STARDOM was fractious in the starting
gate and required reloading to reset, brushed with an inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path and faded between horses turning for
home.

Footnotes
EL DINERO settled in pursuit two wide, followed the leaders from between horses around the far turn, offered a bold rail bid in upper stretch, took over and
drew off. SONOFASHIP set a clear pace in the three to two path, but offered little resistance to an inner challenge in upper stretch and remained clear of
show. BLUE EYED GEORGE stalked in the two to four path tipping outside of the clear leader around the first turn, pursued from the three path around the
far turn, but chased between horses entering the lane and yielded. GOOD AND STOUT tracked from the three to four path, chased in the five path entering
the lane and gave way. GAMER NATE leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, trailed two wide, improved moving to the inside passing the five furlong
pole, shifted to the three path around the far turn and failed to menace. TAKE CHARGE J J stumbled and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, lacked
speed along the inside, took the far turn in the four path and failed to factor. SOUNDS LIKE POWER made little impact from the five path. SPINNING ACES
pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked into the far turn, but steadied while weakening at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
RED ROUTE ONE saved ground well back, launched a raily inside of foes turning for home, tipped outside of the top pair to sustain progress leaving the
furlong grounds, bid entering the final sixteenth and drove clear. TOUCHUPONASTAR showed the way inside of a prompting foe, dueled with that bidder
turning for home, repelled his counterpart as an outer bidder menaced nearing the final sixteenth, got bested by that one passing that marker and held
place. MONEY SUPPLY settled in the two path, advanced inside of rivals into the far turn before tipping to the three path at the three furlong pole, shifted
out to the five path in upper stretch and ran on to edge show late. VELOCITOR stalked along the inside, chased closest to the top pair and from the two
path around the far turn, but lacked a bid while getting outkicked by a rival on either side in midstretch. BEST ACTOR prompted three to two wide around
the first turn, sustained pressure before bidding and sparking a duel turning for home, but hung on his left lead and yielded between horses at the sixteenth
pole. GASOLINE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the backstretch, pursued before drifting to the five path entering the
lane and failed to factor. HAPPY AMERICAN turned his lead to the right just before the gates sprung and broke slow, lagged behind, moved forward along
the inside turning for home, but flattened out. SUPER CORINTO (ARG) laid off of the pace in the three to five path and failed to factor. BLACK BELT stalked
from the two to three path but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
I'M VERY BUSY rated off of the pace two to three wide and between horses, swung six wide entering upper stretch and rallied to sweep past the leader at
the sixteenth pole. GIGANTE stalked along the inside around both turns, bid outside of the leader and gained an advantage entering the lane, but offered
little resistance to an outer foe at the sixteenth pole and lasted for place. WEBSLINGER laid well back two wide and between horses, moved five wide
entering the lane and offered a belated kick to reach show at the wire. BEATBOX pursued from the four path, crept closer around the far turn before floating
five wide entering the lane, got outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, ran on to attempt a late bid for show, but got outfinished by a wider bidder.
STRONG QUALITY bobbled a bit at the start, showed the way in the three path early on, moved to the inside into the far turn, but was headed by a bidder
entering the lane, yielded and lost show in the late stages. IRISH ACES pursued from midpack along the inside, briefly encountered traffic entering the lane
in the two path, shfited in and ran on mildly. POINT PROVEN leaned in at the start, trailed in the two path, shfited to the five path into upper stretch and
moved up between horses at the furlong grounds. ADHAMO (IRE) pursued from midpack in the two path, tracked along the inside around the far turn, hung
on his left lead chasing in the three path through upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds but gave way between horses. PALAZZI broke slowly,
saved ground well back, but to no avail. RISK MANAGER pursued from midpack three to four path, but floated seven wide entering the lane and faded.
WOODS N WATER got hung in the five path while well back, floated eight wide entering the lane and made little impact. RISING EMPIRE tracked five wide,
stalked three deep around the far turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane. JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked in the four to three path, but faded
between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
TARIFA steadied when forced to brush with an inner rival while put to cramped quarters by an outer foe into the first turn, recovered to stalk the leader from
the three path around that bend, pressed before bidding entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, sparred with her inner game counterpart
through the final furlong and prevailed. OUR PRETTY WOMAN showed the way tucking from the three to two path around the far turn, dug in to resist an
outer presser's challenge entering the lane, relinquished an advantage to that one in upper stretch, yet fought on doggedly through the final furlong but was
denied re-reaching even terms. V V'S DREAM pursued from midpack along the inside, secured show from an outer foe while shifting outside of the top pair
in upper stretch, then only managed to chase those ones home to prove best of the rest. ACCOMMODATE EVA lagged behind around both turns, then
surpassed outer tiring rivals. INTRICATE pursued from the three to four path, but came under coaxing chasing around the far turn, got floated to the five
path by an inner foe in upper stretch and gave way. MIDSUMMER MARCH exchanged contact with an outer foe into the first turn while tracking along the
inside, then faded entering the far turn.

Footnotes
CATCHING FREEDOM rated back between hoses soon after the start, trailed, picked up stride in the five path around the far turn before swinging to the
eight path entering the lane, rallied widest delaying his lead change until midstretch, sustained progress to bid entering the final sixteenth and drove past.
HONOR MARIE laid well back in the three to four path, shifted out to the seven path entering upper stretch, rallied along with an outer foe to bid at the
sixteenth pole, but got outkicked. TUSCAN GOLD tracked four wide, pursued under urging between horses around the far turn, sustained his chase through
midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead while getting outkicked by an outer pair at the sixteenth pole, kept on well and edged show late. TRACK
PHANTOM showed the way in the three to two path around the first turn, led from an outer prompter around the far turn, held sway into the final furlong, but
was bested by wide bidders at the sixteenth pole and yielded. COMMON DEFENSE pressed the leader from the four to three path early on, vied around the
far turn, chased his inner counterpart in upper stretch, but flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds and gave way between horses. ANTIQUARIAN
broke through the gate pre-race, then bumped with his outer stable-mate at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path, chased five deep while
attempting to creep closer around the far turn, but flattened out between horses in midstretch. AGATE ROAD bumped with an inner foe at the start, lacked
speed along the inside, awaited racing room in the three path around the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane and moved up. NEXT LEVEL saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. AWESOME RUTA raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but faded through the lane. HALL OF FAME
stalked along the inside but weakened through the lane. REAL MEN VIOLIN laid off of the pace two wide, weakened and was eased through the final
furlong.
