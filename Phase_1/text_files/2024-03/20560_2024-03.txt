Footnotes
JAMIE'S JOY broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace inside, was roused midway around the turn, dug in to fight off an outer challenger from the
two path in upper stretch, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. MONEY MAGNETTES broke out at the start, pressed in the three path, bid two wide early
around the turn, ran on to sustain that bid in upper stretch, but was repelled in the final furlong to place. PERSEVERATE tracked in the five path, tipped into
the three path going into the turn, got bumped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES got bumped by
an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace between foes in the two path, was coaxed into the turn, swung out to the four path bumping an outer foe at the
top of the stretch, and was one paced. OLIVIA'S SPARKLE trailed in the two path and made no impact from the seven path down the lane. VINDICATE
CHA CHA had a slow start, chased from the five path into the turn, but was empty entering the stretch. CHURCH GIRL rated in the six path but never
menaced.

Footnotes
POLIGLOTA settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, was bumped leaving the sixteenth pole but
kept on and was up in time. WHITING FIELD set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out in midstretch, continued to drift out under
left-handed urging, bumped the winner leaving the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead then straightened out under right-handed pressure and led
until the final strides. SIR MENDEL prompted the pace two wide, steadied off heels when WHITING FIELD drifted out in midstretch, angled in soon after and
kept on for the show. STING MUSIC saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and finished evenly. JOE FROM KIEV raced in range two
and three wide and lacked the needed rally. NO PLEBEIAN saved ground and failed to menace. LOVE HOPE FAITH chased the pace from the rail and
faded in the drive. SPEEDREADER played no factor while racing two and three wide. IMMORTAL LION was outrun while racing two wide. AIR FORCE
ROYALTY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. MOONSHINE RUNNER trailed inside.

BRODERIE tracked in the four path, was coaxed early around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and rallied past the inner
pacesetter in the closing stages. IMMORTALLOVE showed the way in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the four path at the top of the lane,
stayed on but drifted out slightly in the final sixteenth, and was caught late to place. GIRVIN GIRL laid up close along the inside, was cued midway around
the turn, and finished evenly in the two path down the lane for show. DEFENDED prompted the pace in the three path, bid around the turn, but flattened
from the six path in the stretch. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA trailed in the five path and made no impact in the eight path down the stretch. BURNAWAY raced
wellback along the inside and never threatened from the five path down the lane.

edged closer four wide around the far turn, came seven wide into the lane and finished well gain the place. ST. SUSAN set the pace inside, was collared in
upper stretch and kept on to hold the show. WORSHIP raced in range two wide, briefly waited for room near the quarter pole, tipped three wide for clear
running turning for home and lacked a rally. CHARDAN saved ground and failed to menace. RYO AMAZING was no threat while racing three wide. CATE'S
CHARM played no factor while racing two wide. CANDY LANDY tracked the pace two and three wide and tired in the drive. SHE PROSPERS raced in
range four wide around both turns and lacked a closing bid. PURRFECT GIRL was outrun inside. CAUSEWAY'S JEWEL pressed the pace two and three
wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
DEVIL IN DISGUISE trailed in the four path, was driven in the six path around the turn, and rallied past inner foes from said position while hanging on his left
lead in the final furlong. ARROGANCY bumped with an inner foe at the start, got sent to lead along the inside going into the turn, was ridden around the
turn, ran on from the three path into the final furlong, was caught late by an outer foe, but held place. COURTLY BANKER prompted the pace in the four
path, was driven three wide around the turn, and kept on in the four path down the stretch for show. TEST FACTOR stalked in the two path, waited rounding
the turn, was coaxed from the rail into the lane, and finished evenly. MIGRATORY raced off the pace in the five path, was ridden in the three path around
the turn, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, but made no impact. FREGON bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path,
was cued along the inside passing the quarter, but did not threaten. IRISH HEARTBEAT pressed the pace in the three path, bid between foes in the two
path around the turn, but weakened from the three path in the stretch. SHARP WONDER bumped between foes at the start, chased in the three path early
but never menaced.

Footnotes
FAR BRIDGE bobbled just after the start, saved ground off the pace, edged closer two wide between foes around the far turn, got through in upper stretch,
steadily gained under confident handling and was up late. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS set a rated pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and led
until deep stretch. CALIFORNIA FROLIC tracked the pace two and three wide and kept on for the show while slightly outkicked. DANCIN IN DA'NILE was
reluctant to load, raced off the pace two and three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. NOVO SOL (BRZ) prompted the pace two
wide and weakened in the lane. DREAMS OF TOMORROW saved ground and failed to menace. LUCKY SCORE raced in range inside and faltered around
the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS SPEEDY was bumped at the start, raced well back three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch, surged outside and was up late.
DONTLOOKBACKATALL tracked the pace three wide, bid in upper stretch, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, drifted out through the final sixteenth and
yielded late. QUALY raced in range three wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch and rallied between foes. BLIND SPOT saved ground in midpack, tipped
out in upper stretch and rallied between for a minor slice. CALL ME SPICY lacked speed inside, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, steadily angled
wider in the lane and rallied belatedly. ST. PAT'S DAY bumped at the start, was hustled to the front, drew clear in the two path around the turn, was taken in
hand late on the bend, led to midstretch and weakened under hand urging. MOANAS POWER had her head turned at the start, raced two wide and never
threatened. JOKES UP was outrun inside. WIDE WEST (IRE) led early, chased at the rail around the bend and tired in the stretch. OH DARLIN played no
factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
CREED'S GOLD stalked inside, was cued midway around the far turn but was immediately stymied passing the quarter, swung from the four path into the
stretch, dove towards the rail, rallied up the inside to bid passing the eighth pole, took the lead passing the sixteenth, and held off an outer foe.
TRAMONTANE tracked in the two path, was roused while three wide midway around the far turn, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and ran on
for place. PENDULUM laid up close in the two path, bid under a ride passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for
show. PAST TENSE laid in midpack in the two path, came under a ride going into the far turn, and finished evenly in the five path in the stretch. SISTER
HONEY rated in the three path, was coaxed between foes midway around the far turn, but made no impact in the two path down the lane. BRAID trailed in
the two path, circled four wide under coaxing around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, and did not factor. HER DIAMONDS
rankly set the pace along the inside, was roused while tipping out to the three path at the top of the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. EXHILARATE
chased inside, got shuffled back to last while along the rail rounding the far turn, and failed to bid in the five path down the lane. MIDNIGHT PROWLER
raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened. WHO LADY WHO was held up along the inside but failed to menace.
