the first turn, tracked the pace setters up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and gained ground late. JUST PLAIN ORNERY pressed
the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the second turn still in the two path and weakened in the lane. TWO BY TWO
