Footnotes
VINE JET led outside early, shook loose inside after initial quarter then widened under urging while never seriously threatened. COCO SHELL raced in
closest pursuit of the pacesetter early, faded then came again for the place. SCREEN SAVER rated just off the pace, bid on the final turn then flattened out.
HURRICANE HIGHWAY lacked speed inside, angled out on the final turn with a mild rally. SECRET PATH dropped far behind wide and was never in
contention. MORE THAN A DANCE chased in the two path and lacked a response. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM flashed speed inside and was finished after
half a mile. KODAPENDENT lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TOUGH WORKOUT stalked two wide, chased on the turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled briefly, took over, drew clear and held well under urging.
BLUEY bobbled at the break, was outrun early, moved up entering the stretch, commenced a late rally on the rail and was gaining at the end. MILAGROSO
raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane, ralied between rivals in the final furlong and closed well for third. CONNECTING stalked two
wide, chased on the turn and rallied mildly late. STEVIE T raced off the pace, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside.
CARPE ALL DAY tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and lacked a bid. SKYHOOK set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner passing the
quarter pole, dug in and weakened in deep stretch. KEEP DEM TALKING was outrun early, saved ground entering the stretch and did not factor.

BUNNY BONUS set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused at the top of the lane, drew clear and was kept to the
task. CONNELMAURA tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied but could not threaten the winner. SIRENETTA
raced off the pace, moved up four wide on the backside, chased outside on the far turn and rallied mildly outside in the lane. LULI'S DANCER broke
awkwardly, raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the backside, chased on the far turn and tired in the final furlong. CINNAMON DREAM stalked two
wide, chased on the far turn and faded. MISQUILLO trailed the field and was outrun.

ARTISTIC REASON stalked the loose leader, took over at the quarter pole and drew away while kept to his task. DESANTIS broke alertly and moved clear,
was hooked midway on the final turn and faltered. SOPHOS was urged off the pace outside and made a gradual late gain. SENSIBLE JIM settled off the
leaders three wide and lacked a response. HEY PORTER angled inside early and began fading on the final turn. SENIOR INVESTMENT dropped back
inside in the opening quarter and was never a factor. SAMARONTI chased outside and never involved. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA trailed for three quarters
then caught fading rivals. FINALIST dropped back early and weakened steadily. PER THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, FINALIST HAS
BEEN DQ'D FOR A CROP VIOLATION.

TREBLE CLEF dueled briefly inside, quickly began drawing off before half a mile, opened a huge advantage and continued to widen while ridden out.
TRICOLOUR lacked speed, advanced on the final turn and was easily second. CRACK THE CODE stumbled at the start, trailed far back, was taken up
advancing inside at the quarter pole. CHANGING THE KARMA dropped far behind inside and was never a factor. BRUSHBACK dueled winner in the
opening quarter then gave way on the final turn. BURN THE EVIDENCE prompted the winner for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

PRACTICAL COACH chased three wide early, then inside on the turn, rallied outside of TRADERS LUCK entering the stretch, took over passing the furlong
marker and drew clear under urging. TRADERS LUCK showed good early speed to set the pace, showed the way on the turn, dueled inside of the winner in
upper stretch and was no match for that rival. BIG JOHN was outrun early, checked sharply to avoid the spill at the quarter pole, then got third. DIXIE'S
TWO STENTS was outrun early, checked sharply to avoid the spill at the quarter pole, then raced inside in the stretch. JOHNNY RITT chased two wide,
chased on the turn, hit a fallen rival at the quarter pole and lost the rider, vanned off after. DALTON chased on the inside, chased on the turn, then hit a
fallen rival at the quarter pole losing the rider, walked off after. ENFORCER chased four wide early, then two wide on the turn, stumbled badly and fell
nearing the quarter pole, walked off after. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official.
