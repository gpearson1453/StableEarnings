Footnotes
BETTER LUCK vied for the lead inside, was roused from the rail approaching the quarter, drew clear while tipping out to the three path in upper stretch,
switched back to her left lead after a right handed cue and began to drift in thru the final sixteenth, but held on. BERNARDO'S LEGACY tracked inside, was
cued midway around the turn, angled out to the six path passing the eighth pole, rallied for place, and just missed the win. SIR BANANA BRIAN laid off the
pace in the four path, was coaxed midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly for show. MISTER
COOPER bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three path, loomed three wide rounding the turn, was roused passing the quarter, but
flattened in the five path down the lane. PAISAN rated in the two path, was coaxed early into the turn, but failed to menace from the five path in the stretch.
NOT A PRAYER bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the two path, was ridden between foes around the turn, but had to steady
turning into the stretch, and yielded.

MOON SPUN saved ground in range, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed through the lane and was up in the final strides. HALEY'S HONOR dueled
at the rail, drew clear in midstretch and led until the final strides. MARCO T. raced off the pace four wide and rallied through the lane to gain the show. IZZY
SWEET GIRL (IRE) lacked early speed while racing three wide, angled to the rail in midstretch and rallied belatedly. LIONZA pressed the pace three wide
and was outfinished. WUDHOOH raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. RAPID TULA dueled two wide and
weakened in the drive. CASSIOPEIA hesitated at the start, raced four wide around the turn and had some belated interest. GALLOP D'HERMES was outrun
inside. PERILOUS chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. LIL' HAYADOIN steadied near the three-eighths pole and faded three wide.

Footnotes
HABERDASHERY showed the way in the three path, came under a ride in the two path going into the turn, dug in from the three path entering the stretch,
got herded out late, but held gamely. NIMMO broke out and bumped an outer foe, pressed inside, was cued midway around the turn, ran on to bid inside the
pacesetter from the two path down the lane, but started to drift out slightly in the final furlong, and was denied to settle with place. TIVERTON got pinched at
the start, chased inside, tipped out to the four path early around the turn, and was along from the five path in the stretch for show. DOLLAR LIBERTY rated
in the three path, floated out to the five path midway around the turn, but failed to threaten in the seven path down the lane. TIZ MARKS SPIRIT bumped
with foes on both sides at the start, prompted the early pace in the two path, but backed up around the turn. BLAZING TYREEK bumped with an inner foe at
the start, stalked in the four path, was coaxed passing the three eighths, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and weakened. SMOOTH AN
EASY got bumped between foes at the start, then trailed throughout.

upper stretch and rallied for the show. ITALIAN SYMPHONY chased the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. VICTORS VALIANT

far turn but came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ROTONDO laid off the pace in the two path, advanced inside of foes early around the turn, was roused while angling out to the four path at the top of the
lane, got bumped by the inner pacesetter while making a bid passing the eighth pole, and inched ahead in the final sixteenth. SHARP EYES was prompted
along from in range in the three path, ridden in the four path around the turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. LITTLE
MINSKY tracked in the four path, was coaxed into the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. BIG DREAMER
broke out at the start, showed the way in the three path, was roused passing the quarter, bumped an outer foe after a left handed cue going by the eighth
pole, then yielded. SUGAR TREAT chased in the three path, was cued from the two path into the turn, but made no impact.

FLORIBUNDA bumped with CORRIN PEAK at the start, set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe. CORRIN PEAK bumped at
the start, saved ground in range, angled out in upper stretch, rallied through the lane and just missed. SOME OF IT was fractious behind the gate, raced off
the pace two and three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. COOL TRICKS stalked the pace two and three wide, switched back
to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and lost third late. VAYESTA bumped with LUCEVAN LA STELLE at the start then came out and slammed VINE
GROVE soon after, raced off the pace two and three wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. CHANNEL LOOP failed to menace
while racing two wide. LUCEVAN LA STELLE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn
and faded under hand urging in the lane. BELLA CARMELINA played no factor while racing two and three wide. JOYFUL ELIZA (GB) was outrun inside.
ALLOVERNOW BABYBLU broke in a tangle then was knocked sideways soon after, rushed up four wide, chased four and five and retreated nearing the

Footnotes
ADIOS NOW stalked in the three path, ranged up to bid three-wide midway around the turn, stuck his head in front passing the quarter, inched clear in the
four path in upper stretch, and held sway. OUR LEGAL TENDER prompted the pace in the two path, had to wait passing the quarter, angled out top the five
path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, drifted out around the sixteenth, and ran on for place. JABRAN chased inside, was driven in the two path
around the turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. EL CHATO bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two path and
made no impact from out in the nine path down the lane. BREEZER bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, floated out to the eight
path in upper stretch, and never threatened. ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND showed the way in the three path, was challenged on both sides from the two path
midway around the turn, but gaveway along the inside in the stretch.

Footnotes
XY SPEED settled off the early pace in the two path, came through an inside opening in upper stretch, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drew
clear. BRING THEBAND HOME was hustled from the gate then taken in hand when outsprinted, stalked inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and
ran on for the place. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) was bumped at the start, trailed in the two path, swung five wide in upper stretch and finished well. MAMBA
ON THREE pressed the pace two wide, was floated four wide turning for home and weakened in the drive. EXTENDO chased the pace three and four wide
and lacked the needed rally. FULL DISCLOSURE set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home and tired through the final furlong.
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
HEIROZAN set the pace in the three path, was cued early into the turn, and dug in from the three path in the stretch to hold sway. EMILY'S ON FIRE raced
from up close while prompted along the inside, continued under coaxing from the rail around the turn, and ran on from inside down the lane for place.
PALMETTO FURY chased in the three path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, and kept on from the seven path in the stretch for show. LACE
CURTAIN pressed the winner in the four path, bid rounding the turn, but flattened. PARADE DOWN BROAD had a slow start, raced off the pace in the four
path, tipped into the two path while being coaxed entering the turn, and did not threaten from the three path in the stretch. VARIEGATE was hustled along
while in range from the five early but backed up around the turn. SHINING SKYE got fractious in the gate, broke slowly. and trailed throughout.
