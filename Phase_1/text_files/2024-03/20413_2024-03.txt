Footnotes
MAYFIELD STRONG tracked the early leader down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, eased out into the upper stretch to challenge and
finished well to draw off under steady pressure. SLICK COUNTRY BOY showed good early foot along the inside to set the pace but was no match for the
winner in the drive. IMMORAL stalked the pace, loomed three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. WEST JET dropped back off the early
going, swung five wide into the lane and had no late rally. SAZON lost ground to race far back and never threatened. GOSPEL TRUMPET stumbled at the
break and unseated his rider.

LET HER BUCK quick to begin, set the pace three wide, got clear mid way through the far turn and drew off under a strong hand ride. PAULA M tracked the
early pace setters five wide down the backstretch, moved up through the far turn but was no match for the winner in the drive. AUNT LOTTIE dropped back
early, swung five wide into the lane and closed in mildly for the show position. K O AMERICAN PIE raced off the early pace, was four deep around the far
turn, shifted in through the stretch run and never threatened. GOSPEL BLOSSOM chased the pace between rivals and weakened. O S U BUDKE raced five
deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. MAMIE D was off very slow, rushed near the rail to contend early and faded while being done early.

MISSIN HOLLYWOOD was allowed to settle early, made a four wide bid near the quarter pole and finished well to get up under strong handling.
BLUESKIESANDANGELS dropped back to race mid pack, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. DOCTOR TINK
rated under a firm hold, checked sharply near the quarter pole, was blocked nearing the eighth pole, found room too late along the rail in a troubled trip. TAP
N PLAY chased between, raced four wide into the upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive. TWENTYONE N CHANGE vied near the rail and gave way.
HOPGUN was off slowly, swung six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. KICK IT AGAIN BOB pressed two deep and gave way. DANCING
DEVIL raced four to five wide around the far turn and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SLEW'S LIAISON stalked the pace, made a good four to five wide bid in the stretch and edged away under strong handling. CHEYENNE WIND unhurried
early, moved up from the inside past the quarter pole, angled out, closed well, took bad steps deep stretch while jockey began to pull up nearing the wire
and had to be vanned off. LORD CREW dropped back early on, raced from the far outside and rallied gamely in the latter stages. COME BET pressed the
early leader from the outside and weakened. C J'S LEGACY dropped back early, raced near the inside into the upper stretch, angled out four wide and
closed in mildly. OLD TOBY set a pressured early pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. SUIT OF WANDS settled early, raced four to five wide
around the far turn and had no rally while racing from the outside. DANTHECONCRETEMAN dropped back off the early pace, swung wide to race from the
far outside in the lane and never was a factor. MAJESTIC FLASH chased the pace from the outside, raced four deep near the quarter pole and was empty.
MR SEEKER was shuffled back at the break and lacked a bid.
