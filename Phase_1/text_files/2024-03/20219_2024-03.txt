failed to reach contention. SECRET GLENDA off rail position to quarter pole, could not keep up, faded late. KERLO'S CAUSE never menaced throughout.

Footnotes
FIRST STRIKE showed no speed to far turn rallied on and circled the field into stretch, kept on to clear late while well handled to the wire. ASMODEUS
three wide run to far turn, stayed on in the stretch no match. MUCHO MOJO widest first turn, close up on the backstretch, dueled into the far turn and
stretch, na d stayed on for show spot gamely. RUNNINGFORJOY inside run to far turn, angled out into stretch, ran on evenly. GO BALI GO outside run to
quarter pole, dueled into stretch, faltered late. FAITHFUL KING quick to duel for half, could not keep up and faded back readily. HOKU no speed from the
gate, never really factored throughout. POOL GUY raced back while bunched up to far turn, never threatened. FLIPARINO steadied along first turn, checked
hard, lost best chance. STONEMONT REUNION never menaced throughout. ICONICUS was through early, never a menace. WILD SEAN had speed inside
to duel for a half but gave way and dropped far back.
