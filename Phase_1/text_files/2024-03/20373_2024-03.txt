the turn, passed tired rivals and finished belatedly. ETHAN was unhurried early, raced seven wide and offered no late rally. SEA OF INDY raced in mid pack
early from the inside and gave way. WF FRANKLY MY DEAR set a four wide pressured pace and retreated. DON HOLLYWOOD was up close early from

FLAGS FINALE tracked the early pace, raced four wide though the turn, met the bid of HIGHER ED, dueled to the wire and prevailed. HIGHER ED was
outrun early, loomed five wide through the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed. SECRET'S DOUBLE pressed the early pace
from between rivals, weakened in late stretch and was along for third. SWEET MONEY set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and
gave way. SHAME ON ROOSTER was allowed to settle early, raced six wide and offered no late rally. ARTFUL CRITIC was void of any early speed, raced
along the inside and never fired. JEEPS STRIDE was unhurried early, raced three wide into the turn, angled in and was empty late.
