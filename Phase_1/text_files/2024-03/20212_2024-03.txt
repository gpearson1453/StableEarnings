Footnotes
WINKIWINKI , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out in mid stretch, straightened and was up near the finish. SPICY MARGARITA
bumped LADY SERENITY when coming out at the break, sped to the lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn and in the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. ROYAL WHISPER was well back after veering out leaving the starting gate, raced wide around the turn and closed with a rush between horses.
LADY SERENITY , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail throughout and chased the pace in a game performance. GOLDEN
CAN bumped LADY SERENITY when bearing in at the break, saved ground around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and lacked the necessary
response. MAMA G'S WISH raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE cruised up to the outside of DARK TIMER leaving the five eighths, took over soon after, dropped in when clearing off leaving the far
turn, was nursed along around the turn, responded to right handed asks inside the furlong grounds and held firm. DARK TIMBER sped clear early towards
the rail, ceded command after a quarter mile, eased off the inside leaving the three eighths, edged up a bit to loom approaching the stretch, gave hard
chase from there, wandered outward a bit in mid stretch, was corrected with right handed encouragement and finished with good energy. DISPUTED CLAIM
was rated back from between rivals soon after the break, came under a hustling ride leaving the five eighths, raced three wide into the lane but could only
gain mildly while on his left lead.

NEIL TO THE KING stumbled leaving the starting gate saved ground around the turn while stalking the pace, eased out to the three path entering the
stretch, advanced outside horses, took command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MEDAGOOCH , steadied in close quarters entering the turn,
floated four deep turning for home and rallied outside foes. BLUE KINGDOM , reluctant to load into the starting gate, broke last, rushed up between horses
down the backstretch, prompted the pace outside BANDITSGOLDENCHILD, bid for the lead in mid stretch and finished gamely. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD
sprinted to the early lead, moved to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, was pressured throughout and weakened late. GLASS OF COURAGE , pinched
back leaving the starting gate, stayed along the inner rail around the turn and was not a factor. LITTLE MAN GAVIN drifted wide leaving the turn and was no
factor. PEALING LAD bore in leaving the starting gate, was outrun and raced near the inner rail on the turn. KEIGS , three deep chasing the pace to mid
turn, gave way.

Footnotes
TOUISSET quickly went clear, set the pace towards the inside and under some rating, handled outside pressure leaving the far turn, opened up while about
three wide and under asking soon into the lane, swerved outward near the furlong grounds, wandered a bit from a left handed ask nearing the sixteenth
pole, was corrected and held firm while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. BRZINA , three deep leaving the five eighths, was pushed along three
to four wide with pursuit past the five sixteenths, shifted out to be about six wide into the stretch, straightened away and continued on with good effort to gain
the place. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY stumbled then bumped at the break, regrouped and pulled her way forward to the inside of runners, saw the leaders get
away a bit while chasing inside BRZINA mid turn, eased out three wide for the drive, remained on her left lead while trying past the sixteenth marker,
switched over late and faded. HOW SWEET SHE IS , off the pace and in the clear leaving the far turn, saved ground into the stretch, worked outward in the
final furlong and had belated interest. I HAVE COURAGE lagged well back to the head of the lane, raced towards the inner rail and offered a mild kick.
SWEET SHUGS , bumped at the break, recovered and moved up between rivals to prompt the pace, chased the winner four wide from the head of the lane
to mid stretch then faded.

Footnotes
NO EASY DAYS brushed with MASAI MAN after breaking a bit awkwardly, prompted the pace outside that one, took command turning for home and was
kept to his business in the drive. SUMO , a forward factor inside horses around the turn, eased out at the head of the stretch and rallied. GET SET hugged
the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, remained on his left lead and rallied inside rivals. CHELONIAN , four wide on the turn,
failed to menace and passed tired foes. BRETT'S WORLD , four wide on the turn lacked a rally. CASANOVA KITTEN worked between horses on the turn
and weakened. MASAI MAN brushed with the winner leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in
upper stretch. LOOSE GOOSE was outrun.

Footnotes
CRUSADER RABBIT broke sharply and got involved in a battle outside PROFITUNITY through the opening quarter, was joined soon after from her outside
by SHINING SPIRIT, was not fazed handling pressure from those two around the turn, responded to firm asking in upper stretch and spurted clear, kept on
under right handed asks heading to the sixteenth marker then widened through the final yards. SHINING SPIRIT moved up three deep to threaten past the
half, disputed the pace outside rivals around the turn and into the lane, could not quite go with the winner leaving the three sixteenths but stayed on well to
earn the place. PROFITUNITY disputed the early pace to the inside of the winner then inside the top pair leaving the far turn, remained a forward presence
under coaxing into the lane, gave hard chase leaving the furlong grounds and kept on with good effort. GATE SONG drafted back off the embattled leaders
while towards the inside, was under a ride two wide into the lane, worked between rivals past mid stretch and churned on. ROYAL RIBBON , three deep
early, angled six wide into the stretch, made steady progress outside runners leaving mid stretch and finished with interest. PUDD'N N PIE angled out early
then edged up to be in the clear chasing the leaders, was under a hustling ride mid turn, angled out four wide approaching the stretch but lacked the needed
finish. VINO DOLCE bobbled at the break, saved ground into the lane, made a mild run then flattened out. HANNAH GOOD broke slowly, lagged back
under a ride, angled out in the lane but failed to menace.

Footnotes
I KNOW MAP lacked speed, hugged the inner rail in upper stretch, angled out in mid stretch, closed nicely and was along in time. PRADO ROAD brushed
with CAP COM leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, drifted out when going clear in upper stretch and weakened late. HAD TO
HAVE HIM , steadied behind horses near the four and a half furlongs pole, found room along the inner rail in the stretch, advanced to the sixteenth pole and
hung. WORKISLIFE stayed in the two path on the turn, eased out four deep at the head of the stretch and lacked the necessary response. CAP COM
brushed with PRADO ROAD leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail and was no factor. SINCERITO , a forward in the two path between horses,
disputed the pace to upper stretch, weakened and steadied when squeezed back by the winner in mid stretch. BRUDER , three deep, disputed the pace to
upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FRIGHTLAND , snugly in hand contesting the pace to the inside of DOLICE VITA, was let out a bit while dueling past the three eighths, moved clear
entering the lane, responded to stout asking and kicked away leaving the three sixteenths, wandered out a bit, was soon corrected with right handed
encouragement and held firm. JARDANI settled off the embattled leaders while saving ground, raced well back exiting the far turn, gathered some steam
while cutting the corner into the lane then leveled off to his best stride late while gaining the place. DOLICE VITA bobbled at the break, recovered and pulled
his way to a slim advantage outside FRIGHTLAND entering the first turn, maintained a narrow lead into the far turn, stayed on after being headed leaving
the three eighths, failed to match strides past the quarter pole, remained clear of the others with pursuit past mid stretch then faded late. CROSSLAND sat a
perfect trip rating in range of the dueling leaders, angled four wide under a ride into the lane, gave futile chase nearing mid stretch, shifted in late and came
up empty. ALOTTACENTS , off the pace and outside JARDANI past the five eighths, failed to respond leaving the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
NEVER GREW UP saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail through the stretch, took command near the eighth pole then drove clear.
NOT THISTIMERANDY , three wide around the turn, rallied outside rivals. RETURN FIRE , under urging the opening furlong, angled out near the five eighth
pole, was three wide turning for home, bid for the lead in upper stretch then tired. THUNDERSLAM lacked speed, raced inside horses throughout and
passed tired ones. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN , four wide leaving the turn, was no factor. GINO THINKABOUTIT was outrun. SCENIC MOON was outrun. MIKE
THE BOMB raced along the inner rail on the turn and in the stretch and weakened. UNCLE CHINITO sprinted to a long lead on the turn, entered the stretch
in the two path and faltered.
