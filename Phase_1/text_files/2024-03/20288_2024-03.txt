Footnotes
BELLAJU broke on top, soon sprinted clear, set all the pace toward the inside, increased advantage through the lane while being kept to task. BARSTOOL
BABE in the second flight, roused, rallied toward the inside to finish willingly to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. HURRICANE FIRE closest
to the winner to that one's outside, three wide into the lane, had little for that one through the lane, no match for the runner up the final furlong, lasted for the
show. ALESSIA one paced two to three wide for a half, continued evenly through the lane, not enough for the show. TANDI SUE off a step slow, lacked
speed while in the two path, improved slightly down the lane, not enough for the show. BABY AVERY within striking distance while racing outside, had little
left for the drive. UNION DAME bobbled slightly just after the start, remained back and inside.

Footnotes
CASHMERE BABY bothered slightly by a rank HONDUREAS PASSION into the first turn while four wide, began a slow advance into the far turn,
accelerated while four wide midway on the final turn, challenged on the outside of a pair of rivals turning for home, wore down the leader and edged away
under steady handling. MOENCHANTED away in good order, set the pace off the rail, shrugged off a rival when straightened for home, responded when the
winner came alongside soon after, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, remained clear for the place. BLUE EMBER forwardly placed, along the inside,
continued within striking distance while saving ground, lacked a closing kick. LADY WOOPIG last away, raced back while inside, steered out three wide
when beginning to advance late second turn, continued to improve through the lane. SUNNYANDSEVENTY prompted the runner up from the outside,
lodged a mild and brief bid turning for home, faltered the final furlong. MELANIA T in the second flight while racing three wide and between foes through the
first turn, continued three wide, lacked a closing kick. REAUX BINA remained back while saving ground to no avail. KAVA five down to four wide through the
first turn, three to five wide through the second bend, lacked a closing rally. SKY RAVEN in the second flight in the two path and between horses, tired after
a half. HONDURAS PASSION very rank into the first turn, raced wide, trailed home.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MOMENT broke in then came out, was righted to race forwardly and inside, rail bid late in the turn, extended drive to the wire, proved narrowly
best while remaining along the inside. LUNDBERG within striking distance off the inside, four wide and between rivals turning for home, lost ground to the
rail hugging winner as a result, slowly getting back to that one late. FUNNY UNCLE broke into the gap to be away slowly, continued to lag for a half, came
three wide for the drive, shifted out nearing the furlong grounds and staged a belated rally to annex the show through some traffic. ROCKING ROCKET
moved outside, three wide turning for home, within striking distance a furlong out, lacked a closing punch. FASHION KING slight bother after the break,
back off the pace and the inside, fanned five wide out of the turn, lacked a rally. CONGRATS ON FIFTY moved up to take command after the start, set the
pace in the two path, allowed the winner the inside late in the turn, began to back up when headed by that one into the lane then continued to weaken the
final furlong. POWER SLAM was finished early, trailed in.

Footnotes
EIGHT STRAIGHT lacked early foot well out in the strip, began to advance five wide into the turn, outside bid turning for home, kicked well clear under
steady handling. BOURBON ON FIRE broke back, lacked speed off the inside, was five wide out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to be in time
for the place, not a threat to the winner. CADILLAC COWBOY in the second flight off the inside, chased the leader through the turn, proved no match for the
winner in the drive nor able to contain the runner up, saved the show. MISCHIEVOUS MAX away in good order, cleared up front along the inside, faltered
when headed entering the stretch. CHADRON in mid pack while racing off the inside, came three wide for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a
closing kick. EQUATE broke in, bothered rival, was straightened for race forwardly for a half along the inside, had little left for the drive. FLYHERBFLYHIGH
in mid pack, moved inside turn, failed to rally. BRAHMS JR. went one paced while three wide throughout. GET AWAY WITH IT steadied when in tight at the
break to be away slowly, remained always back. BERRYVILLE BULLET bobbled at the break, raced back and well wide, four to five wide turn, remained
back. ALWAYS A KING in the second flight while four wide into the turn, began to back up before a half. GUYDON pinched to be away slowly, five wide
turning for home, remained back.

Footnotes
SHOW ME THE CANDY unhurried early along the inside, continued to be patiently handled along the rail through the turn when creeping closer, slipped
thru entering the stretch to challenge, clear a furlong out, held to the wire under steady handling. CHIP SHORTAGE lacked early foot, improved inside of
traffic into the lane, rallied up the rail to narrowly annex the place. RISKY SPIRIT in tight at the break, raced in mid pack outside, four to five wide when
moving on the two leaders late in the turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner nearing midstretch, could not match that one to the wire, nipped late
for the place. THORN CROWN bothered a bit at the break, void of speed in trailing early off the inside, four wide into the stretch, displayed some mild
interest to the wire. TIZ SWEET CANDY broke sharp, dueled up front closest to but not on the inside, allowed the winner the inside into the stretch and
began to weaken. CHARLOTTES WAY raced off the pace and the inside, two path through the turn, evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick.
CUPID'S MUSIC bumped to be away slowly, raced well wide, five path through the turn,picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. OH MY
GAWD broke in to bother a couple of inner rivals, dueled outside for a half and began to weaken. ADIOS MUCHACHAS chased the dueling leaders in the
three path for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
BIZZY LEGS away in good order, set or forced the pace off the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, drew clear under steady
handling to the wire. GREATHEART raced back off the pace in the three path through the first turn, three to four wide second turn when advancing, closest
with furlong to run, prove no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. CANADIAN PHAROAH settled off the pace toward the inside, saved ground
far turn, steered out three wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to annex the show. TEST PILOT broke sharp, allowed the two leaders to go early,
stalked that pair off the inside, had little for the drive. DEEP STATE off the pace and the inside, three wide onto the backstretch, moved inside, saved
ground through the second bend and into the stretch, improved a bit late while remaining inside. MAKE NOISE in some traffic when firmly handled into the
first turn, moved out, raced four to five wide through the second turn, improved slightly through the stretch. KOWBOYKABIN away in good order, dueled up
front inside the winner for six furlongs, first to blink turning for home. EGO lacked early foot, in traffic into the first turn, remained back up the backstretch,
improved through some traffic into the lane then went flat the final furlong. DREWPOWER raced in mid pack toward the inside, had nothing for the drive.
TURN ON THE MAGIC off the pace outside, four wide onto the backstretch, continued outside, four wide again late in the final turn when giving way,
continued to fade.

Footnotes
BIG PAPER bumped start, allowed the pace to go early, moved out, advanced four to five wide late in the final turn, engaged the leader from the outside
inside the furlong marker and drew clear under firm handling. DANCE SOME MO lacked speed inside, pulled up the backstretch, continued to save ground
far turn, moved a bit closer in traffic with a quarter to run, between horses into the stretch, finished up willingly through some traffic late to earn the place.
LEADER OF MEN outrun early while four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit by late in that bend, rallied four wide into the stretch, took over and was
briefly clear a furlong out, could not last. MYSTERY MO saved ground while racing off the pace, angled out to be four wide in traffic late in the final turn,
displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position. EFFICIENCY settled off the pace early, second flight between horses in the second turn,
waited in traffic with a quarter to run, came up empty when clear the final furlong. ROYAL ACT four wide in the first turn when with the second flight,
continued in that second group up the backstretch, challenged three wide midway on the final turn, faltered in the drive. FIGHT'N READY broke back,
lacked speed, angled out sharply when moving a bit closer late in the final turn, six wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat.
WHAT A COUNTRY bumped at the start, trailed well back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BANDERA AZTECA pressed
the issue from off the inside for six furlongs, gave way turning into the stretch. TOMA TODO broke on top, set the pace inside until headed entering the
stretch and stopped.

FREE LIKE A GIRL tracked the issue along the inside, in traffic into and through the far turn, steered out three wide, set down when clear into the lane,
closed with good courage to be up in time. BACKYARD MONEY forwardly placed outside, continued to prompt the issue the middle three furlongs,
advanced and challenged on the outside midway on the final turn, showed the way into the stretch, shook clear furlong out but was unable to contain the
winner, clear for the place. STELLAR LILY set or forced the pace off the inside early, fell back off the runner up and another rival on the final turn, went
evenly through the stretch to be clear for the show. INTO DISCO last away, void of speed four wide into the first turn, continued back, moved closer four
wide turning for home, flattened out a bit the final furlong to finish up evenly. JOKE SISI (CHI) set or forced the pace toward the inside, chased the runner up
into the stretch, faltered through the stretch. BOW DRAW lacked speed, made little impact through the stretch. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH main group while
four wide first turn, moved closer three wide in the second turn tired in the drive. LOVER GIRL was finished after a half while off the inside. JUBELLA four
wide through the first turn, four to five wide second, outrun.

Footnotes
USUALLY WRONG broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch inside, was given a bit of a breather into the turn, shrugged off nearest pursuer turning
for home then held the drifting runner up at bay under steady handling late. COACH JIMI D forwardly placed inside, steered out four wide when advancing
late in the turn, tried the winner from the outside nearing the furlong marker, drifted out soon after, fell back off that same foe as a result then was slowly
gaining late. MORUNNING broke back, steadied slightly in some traffic into the turn, came four wide for the drive, rallied to be up late for the show, not a
serious threat to the top two. FLASHY FAST in mid pack outside, three wide through the turn, bettered position a bit in the drive with some modest interest.
JESTER SANG closer in the second flight through the turn while off the inside, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. MAJOR MACK four wide
through the turn in the second group, lacked a closing response in the drive. HAILSTORM lacked speed inside, was never a serious threat while continuing
to save ground. VILLAIN broke back, void of speed just off the inside, passed some faltering rivals. HAPPY GREY pressed the winner for a half from the
outside, gave way in the drive. STRAIT RUSH broke back, was not a threat four wide. VICTORY DASH forwardly placed three wide, stopped through the
stretch.
