Footnotes
HAPPYMAC close up from the start, dueled up front in the two path, salted the other speed away inside the furlong grounds and kicked clear. GOOD
HEART away in good order, narrowly set a pressured pace up the backstretch, raced on equal terms with the winner and through upper stretch, could not
match strides the final furlong, remained clear for the place. DRIFTER last away, continued to lag for five furlongs while along the inside, rallied up the rail to
be along for the show. CREME DE LA CHROME lacked speed, four wide through the turn, improved into the lane with some mild interest, stalled inside the
furlong marker, outkicked for the show. SPOTTED BULL closest to the dueling leaders while heading up the second flight along the rail, came up empty for
the drive. TIGER DAD forwardly placed early while three wide, gave way from between horses turning for home. BIG SWEDE broke back, moved outside,
four wide into the turn when with the second group, also backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
CLASSY EDGE prompted the leader while off the inside, challenged outside that one midway on the turn, gained command and slowly increased advantage
under steady handling. PREDICTING back off the early pace just off the inside, began to advance far turn, dropped inside and continued to advance into the
stretch, finished up willingly to be clear of the others. DIFFERENTLY headed up the second flight while just off the inside for a half continued in the two path
for the drive, proved no match for the top two in the drive, lasted for the show. PRINCIPAL ANITA off a step slow, raced back, swung out be four wide into
the stretch, staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip to finish willingly, too late for the show. BOOGIE ON off slowly, continued to trail turn while in the
two path, staged a mild, belated rally to improve position. HONDURAS PASSION lacked early foot, raced back, improved position late while not a serious
threat. OCEAN BIRD broke sharp, set a quick opening quarter along the inside, gave way when headed entering the stretch. BABE IN THE WOODS in mid
pack along the inside, continued to saved ground ground, had little for the drive to finish up evenly. BRIEF NOTE lacked speed outside, four to five wide
turn, failed to muster a rally. BONNIE LASS evenly paced for a half in the three path, tired through the stretch. TEXAS HOTTIE forwardly early outside, four
to five wide turn, stopped through the stretch.

MUSICAL MAESTRO allowed the pace to go early while off the inside, moved closer in the two path through the turn, engaged the leader from the outside
when straightened for home, dueled past the furlong marker, gained the advantage soon after, drifted out slightly, held sway late under firm handling.
NOFURTHERQUESTIONS in the second flight inside, steered out to be three wide into the stretch, closed the gap on the winner, angled in as that one was
drifting a bit to come in near contact just after the furlong marker, was straightened, came in again late bumping with GUCCI BOY, could not get back to the
winner in the waning strides. GUCCI BOY behind the early leader inside, continued forward into the stretch, covered up in some traffic behind the two
leaders past the furlong marker, steered out late in an attempt to hit a narrow opening between that top pair with less than a sixteenth remaining, bumped
with NOFURTHERQUESTIUONBS, steadied and crossed the wire wrapped up. TRABR'S CREED broke alertly, cleared and showed the way up the
backstretch and through the turn, extended that advantage through upper stretch then weakened when confronted the final furlong. WILSON BAY in mid
pack while between horses, four wide into the stretch, displayed some mild interest well out in the strip. HAPPY TEARS in the main group while well wide,
four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. TAKE MY ALLOWANCE off a step slow, trailed while saving ground, in lacking a rally. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NOFURTHERQUESTIONS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND
PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
QUICK BUCK in the second flight while in the two path, closer in some traffic late in the turn between foes, steered out five wide into the stretch, bid, clear
past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. CRAVENSWORTH last to leave, raced back toward the inside, angled four wide into the
stretch, angled widest when straightened for home, set down, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. ASYMMETRIC back off the pace early inside,
angled out steadily through the turn, worked way out to be six wide for the drive while inside the runner up, could not match that one late or do much with
the winner while up late to gain the show. BORDINOS in mid pack inside, advanced in some traffic late in the turn then slipped through along the rail turning
for home saving considerable ground over several rivals, challenged and vied past the furlong along the rail, weakened, lost the show late. DEUS EX
MACHINA forwardly placed, floated out to be four then five wide into the lane, lodged a brief bid approaching the furlong grounds while between horses and
hung. LAST OUTLAW back off the pace well out in the strip, four wide through most of the turn, lacked a rally. ISOCLINE vied up front closest to the inside,
weakened final furlong from between horses. WORK ORDER dueled front while off the inside, continued to battle into the stretch, gave way the final furlong
as well. WORTHTHEMONEY in mid pack off the inside, was finished before a half.

TAXED off a step slow, was outrun in the run up the backstretch, began to advance turn, came three wide for the drive, closed full of run to win going away,
out seven furlongs in 1:23.53. PALACEIN away in good order, quickly sprinted clear while angling toward the inside, breather turn, continued to hold a
daylight advantage past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner to the wire, held the place. BACKYARD MONEY in the second flight, moved
closer along the inside late in the turn, continued up the rail through the stretch, not enough for the place. ALWAYS ANGELS in the second flight while
racing three wide, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. HYPERSPORT chased in the two path, gave way in the drive. AMERICAN
ROCKETTE off a step slow, trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. VERYLITTLECENTS off a step slow, remained
back. MAIRSILS FIRST mid pack inside, stopped in the turn, distanced after the issue had been decided, jogged in.

Footnotes
VIOLENT RIVER outrun in the early going, advanced into contention with a four wide move through the turn, took over, fully extended to hold the runner up
at bay late while outside that one. WITHOUT OBJECTION off a step slow, moved up to a forward position the opening quarter, shuffled back in some traffic
into the turn, patiently handled when lacking clear room late in the turn, got through inside, closed the gap on the winner slowly in the final furlong, clear for
the place. HONEST OPINION in mid pack while off the inside, challenged and vied three wide and between rivals while inside the winner turn, raced on
equal terms with that one nearing the furlong marker then gave ground grudgingly to that rival and the runner up to the wire. DANCIN ROCKET away in
good order, narrowly set a pressured pace along the inside for a half then began to gradually weaken entering the stretch. GUST OF WIND within striking
distance out in the strip while between horses, four wide into the turn, second flight turning into the stretch, came up empty in the run to the wire.
PALMETTO DEVIL in mid pack along the inside, raced in traffic through the turn, also failed to respond when called on when clear for the drive. NO MO
WHINING hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, improved a bit through the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. CHROME
CANDY in the large second flight into the turn well wide, five path through the lane, had little left for the drive. MO ANGELL broke alertly, vied up front in the
two path, gave way from between horses exiting the turn. GUYDON off slowly, remained always back. NATIVE MOONSHINE in the main body widest, six
path through the turn, faded.

Footnotes
ASTERNIA broke behind the early leader, moved up to duel with that one through the turn, kicked steadily clear through the lane while kept to pressure.
BLUE SQUALL in the second flight while between horses for a half, asked along into the lane, proved no match for the winner, edged clear for the runner up
spot. XTREME SMOKE SHOW last away, raced in the second group inside, steered out a bit to be in the two path into the lane, split foes. TX WOMEN FOR
ARTS fell back to trail, saved ground into turn, steered out three wide into the lane, set down, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improved
position a bit. XTREME DIVA broke alertly, in the second flight outside, moved closer three wide late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. BROOKLYNN
DREW away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch inside the winner, dueled with that one through the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HAULIN ICE outbroke some outside trouble along the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear when straightened for home, held the runner
up safe late under firm handling. TIMBAVATI stalked the pace while off the inside, fell back, three wide for the drive, slowly getting back to the winner late.
MS CARROLL COUNTY broke in to tighten up a foe at the break, continued to come in to bother a couple of more rivals the opening furlong, chased the top
two throughout to finish up best of the rest. COUNT IT ALL JOY in tight at the break, raced back, angled in a bit to be in the two path for the drive, improved
position, no real threat. THE GIRL IN RED in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went one paced through the lane in lacking a closing
response. LASSIE MY GIRL bothered soon after the start, raced back off the pace, dropped to the inside late turn, also lacked closing response. SASSY
LASS last to leave, four to three wide through the turn, lacked a rally as well. STHENIC bothered early, three wide through the turn when off the pace, tired
in the stretch. APPEALING ADDIE broke back, was never a threat. DOUGHTY moved up closer along the inside late backstretch, gave way in the turn,
pulled up out of the turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER stalked the two leaders up the backstretch, advanced on that pair late in the turn, challenged three wide and between horses entering
the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, dug in late and found just enough to gain the nod at the wire. TEJANO TWIST last away,
moved out three wide for the run up the backstretch, closer four wide turning for home to concede real estate to three of his four rivals, regathered, set down
with vigorous left then right handed crop, was going willingly at the end only to miss the nod. RYVIT dueled up front along the inside, continued to battle
between horses into and through upper stretch, proved stubborn until late before yielding to the top two. SURVEILLANCE moved up to duel just after the
start, continued to alternate up front into and through the turn in the two path, battled on between horses with a furlong to run then yielded late. OSBOURNE
lacked speed, raced in the two path behind the first flight through the turn, had little for the drive.

Footnotes
ROCKET CAN off a step slow to be last away, unhurried early off the inside, launched a professional move four wide through the second turn to reach
contention, challenged into the stretch, took over when straightened for home, and maintained that advantage late under steady handling. TAPSASIONAL
set or forced the pace in the two path, responded after disposing of the other while being challenged by the winner and another rival from the outside late in
the final turn, ran on well to end to finish a game second. ALEJANDRO void of speed, moved out to be four wide when asked along late in the final turn,
long drive while widest of the main group stretch, prevailed for the show. HEROIC MOVE angled in from four to two path first turn to save some ground,
continued just off the inside, moved a bit closer late in the final turn, came three wide into the stretch, finished up mildly while in some traffic a sixteenth from
the wire. HARLOCAP within striking distance while three wide, advanced and challenged in the second while remaining in the three path, between horses
and inside the winner into the stretch, weakened late. SECRET POCKET settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through most of the second
bend, lacked a closing kick. TEXAS RED HOT void of speed, was continuing to race back when getting out late in the final turn, failed to menace stretch.
WARREN L away best of all, dueled up front inside the runner up for six furlongs, gave way midway on the final turn. LUCKY BOSS prompted the early
pace while racing three wide, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
RUNNINTHESTREETS broke back, lacked speed, strong move four to five wide turn, engaged the runner up turning for home, dueled, drifted out, proved
best late under firm handling. WILDWOOD QUEEN moved up to vie after the start, four wide into the turn, shook clear late in the bend while angling in,
responded when confronted by the winner exiting the bend, raced on equal terms with that one past the furlong marker then could not match strides late,
well clear for the place. QUEEN MALLARD broke back, moved up inside, shuffled back along the rail early turn, fell back, continued to save ground,
improved upper stretch and then finished up evenly to prove best of the rest. MY JULIA in traffic early when covered up in the run up the backstretch,
continued in traffic turn, three wide turning into the stretch, improved a bit, not enough for the show. Q'S YOUR MAMA in mid pack between horses, shuffled
back into the turn three wide, moved out and was five wide turning into the stretch, went evenly through the stretch. ARIEL M D broke back, fell further back
when sluggish, saved ground turn, bothered by a tiring rival along the rail upper stretch, checked up, displayed some interest after recovering. THIS
DAMSEL MAYFLY void of speed, worked around a tiring rival turn, shifted out for the drive, passed some tiring horses to improve position. DEVLISH GAL
broke back, moved up and briefly appeared to be a threat four wide through the turn, faltered in the drive. J J'S JOY vied up front along the inside, fell off the
runner up midway on the turn, continued to tire stretch. WHO LU in the second flight between foes and three wide into the turn, four wide exiting, tired
through the stretch. SPARKLY off slowly, raced four wide through the turn and remained back. MISS MO MESA with the pace for three furlongs between
foes, gave way.
