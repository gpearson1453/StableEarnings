Footnotes
BLUE TIMES pressed the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drove clear.
BIZYMALINE set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths pole, fought on inside of that foe past the eighth pole but settled
for second best late. HARLAN'S LEGACY chased the pace three wide, could not gain on the top two but kept on to best the rest. NOTHING BUT PUMPS
raced well back two and three wide and rallied belatedly. MACASSA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. STREAKING GREY pressed the
pace between the top two around the first turn and steadily faded from there. CAMI RUNNER bumped with WINNING AT EASE entering the first turn,
angled in midway around that bend and never threated. MONEY FACTOR raced in range two and three wide, steadied off heels near the quarter pole and
had no further bids. WINNING AT EASE was bumped entering the first turn, saved ground that bend, went three wide around the far turn and was never
involved.

Footnotes
IZZY D'ORO laid up close in the three path, was roused to bid going into the far turn, took the lead midway around the far turn, and drew clear while tipping
to the rail down the lane. BORN FLASHY tracked in the three path, got stymied between foes in the two path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the
three path entering the lane, and chased on for place. ITS BOURBON THIRTY stalked inside, came under a ride from the rail midway around the far turn,
was in the two path entering the stretch, tipped out to the four path around the sixteenth, and kept on for show. AZ U CHASE ME raced off the pace inside,
was coaxed along in the two path around the far turn, but made no impact. ROUGHSHOD laid in range in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, but
flattened in the five path down the lane. HIGHLAND PEAK raced in midpack in the two path, checked early into the backstretch, was roused from the three
path into the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, but failed to bid. MO' SPRESSO was held up in the two path turning into the
backstretch, driven in the three path around the far turn, but failed to threaten in the eight path down the lane. CPTBOBSBTWENTYNINE showed the way
along the inside down the backstretch, but gaveway turning into the stretch. SIR MENDEL had a slow start, rated in the four path, but got floated out to the
six path midway around the far turn, and failed to menace. RAMESSES chased in the three path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, but
weakened in the stretch. DAKOTA COUNTRY broke slow then had to check after the start, got herded out to the seven path by a loose horse leaving the
first turn and could never get involved. ZAPATA (IRE) bobbled and lost the rider at the start, bothered DAKOTA COUNTRY around the first turn, competed
the circuit, was caught after the race and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE

FLAMMABLE at the start, trailed inside, swung five wide in upper stretch and finished well. RICHY saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper
stretch, continued on the left lead and gained the show between foes. UNCLE B dueled at the rail and weakened in the final furlong. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE

three path, came under a ride along the inside early around the turn, but faded from the two path in the stretch. BINGO WAS HIS NAME bumped with an
outer foe at the start, was hustled from in range in the three path, but drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, and flattened. WEMBY bumped with an
inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, floated out to the nine path turning into the stretch, and failed to menace. GROUP TICKET bumped with an

foes at the start, raced off the pace two wide, made progress inside of foes in upper stretch, steadied near the eighth pole and had no further bids. XY FACE
set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole. FLASHOVER checked early on the first turn, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
FRAC DANCER set the pace in the three path, merged to the two path going into the turn, was cued turning into the lane, drifted to the rail on his left lead
passing the eighth pole, but held sway. RUNNIN' ROCKET stalked in the two path, was roused from the rail midway around the turn, hung on his left lead in
the stretch, and tipped out in the final sixteenth while running on for place. LIGHTING CLOUDS tracked in the five path, ranged up under a ride in the four
path midway around the turn, and kept on from the five path in the stretch for show. REEF RUNNER bumped between foes at the start, chased in the two
path, was ridden three wide around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and flattened. GENERAL LEDGER bumped with an outer
foe at the start, raced off the pace inside, was coaxed midway around the turn, but never threatened from the three path in the stretch. A G DIAMOND
pressed the early pace in the four path but backed up between foes around the turn.

Footnotes
GLOBES raced well back two and three wide, swung six wide turning for home, closed outside, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and forged ahead under
a drive. MUFRIH raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch, could not withstand the winner but held
well clear of the rest. EYES OF CHAMPION raced off the pace two and three wide and was along for the show. MISTER MOORE saved ground off the
pace, made a rail bid in midstretch and flattened out in the final furlong. MIDWAY MISCHIEF saved ground and failed to menace. IMPRESSIVE SPEED
trailed inside, swung seven side in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. ARAK raced off the duel in the clear two and three wide, took the lead near the
quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. SWATH dueled two wide, drew clear and angled in nearing the far turn and faltered near the
quarter pole. KINGDOM ON PAWS dueled inside around the first turn, angled out entering the far turn, chased around that bend and came up empty in the
lane.

Footnotes
BRYCE CANYON chased in the three path, was ridden into the far turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, tipped inwards while rallying passing the
sixteenth, and got up in the closing stages. HONESTO stalked in the five path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, got floated out to the seven
path at the top of the lane, ran on while tipping inwards, bumped with an inner foe late, and got up for place. SWAGGISH got a bit keen while up close in the
four path turning into the backstretch, was cued from the two path into the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, kept on while tipping
inwards, briefly led passing the sixteenth, bumped with an outer foe late, and was overtaken on both sides to show. EL SOCIO showed the way in the three
path down the backstretch, was cued in the two path passing the quarter, but evened out between foes in the final furlong. COACH ABERNATHY tracked in
the two path but faded along the inside in the final furlong. READYSEEKGO hopped at the start, trailed in the two path early and never threatened. LUNAR
ROCKET had a slow start, raced off the pace in the four path and never menaced.

Footnotes
FIVE TOWNS (GB) stalked the pace from the rail, swung five wide turning for home, kicked in and won going away. DEMOGORGON settled off the early
pace while racing two wide, circled four wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but kept on to hold clear of the
rest. JOHANNY raced in range two wide, lacked the needed rally but kept on to gain the show. STEPHANIE'S CHARM dueled two wide to upper stretch
and weakened. PAWKY stalked the pace three wide, bid three wide between around the far turn, led near the five-sixteenths pole but faded in the drive.
TRANSPARENCY trailed two and three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and was no threat. GRACE DARLING (IRE) dueled inside and retreated after
six furlongs.

Footnotes
ROLL ON BIG JOE chased inside, tipped out to the three path under a nudge midway around the turn, took aim in the five path at the top of the lane, and
kicked on past an inner foe in the closing stages. JET WINGS set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside turning into the stretch, but hung on
his left lead, and was caught in the final strides by an outer foe in the final strides to place. COMMANDANT trailed in the two path, tipped out to the four path
under a ride turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. LOYAL LOUIE tracked in the two path, was driven in the four path around the turn, but failed to
bid from the six path down the lane. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS raced off the pace in the four path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but
made no impact. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND stalked inside, was coaxed midway around the turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened.
FAST FIXER pressed in the three path but gaveway in the stretch.
