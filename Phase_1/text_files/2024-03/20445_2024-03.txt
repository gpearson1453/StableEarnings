drive. JULIA'S WARRIOR laid off of the pace three to four wide and stayed on to gain [lace in the final sixteenth. TIME TO MEDDLE led along the inside
early on, dueled with an outer bidder around the turn, gave way to that one entering the lane, lost place in the final sixteenth and saved show. LET'S GO
RANDOM laid off of the pace two to three wide, ran on along with an outer rival into midstretch got outkicked by that one nearing the final sixteenth and kept
on to miss reaching show. UNCLE NICK pressed two wide and between horses early on, chased into and around the turn, then faded.
THUNDERTAKESDALEAD trailed in the three to four path and made little impact. CARLOS PUNCH broke a step slow and was put to crowded quarters
between foes at the start, tracked along the inside and weakened.

BEAUTIFUL LIFE tracked from the three to five path, bid in upper stretch and drove clear passing the furlong grounds. CAJUN BLAST hopped slightly at the
start, vied two wide and between horses, sustained a duel with his outer counterpart after their inner competitor yielded turning for home, but was outkicked
by a wider bidder in midstretch, then saved place. PORT ROYAL laid off of the pace in the four to six path, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead to
miss reaching place. FOE prompted inside of the top pair into the turn, yielded to those rivals turning for home, sustained stride shifting to the four path in
upper stretch, kept on between horses but got outkicked for show by an outer rival in the final sixteenth. PRINCE COSMO vied three wide, dueled two wide
turning for home, but gave way between horses in midstretch. TAYSOM saved ground pursuing from midpack, but to no avail. GLORIA'S BOY made little
impact from the two path. TILT A WHIRL lacked speed in the five to seven path and failed to factor while laboring on his left lead. U RASCAL U broke a step
slow, pursued two wide and between horses, but backed out keenly entering the turn and steadily faded.

HOODLUM pursued from midpack two wide, tipped to the four path for clear sailing entering the lane, rallied to drive past the leaders nearing the furlong
grounds, drew clear leaving that station and held sway. COACH ADAMS laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around the
far turn, rallied between horses in midstretch and sustained progress to edge place late. YES POINT stalked two wide, got outkicked by an outer bidder in
upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed leads to vie for place leaving the furlong grounds, but was outkicked for that position in the final
sixteenth. SECOND OF JULY set a clear pace around both turns, but was bested by an outer bidder nearing the furlong grounds and yielded. JOLLY
TOMMY tracked three wide, floated to the five path entering the lane, chased and gave way. MY BARILEY laid off of the pace three to two wide, shifted out
in the final furlong and moved up. LIL BRO COOP tracked along the inside, chased turning for home, lacked a bid and faded. WICKED TRICK lacked speed
in the three path, saved ground around the far turn and failed to factor. EYE DEE KAY lacked speed four wide, hung on his left lead in the six path in upper
stretch and made little impact. FABLED RULER was taken in hand leaving the gates and trailed throughout.

MT. MASADA tracked two wide, took aim on the clearing leader from the five path entering the lane, sustained a determined grinding charge while pulling
away from the rest, reeled in the leader at the sixteenth pole and edged past. MUGEN sparred for the lead with an inner rival, kicked clear entering the lane,
but was collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and got worn down. MYIYLA hopped at the start and was off slow, raced at the rear two to three
wide chased from the five to four path and between horses nearing midstretch, then stayed on for show. COMPUTADORA was brushed by an inner rival at
the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, chased three wide and among foes in the lane and moved up. JALOUSE pursued along the
inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch but failed to menace. CATCHYALATER tracked in the four path, chased around the turn, yielded drifting to the six
path entering the lane and gave way. MRS. KATZ lacked speed in the three to four path and made little impact. BREAK THE BRULES led from an outer
prompter early on, vied with that one around the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
GUNNER BAY tracked two wide and between horses, tugged moving to the inside into the turn, checked at the five sixteenths pole, lacked a rail seam and
was stymied behind the tiring pace setter in upper stretch, altered course outwardly before recovering, ran on to bid inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole
and edged past. SILVER WINGS prompted in the five path, vied in the three path turning for home, led entering the lane, held sway into the final furlong, but
was bested by an inner bidder in the final sixteenth and saved place. THINKABOUTIT raced at the rear along the inside, inched closer in the four path nd
between horses in upper stretch, tipped wider at the furlong grounds and sustained progress. VERB laid off of the pace in the three to two path, moved
between horses to take aim in the four path entering the lane, but was turned away passing the furlong grounds and yielded. DANCIN WITH ANGELS vied
for the lead in the three path and between horses, but gave way around the turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and faded. CREOLE CHARLIE
vied along the inside, got headed entering the lane and weakened. GIMME SOME MO pressed in the four path and between horses under urging early on,
failed to sustain pressure and chased from the five path around the turn, the faded.

Footnotes
LEROUX vied for the lead, raced from the two path, had inside advantage through out, was cued and responded well, was joined by two other outside
challengers, matched strides into the stretch, shook one, battled to the finish with the other and prevailed. VEGA STAR was forwardly placed early, stalked
the pace setter from the three path, relaxed in hands early, went to work with two others nearly the lane, shook one competitor in the upper stretch,
contended with the other through out the stretch drive, battled eyeball to eyeball but just missed this time. DOOLGAROUX stalked the early leaders from the
two path, maintained that position while chasing the front runners, raced inside but did not have enough today. RAZOR CREST vied for the lead, raced in
the two path in between rivals, went with the two other leaders into the stretch, but tired late. WHITE ICE was off a touch slow, found his stride in the three
path while racing off of the pace, settled and found his best stride late, raced inside and closed well. THE SPEEDY ONE was off in the middle of the pack,
raced five wide, never got involved. MO CAN DO raced off of the pace inside in the two path, maintained middle field positioning with an even effort.
NOPENOTTONIGHT was off in the middle of the field, raced three wide, was in tight early on the back side, recovered and settled then finished flat.
DYNAMIC MOON raced off of the pace in the four path but showed little. BAD BRAD raced mid pack early in the five path, and never gained any headway.
PRINCE PERFECTA broke a bit slow, settled, raced four wide while chasing. GRAN CHICO raced mid pack in the five path, briefly stalked the leaders then
tired.
