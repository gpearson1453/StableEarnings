Footnotes
FRENCH ONION led the way on the outside up the back stretch, came around the turn in the three path, and dueled to the wire to get the head bob for the
win. FREEZE 'EM was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field early, navigated the bend from the three path, begin a bid passing the quarter pole, and
gained ground to just miss. SHINING TIGER raced off the pace of the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and improved position mildly
from there. SUDDENLY FAMOUS chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, and faded in the stretch. LITE
RANCHIN KID dueled between horses through the opening quarter mile, saved ground around the turn, and tired in the lane.

the far bend from the two path and dug in in the lane to just miss. DE LA LUNA raced in the three path around the first bend, stalked the leader between
horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and gained ground late to narrowly miss. HEIR (FR) bumped with the horse to
his inside at the break, raced in the five path early, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the four path and

Footnotes
CAT ON THE RUN chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and gained ground late to get up for the win in the
final strides. SILVER MATY dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch
and was caught at the wire. DIVINE GIFT tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and
kept on from there. SHILSHOLE BAY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the lane.
PRINCESS K stalked the leader on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the four path and faded in the stretch. INZAWAY
raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the five path and made no bid. MEMORIES IN GOLD trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the
bend from the three path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SALINE RIVER saved ground around the first turn, pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, kicked
clear in upper stretch and held off a closer at the wire. LUKA GRAZIE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path early,
settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground late. TED bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn still in the two path, was caught in upper stretch and chased on from there. COASTAL WATERS raced in the three path through the
early going, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and kept on to the finish. CASHANOVA raced in the
three path around the first bend, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and was outkicked in the
lane. ROUND OF APPLAUSE saved ground off the pace through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the two path and never threatened.
INESPERADO raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around
the far turn and faded from there. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around
the far turn in the two path and made no bid. BERNALINHO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the four path early, stalked the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and tired in the lane.
