Footnotes
SURFER DUDE stalked outside of the clear leader down the backstretch, ranged up turning for home to bid for the lead entering the lane, drove clear in
upper stretch, drifted out a bit through the final furlong as a pair of outer foes closed in late, but lasted to the wire. OSBOURNE was bumped outwardly by a
set of inner foes at the start, tracked in midpack two wide, cleared an inner rival and moved to the rail approaching the three furlong pole, picked up stride
and improved inside of rivals to claim show entering the lane, shifted outside of the top pair soon after, grinded away at SURFER DUDE's margin in the final
furlong after that foe kicked clear, produced a late bid approaching the wire as an outer on-charging rival did the same, but missed between horses, and
saved place. UNPREDICTABLE BAY trailed in the three to four path around the turn, swung seven wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes in the final
furlong to bear down on the top pair in the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground to reel them in. GREAT ESCAPE bumped an outer rival at the start, chased
two wide and between horses while under steady encouragement, but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, came out and bumped an outer
foe in upper stretch, then sustained his chase through the final furlong to maintain a minor share. STAYED IN FOR HALF bumped with an inner rival at the
start, rushed soon after to grab an advantage leading the chute, built a clear margin after a furlong, managed that advantage while a bit off of the rail around
the turn, but met the eventual winner's bid entering the lane, failed to match strides in upper stretch, and faded. MICKY FROM WEXFORD chased four
wide, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, took a bump to his hind quarters from an inner foe in upper stretch, and gave way between horses.
CATHEDRAL BEACH was bumped and pushed outwardly into an outer rival at the start, raced far back in the three path around the turn, then made little
impact between horses in the final furlong. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE tracked in the five to six path around the turn, but faded in upper stretch. IGNITIS laid
off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two to three paths, and tired. PURE PANIC bumped with an outer rival at the start, saved ground far off
of the pace around the turn, but was outrun.

LADY ROCKSTAR (GB) settled toward the inside, came under a ride into the second turn, wheeled out seven wide entering the stretch, engulfed the
leaders and quickly drew away. STEPPER settled between horses into the first turn, shifted out four wide on the backstretch, moved out further leaving the
second turn, kept on willingly between horses to earn the place. READY LADY was hustled along three deep, came four wide and churned on to earn the
minor award. COMMUNITY ADJUSTED was allowed to settle, came three wide into the stretch and finished with a belated improvement. QUEEN
BOURBON stalked the pace three wide, moved up to engage the leader before going a half, disputed the issue to the final furlong and faltered. TWO
SIXTYONE set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed with three furlongs to run, contested the issue to the furlong marker and succumbed.
FINAL BELLE was forwardly placed three wide to the stretch and gave way. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER attended the pace along the inside to the second
turn and dropped out. TALKING BOOK trailed.

leader near the sixteenths pole and cleared the field in the final stages. COVER ME UP set the pace early, raced on the inside through the far turn, inched
clear near the eighth pole but yielded late in the drive. MONEY SUPPLY broke out at the start, raced in the four path along the first turn, tracked the early
pace, raced three wide along the far turn, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the drive. CURLY TAIL was bumped
and bothered early on, raced in the four path along both turns, was in the six path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. MCLAREN VALE
stalked the pace early, raced from between horses along the far turn, was in the two path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. AMERICAN
SANCTUARY was bumped hard at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and empty late in the stretch run. EMIRATES ROAD
was bumped and bothered at the start, raced in the three path through the far turn and improved position. BYE BYE BOBBY was through after a half.

Footnotes
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL (FR) was slow out of the gates and last away, trailed comfortably in the two path, quickened into the far turn, shifted outside of foes
at the three furlong pole, offered a sharp blitz in the five path to quickly circle rivals around the far turn, loomed large turning for home to bid at the quarter
pole, assumed command from her stable-mate approaching the furlong grounds, and drew off through the late stages while well in hand and with more to
give. IN ITALIAN (GB) established a clear advantage in the early stages, maintained a loose lead while well in hand and staying in the three path around
both turns, but met her stable-mate's bold bid entering the lane, battled with that foe through upper stretch, but proved no match at the furlong grounds, and
safely held place thereafter. WAKANAKA (IRE) broke a step slowly, settled off of the pace in the three path, trailed in the four path into the far turn,
commenced a gain outside of foes turning for home, then stayed on to secure show in the final furlong. LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE stalked outside of the
leader while in the four path, but was outmoved by an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way through the lane. FLOWER POINT tracked in
midpack in the two path, backed off of the pace in the three path around the far turn, and made little impact thereafter. ABSCOND stalked along the inside
while a bit off of the rail, but faded entering the lane, and was discovered to have bled.

Footnotes
THREE TECHNIQUE settled in hand off of the inside, came under a ride inside the three furlong marker, made a sweeping move six wide, reeled in the
leaders and kicked away late. INJUNCTION tracked three deep, made his bid four wide, kept on well but was unable to go on with the winner. SOUTH
BEND was unhurried into stride, took closer order through the turn while four wide, angled out further in the lane and was making up ground with every
stride. NECKER ISLAND stalked the pace, bid between rivals, loomed a danger but lacked the needed late response. DREAM SHAKE attended the pace
along the inside, got through to make a bold bid, struck the front nearing the furlong marker, but faltered in the drive. SHARED SENSE settled saving
ground, angled out leaving the turn and advanced between horses. GUN IT was away alertly, set the pressured pace off of the inside to the stretch, but
weakened between horses and gave way. A C EXPRESSWAY saved ground to no avail. ENDORSED moved up four wide to make a mild bid, but failed to
sustain the drive. PERFECT SPEIGHTY showed little. FROSTED GRACE contended between horses to the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
OBLIGATORY was void of early speed, trailed the field while well off of the rail around the turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes in
midstretch, sustained her relentless charge in the final furlong to take aim on a bidding FOUR GRACES in the final sixteenth, and reeled in that rival in the
closing stages. FOUR GRACES tracked from midpack and in the four path around the turn, picked up stride turning for home as BELL'S THE ONE ranged
up alongside, produced a grinding rally between horses in upper stretch, reached the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, led soon after, but was worn
down by an outer on-charging foe in the closing stages. JUST ONE TIME rushed after a bit of a flat-footed beginning to reach the front leaving the chute,
showed the way inside of a pair of prompting rivals down the backstretch, encountered continued pressure from EDGEWAY around the turn, shook clear of
that foe passing the quarter pole, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was worn collared entering the final sixteenth, and gave way, but lasted
for show. BELL'S THE ONE settled far off of the pace, took the turn in the three path, shifted to the five path turning for home while launching a rally outside
of rivals, but leveled off in midstretch without menacing, got outkicked by the eventual winner at the sixteenth pole, kept on late, but missed reaching a tiring
rival for show. KIMARI tracked in midpack along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path while inside of FOUR GRACES, failed to match rallying
strides with that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole before pausing briefly behind a tiring CENTER AISLE turning for home, shifted inwardly for clear
sailing inside of rivals in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. EDGEWAY pressed the top pair from the outside down the backstretch, sustained pressure two
wide around the turn after an inner foe gave way, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, and weakened between horses
at the furlong grounds. CENTER AISLE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to maintain position approaching the five sixteenths pole,
and weakened turning for hoe.

Footnotes
STOLEN BASE tugged in traffic early, clipped heels into the first turn, recovered quickly and advanced four wide, continued on well between rivals into the
stretch, turned back the bid of BALNIKHOV (IRE) and gamely kicked clear. BALNIKHOV (IRE) was squeezed at the start and rank to place early, leveled
into stride on the backstretch, mounted a sweeping move through the second turn, loomed large five wide into the stretch, poked his head in front briefly but
wasn't quite good enough. SY DOG was unhurried into stride, moved up four wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, tacked a bit
inward nearing the furlong marker and was making up ground. SMOKIN' T was allowed to settle along the inside, angled out leaving the second turn and
rallied between horses. PORTFOLIO COMPANY pulled to contention toward the inside, split horses entering the stretch to make his bid but flattened during
the drive. RED RUN was allowed to settle, came four wide and improved position. RED DANGER tracked off of the inside, moved up to engage the leader
midway the second turn, but weakened entering the stretch and gave way. COINAGE was close up three wide through the second turn and tired. MAIN
EVENT saved ground to no avail. DOWAGIAC CHIEF was away alertly, angled in to set the pace, was headed leaving the second turn and succumbed.

Footnotes
SANTIN rushed after a flat-footed beginning to stalk outside of the pace setter while in the five path around the first turn, pursued that foe from the same
position around the far turn, ranged up entering the lane as an outer MIRA MISSION rallied alongside, produced a bid for the lead in upper stretch, got
headed by his outer counterpart in midstretch, but battled on gamely in the final furlong, gained an advantage approaching the final sixteenth, and held
resolutely thereafter. MIRA MISSION tracked two wide while in the five path, shifted outside of a stalking SANTIN turning for home, bid for the lead along
with that rival in upper stretch, forged a short advantage approaching the furlong grounds, but failed to kick away as the aforementioned foe battled on in the
final furlong, lost even terms with that foe entering the final sixteenth, and was outgamed to the wire. ADHAMO (IRE) settled far back two wide while in the
four path, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, stayed on while failing to keep pace with the top pair in midstretch, bid for show at the sixteenth pole
along with an inner SHIRL'S SPEIGHT, and prevailed. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT laid off of the pace in the four path while outside of a rival, tucked to the two path
turning for home while coming under a drive, chased along the inside through upper stretch, shifted outwardly in the final furlong to bid for show entering the
final sixteenth as an outer ADHAMO (IRE) did the same, but was outkicked for that position. TRIBHUVAN (FR) showed the way via a loose lead while
staying well off of the inner rail, managed that uncontested advantage around the far turn before meeting a pair of outer bids in upper stretch, but yielded to
those rivals at the furlong pole, and weakened. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) rated off of the pace along the inside while staying off of the rail, shifted from the
three path to the four path around the far turn while still having many lengths to find, and made little impact. BIZZEE CHANNEL stalked behind the leader
while in the four path, but faded entering the lane. CAVALRY CHARGE broke slowly between horses causing him to fail to achieve early positioning, settled
far back along the inside while also staying off of the inner railing, and never got involved. KENTUCKY GHOST lagged behind the field around both turns,
then was distanced and eased through the lane, failed to reach the turf course gap after galloping out, and was vanned off.

RICH STRIKE came out a step slow while breaking just a bit outwardly at the start, tucked down behind the main group shortly after, settled far back two
wide, picked up stride to move four wide and between horses into the far turn, awaited racing room among foes turning for home before smartly shifting
inward approaching the lane, rallied along the inside in upper stretch, altered course outside of MESSIER leaving the three sixteenths pole while checking
mildly, then sustained his charge inside of the leading pair in the final furlong, bid in the final sixteenth and edged an advantage approaching the wire.
EPICENTER settled saving ground, took closer order inside the half mile marker, moved out and continued the advance between rivals, waited briefly
nearing the quarter, angled out further into the stretch, shook clear once uncovered, dug in and fought doggedly but was unable to resist the winner.
ZANDON was put in tight early, tucked in to save ground, ranged into striking distance into the second turn, worked his way through traffic as he closed the
gap, shifted out to be clear entering the lane, loomed a danger but failed to make headway in the drive. SIMPLIFICATION settled off of the pace three wide,
shifted five wide approaching the far turn, inched closer under urging between horses turning for home, fanned seven wide entering the lane then stayed on
well through the final furlong to chase the leaders home. MO DONEGAL broke awkwardly and was away behind the field, was unhurried toward the inside
near the back of the pack, wheeled out ten wide leaving the second turn and was making up ground too late. BARBER ROAD dropped in after breaking
towards the back of the pace, raced at the rear two wide, raced five to six wide around the far turn before swinging eleven wide entering the lane and stayed
on mildly, but was fended off by an MO DONEGAL while outside that one for a minor share. TAWNY PORT took mild nudges from rivals on either side at
the start, tucked into the first turn to save ground off the pace, shifted off the rail to surpass the stopping early-pace setter around the far turn, improved
inside of rivals entering the lane, shifted out six wide in upper stretch to take aim on the leading group but only managed to chase them before flattening out
in the final furlong. SMILE HAPPY settled between rivals within striking distance, was caught in tight and steadied near the three furlong marker, battled on
between runners through the second bend, altered to the outside for clear sailing into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. TIZ THE BOMB broke
slow, settled along the inside, came under a ride into the second turn, followed the path of the winner into the stretch and around the tiring ones to make up
some ground. ZOZOS brushed by the rival from his inside at the start, moved forward approaching the wire for the first time to achieve a three wide stalking
position, was floated four wide by EPICENTER while chasing the leaders around the far turn, got outmoved by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, and faded
shortly after. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY leaned outwardly at the start while breaking a step slowly, rated off of the pace three wide in the first turn, moved along
between horses into the far turn, steadied hard among foes passing the five sixteenths pole, got floated out by CYBERKNIFE in upper stretch, and made
little impact. TAIBA tracked from midpack while gradually shifting inward through the lane for the first time, cleared an inner CHARGE IT entering the first
turn, pursued comfortably from the two path, shifted out to be four wide into the far turn, chased under encouragement among rivals around that bend, but
offered little response, and tired on his left lead in midstretch. CROWN PRIDE (JPN) prompted the pace three deep, contested the issue to the stretch and
faltered. HAPPY JACK was slow into stride and passed only the tiring foes. MESSIER tracked the leaders along the inside under a snug hold, commenced
his bid between horses, forged a brief lead nearing the quarter pole, but came up empty entering the stretch and retreated. WHITE ABARRIO got hung out
five wide whilst midpack around the first turn, inched closer seven wide and outside of foes while under heavy urging around the far turn but spun into the
lane nine wide and faded between horses in upper stretch. CHARGE IT was caught in tight entering the first turn, steadied and altered course to the outside,
when five to six wide through the second turn, was forced in when CYBERKNIFE came in and failed to menace. CYBERKNIFE tracked while forwardly
placed in the three to four path around the first turn, got floated five wide into the latter bend, required urging to keep pace turning for home and caved after
fanning eight wide into the lane. PIONEER OF MEDINA brushed with an inner rival soon after the start, raced midpack four wide and between horses
around the first turn while under steady urging, came under a heavier drive while a bit wider down the backstretch, but was through into the far turn,
weakened around that bend and got eased through the lane. SUMMER IS TOMORROW was away in good order, set a contested tempo for six furlongs,
but gave way readily once headed and was eased through the lane and walked off.

on, rolled up along the turn, raced in the three path into the lane, was no match for the winner down the lane and held place in the final stages. ELITE

stages. MASTER OF ARMS was bumped and pushed in at the start, rallied along the turn, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but
weakened late in the stretch run. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY chased the pace early, was bumped along the turn, raced in the two path into the lane and
