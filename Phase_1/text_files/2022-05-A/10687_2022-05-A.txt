FRIEDER FANATIC dueled inside trio of rivals early, repelled a foe in the stretch and edged clear in a steady drive. FANCY SCEPTER broke sluggishly,
steadied inside near the quarter pole, swung wide into the stretch and rallied. BITTERSWT SYMPHONY dueled in the two path, drifted out under a left
handed whip in midstretch, was straightened and weakened slightly. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch and
faded. SCARF dropped back early inside and was never in contention. ORB'S PARTY GIRL forced the pace four wide for a quarter mile and gave way.

very wide on the turn and closed well. CREEDIBILITY outrun early, moved wide in the stretch and was up for the show. HOLA PRINCESS broke a step
slowly, saved ground throughout and was no threat. SALLY O'PRADO trailed early, moved briefly closer on the turn then flattened out. ROCHELA prompted
the winner to the turn and gave way readily.

Footnotes
LEAN ON E settled in the two path, bid into the stretch then wore down the leader with a determined closing rally. BLUE PAYNT moved close inside, bid to
the front at the quarter pole and held on gamely. SWEET WILLEMINA reserved inside, angled three wide before half a mile then flattened out in the stretch.
MADAME ROUGE set a clear pace under rating hold to midway on the final turn and tired. LIKE A PRO dropped far behind then passed rivals without
menacing. TOMARIE raced within range in the two path and lacked a rally. JADE DELTA chased very wide, was put to urging into the far turn but had no
response.

MARIANNA QUEEN stalked the leaders inside, bid into the stretch and outdueled rival through the final furlong. GINGERS WISH well placed inside,
advanced on the final turn, angled wide and closed well. CONNOISSEUR quickly took control, was clear for six furlongs then tired in the final eighth.
MIKEY'S JEWEL angled inside on the first turn then lacked a solid rally. HOLIDAY RAID dropped back outside and was never a factor. SAME MOON
lagged far behind then caught stopping rivals. SHIRLEY GREENE was urged within range for half a mile and faltered. MAGNETIQUE raced in closest
pursuit of the pacesetter, stopped and lost contact with her field.

DREAMING OF GERRY rated between rivals off the pace, took over into the stretch and drew away under some urging. MY BROTHER NEIL alternated for
the lead along the inside, faded on the turn, moved outside and came again for the place. CATTY'S UNCLE dueled outside, led on the final turn then
weakened in the stretch. MY COUSIN RICH saved ground, was asked for run on the final turn and offered a mild rally. SCOOP DAWG chased within range
three wide and weakened steadily. BOARD CERTIFIED moved closer four wide before half a mile then faltered. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT lagged far behind
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EXTREME FORCE controlled the pace, repelled challenges and remained clear while kept to his task. INDIRECTLY broke sluggishly, saved ground
throughout and rallied in the stretch but could not get by the winner. I SAW IT ALL raced between rivals then showed some late energy. CATCH MY VIBE
stalked the pace outside, moved very wide on the turn then flattened out. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN close up inside, went after the winner on the turn then
weakened. RUN FAST dropped back early and lacked a rally. KIKKERLAND prompted the winner outside to the far turn and faded. YEI YEI saved ground
and raced far behind throughout.

JEBOLOGIST set a measured pace, moved clear into the stretch and edged away under moderate pressure. SKY TEMPLE far behind inside, split rivals
late with good energy to gain the place. NINE TOE JOHNNY broke slowest, moved up quickly, angled out and flattened late. BIRCHMOUNT RD forced the
pace along the inside to the stretch and weakened. CHARLIES SAFARI trailed for half a mile then advanced very wide in the stretch.
DISTRACTANDATTACK prompted the pace between rivals for half a mile and faltered. PASSAGE OF LINES lacked speed, angled inside on the turn and
lacked a rally. OUCH OUCH OUCH forced the pace four wide down the backstretch and stopped.

AEGEAN SEA quickly pulled clear, widened in the stretch and dominated her field throughout while ridden out through the late stages. MIDNIGHT
OBSESSION pursued the winner throughout, proved no match but held gamely for the place. ARGENTINA GIRL lunged at the start breaking well behind
her field, rallied willingly but was outfinished for runner-up spot. AKNA saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. HAY BUCK gave way after a quarter
mile and lost contact with her field. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

STARSHIP BLANCA outrun early, advanced inside, angled out then back in through the stretch and drew off. RISEN CHANGE trailed early inside, moved
out in the stretch and closed well. LIAM'S LADY vied briefly, drew away on the turn then weakened in the stretch. HEY IT'S TATI forced the pace outside,
faded briefly on the turn, bid into the stretch but proved empty. AMERICAN MONEY lacked speed inside and was never a factor. INTERVENTION prompted
the pace inside to the turn then gave way. STONEHARBOR BLONDE stalked the pacesetters four wide and began tiring on the turn. ALMOST EVIL
dropped far behind and was never a factor.
