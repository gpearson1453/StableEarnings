DANCING TIL DUSK , away in good order and gained a stalking spot, closed in steadily into the lane, sustained under a drive and moved up with an outside
bid leaving the furlong grounds, secured command about a sixteenth out and drew clear. FACTOR IN broke just a bit slow, regrouped and quickly took over,
opened up when keen to go on, set the pace towards the inside, came under pressure in upper stretch, failed to resist the winner but stayed on willingly to
be well clear of the rest. MOSALAH drifted in a bit at the break then was taken in hand soon after while three wide, raced well back while in the clear leaving
the five eighths, saved ground into the stretch and finished with some interest. COLOR CRUSH , far back while saving ground, angled three wide for the
drive and had belated action. MUSETTA , under firm rating early, raced far back into the far turn, came two wide for the drive and lacked a rally. NICOLAR ,
in the clear chasing the pace, came up empty. POSITIVE POWER , rank and checked along early, was outrun.

SUGAR GRAY LEONARD stalked the pace outside RAISE A SPEIGHTS, secured command leaving the turn, drew out under brisk urging and raced a bit
erratically in the drive. RAISE A SPEIGHTS showed speed inside the winner, raced near the inner rail around the turn and was second best. LATE CALL ,
four deep on the turn, lacked a rally. LAW OF THE JUNGLE showed speed along the inner rail for three furlongs, dropped back on the turn, swung out
turning for home and passed a tired rival. RUNNING MAN , well off the rail chasing the pace around the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME rated off the heels of the leaders nearing the seven eighths pole then angled out to track three wide, was put to a strong drive as the
leading pair sparred leaving the three eighths pole, moved up to challenge with a furlong to go, poked a head in front a sixteenth later, was fully extended
outside rivals and got the bob. TITAN'S WILL prompted the pace outside the leader, moved alongside leaving the far turn then gained a short advantage
past the five sixteenths, maintained a tenuous lead between rivals leaving the eighth pole, continued on valiantly and just lost the bob. KRACHENWAGEN
grabbed command soon after the break, set a rated pace towards the rail, stayed on after ceding the lead after six furlongs, battled bravely inside the top
two through the last eighth but wasn't quite good enough. LOST MY VOWCHER , tucked up towards the rail tracking the pace, awaited some room mid way
on the final turn, came back towards the rail leaving the three sixteenths, eased out but went even in the final yards. BAHAMA CHANNEL edged up
between foes near the five eighths and stalked, was coaxed along holding position leaving the three eighths, altered out five wide for the drive but came up
empty. PERCHER , urged off the pace, failed to respond.

RAPID RESPONSE , forwardly placed two wide, went on the attack between foes into the turn, took over leaving the three eighths, edged clear while
confidently handled leaving the five sixteenths, opened up after being roused once left handed in upper stretch then eagerly pulled away while steadily hand
ridden in the final furlong. THE CAIRO KID , with the pace three deep, chased the winner into the lane and stayed on willingly to salvage the place.
CHAMBO leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and pulled his way forward behind the leading trio, stalked around the turn, shifted out
for the drive but came up empty in the final furlong. ANTIPOISON saved ground without a response. ENANO ASTRAY lagged back off the pace, circled four
to five wide into the lane but lacked a bid. PEPE AND HEYWOOD sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was overtaken by the winner near the
three eighths, gave some chase to the quarter pole then retreated. CORRELATE , bumped at the break, raced two wide leaving the far turn and was outrun.

SUPER LOVE lightly bumped with MR. MOX leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside BACKNTHEWOODS down the backstretch, gained
command mid way on the turn and dug in tenaciously in the drive to prevail. ROMINSKI , bumped by GRUNDER'S CALL leaving the starting gate, stalked
the pace, moved up three wide leaving the turn to take aim on the winner then gamely chased that one through the stretch. HAMPDEN LANE , along the
inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, moved to the four path in upper stretch and flattened out. YO NESSROUNDONKERN ,
along the rail on the turn, eased out to the two path leaving the turn and lacked a rally. MR. MOX , lightly bumped with the winner at the start, lacked speed
and passed tired foes late. GRUNDER'S CALL bore out bumping ROMINSKI leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three deep and gave way.
