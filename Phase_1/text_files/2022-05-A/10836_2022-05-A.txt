MINE ME sat outside in range, was given her cue nearing the three sixteenth pole and won driving. JOY IN GRACE stalked the pacesetters from the three
path and was out finished. SHELTERED BAY sped to the front early and flattened out in the drive. BABS DELIGHT trailed the field, lodged a rail bid and
failed to threaten. INTERESTING TIMES chased the pace and tired.

KEEP YOUR COOL attended the pace while four to five wide, pressed the issue at the quarter pole then entered into a duel outside of CAB SAV and inched
clear under steady handling. CAB SAV prompted the early pace from the two path, responded to challenge from KEEP YOUR COOL into the stretch and
was out finished. SAKURABA rated well off the pace and passed tiring rivals. MCKENZIE RED lacked the early speed needed, dropped back leaving the
turn and weakened. SAMMY'S CHARM sent for speed crossing over to secure a position just off the inside rail and left nothing left in reserve for the drive.

SILENT RHYTHM, weakened inside and just held on for second. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND stalked inside, shifted outside into the stretch and closed just
missing out for place honors. TANGERINE TAXI offered a mild bid. BONANZA CREEK chased throughout. SILENT RHYTHM contended the pace from the

SAVEITFORARAINYDAY saved in second flight, lodged a bid between foes at the head of the stretch and won driving. MADE FOR MORE sat in striking
range from the four path, rallied outside through the stretch and was outkicked. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY brushed leaving, contested the early pace along the
rail and was bested late. FAIRY BARB sent for speed outside, pressed three wide in the turn, and weakened late in the drive. BLUSHING BROOKE
contested the pace from between rivals and yielded in the final furlong. ENTITLED STAR fractious in gate, was not a factor and was reported as having bled
after the race. DAME DEVIL broke inward and was never involved. ** ENTITLED STAR reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled following the
race.

CONCUR raced three wide in the turn, chased the leader through the stretch but was no match and got by late for place. BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the
pace while four wide, chased from the rail under heavy encouragement and was bested late for second. SIR BRONX showed some interest late. SAVED BY
ZERO rank early and was outrun late. PADDYSDAYCHARM chased the pace while three wide and gave way in the final furlong. ANELLO jostled away and
was never involved.

Footnotes
FLORIST angled three wide leaving the backstretch, swung outside at the top of the lane, was set down and won driving. IT'S ALEXUS hurried away then
settled in range, angled out to the four path in the final sixteenth and closed on the eventual winner late. CARRIE'S SUCCESS trailed the field, raced wide
into the lane and launched a late bid getting up for show. OUT FRONT raced mid pack and finished evenly. BLACKBERRY LISA broke awkwardly, raced
three wide in the far turn, moved up menacingly to gain a very narrow lead and was rundown late. NO COLLUSION settled inside along the rail, lodged a bid
then lacked running on the rail, angled out then was outkicked. SHESAHEATWAVE chased the pacesetters, rallied determinedly in traffic and weakened
inside late. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE pressed the early pace, was under attacked into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. EDGE OF OKOTOKS
vied inside for the early lead and left nothing in reserve for the stretch drive.
