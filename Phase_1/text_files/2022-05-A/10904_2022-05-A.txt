CUT THE CORD Tracked in hand along the three path to the top of the lane, angled out some, took dead aim, responded and drove clear for the score.
OLIVER'S FORTUNE Away well, vied for the lead early, took charge after a half mile, showed the way two from the rail, was collared and then finished best
of the rest. DEVIOUS BANKER In hand four wide, began to gain midway on the last turn, angled to the outside and flattened out. BELLAMY DOLCE Lagged
far back while four wide on the turn and then failed to threaten. MAJESTIC SKY Forced the issue inside early, continued to save ground and then was done
