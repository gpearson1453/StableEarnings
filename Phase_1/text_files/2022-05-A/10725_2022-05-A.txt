Footnotes
AIRBORNE GAL broke out, was straightened to race with the pace, clear turn under mild restraint, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling.
AIDANIKE pressed the issue early three wide and also between horses, chased the winner out of the turn, made little inroads on that one the final furlong,
clearly second best. STARRGARITA bothered at the break to be last away, trailed up the backstretch well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, shifted
out to be widest for the drive, up for the show down the middle of the strip. EMERALD PRINCESS forwardly place while well wide, four path through the turn
when with the second flight, had little left for the stretch run. CHASING SHADOWS broke out to bother STARRGARITA, raced with that one up the
backstretch in the back, four wide late in the turn, lacked a serious closing response. ATHENAS SONG flashed brief speed along the inside and began to
fade before a half. INTO CLASSIC broke back, made little impact while racing toward the inside.

Footnotes
STAINLESS STEEL broke sharp, closest to the leader up the backstretch off the inside, bid two path midway on the turn, dueled into and through upper
stretch, edged away, kept to task. JUSTIN SPEIGHT took control after the start, showed the way into the turn along the inside, responded then raced on
equal terms with the winner after that one challenged midway on the bend, could not keep up the final furlong, narrowly saved the place late. TAKE NO
PRISONERS off a bit slowly, raced back early off the inside, advanced two path late in the turn, getting to the runner up late while clear of the rest.
LOOKINFOREXCITEMEN fell back to trail after the start, angled out three wide late in the turn, improved position. RESERVE went one paced throughout
while racing three wide. PROJECT THUNDER off a step slow, remained back throughout. WESLEYAN forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady
fade before four furlongs.

Footnotes
MINICONJOU fell back to trail just after the break, four wide through the turn, took over when asked upper stretch, drifted out a bit under a left handed stick
when clear, continued to hold the runner up at bay in the waning strides. WINDCRACKER lacked speed outside, four out to five wide late in the turn when
moving a bit closer behind the winner, continued to chase that inside the furlong marker, stopped riding briefly when that same rival drifted out late, second
best. RARE STRIPE within striking distance three path, asked along late turn, continued three wide into the lane, could do little with the top two the final
furlong to finished up best of the rest. SWIFT TAP alternated up front for a half closest to the inside, gradually weakened through the stretch. MEGATAP
went one paced throughout in the two path in lacking a late punch. RIDGEPOINTE in the second flight early along the inside, fell back turn, no factor stretch.
COACH HAPPY dueled up front in the two path, stopped through the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN IN DEEP
STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF WINCRACKER AGAINST MINICONJOU, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. PER RULING DATED
11/29/2022 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2022-OP-54), MINICONJOU WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE BEST.

SWEETNESS TO closest to the winner while in the three path, moved to challenge late in the second turn, edged clear past the furlong marker, held the
runner up safe late under steady urging from both hands. JERI DAWN lacked early foot, advanced four wide into contention second turn, saw his progress
stall a furlong out, coming again late. ALLELUIA ANGEL broke alertly while washy, got clear first turn off the inside, continued to show the way off the inside
up the backstretch, briefly responded when challenged by the top two turning for home, weakened a bit late but managed to save the show. MILU ROCKET
settled off the early pace while saving ground, in the two path through the second bend when still in mid pack, dropped inside a furlong out, moved back out
and passed TWENTYTWENTYREDO at the wire. TWENTYTWENTYREDO forwardly placed along the inside, continued within striking distance through the
final turn, briskly roused into the lane, moved out a bit while still under strong encouragement with a sixteenth remaining, was not persevered with to the
wire, lost a position late. FIBRILLATOR lacked early foot toward the inside, steadied in some traffic onto the backstretch, improved a bit in the two path final
turn, went evenly through the lane. MISS DUTTON in mid pack early off the inside, steered out three wide to be three wide into the lane, made little impact
in the run to the wire. KENKEAD fell back to trail, continued well back into the far turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
SPOT'S MAINE GIRL dwelt at the break to spot the field several lengths, moved out, five wide onto the backstretch, remained five wide through the final
bend, no response in the drive. TALLANDLONG four wide when with the second flight through the first turn, remained outside backstretch, four wide again
into the far turn, gave way soon after.

Footnotes
RATTRAPANTE never far back outside, moved up to duel into the turn, gained the advantage and drew clear turning into the lane, not threatened in the run
to the wire while kept to pressure. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE in mid pace early outside,, three wide into the lane, split foes past the furlong marker, finished
willingly to earn the place while holding the next runner at bay in the waning strides. LIFE OF SATURDAYS settled off the pace, raced four out to five wide
late in the turn when advancing, closest to the winner with a furlong remaining, outkicked late for the place spot. VERY SPICY void of speed after breaking a
step slow, came three wide out of the turn, steered out sharply upper stretch, improved position a bit. GUEST IN MY HEART back off the pace and the
inside, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, lacked a serious closing punch. BRIAR THICKET hesitated at the start to trail early, continued back
through the turn, found best too late. DREAM TOWN in the second group, had nothing for the drive. ITSY BITSY BETTY broke well, set the early pace
toward the inside, began to give way late in the turn. OLIVIAN forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL with the pace into the first turn while in the two path, dueled in the run up the backstretch, fell back off the leader entering the stretch, came
again with a late push to be up in time. W W FITZY dueled up front along the inside into and through the first turn, held a narrow advantage the middle half,
larger lead approaching the furlong marker then yielded late to be caught in the final strides. BOBBIN TAIL void of speed, remained back into the far turn,
came three wide for the drive, along for the show while proving no match for the top pair. A REAL JEWEL in the second flight well behind the dueling top
two, also proved no match for that pair in the drive, caught late for the show. BOW BOW GIRL last to leave, trailed after a half, passed tiring rivals while
never a threat. PRETTI XTREME in mid pack, failed to rally. MISS IMPERIAL four wide through the first turn, tired after a half. Per a ruling (2022-OP-52)
received 6/6/22 from the Arkansas Racing Commission, Bobbin Tail was dq'd due to a positive test.

Footnotes
HEATED ARGUMENT bothered at the start, in the second flight up the backstretch just off the inside, closer in traffic late in the turn, brushed when three
wide into the lane, challenged soon after, drew clear. CHOCTAW CHARLIE within striking distance three wide, continued in the three path turn, brushed
with the winner into the lane outside that one, could not match that same rival the final furlong, saved the second spot. MOCHA KISS fell back after the start
well out in the strip, advanced four to five wide late in the turn, continued to make progress through the stretch while widest, getting to the runner up late.
TAPIT RIGHT in the second flight while racing in the four path, continued four wide into the lane, between horses, one paced through the lane. SULWE
broke back, lacked speed well out in the strip, raced four out to five wide in the turn, improved position while too late. DOLLY DIMPLE in mid pack three
wide, encountered some traffic into the turn, continued three wide through the rest of the bend, went evenly through the stretch when clear. DERBY DAY
LASSIE broke in to bother the winner, was straightened, dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed late in the turn, vied past the furlong
marker then faltered when headed by the winner. DUTCH TREAT fell back to trail soon after the start, five wide into the turn, dropped to the inside through
the bend to ride the rail into the lane, improved by passing tiring rivals while not a serious. HAMAZING LACE in the second group while along the inside,
came in the two path for the drive, came up empty in lacking a closing response. SPURWINK LANE broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, gave
way in the drive. TRULY A ROCKET off slowly, failed to menace in remaining back.

Footnotes
THE MARY ROSE away in good order, showed the way into the first turn, set all the pace toward the inside, shrugged off a mild and brief bid from the
runner up late in the final turn, drew off through the lane without being fully extended. CONNIE K broke alertly, relinquished the advantage to the winner into
the first turn, chased that same rival up the backstretch, lodged a brief bid from the outside late in the final turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly second
best. KABOOM BABY fell back trail soon after the start, moved outside, four wide rally into the lane, in time for the show, not a threat to the top two. MY
DAMS ATITUDE off a step slow, raced back and outside, four wide into the far turn when beginning to advance, continued to improve into the lane, closest
to the top pair a furlong out, flattened and was caught late for the show. HOT SPRINGS BLING broke in mid pack, remained with the main body off the
inside, dropped to the rail turning for home, failed to muster a closing kick. TOO PRETTY in the main body, raced in traffic then steadied midway on the first
turn, fell back a bit, went one paced the rest of the way. UNBRIDLED TWISTER four wide through the first turn when well off the pace, three wide through
the second turn, also failed to rally. FLATOUTANDFOXY broke back, continued to lag, steered out three wide turning for home, remained back as well in the
run to the wire. PUNCHY GIRL four wide through the first turn when within striking distance, gave way after six furlongs. CHAI TEA forwardly placed for just
over a half, stopped.

Footnotes
CALIBRATE unhurried while four wide into the first turn, asked along three wide in the second turn, outside bid late, continued resolutely to prove best in
game fashion. SUPER CONSTITUTION prompted the leader from the outside, crept clos4er second turn, put a head in front nearing the furlong grounds,
vied late inside the winner and between rivals, outkicked in the final strides. KINGMEISTER took command into the first turn just off the inside, rated in
setting a reasonable pace the middle part, responded when confronted by the runner up in the second turn, gave ground grudgingly to that one and the
winner through the lane. NOTARY last away, trailed, came five wide out of the final turn when mounting a mild rally, no threat to the top three. WHAT A
COUNTRY raced back off the inside, three wide through most of the final turn, lacked a serious response. CAERUS settled off the pace and the inside,
raced in the two path through the final turn, lacked a finishing kick. LIGHTNING STRUCK forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn,
tired through the lane. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS broke back, was never close. GREAT FACES pinched back early second turn, moved out four wide, gave
way after half.

Footnotes
BAD OUTLOOK lacked early foot off the inside, angled out three wide turning for home, challenged late between foes, finished with good resolve to prove
best. RIO LADY void of speed, three to four wide turning for home, challenged outside the winner with less than a furlong remaining, failed to keep pace
with the winner late while edging clear for the place. LATE NITE MUSIC pressed the issue between rivals up the backstretch, dueled late in the turn, took
over into the lane, quickly clear, faltered when unable to contain the top two late. FARASINO broke slowly, raced back early as a result, saved ground out of
the turn, improved position, not a serious threat to the top trio. ROYAL BONUS in mid pack and in the two path, improved a bit into the lane while remaining
toward the rail, flattened out in the final furlong. WILD IRISH narrowly set the pace up the backstretch along the inside, vied through the turn when hold and
even slimmer advantage, gradually weakened in the run to the wire. QUE PASA MUFASA contested the pace while three wide up the backstretch, began to
falter early in the turn. CHAOS MAGIC in the second flight while saving ground, had nothing for the drive. OUTLAW QUEEN in mid pack and wide up the
backstretch, three wide out of the turn, gave way.
