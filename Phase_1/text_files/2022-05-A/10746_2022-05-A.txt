Footnotes
NOFANSINTHESTANDS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, began a bid from the two path
passing the three eighths pole, gained ground outside down the lane and pulled clear in the final furlong while drifting. I LOVE TO RACE bumped with the
horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace from the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. UPSIDE DOWN was fractious in the gate, broke well to lead the field while saving
ground around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and weakened late. SPECIAL
CONQUEST was bumped by the horses to either side and squeezed back leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the
backstretch and around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening. MAGIC SOLUTION bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, dueled between horses around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around
the turn and tired further in the stretch. HOOSIER GOLD CASE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace,
navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
BIG MERRILL raced keenly into the first turn, chased at the rear of the main group around the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, tipped out to the
four path near the seven sixteenths and began to rally, caught K C'S FIRST BMW near the five sixteenths, cleared into upper stretch, kept on under a drive
and just held. CALICO JOE soon trailed, began to improve under a drive in the three to four path past the three eighths, was driven between horses in upper
stretch and continued to improve, found his best stride past the sixteenth mark, surged on the pacesetter and narrowly missed. K C'S FIRST B M W vied
outside of SWEET TONIC around the clubhouse turn, took a short lead while prompted by that foe inside him down the back straight, cleared into the far
turn and set the pace in the two to three path, was headed by BIG MERRILL near the five sixteenths, proved no match into the lane, and chased on mildly to
hold the show. DREAM ATTACK was forward inside into the clubhouse turn, settled back to chase the leading pair through that bend and down the
backstretch, chased in the two path around the far turn, chased three wide down the lane and lacked the needed rally. SWEET TONIC vied inside of K C'S
FIRST B M W through the first turn, attended the pace inside that foe down the backstretch, stopped inside near the half, slowed to a jog down the lane but
finished the race under his own power and walked off.

PATH TO SUCCESS was keen to the lead, set the pace inside, was lightly shaken up into the far turn and continued to lead in the two path, was asked in
earnest in upper stretch and opened up on the field, and kept on well clear under a mild drive. DRIVEN ONE bobbled at the start, raced three wide into the
clubhouse turn, stalked the pace outside of BROTHER HAROLD, was pushed along into the far turn, tracked the pace in the three path while still just
outside of BROTHER HAROLD, chased on in the lane while no match for PATH FOR SUCCESS, but chased on best of the rest. BROTHER HAROLD was
lightly bumped by DRIVEN ONE in the opening strides when that one bobbled at the start, stalked the pace between horses through the first turn and down
the backstretch, tracked the leader in the two path while driven around the far turn while still racing inside of DRIVEN ONE, continued to chase under a drive
in the lane, proved no match for the winner and was outfinished late for place. JIM AND JIM settled at the rear, continued at the inside of the rear pair past
the eleven sixteenths, saved ground around the far turn, and offered no rally in the lane. J J'S SOLUTION tracked the leading trio around the clubhouse
turn, gradually lost ground down the backstretch, formed a rear flight outside of JIM AND JIM from the eleven sixteenths, continued with the rear pair in the
two to three path on the far turn while pushed along, and offered no bid two wide in the lane.

Footnotes
REGULAR GUY raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three
path, moved up to challenge approaching the quarter pole, gained ground outside and drew off in the final furlong. QUANTUM LEAP angled over to race in
the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle between horses in upper stretch and
was caught late. BRAVO BRAVO saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the rail
around the far turn into the lane and gave way late. TWO WORLDS saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve
position from the two path around the far turn and continued to gain ground in late stretch. NIGHT THINGS saved ground around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch in the middle of the pack, moved up while racing around the far turn and weakened on the rail in the lane. HAPPY CAMPER raced into
traffic and stumbled headed into the first turn, continued in the two path from there, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack, offered a mild bid from
the two path around the far turn, and flattened out entering the stretch. CHOCOLATE BUNNY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders
up the backstretch on the inside, began to tire while saving ground around the far turn and was empty from there. AN OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE
RIDER OF HAPPY CAMPER, CITING INTERFERENCE BY QUANTUM LEAP ON THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO
CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

LIKE A SALTSHAKER chased midfield inside of D' YANK, advanced two wide around the turn, was in range between horses behind BULL HOLLOW near
the quarter, got through three wide in upper stretch, and took the lead, and ran clear in the final furlong while drifting out. AGGRESSIVITY settled at the
rear, began to advance in the four to five path around the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and kept on with good interest to prove second best. D' YANK
chased two wide outside of LIKE A SALTSHAKER down the back straight, continued to chase four wide on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied on
willingly but was outkicked for the place. EL ASESINO was lightly bumped by BULL HOLLOW in the opening strides, attended the pace three wide early,
was pushed along three wide around the turn in close range of the leading pair, turned into the lane four wide with the leading line, proved no match for
LIKE A SALTSHAKER from approaching the eighth pole and flattened in the final sixteenth. IWILLPERSEVERE broke outward, settled toward the rear,
saved ground around the far turn with the rear flight, offered a sharp two-wide rally in upper stretch, but weakened inside in the final furlong. BULL HOLLOW
broke outward and lightly bumped EL ASESINO, pressed the pace outside of GET HAMMERED, engaged outside that foe past the seven sixteenths,
disputed the pace two wide from the three eighths into upper stretch, proved no match for LIKE A SALTSHAKER from upper stretch, and weakened in the
final furlong. GET HAMMERED was sent for speed inside, set a pressured pace inside down the back straight and into the turn, was headed at the three
eighths, vied in the leading flight from there, was driven inside in upper stretch, and emptied out.

DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT was urged to an early lead while racing up the backstretch, battled while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and drew off to the wire. SISTER RULER tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to challenge from the
two path while racing around the turn, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and chased that rival to the wire. GET NONE chased the leader
between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung out to began a bid nearing the quarter pole and finished evenly on the
outside. STOPSHOPPINGAMY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made a mild
improvement of position between horses in late stretch. RACETOTHEFINISH tracked the leader on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the
turn, raced into tight quarters on the rail in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WAR COLORS trailed the field up the backstretch, continued
around the turn in the two path and made no bid. IGGY BIGS hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, was forced to swerve to avoid some geese near the eighth pole and
was empty from there.

Footnotes
PACKED HOUSE was placed on the lead and set the pace while clear, saved ground through the far turn, went to a hand ride in upper stretch, was shown
the crop midstretch, and kept finding enough to hold safe. THE LAST OPTION was keen under a hold into the first turn, tracked the leader three wide
through that bend, chased the leading pair outside of SPLASH FOR GOLD down the back straight, tracked the leader three wide around the far turn, went to
a drive in upper stretch while still racing three wide, chased on willingly to the finish and closed up some ground on the leader late. MR. LUV MAKER raced
between horses in the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the pacesetter down the back straight, chased the leader between
horses around the far turn, was pushed along past the three eighths and driven between horses in upper stretch, could not close ground on the leader and
was outfinished for place late. SPLASH FOR GOLD raced at the inside of the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, chased the leading pair inside of
MR. LUV MAKER down the backstretch, saved ground while chasing inside of THE LAST OPTION and MR. LUV MAKER around the far turn, was driven
inside in upper stretch, could not reel in PACKED HOUSE and weakened in the final furlong. IRISH MAJOR settled outside of MAXIMUS IMAGE in the rear
pair around the clubhouse turn, raced three wide with the rear group down the back straight, continued toward the rear in the four path on the far turn, was
driven four wide in upper stretch and chased evenly late. MAXIMUS IMAGE settled at the rear inside of IRISH MAJOR around the clubhouse turn, raced
between horses in the rear flight down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path on the far turn, was asked three and then two wide in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. DOM CAETANO (ARG) settled toward the rear well behind the leading group, dropped to a clear last near the nine
sixteenths, raced at the rear in the two path around the far turn and was allowed to trail home.
