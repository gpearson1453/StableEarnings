KYEMBEA saved ground just off the pace then slipped through on the rail and drew off. A LOT OF HEAT pressed the pace from two wide made a move
three wide going into the stretch and fought gamely. SWORD OF GOLD was near the back through the turn and made a late rail bid to be up for the show.
DA CRIMSON PASS set most of the pace from the inside and gave way in late stretch. SWAY BACK WHEN was never a threat. OCTAGON was close up
from three wide made a bid going into the stretch and faltered.

A FLICKER OFSILVER vied for the lead from three wide and took the lead at the sixteenth pole and cleared under steady urging. MY REAL DIAMOND set
a pressured pace for a half on the inside fought off challenge from HUNTER'S LEGACY in late stretch to hold on to the place. HUNTER'S LEGACY was
placed just off the pace on the inside then made a challenge in mid stretch and missed the place. SOONER SKUTA raced in the middle of the pace from
four wide and improved late. TRUE GLORY pressed the pace from two wide through the turn and faded. OKLAHOMA LINE was never a factor. WOODS OF
