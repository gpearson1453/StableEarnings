past the middle of the racetrack. CENTRIST trailed until deep stretch then finished determinedly two wide. CUTLER stalked the early pace inside, moved
closer three wide entering the stretch then was outfinished. AMIGO'S AFFAIR pressed the pace along the rail into the stretch, inherited a narrow advantage
then was outfinished. KEYED ON TOP with the second flight two wide, failed to respond.

Footnotes
LONE BOY pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead , shook clear in upper stretch and won in hand. BABA LOOEY was bumped at the start,
offered a mild bid in the five path into the stretch and finished second best. MARCH MAGIC allowed to settle, rallied determinedly in the six path late.
GOING PRIMETIME failed to menace. BILLY BEACOUP set a pressured pace along the rail for nearly a half then weakened in the stretch. JUST
INSPIRED was no threat. TANNER was bumped at the start, dropped back then outrun. ZAROSHA was no factor. VOLUMATTIC was bounced around
between rivals then pinched back at the start then was through early. THORMEISTER bore in at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to his inside
and had brief speed.
