TAP THE HEART moved to the front and gained a daylight advantage in the first turn, opened the advantage then was kept to task in the lane. ANGIE'S
REVRAC cahsed the winner four wide and could not close the gap through the lane. PRAIRIE FIREBALL was along the inside and lacked a closing rally in
the drive. ONE HOT REDHEAD lunged at the break, remained three tof four wide and was not a factor. CRIMSON T. was always back along the inside.
SOCIAL ELIZABETH bobbled at the break and never threatened while five wide.

Footnotes
WILDCAT NATION tucked in through the first turn behind the early leaders, moved out three wide heading up the backstretch, rallied into the lane and
moved off under steady handling. HOT ARTIE moved to a clear lead racing out from the rail, made the running to upper stretch and could not handle the
winner while clearly best of the others. PRAIRIE SQUALL chased the early leader three wide and weakened. PAPA JOE angled out in the far turn but failed
to threaten. THE GREATEST EAGLE was not a factor. FORGERY dropped out going up the backstretch, was pulled up in the far turn then walked off under
his own power.

wide. FOLLOWING THE RUNNING OF THE THIRD RACE THE RIDERS ELECTED TO NOT TON CONTUE WITH THE CARD. THE REMAINDER OF
