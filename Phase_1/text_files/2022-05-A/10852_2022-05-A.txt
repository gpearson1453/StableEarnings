Footnotes
SILENT ZENON was hard to load, stalked the pacesetter, went two to three wide on the turn, took over past the three-sixteenths, moved clear in the stretch.
FULL OF DRIVE settled off the leaders mid-pack, went two to three wide on the turn, came out at the sixteenth pole and rallied to get up for place. BLUE
BEES was urged clear soon after the start, dictated terms along the inside, was collared past the three-sixteenths and weakened in the drive.
SOUTHWESTERN HOPE stalked outside, went three to four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. GUSHER chased inside, came off the fence on the turn, was
three wide turning for home and wider still in upper stretch, offered no late kick. HENRY ON THE RUN was just a bit fractious in the gate, raced outside four
to five wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. LIL LATIGO stumbled at the start, shifted in and saved ground on the turn. PROUD
ZONING was just a bit fractious, raced three wide on the turn and failed to rally.

IMA SAINT TOO stalked two to three wide early, bid three then four wide on the far turn, moved clear. GUNNERS ONE stalked the pacesetter early two to
three wide, moved to force the issue leaving the backstretch, took a narrow and brief lead, was outkicked. ALMOST A STORM shifted in four wide heading
to the first turn, advanced between foes early up the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn and ran on for show honors. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT was
restless in the gate, shifted in while settling into stride heading to the first turn, came out early up the backstretch, improved late. DECK HUMOR raced
evenly two to three wide and failed to make a bid. KRIS WHO set the early pace inside, was pressured into the far turn, gave way. DIXIELAND DELIGHT
raced outside rivals four to five wide, had no rally. MISS RULES bobbled at the break and was never near enough to threaten. WRAPPED chased from
inside, was asked to keep up about the half, tired.

Footnotes
BLUE CHIP BETTY stalked outside, went four then six wide on the turn, was under stout urging and edged away late. BULLY BABY pressed the pace,
contended three then five wide and between foes on the turn making a mild bid, was outfinished. SUNRISE IN THE BAR was urged forward to set the pace
racing off the fence, drifted four wide leaving the turn, yielded grudgingly. ROBTHEQUEEN settled inside on or just off the rail, gained late. RIVER JUMPER
went four to six wide on the turn and ran on evenly. MINDOFMYOWN broke several lengths slowly, fanned six wide into the stretch and passed rivals.
D'TATWAY was floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TOTHEMOONANDBACK chased the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn,
weakened. TIZ DONNA BELLA was mid-pack two to three wide, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
AUTOPILOT set a pressured pace inside, moved clear late up the backstretch, came off the fence late on the far turn, was clear into upper stretch and just
lasted. BARBIERE moved in from four to three wide early on the first turn then nearer the rail early up the backstretch and advanced inside rivals heading to
the far turn, swung five wide leaving that bend, was gaining late but missed. KENTUCKY PEERLESS was caught five wide between foes on the first turn,
was within striking distance turning for home going four to five wide on the far turn but evened out in the lane. MT. TAYLOR was restless in the gate,
encouraged along after the break, moved in from three to two wide on the first turn then angled out early up the backstretch, advanced to the far turn then
moved back in from three to two wide, flattened out in the drive. ROCKTHEPULPIT was caught four wide between foes on the first turn, made a mild bid
four then three wide on far turn but flattened out. BULLY RIDE pressed three wide, dropped back up the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn and
could not rally thereafter. AUTISM SAVANT was forced six wide on the first turn, went four wide on the far turn and was never a threat. BUMBLEBEE
pressed from between runners, dropped back, tired. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SAYIN GRACE switched off the inside to stalk two to three wide, took over on the far turn and moved clear. MCCLASSIC settled off the leaders, advanced
inside heading into the far turn, came off the fence a bit, angled back inside a rival at the top of the stretch and fought on to get up for place. BASHFUL BOB
set the early pace inside on or just off the rail, was overtaken heading into the far turn still racing near inside, lacked the needed late kick and lost place late.
JEDI WARRIOR was within range two to three wide outside early, took closer order to press up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn and
evenly in the stretch. ME AND JACK altered out four wide entering the first turn, began to pass rivals four to five wide on the far turn and continued to
improve in the stretch. MUSKYMAN exchanged a light bump at the start, angled in heading to the first turn, raced mostly two to three wide and needed more
late. POCO SUENOS exchanged a light bump at the start, raced three to four wide mid-pack through the first turn, moved in from three to two wide on the
far turn and failed to rally. SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE was up close four wide early, steadily weakened. JOHNNY switched off the inside tracking mid-pack
in the two to three path, pulled up at the top of the stretch and vanned off.
