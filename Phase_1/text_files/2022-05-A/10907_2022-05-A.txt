PASSO A FRENTE stalked the pace looming to the far turn being boxed in nearing the quarter pole angling out in upper stretch finding room bidding three
deep from the eighth pole edging clear under a drive. WICKED INTENT unhurried early advanced outside from the half taking the lead in upper stretch
drifting in crowding rival outside the eighth pole ceding late to outside pressure. TETHERED stalked the pace while saving ground to upper stretch being
crowded on the rail steadying briefly outside the eighth pole angled out finishing with little left. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES tracked the pace chasing on the far
turn racing evenly from mid track down the lane. FANFARE WELL sent clear set the pace through the far turn then faded in upper stretch. PIVOTAL
WOMAN (FR) tracked evenly to the far turn before giving way into upper stretch. ROSES FOR DOUG played no factor. DASHING HERO was always
outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF TETHERED AGAINST THE RIDER OF WICKED INTENT FOR INTERFERENCE OUTSIDE THE EIGHTH
POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
