Footnotes
JUNIOR SENATOR was away alertly and opened a wide margin on the fiield, and never gave up that commanding lead. CHOSEN MATE (IRE) did his best
to close the gap on the leader, but didn't have foot to reduce his lead. THEDA'S BOY settled mid pack, started closing ground on rivals on the backside for
the final time, rallied down the hlll and into the final bend to get in striking distance for the second spot heading to the last jump, gained ground through the
stretch but it wasn't enough to capture the second spot. LONELY WEEKEND raced mid pack but failed to respond when called upon. PROFITEER was in
the middle of the pack, had a mild rally coming off the hill for the final time, then flattened out from there. BROKEN FORCE failed to menace. SUDDEN
VICTORY raced towards the back, started to weaken on the backside for the final time and was pulled up before the last jump and walked off. SHOOTIN
THE BREEZE was through early and then struggled to maintain to keep up and was pulled up before the last jump and walked off. SO SUBLIME was never
a threat and was pulled up before the last jump. FULL TIME PARTY (IRE) was in contention for the first two miles, then retreated and was pulled up before
the last jumpand walked off. PADDY'S CROWN struggled in the back of the field, then trailed and was pulled up three fences from home and walked off.

Footnotes
WITHOUTMOREADO (IRE) assumed command from the beginning, controlling the race on the front end, rallied coming off the final bend to draw clear of all
pursuers and widened the margin after the last fence. MASTER SEVILLE was well placed under a patient ride, closed the gap two fences from home, rallied
coming off the final bend heading to the last fence to be in striking distance but was no match for the winner. ADJUTANT (GB) settled mid pack, rallied
coming down the hill going into the home turn to be on terms jumping the last then weakened in the late going. HUYANA was through early and kept losing
ground as the race unfolded but managed to get around and finish fourth. RHYTHMIA faiiled to menace. BOUTONNIERE was well placed, then stalked
pace four out, rallied after the second last closing ground on the inside to be right there when he fell at the last and walked off.

MERCOEUR (FR) showed the way from the start, was unchallanged until they headed down the hill into the stretch when ROYAL RUSE got on terms
heading to the last, they jumped the last as a team, but was out run to the wire by the winner. ROYAL RUSE was comfortable tracking the leader for most of
the way, rallied down the hill heading into the stretch to collar the leader heading to the last, was right there jumping the last then gave way through the
stretch run.
