GORMLEYS GOT GAME settled off the early pace into the turn, moved three wide approaching the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared while entering the
lane then widened while being kept to the task. OXWOOD vied for the lead two wide, settled back to chase the pace into the lane, was no match for the
winner but stayed on well to regain the place spot. THUNDERHEART vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, could not stay with the winner into
the lane, lost the place spot late then just lasted for the show spot while weakening. BAJAN RUM was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane
from the three path, shifted into the four or five path and moved up to just miss the show spot. BIG NICK saved ground throughout and lacked a closing
response. BARSTOW was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired.

Footnotes
AMAZINGNESS was unhurried while in the two path, moved further off the inside in mid-turn, gained momentum into the lane while in the four path and
rallied from mid-track to just be up in time. BICKERMENTS stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid three wide into mid-turn, went
with NORA'S STAR through late turn and into the lane, dueled with that one into deep stretch, inched to the front very late and was nailed by the closing
winner from the outside. NORA'S STAR pressed and set the pace into the far turn, went with BICKERMENTS through the turn and into the lane, gained the
lead near the sixteenth pole, continued to battle with the runner-up into deep stretch and was outfinished by the above duo. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE in the
three to the two path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the four path and offered a mild gain. EULALIA vied for the lead into
mid-turn then gave way. SIGNATURE STREET in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and made little headway.
SEQUEEKER chased the pace into the far turn then tired. KNOTTY BLONDE was in the two path through the turns and was empty in the lane.
MYGIRLJUSTICE was outrun while in the two path through the turns. HANDFUL OF CARATS was done entering the far turn while in the four to the three
path.

NO PROOF dueled outside of a rival, engaged another outside as the former gave way, came out under left-handed urging in the stretch to bump
JEOPARDY THEORY and was up at the wire. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF JEOPARDY THEORY, NO PROOF WAS DISQUALIFED
AND PLACED SECOND. JEOPARDY THEORY stalked the pace in the four path, rallied at the quarter pole, dueled outside of NO PROOF, gained a short
advantage late and was bumped solidly by that one. SPACE FORCE WON dueled inside to the stretch and then gave way. PALMER'S PASS and BONNE
CHERE improved positions late. WHITE SILVER SANDS raced five wide, bid at the three-quarters pole to stalk the pace outside, then gave way on the far
turn. DEEP IN JOY passed tired rivals. THUNDERBOLT ZEUS stalked in the three path, then faded after running a half mile. SAINT ZEKE was off
awkwardly. KORDELL was through early.

Footnotes
FIELD DAY stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, was clear briefly and held on at the wire under steady gain. POWER END was unrushed early,
angled five wide in the stretch, rallied and just missed. CHARCOAL stalked the pace in the four path, then had a mild late bid. DOUBLE TUFF stalked the
pace in the five path, then had no late bid. ROLIN WITH OLIN quickly got the lead inside, then gave way in the stretch. EDGEMONT ROAD stalked the
pace between foes, then faded in the stretch. MALPAIS reared at the start and was declared a non-starter.
