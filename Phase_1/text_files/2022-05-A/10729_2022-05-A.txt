Footnotes
ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) set the pace under pressure from HONOR IT to the outside, saved ground while holding a short lead through the turn, shook free in
upper stretch and held well under right-handed urging. BRIEFCASE GIRL broke slow, traveled at the rear of the field outside a rival, angled out and came
four to five wide into the stretch, rallied gamely but was not enough to get to the winner. GRANOLA GIRL stalked inside into and around the turn, tipped out
a bit in the stretch and finished evenly in the late stages. CHLOE'S CROWN stalked off the rail or outside a rival, angled to the rail on the turn, came out
entering the furlong grounds and kept on to earn a minor award. HONOR IT broke out but came away well then prompted the pace from outside, stayed
alongside the leader while in the two path through the turn and weakened. TOO BOSSY forwardly placed outside the top pair in the early going, urged along
three wide around the turn but flattened out in the lane. KEEPURSELF ALIVE hopped slightly and came away slow, traveled along the inside at the back,
went awkwardly while a bit green into the turn, remained inside into the stretch and was not a factor. DAZZLING JOKER was off slow to begin, raced
greenly while pulling the rider along up the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch, moved out to a
clear path and weakened.

Footnotes
CONUNDRUM pressed the winner up the backstretch, vied between foes into the stretch, fought head-to-head with VETOED down the lane and dug late to
edged the runner-up. VETOED set the pace on the inside under pressure, vied with a pair of rivals two wide into the stretch, battled with CONUNDRUM
down the lane and was edged late. LIAR LIAR broke slow and inward to bump then got shuffled back, pulled the rider to a forward position, steered outside
the top pair and went three wide into the turn, bid three deep around the bend, faltered in the late stages but finished a clear third. WEEGEE raced between
foes then four wide into the turn, moved down to the three path around the bend and lacked the needed response in the drive. ROMEO'S GLORY dropped
back early, rounded the tur three then two wide and failed to menace. TEE SHOT took a bumped from outside leaving the gate, chased the top pair from
inside off the pace, saved ground through the turn and had little left for the stretch run. SIERRA PASS showed early speed outside a trio of rivals then
dropped back off the pace past the nine-sixteenths pole, chased five then four wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TARTINI stalked along the inside, looked to make a run leaving the bend but was boxed in briefly, got out into the clear, drew alongside VIE EGNATIA and
wore down that rival in the final strides. VIA EGNATIA took control early and was guided inside to set the pace, cut the corner into the stretch, met the
challenge from TARTINI in the lane, clung to a narrow lead with a sixteenth remaining and yielded grudgingly in the closing moments. FRONTIER MARKET
broke a step slow and took some coaxing from the gate, settled at the back on the inside, eased out a bit leaving the far turn, then steered out widest in the
drive and rallied to gain the show. FOREVER MO steered to the inside, eased off the rail on the far turn then angled back down inside exiting the bend and
got edged for the show honors. MOVE OVER (GB) settled off the pace in the two path, angled out around rival on the far turn and came three wide into the
lane, moved out further in the stretch but lacked a rally. ENCROACHMENT was closest in pursuit of the winner from the two path to far turn, gave chase two
wide into the lane and weakened. STITZY broke a step slow, went three then two wide around the first turn, raced near the back outside a rival, went two
wide into the second bend then tipped out to three path and made no impact. MONGOLIAN LEGEND stumbled a bit leaving the gate, tracked off the rail
early on, dropped back around the far turn then angled inside and faded.

Footnotes
LIL LIGHT HEADED came away best then ceded the lead to CROSS INDIAN and pressed that rival while in hand, took over midway around the turn,
cleared approaching the quarter pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch and drew away. WHISKEY VISION stalked the speed from inside into the
turn, waited for room then split foes at the quarter pole following LIL LIGHT HEADED, continued to give chase through the lane, could threat the winner late
but proved second best. CHRIS FIX tracked four wide into the turn, crept closer around the bend and chased four deep into the lane but flattened out in
deep stretch. CROSS INDIAN hustled from the gate early and went up to take command while drifting out, held a short lead over the winner into the turn,
lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the drive and weakened. SAMBA FLAVOR broke a bit slow, stalked off the rail, put in a
mild bid three deep on the turn, could not keep up with the winner approaching the quarter pole, chased three deep into the stretch and weakened. ITS BIG
bobbled leaving the gate, lost his path and forced to steady early, raced along the rail then eased out and came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the
lane and failed to menace. ARICKAREE was off a bit slow to begin, lost his path early, traveled two then three wide on the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
GHOSTEM sped to the front, held a comfortable lead up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside to the stretch and drew off in the final sixteenth.
AVERY BLUE stumbled in the beginning, closest in pursuit in the two path, urged two wide into the drive, failed to reach the winner in the lane and settled
for second best. TIZ MY PRINCESS raced in the two path around the first turn then moved out a bit traveling in mid-pack, summoned a mild response when
asked and gained the show. SENSIBLE MOVE broke awkwardly leaving the gate, got put in a bit tight down on the rail then was reserved along the inside
early, lacked room from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch and churned on for a minor award. ELA CALIMERA MOU
went two wide around the first turn, shifted out to the three path at the three-eighths pole, moved back to the two path around the bend, tipped out in the
drive and never responded to urging. SHEZ OUR ARCH checked between rivals passed the finish line first time around, moved to the inside trailing the
field, moved out to the three path for the second bend, got floated out at the eighth pole and was never a factor. LADY BLACKBIRD stumbled leaving the
gate, angled to the inside and raced in mid-pack, saved ground to the stretch and failed to respond to urging. MENSA ON TAP tracked off the rail then
moved into the two path, angled to the rail on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
REDLINE raced up close on the inside before dueling for command, fought into and around the turn, carried the lead into the stretch, battled with the
runner-up through the final furlong and held that rival at bay. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU stalked off the rail, angled down to the inside then back out and bid
outside the top pair at the quarter pole, challenged REDLINE through the lane but could not get by. SHORTMAN chased widest to the turn, went four to five
wide around the bend and gained the show. DANCE COMPANY got bumped leaving the gate, unhurried at the back of the pack, went three wide into the
turn, angled to the rail around the bend and got edged for the show honors. FUNKENSTEIN got forced into rival leaving the gate, traveled four wide into the
turn racing at the back, angled down to the two path and failed to menace. THRIVE broke in and bumped rival, had his path taken early, coaxed between
rivals and went up to duel for command outside a rival leaving the backstretch, fought for command around the turn then lost touch past the quarter pole and
gave way in the lane. MANDO bumped from outside and forced in leaving the gate, chased three to four wide into the stretch, checked between rivals past
the eighth pole and weakened. FINGLAS LAD broke well, raced up close outside rivals early then chased the top pair into the turn, went four wide around
the bend and weakened. CALDER VALE away quickly, forwardly placed between rivals then got put in tight quarters and steadied at the nine-sixteenths
pole, dropped back into and around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
GILLIAN ELIZABETH pressed between runners while in hand, ceded the lead to the top pair leaving the backstretch, chased along the rail then eased out
around the bend and entered the lane three wide, tipped out widest in upper stretch, rallied to the front midstretch and kicked clear to win going away.
SUPER RENEE vied three deep early, dueled outside in the two path around the turn then between rivals past the quarter pole, could not kick on with the
winner in deep stretch and held the place. PICTURE OF A LADY was off a bit slow to begin, raced off the pace up the backstretch, went two wide through
the turn, drifted out midstretch and got up for the show. SO IT WOULD SEEM raced up close outside a trio of rivals, bid three deep on the turn, fought into
the final furlong, could not kick on with the winner and faltered in the late stages. MIRACLE OF HOPE vied for command from inside up the backstretch,
dueled inside SUPER RENEE on the turn, battled back into the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. WETHERLY was off slow from inside, rounded
the turn two then three wide and failed to menace. MAGICAL LADY broke a bit slow in the beginning, entered the turn three wide, exited five wide and failed
to make an impact. MISSING PENNY chased up close briefly then dropped back and moved to the inside, saved ground around the bend and had little left
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DR. TROUTMAN vied inside early before taken control, cleared briefly into the turn, lost command approaching the five-sixteenths pole, chased four wide
into the lane, came back from outside while floated out through the lane and got up at the wire, then walked off in distress from what appeared to be
extreme exhaustion. RECKONING DAY was off a bit slow to begin, lost a clear path and angled down to the inside, slipped through to grab the lead near
the five-sixteenths pole, led two wide into the stretch, drifted out while battling with DR. TROUTMAN and got nailed at the wire. BLACK STORM off a bit
slow to begin, tracked off the rail then steered to the inside for the turn, rallied along the fence in the drive but was not enough. CLAIM OF PASSION lost his
path early and angled to the outside, went five wide into the bend, angled down to the three path then moved back out and entered the stretch five wide and
improved position. PRINCE RICKY broke out a bit and was quickly corrected, raced up close from outside the dropped back to chase three then four wide
on the tur, drifted inward in the stretch and flattened. PRINCE HUSSAR tracked outside a rival, traveled four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path
around the bend and tired. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA away quickly from the gate, chased up close then dropped back two then three wide on the turn, eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
RED ROAD stumbled leaving the gate, went up to stalk the pace from the rail position, bid between rivals and took over midstretch, held a short lead
through deep stretch and held gamely. HANDY DANDY got bumped from inside at the start, stalked the pace outside a rival, asked three wide on the far
turn, tipped out and bid midstretch but was staved off by the winner. STOTLAND bothered when forced out a bit at the start, unhurried in the early going,
went three deep on the clubhouse turn, came four wide into the drive, tipped out and launched a bid widest of all but lacked the needed late punch in the
end. ST ANTHONY traveled between runners in mid-pack, exited the far turn three wide, caught in traffic in the lane then angled to the inside and missed
the show. BEEF WINSLOW closest in pursuit early on, moved up to press the pace near the half-mile pole, headed rival at the five-sixteenths marker,
cleared past the quarter pole, lost command in midstretch and flattened to fifth. ECHOSMITH (IRE) broke out and bumped rival, sped clear and controlled
the pace, took pressure midway up the backstretch, headed by BEEF WINSLOW with five-sixteenths remaining, lost touch with that rival past the quarter
pole and weakened down the lane. NERO TULIP (GB) forced out in the beginning, taken back and guided inward, crept closer on the far turn while saving
ground, tipped out in the lane, lacked room in the stretch and never found a clear path to run at. EGOMANIA got crowded early then began to pull and had
to steady when running up on heels first time through the stretch, raced two wide early then three wide into the lane and failed to menace. OH GREAT (IRE)
got bothered when forced out a bit leaving the gate, steered to the inside while trailing the field and never got involved.
