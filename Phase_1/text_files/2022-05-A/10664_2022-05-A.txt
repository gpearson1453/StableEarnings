Footnotes
OCTOBER TIME was close up early three wide, took over outside ASTRAL WEEKS midway on the far turn and kicked clear, and dug in when challenged
by GLORY AND VICTORY in the stretch. GLORY AND VICTORY steadied while reserved soon after entering the backstretch, began moving up through
some traffic after a half-mile, had aim outside the winner turning for home, but could not get by while clearly second best. WIZARD SERRAT advanced
coming off the far turn four wide, and had enough to save the show late. PAPA CHARLES raced three to four wide on the far turn, and improved position
without threatening. ASTRAL WEEKS set the early pace inside, and folded up once displaced up front. MUNGER was no factor three wide. POETIC CODE
raced four wide early, edged closer to the leader after six furlongs three wide, then faded through the drive. REGIO was never prominent. RIO HATO was
finished early inside. KILLARGUE KELLY gave chase for a half-mile or so, then faded.

GITANA set the pace along the rail and drew off under a mild drive. SIMPLIFY (ARG) had her head turned at the start, advanced inside down the
backstretch, stalked inside around the turn, tipped out turning for home and was clearly second best in the lane. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL raced off the pace
two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. BARGAINAIRE prompted the pace two wide and tired after a half. CODE
NAME LISE stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
BAILADOR pursued RACKET from afar for six furlongs, was roused in earnest a quarter-mile out, responded well and was up outside RACKET in the last
70 yards, then was carefully handled near the wire between horses. RACKET breezed along on a comfortable lead to the stretch, was clear into the final
furlong, could not hold off the winner and just saved the place. SUNSET PROVISION raced two to three wide, stayed on task through the stretch and was
inching closer outside the top two. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY saved ground and could not muster a serious threat. SON OF NEOLITHIC was outrun to the
stretch, and gained some ground belatedly. BIG ART was no factor three wide. SHEA D CAPTURE raced wide throughout and made no impact.

Footnotes
LITTLE BELITA tracked the pace four wide, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. DALI'S HEART was pinched back soon after the start,
raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and ran on for the show. LATTE LOVER had the saddle slip back early,
dueled inside, drifted out turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. ALBA MIA dueled two wide to upper stretch, angled in near
the three-sixteenths marker and faded. MAGNOLIA ROAD bumped DALI'S HEART soon after the start, raced well back inside and passed tiring rivals.
RADAGAST stalked the pace three wide and tired in the lane. FLAT OUT COOL bumped DALI'S HEART soon after the start, raced three wide and never
threatened.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, rated along inside on a clear lead, repelled a bid from YAMATO approaching the stretch,
and went clear again under a drive. YAMATO raced three wide, advanced outside LAMPLIGHTER JACK to loom a threat with a quarter-mile remaining, got
shaken off into the stretch and had enough to hang on for the place. LAVERY bumped with FLY THE W at the start, prompted the pacesetter from outside,
lost ground to the leaders around the far turn, shifted three wide into the lane and was coming on again late. RACE CRAFT bumped with STIRLING DRIVE
at the start, saved ground throughout and lacked a solid response. STIRLING DRIVE bumped with RACE CRAFT at the start and was slow into stride, and
made no impact. COLONIST raced wide and was never close. FLY THE W bobbled at the break and bumped with LAVERY, and tired on the far turn three
to four wide.

Footnotes
BADBADBOBBY stalked the pace from the rail, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, wore down the pacesetter and was up
late. URANIUM set the pace in the two path, kicked clear near the quarter pole and led until deep stretch. READYSEEKGO broke in a tangle, saved ground
off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. CELESTIAL GLAZE tracked the pace four wide and weakened in the final furlong.
CAPTURE MI prompted the pace three wide and tired in the drive. CASH EXPRESS failed to menace while racing four wide. ULTIMATE BREEZE played
no factor while racing two wide. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
Z FIRST took command early, rated along inside to the stretch and widened under pressure. DANCIN DEE prompted Z FIRST from outside, could not make
a serious impression under a ride approaching the stretch, and ran on well enough to save second. WINNING AT EASE moved off the rail to go around
FLECHE D'AMOUR midway on the far turn, went back inside rallying mildly into upper stretch, and finished up evenly. CALIFORNIA GIGI could not menace
through a three-wide trip. KNOWWHENTOFOLDEM swung four wide leaving the far turn, and could not gain under pressure. VANDALIA never reached
contention. FLECHE D'AMOUR tired inside after six furlongs. MAMITA LINDA was always outrun. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TIZ ROMANTIC pressed the pace two wide, led between foes nearing the lane then kicked under left-handed urging in the stretch. ELUSIVE TREAT (GB)
bobbled at the start, raced off the pace two wide, came four wide into the lane and outfinished a foe for the place. MEETMEINKINGSTON stalked the pace
from the rail, tipped three wide in upper stretch, was no match for the winner and lost the place duel. GHOSTLINER hesitated at the start, chased four to five
wide around the turn and improved position without threatening in the lane. SPAN OF CONTROL hit the starting gate, stalked the pace three wide, reached
near even terms three deep near the quarter pole and faded through the stretch. FULL DISCLOSURE set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane.

UNBRIDLED GLITTER bumped lightly with MISS YOUNIVERSE at the start, was never far back, split horses rallying to poke a head in front after six
furlongs, and drew off kept to steady pressure. CAPRIDREY advanced after a half-mile in the three-path, reached a short lead between horses late on the
turn, could not go with the winner turning for home, then dug in to secure second inside rivals. TICKET TO HEAVEN bumped with ARTIFICIAL INTELL at
the start, raced in the second flight three to four wide to the stretch, and offered a mild response outside. CREME CARAMEL lodged a mild four-wide bid on
the turn, then flattened out. MISS YOUNIVERSE bumped lightly with UNBRIDLED GLITTER at the start, raced well back for six furlongs, and passed tired
horses. OLYMPIC FENCER bumped with NOBODY'S SECRET at the start, moved up along the rail into tight quarters and got shuffled back near the
half-mile pole, and had nothing further. ARTIFICIAL INTELL bumped with TICKET TO HEAVEN at the start, raced two wide and tired on the turn.
NOBODY'S SECRET bumped with OLYMPIC FENCER at the start, and retired early. ANGELIC STORM bumped with SEA LIONESS at the start, raced
forwardly early, gained a brief lead on the turn while moving to the rail, then faltered after six furlongs. VALIANT MISS vied inside SEA LIONESS early, and
stopped on the turn. SEA LIONESS argued the pace outside VALIANT MISS early, and stopped soon after going a half-mile.
