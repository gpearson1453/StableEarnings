Footnotes
IMOGENE MALVINA stalked behind the leading pair from the two path, pursued outside of them around the far turn, took aim in upper stretch, inched closer
to bid passing the furlong grounds, forged an advantage approaching the final sixteenth, and edged away. PARK ON THE NILE set the pace inside of a
prompting rival, inched clear of that foe after being set down in upper stretch, dug in to resist IMOGENE MALVINA's challenge in midstretch, but was bested
by that foe entering the final sixteenth, then saved place from an outer on-charging rival at the wire. IDIOMATIC brushed the gate while taking a staggered
step at the start, bobbled slightly soon after, emerged keen through tight quarters approaching the wire for the first time, remained a bit unsettled while
achieving a two wide tracking position into the first turn, settled into stride approaching the backstretch, came under urging to keep pace turning for home,
shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and produced a late kick in the final furlong to threaten place, but ran out of ground to reach that position.
CUSTOMER DRIVEN took a bump from an inner rival at the start, pressed the leader from the four path around the first turn, tucked to the three path
entering the backstretch, sustained pressure in the two path around the far turn, but drifted back to the three path entering the lane, failed to keep pace with
his inner counterpart and an outer bidding foes in upper stretch, chased them into the final furlong, but yielded and lost show in the final sixteenth.
SKRATCH KAT lost balance and leaned into the an inner rival at the start before being jostled about between horses, trailed in the two path following the
incident, moved out of last in the three path into the far turn, but made little impact therafter. SEQUIST saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. EARLY
GLOW sat reserved off of the pace along the inside, trailed in the two path around the far turn, and never got involved. FANNIE AND FREDDIE took a
nudge from an inner foe to her hind quarters at the start, tracked while hung out in the five path around the first turn, then faded in the four path turning for
home.

Footnotes
AVIANO bobbled at the start, settled in hand, moved into contention three deep, came to level terms nearing the quarter pole, wore down the leader and
edged clear. RED HORNET attended the pace along the inside, shifted out a bit, kicked on between foes and was all out to earn the runner up spot. MR.
TIP was allowed to settle four wide, angled out further in the lane to make his bid and was making up ground. Q F SEVENTY FIVE set the pace along the
inside, disputed the issue to the final sixteenth and succumbed. ARABIAN PRINCE prompted his entry mate outside, was collared between rivals on the
second turn and gave way. MYOPIC settled off of the inside, altered to the far outside in the final furlong but failed to make headway.

Footnotes
JUJU'S MAP was allowed to move forward after breaking a bit flat-footed, emerged between horses to gain command into the first turn, set the pace in the
two path, managed an uncontested margin down the backstretch, felt gradually more pressure from POWDER RIVER around the far turn, but kicked away
from that foe when let out a notch approaching the lane, widened her margin through midstretch under light urging, and was put to wraps through the final
sixteenth to win with more to give. POWDER RIVER broke sharply, allowed an outer rival to dictate terms into the first turn, moved off of the rail around the
first turn to set up shop outside of that rival while stalking, inched forward to press around the far turn, but failed to keep pace approaching the quarter pole,
proved no match entering the lane, then held place through the stretch to prove second best. ILLIOGAMI tracked from midpack in the three path, stalked the
top two around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch, but maintained show therafter. MICROCAP broke a beat slowly, settled far
back in the two path, picked up stride between horses around the far turn, was forced to pause among rivals turning for home, split foes through a wide
seam entering the lane, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. FAMILY TIME tracked from midpack along the inside,
but from behind the leader while under strong urging around the far turn, then faded in upper stretch. MISS TULSA came out multiple lengths behind the
field while breaking a bit outwardly, took up position at the rear outside of foes, tugged keenly in the three path around the first bend, moved forward
approaching the far turn, but required urging in the two path to keep pace around that curve, and lacked a response. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) tracked two to
three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders while between horses into the far turn, and failed to menace among foes through the lane.
COMPELLING SMILE trailed along the inside early on, surpassed rivals after shifting off of the rail approaching the far turn, took that bend in the four path
before floating to the six path in upper stretch, and made little impact. SHESA MYSTERY laid off of the pace in the two path, trailed approaching the final
five sixteenths, and never got involved. TABOR HALL tracked three wide, got floated to the four path around the first turn, then faded four to five wide
turning for home.

the furlong marker and was all out to wear down that one. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL stumbled at the start, recovered quickly and established command into
the first turn, controlled the tempo to inside the furlong marker, battled on but was unable to resist. AVA'S GRACE was away in good order, tracked the
leader three deep, but weakened slightly between rivals in the drive and gave way. BATTLE BLING settled between foes, angled out entering the stretch but
failed to make headway. SHE'S ALL WOLFE was unhurried on the outside, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. JILTED BRIDE was
forwardly placed along the inside for six furlongs and tired. TEMPER TIME saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD pressed two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as HAPPY SAVER menaced outside, got headed and brushed by that foe in upper
stretch after their inner counterpart backed out, fought on to gain an advantage at the furlong pole, and kicked away soon after. HAPPY SAVER stalked
three wide, loomed a danger while bidding for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage entering upper stretch, but shifted inwardly in the
process, brushed a rival, and put another foe to tight quarters, then got outkicked at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. TITLE READY laid off of
the pace in the two to three path, came under encouragement to keep pace into the turn did so before tipping to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed
on to claim show at the furlong grounds, and failed to threaten the top two thereafter. WEYBURN set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids at the five
sixteenths pole, got outkicked by those rivals entering the lane while gradually being put to tight quarters, backed out in upper stretch before bumping the
inner railing two times, then lost show at the furlong grounds, and held fourth through the late stages. SOY TAPATIO broke a half of a beat slowly among
foes at the start, stalked along the inside and just behind the leader, but faded turning for home. FULSOME broke with the field, but was allowed to settle at
the rear two wide early on, took the far turn in the four path while attempting to launch a rally, but made little impact through the lane. MAX PLAYER raced at
the rear along the inside, then trailed in the two path around the far turn, but was outrun and showed little.

MATAREYA bumped with LAC VIEUX DESERT at the start, tucked in leaving the chute, attended the pace along the inside, shifted out to make her bid
entering the stretch, reeled in PRETTY BIRDIE and edged clear. PRETTY BIRDIE sprinted clear to set the pace, fought on determinedly but was unable to
resist the winner. WICKED HALO bumped with GERRYMANDER at the start, was allowed to settle off of the inside, wheeled out six wide entering the
stretch and was making up ground. MARISSA'S LADY shadowed the leader three deep, but weakened between rivals in the drive and faded. SWEET DANI
GIRL stalked the pace, launched her bid four wide, but flattened during the drive and faded. GERRYMANDER was jostled at the start, was unhurried into
stride while saving ground, and failed to threaten. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE angled in leaving the chute, settled between foes, but lacked a response when
called upon. LAC VIEUX DESERT was bumped hard between horses at the start, contended for a half and faltered. AIN'T EASY was hustled along between
horses for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
ARREST ME RED prompted the pace five wide and between horses early on, shifted inwardly approaching the turn, bumped an inner rival entering the
bend before tipping back to the five path, pressed the leading pair from that lane around the turn, shifted to the seven path entering the stretch while inching
closer, bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear late. BRAN (FR) contended in the early scuffle for the lead two
wide and between horses, but bumped with rivals on either side into the turn while allowing outer foes to go on, stalked from the three path and between
foes around the bend, shifted to the six path entering the lane, chased behind the main group through upper stretch, stayed on between rivals in the late
stages to bid for place approaching the wire, and prevailed via a tight photo. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) saved ground off of the pace, tipped to the two path
entering the lane, split rivals at the furlong grounds, gained place entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed at the wire for that position. GEAR JOCKEY laid
four wide and between horses while a part of the early scramble for the lead, but steadied at the seven sixteenths pole when an outer ARREST ME RED
shifted in, tipped out into the bend and tracked from the five path while outside of foes, floated to the eight path entering the lane, chased the bidding
aforementioned rival through midstretch, then stayed on to produce a late place bid, but missed reaching that position. DIAMOND OOPS laid close up three
wide and between horses, but also checked at the seven sixteenths pole when the eventual winner shifted inwardly, tracked from off of the pace in the three
path and among rivals around the turn, shifted out to the nine path and between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on well in the late stages. CARAVEL
tracked in the two path early on, saved ground around the bend, moved through a wide seam to bid for the lead in upper stretch, vied through midstretch,
but faltered entering the final sixteenth. JUST MIGHT vied six wide and between horses early on, emerged from the tussle to gain an advantage entering the
turn, showed the way inside of a pressing foe while remaining in the three path around the bend, shifted a path outwardly entering the lane, clung to an
advantage in upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. CHASING ARTIE stumbled severely at the start costing him all chance,
lagged behind the main group around the turn, then surpassed tiring foes in the final furlong. JOHNNY UNLEASHED vied seven wide as the widest of the
early contenders, sustained prompting position into the turn, vied two wide while in the four path around the bend, floated to the five path entering the lane,
then yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, fanned to the ten path
entering the lane, but made little impact. THE LIR JET (IRE) clung to a very minor advantage from outer rivals early on, but took a bump into the turn,
allowed outer foes to go on into the turn in order to stalk from the two path, but weakened in the three path passing the quarter pole. COWAN laid off of the
pace in the three path, shifted to the eight path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. PYRON failed to keep pace with the field into the turn, then was eased
through the lane while showing little.

Footnotes
SOCIETY set the pace while a path off of the rail, built a clear advantage turning for home before meeting ONETHEONESANDTWOS' bid entering the lane,
fended that foe off through upper stretch, repelled his challenge at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, and inched
away. ONTHEONESANDTWOS stalked three wide, ranged up to the clear leader entering the lane to attempt a bid in upper stretch, but only managed to
chase the leader, got turned away entering the final furlong, and proved second best. REAGAN'S DECISION took a bump from an outer rival at the start,
stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, chased while shifting a bit further out in midstretch, but failed to progress through
the final furlong while maintaining how. FEELING HAPPY bumped with an inner foe at the start, settled far back in the two path, then rallied along the rail in
upper stretch to claim fourth entering the final furlong. PRINCESS ELIN saved ground off of the pace, shifted four wide entering the lane, and improved
between horses in midstretch. NAPA CANDY took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and failed to menace. VACCINE OF HOPE raced forwardly
placed in the three path early on, but faded around the turn. TALEOFREADYCHIANTI tracked in midpack in the two path, but lost position into the turn,
swung six wide entering the lane, and made little impact. RAIN CHECK trailed along the inside, and surpassed tiring rivals without factoring. WISH YOU
WELL hesitated at the start while being last away, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out into the turn, tracked from the four path and between
horses around the bend, but faded in midstretch. ANGITUDE pressed the pace two wide, chased between horses turning for home, and caved passing the
quarter pole.
