Footnotes
DREW'S GOLD was a beat slow at the start, darted out along the backstretch, chased the pace, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path
into the lane, made a bid down the lane and edged clear in the final stages. UNDALAY set the pace early from the rail, stayed on the inside into the lane and
yielded late in the stretch run. TOP OF MY GAME raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. TUSTLER was a
beat slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and improved position late in the stretch run. SERGEANT COUNTZLER
tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but weakened late in the drive. OVERLY D'ORO was never a factor.
JEREMY'S JET was a bit slow at the start and hustled hard early on, pressed the early pace two wide, lugged in a bit in the upper stretch and faded down
the lane. FAST FORWARD was steadied along the backstretch and trailed the field throughout.

HANNAH'S HAVEN tracked the pace early, raced in the five path into the lane, took over command near the eighth pole and drew off late under a steady
drive. RACEDAY ATTIRE pressed the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, took over and led near the three
sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner the rest of the way. PONTIFFANY was bumped and bothered along the backstretch, raced from between
horses along the turn, swung into the six path entering the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. BLACK PANDA was bumped at the start, set the pace
early on, lugged out a bit along the backstretch, raced in the two path into the lane and faltered down the lane. BEL ARIA was through after a half. HIGH
VALUE TARGET was done early. SLAM DIEGO was in tight along the backstretch. SCOOCH was eased in the stretch and walked off after the race.

Footnotes
KYGO (GER) got pushed into an inner rival by outer foes soon after the start, settled off of the pace in the two to three path, bided time around the far turn
before swinging six wide entering the lane, rallied past inner foes in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear soon after. POLICY OPTION
saved ground towards the rear of the field, awaited racing room turning for home, committed to a rail rally entering the lane, slipped inside of foes in upper
stretch, bumped an outer BOHEMIAN BOY while tipping outside of a clear tiring rival the the furlong grounds, caused a chain reaction among outer foes in
the process, but sustained his charge in the late stages after flopping back to his left lead, and surged to reach place at the wire. SECOND OF JULY set a
pressured pace in the two path around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, met sterner challenges from outer rivals turning for home,
managed to shake clear of those bidders in upper stretch, but offered little resistance to KYGO (GER)'s bid in midstretch, yielded, and got nailed on the wire
for place. FORT MOULTRIE tracked from midpack two wide, shifted to the five path entering the backstretch, chased under urging in the four path around
the far turn, floated five wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, took a brush from an inner rival in midstretch, and
kept on mildly. BOHEMIAN BOY stalked along the inside, chased two wide and between horses through upper stretch, but was bumped by an inner rival at
the furlong grounds, and gave way among foes through the late stages. ELI was bumped and forced inward by outer foes at the start, shied to avoid the
inner railing to end that incident, trailed the field two wide, then improved along the rail in the final furlong. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) stalked in the four path and
outside of the top pair around the first turn, moved closer to press three wide approaching the far turn, ranged up to bid entering the lane, but failed to match
strides with the leader passing the quarter pole, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then took a bump from an inner foe at the furlong grounds
while between horses, and faltered shortly after. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) raced in midpack along the inside, shifted two wide at the five furlong pole, tracked
between horses around the far turn, but tired in upper stretch. FED MONEY prompted the pace setter from the outside while in the three path around the
first turn, inched closer between rivals around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOBSTER GUN saved ground in midpack, decisively slipped inside of chasing foes turning for home, tipped outside of the top pair to take aim entering the
lane, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear. NEPOTISM prompted the pace two wide while in the
three path, vied around the far turn, then from between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked by his outer counterpart at the furlong grounds, and kept
on to secure place. MOUNT ATHOS set the pace in the two path while a bit eager in the bit around the first turn, dictated terms via a pressured pace down
the backstretch, vied inside of a foe around the far turn, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer rivals in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong
pole, and gave way. SOUTHERN PASSAGE saved ground while trailing, then improved inside of rivals approaching midstretch, and stayed on. FULL
CHARGE steadied in tight between horses a few strides out of the gates, remained in the four path around the first turn while off of the pace, inched a bit
closer under a drive and in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out while being floated out entering the lane, and tired. ENDLESS SUNSET raced
far back in the four to three paths, and made little impact. INVISIBLE WAR stalked in the four path, chased under urging into the far turn, but weakened
between horses at the five sixteenths pole. PERFECT CUT stalked in the two path, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
KOOLHAUS vied for the lead outside of BRIGADIER GENERAL around the first turn while in the three path, inherited an advantage at the nine sixteenths
pole, shifted down to the two path into the far turn as the aforementioned rival re-challenged to the outside, then shook free of that rival in upper stretch, and
held resolute to the wire. ALEJANDRO laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked while inching closer in hand in the two path around the far turn, tipped a
bit out in upper stretch to aim a rally between horses, grinded through the seam to bid for place, battled with his outer counterpart for that position through
the late stages, and prevailed. GREATHEART stalked the top pair from the three path early on, ranged up outside of them and in the four path around the
far turn, but only managed to chase while failing to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, fought on determinedly in the final furlong while
brushing with an inner ALEJANDO, battled for place in the late stages with that one, but was bested. BRIGADIER GENERAL vied for the lead inside of the
eventual winner early on, rated back approaching the far turn to re-engage that foe from the outside entering that bend, attempted a bid entering the lane,
but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, sustained place well into the final furlong, but yielded that position to a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth.
PROTONIC POWER trailed in the three path around both turns, and was outrun.

Footnotes
YOUENS raced in midpack in the two path, tracked in the three to four path turning for home, fanned five wide entering the lane, produced a good kick in
upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, edged an advantage a sixteenth out, and held from an outer rallying rival late. VIBURNUM was allowed to
settle early on, trailed in the two path, picked up stride between horses entering the lane, bumped an outer HATARI before tipping six wide in upper stretch,
rallied well through the final furlong, but did not have enough to reel in the leader. DREAMFUL vied along the inside of a rival, shook free in upper stretch,
met YOUENS's bid at the furlong grounds, and yielded at the sixteenth pole. HATARI laid off of the pace along the inside, was bumped by an inner foe while
five wide entering the lane, got floated seven wide in upper stretch while getting outkicked, and moved up on his left lead. OFF WE GO vied for the lead two
wide, but faded between horses in upper stretch. HAT TIP stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase through upper stretch before fading. SILKY
WARRIOR (IRE) settled far back two wide, fanned six wide entering the lane, and made little impact. CUZZYWUZZY stalked three wide, but weakened four
wide and between horses passing the quarter pole. CELESTIAL SPIN stalked two wide and between horses, but weakened three wide entering the lane.
