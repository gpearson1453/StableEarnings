Footnotes
CYCOLOGIST tracked four wide, rallied entering the lane to bid at the furlong grounds, and edged clear. HANNAH'S HAVEN rushed the gate pre-race
without breaking through it, then came out slowly while brushing the gate at the start, rushed inside of rivals leaving the chute to forge an advantage at the
five furlong pole, inched clear at the half mile marker, built a wider margin into the turn, maintained it through upper stretch, but was confronted by
CYCOLOGIST at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. SONADOR vied two wide early on, stalked an inner foe after three furlongs, but only
managed to chase that foe while getting outkicked for place in upper stretch, and kept on to prove best of the rest. MY DADDY'S TRAINER broke in a tangle
and raced at the rear two wide around the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and moved up between horses in midstretch while hanging on his left
lead. I'M STYLIN raced off of the pace four to five wide around the turn, and made little impact. HUSH HUSH saved ground at the back of the pack, but to
no avail. ROSES FOR ASHLEY prompted the pace three wide, but tired between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
TWO OF A KIND was studdish in the paddock, broke alertly and quickly opened up a clear advantage showed the way in the two path while well in hand
around the turn, spun into the lane in the three path, and held sway through midstretch before inching further away in the final furlong. CIGARETTE BOAT
broke a step slowly, tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, and stayed on in the final furlong to reach place late. BLING BLING BLING raced
forwardly along the inside, but was restrained back at the seven sixteenths pole to switch outside of a rival into the turn, tracked three wide around the bend,
got floated to the five path entering the lane, took a brush from an inner foe in upper stretch before claiming place from that rival at the furlong grounds, but
only managed to chase the clear leader before tiring leaving midstretch, but just saved show at the wire. MO'S TREASURE laid off of the pace in the two
path, then stayed on while inside of foes to bid for show late, but just missed. ABINADI stalked the clear leader two wide around the turn, shifted to the four
path entering the lane, then brushed an outer rival while chasing in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS raced
far back along the inside and made little impact. BOOK OF KELLS took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and never got involved.
CLASSICAL broke a step slowly at the start while last away, trailed the field in the four to five path around the turn, and got outrun.

YES SIR ROBERT bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, pressed the pace three wide forcing a quick tempo, bid for the lead while getting floated
to the five path entering the lane, dueled with MAJESTIC WEST through upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear in the
final sixteenth. MAJESTIC WEST vied two wide, then from between horses around the turn while setting fast fractions, led while drifting to the four path
entering the lane to deter his outer counterpart from bidding, but dueled with that rival through upper stretch, got headed entering the final furlong, fought on
well thereafter, but was second best. Z U AT THE RACES trailed in the four path into the turn, then stayed on to reach show in the final sixteenth.
WESTWARD LOOK set the pace inside of a pair of hounding rivals around the turn, but failed to keep pace approaching the quarter pole, weakened, and
lost show late. INCITATUS bumped with an inner foe soon after the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, but was done early.

Footnotes
BERNIE LOMAX tracked two wide, then along the inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, moved forward inside of rivals entering the lane, took
aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, ranged up in midstretch to bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged clear. SMARTY JOHN cleared early on,
showed the way in the two path as a pair of outer rivals pursued, shook free of them in upper stretch as BERNIE LOMAX took up the chase, bet met that
foe's bid in the final furlong, and was bested late. C J ALL THE WAY raced at the rear three wide and outside of foes, gained in the four to five path turning
for home, and stayed on for a minor share. JONAS' DREAM hopped at the start and broke slowly, raced at the rear two wide and between while in the three
path around the turn, and improved in the lane. RIGHT OF RUSH saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ONYOURMARKGETSETGO chased two
wide and from between horses, inched closer in the three path turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch. EDGE OF GLORY stalked outside of the
leading pair from the four path around the turn, but caved between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
AL QAHIRA vied two wide, then from the three path around the far turn, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and drove clear of her inner counterpart at
the furlong grounds. JOYFUL APPLAUSE set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that rival in upper stretch, failed to keep pace at the
furlong grounds, and held place thereafter. QUALITY STAR stalked along the inside, easily tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, but only
managed to chase them home. PURE COUNTRY lunged slightly and brushed an inner rival at the start, settled far back two wide, took the far turn in the
three to four path, improved between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on. DETERMINED GOLD tracked from midpack inside of rivals while in the two
path, but only managed to chase while one-paced through the lane. COLONEL ABY B saved ground off of the pace, was relegated back to trail the field
turning for home, improved inside of wide rivals entering the lane to be midpack in upper stretch, shifted off of the rail in midstretch, but failed to threaten the
leaders. RED LIGHT RACER was slow into stride leaving the gate, rated at the rear in the two to three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and
improved between horses in midstretch. ENGLISH TREASURE stalked three wide and from between horses, took the far turn in the four path, but faded in
the five path passing the quarter pole. FITS THE JILL broke a bit flat-footedly, got hung out in the three to four path while at the rear around the first turn,
swung from the five path to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. CURIOUSLY raced forwardly placed two wide and between
horses, but faded passing the quarter pole. AMENSET tracked while forwardly placed four wide, got hung in the five path around the far turn, came into the
lane in the six path, but lacked a kick in upper stretch before tiring. WINTER MUSIC tracked in midpack in the three path, then from between horses around
the far turn, but gave way through the lane.
