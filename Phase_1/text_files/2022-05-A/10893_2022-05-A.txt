entered stretch in the five path and made mild late progress. W. WHITEHOUSE settled off the pace per usual along the rail, continued along the rail entering
the turn, made steady progress through the turn and gained on the leaders to the wire in a non threatening third. INNATE settled off the pace off the rail on
the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and failed to threaten in the lane.

tight hole, finished with a rush and galloped out well on own power. CHICAGO SUBURB broke in, steady urged while having a wide path, lugged out three
lanes late. VGK CORONA CARTEL away well, hand ridden throughout and failed to fully straighten out while on right lead, and was caught late. WAVING
THE WAY broke in, lugged in a path passing the gap, steady urged to the wire and finished up evenly. FIRST NAVA CARTEL broke in, bumped at the start,
wide path, steady urged throughout while being outkicked. VAL QUERETANO away cleanly, tried to lug out early, corrected, lugged midway, in contention
late and impeded by lugging out rival and had to steady. CHANCES ARE UP came away slow and pushed in by rival at the start, hand ridden to the wire
after losing all chance. THE SEARCHERS off slow and came in at the start, lugged in at the gap and under restraint thereafter.

Footnotes
VALIANTLI bobbled at the start, recovered quickly and was very quick into stride and finished strong under right handed urging. CHICKS FIRST FLASH
away cleanly and shortly thereafter slammed by inside rival, straightened out and finished well under right handed urging. MUY BIEN CORONA away well,
appeared to react negatively to right hand urging and failed to kick on well enough to hold on to early advantage. MORNINGS WITH MARIA came out two
paths at the start, drifted back in approaching the gap, and drifted in late under right hand urging. ONE SWEET BAR lunged and bumped into rival at the
start, recovered and was making up ground under right handed urging till switching leads with a sixteenth to go, flattened out after the lead change. NAVAJA
broke in and bumped rival at the start, leaning in a bit early, brushed with rival at the sixteenth pole and put in a tight uncomfortable position late. ONE
SWEET DUCK breaking outward hit the gate hard, bumped rival at the start, in tight along the rail throughout, bumped with rival approaching the sixteenth
pole, and put in real tight late and had to steady. SMOKIN HOT FIRE broke out and bumped rival at the start, drifted out midway and lacked needed kick.
FRAQ ATTACK bobbled at the start, shifted in and bumped with rival early, lost path approaching the eighth pole, angled out and hand ridden to wire. J
PERFECT DEAL stumbled, bumped at the start, bumped with rival early, and lost all chance.
