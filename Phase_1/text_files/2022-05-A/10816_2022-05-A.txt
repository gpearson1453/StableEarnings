Footnotes
BIRDIE CURDY stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the seven eighths pole, made a strong bid approaching the quarter pole to take command
while racing three wide and drew off in the drive to be well clear under strong handling. PURE SILK stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the winner in the drive. SMOKEY REFLECTION tracked Violet Shadows down the
backstretch while racing the inside and weakened in the stretch run. ON A SHOESTRING settled off the early pace, raced four to five wide through the
upper stretch and never threatened. VIOLET SHADOWS set all the pace along the inside and tired readily.

the early pace, raced four wide through the far turn and slowly closed in on the top pair in the stretch drive. BAD AT LOVE showed good early speed while
racing between rivals and weakened a bit in the final stages. MY CITY GIRL stalked the early pace, checked nearing the quarter pole and had no final
winning bid while racing from the inside. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT was slow early, raced four wide in the drive and never was a factor.

Footnotes
OKLAHOMA HEAT was bumped at the break, stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to get up under strong handling.
CRAZY LOVER stalked the pace, moved up two to three wide while racing between rivals and finished gamely to the wire. TAG ME stalked the pace,
moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair late. A LOT OF HEAT was forwardly placed to lay up close, raced
along the inside and had no final winning bid. BACKSTAGE BUD checked near the seven eighths pole, settled off the early pace and never was a factor.
RODEO RIVER broke in, bumped at the start, checked sharply near the seven eighths pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
MIGHTY HAPPY stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, moved up three wide in the stretch run and finished well to be clear late under
strong handling. LADAWN stalked the pace, challenged near the eighth pole , led at the sixteen pole and was outfinished late. RUN A FIRE dropped back
early on, raced four deep and moved up late. HURRAY FOR RHEA was off slowly, hustled to lay up close, raced near the inside in the stretch run and had
not enough late. DA DYNASTY DIVA vied for the early lead, drifted a bit near the quarter pole and weakened late. TERRIFIC INDY pressed the early pace
and weakened while racing five wide. MOONSHINE PRINCESS dropped back early, raced wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.
FLASHBACK KISS stalked the pace, raced five wide through the far turn and weakened. MARYJO'S DUCHESS raced widest through the lane and never
threatened.
