SHIPMAN'S SONG set the pace on the inside, raced off the rail into the stretch, dug in gamely, dueled with COVINGTON QUALITY through the final furlong
and prevailed determinedly inside. COVINGTON QUALITY stalked close up two wide, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run, dug in
gamely outside of the winner and dueled that rival to the wire. HUNTER QUICK stalked close up three wide, bid four wide at the quarter pole and finished
evenly outside. TIMELY REPLY raced two wide off the pace, chased the leaders on the turn and gained mildly inside in the lane. CATALE STORM was off a
bit slow, tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid entering the stretch, then flattened out.

Footnotes
JUSTINS OMEN vied inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely inside rivals passing the eighth pole, dueled through the final furlong and
determinedly prevailed at the wire. THAT'S SOMETHING raced four wide early, stalked the pace, bid four wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch,
dug in gamely outside in the final sixteenth and needed a bit more. SPIRIT OF SPOATIE vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn, battled it out
through a long stretch drive and dug in gamely between horses to the wire. OKIE UNION raced three wide early, stalked close up three wide, bid three wide
on the far turn, dueled into the lane and was outkicked. TOAH tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and gained mildly on the rail. JUST A
IRISH LAD raced off the pace inside, continued on the rail and failed to threaten. HUMOR'S REWARD raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.
YOUNG SKYWALKER raced five wide early, then stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
J. CAT WEST showed good speed racing four wide, bid four wide on the turn, dueled in upper stretch, then battled it out with BLUEGRASS BREEZE,
brushed with that rival near the wire and prevailed after a long drive. BLUEGRASS BREEZE vied three wide for the lead, dueled three wide on the turn,
battled with J. CAT WEST in the final sixteenth and dug in gamely to the finish. BORK vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, battled in upper stretch,
then weakened and held for third. NORTHERN ORBIT vied between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn and weakened in the lane. WEST COAST
CHROME tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid entering the stretch, then flattened out. GOLDEN ZIP was outrun early, advanced at the quarter
pole and failed to threaten. GOSPEL TRUTH stumbled at the start, chased five wide and tired. ADONAI was off slowly and did not factor. After a Stewards'
Inquiry into the stretch run, the race was declared official.
