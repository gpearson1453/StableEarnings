wide, went three wide around the far turn, bid between foes in the lane and just missed second. MILLENNIUM CONDO stalked the pace two wide, bid
between foes nearing the eighth pole, was bumped leaving that pole and was outfinished. STRONG AGAIN was in range inside, tipped out in upper stretch,

and was eased. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF STRONG AGAIN AGAINST DUNNIGAN FOR ALLEGED

Footnotes
FARM BOY was bumped between horses at the start, settled off the early pace toward the inside, moved out three wide under a ride on the far turn, bid
between horses through the stretch, swapped back to his left lead late and prevailed after a long drive. SUN VIKING bumped with FARM BOY at the start,
tracked outside the leaders three wide, rallied to a short lead in midstretch, then was edged to the wire inside the top one. IMPRESSIVE SPEED was four
wide into the first turn, stayed out in the course advancing at the top of the stretch, loomed outside through the furlong grounds but was outkicked from
there. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES broke inward, hustled to the lead and moved inside, could not handle SUN VIKING in upper stretch and gave way. BYE BYE
DAVID was bothered by ADMIRAL TRUFFLES at the start, and never reached contention. LINGUINI bumped with FARM BOY at the start, prompted
ADMIRAL TRUFFLES from outside early, and was empty on the far turn.

Footnotes
MO HAWK broke to the lead, moved inside rating along clear to the stretch, grew leg weary late but had enough to hang on. A THREAD OF BLUE chased
outside MO HAWK throughout, could not make an impression under a drive approaching the stretch, stayed on task and was coming on at the finish.
WINNING FACTOR raced two to three wide, and turned in an even effort finishing well clear for the show. SASH (GB) faded inside after six furlongs.
CARAMEL CHIP was never a factor. STIRLING DRIVE walked out of the gate spotting three lengths to the field, and continued to trail. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ALWAYS EDEN settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command in midstretch and drew off under a
drive. BEE RIGHT raced in range three wide early, bid four wide around the far turn, reached the front near the five-sixteenths pole, vied to midstretch, was
no match for the winner but stayed on to be a clear second. ICE LOVE set the pace along the rail, drew clear down the backstretch, was collared midway
around the far turn, fought on inside to midstretch and weakened. ENOUGH RAIN hit the starting gate, raced four wide around the first turn, angled in
nearing the far turn, saved ground around that bend, angled back out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. I LOVE MAGEL stalked the pace three
wide, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths marker, briefly led then caved in the lane. ARTIFICIAL INTELL saved ground and failed to menace. DIXIE
DIVA played no factor while racing mostly two wide and swing five wide leaving the quarter pole. PRESENCIA hesitated at the start, raced three wide and
never threatened. BITTY BABY was outrun while racing two wide. KHOWRITER pressed the pace two wide and retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA FROLIC was unhurried for six furlongs, swung wide for the drive, kicked in strongly and was along in time on the far outside. BOB MARCO
pressed the pace four then three wide, fought his way to a short and brief lead outside OLD TOWN ROAD and MERLIN strides from the finish, but was
nailed on the money. OLD TOWN ROAD set the pace inside, and stayed on stubbornly. MERLIN pressed the pace between horses, bid on the far turn,
battled through a long drive in close quarters and narrowly missed in a blanket finish. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND wound up three wide on the first turn,
raced close up to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing response. VLADISLAV never factored while two to three wide. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT trailed
inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ADIOS BABE set a clear pace inside and widened while ridden out. RACING COLORS broke a bit awkwardly, chased the winner three wide and was clearly
second best. WICCA WISDOM hit the starting gate, chased the winner two wide between foes for a half, was no match and bested the rest. HARD CHOICE
failed to menace while racing four wide. BE THE ONE played no factor while racing two wide. PRETTYASPINK had brief speed inside. FUNNY FACE was
outrun while racing three wide. MISS ATOCHA STAR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STARRY HOPE established a moderate pace inside, shook clear into the final furlong, and had just enough to last. MONEY FACTOR saved ground
unhurried to the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch, closed steadily but came up just short. SERENADE A KITTEN was reserved early two wide,
bumped his nose into the hind end of ISLA BONITA a furlong out, then was outfinished between the top two. ISADORABLE AIDA chased inside, and could
not muster the needed final response. ISLA BONITA was bumped between horses at the start, prompted STARRY HOPE from outside, challenged near the
quarter-pole, but gave way in the late stages. YOLANDA'S PRIDE bumped with ISLA BONITA at the start, and was no factor. LOVIN LIVIN hopped and
broke inward bumping ISLA BONITA, raced three wide and could not reach contention. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

KOZY DREAMS settled off the early pace outside, raced three wide around the turn, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. AMERICAN OF COURSE
set the pace in the two path, fended off a bid from SMARMY and led until deep stretch. SMARMY prompted the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane,
fought on to deep stretch, had the rider lose the whip near the sixteenth pole and weakened. DEMURELY was pinched back soon after the start, saved
ground off the pace and passed tiring rivals. FREAK failed to menace while racing two wide. PACIFIC PRINCESS saved ground to no avail. ST. PAT'S DAY
was up close inside, angled out nearing the lane and came up empty. BUNNYNOTBEAST was outrun while racing four wide. YEARS AGO played no factor
while racing three wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH THE FIVE FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MISH was edgy in the gate but came away in good order, took control immediately a bit off the inside, sailed along unbothered to the stretch, and widened
the advantage in hand. DISC JOCKEY gave chase inside early, had the two-path into the lane and ran on second best. HERCULES had a ground-saving
trip, and got up late for the show. CAXAMBAS CANDY was finished early two wide. HIERRO was ridden along through the turn three wide, and tired. HARD
LIGHTING became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider, and never got close. FIRST RULE was edgy in the gate unseating the rider, chased the winner for
a half-mile, and tired.

Footnotes
OCEAN SAFARI tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide turning for home, kicked in outside and was up late. OMIXOCHITL stalked the pace two
wide, took the lead in upper stretch, edged away from the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole but could no resist the winner late. LOVE HER LOTS raced off
the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the show. RAPTUROUS was off slow, raced off the pace three wide and rallied
belatedly. LEMIEUX set the pace along the rail to upper stretch and weakened. DIAMOND WOW raced three wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally.
EMPRESS ELLIE failed to menace while racing four wide. UNBRIDLED ENSIGN checked near the three-quarters pole, saved ground throughout and never
threatened. BIG TENTATIONS hit the starting gate and was always outrun while racing two and three wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
LOVE ME ARCHIE settled in the second flight early, began picking off rivals three wide on the far turn, rallied steadily to reach the front in midstretch and
kicked away under pressure. STARSHIP WIZARD was reserved early inside, swung four wide approaching the quarter-pole, and finished well to go clear for
the place. POETIC CODE saved ground well back to the far turn, stalled in traffic approaching the stretch, split horses into the final furlong and finished with
good courage. DUKE SKYWALKER vied early two wide, moved inside coming away with a clear lead up the backstretch, and stayed on to the furlong
grounds before giving way. AWESTAMIND broke outward, raced forwardly four wide into the first turn, pressed the pace to the stretch, and weakened in the
last eighth of a mile. AMERICAN DOLLAR stayed in range early three wide, and tired after a half-mile. BOLD PLAY pressed the pace inside for a half, and
tired. GRAY WARRIOR had AWESTAMIND break out in front of him and was off behind the field, and stayed there throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND
TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
