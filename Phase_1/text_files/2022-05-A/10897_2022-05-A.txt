ANANROAD sent clear would draw off on the turn moving to a commanding lead in upper stretch showing full of run there being ridden out. JUSTIN FRONT
went evenly while saving ground to upper stretch rallying along the rail to save place. UNCLE CARLITO chased the pace watching a loose leader get away
on the turn having to resort to a place duel down the lane moving abreast foe missing place. STARSHIP TAXI steadied briefly as HONOR LIFE cut across
after the break, raced evenly on the turn finishing well down the lane in four path. TEN TWENTY NINE slow early raced mid track down the lane. SQUARED
STRAIGHT gave hard pursuit through the turn weakening near mid track in upper stretch. HONOR LIFE cut in after the break, played no factor. MY MAE
