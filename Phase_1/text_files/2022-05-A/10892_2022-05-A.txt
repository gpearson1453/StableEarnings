Footnotes
MALIBU CHANNEL pressed the pace down the back stretch, traveling two wide, then dueled for the lead with RAISE THE PURSES down the lane, digging
in at the wire to get the win. RAISE THE PURSES was in contention early going four wide, dueled in the stretch drive but was out finished late for a game
second. BLURT was mid pack early, going four wide, then rallied in the turn, giving a gallant effort to grab third at the wire. GOLDBRIDGE was mid field,
traveling three wide and had a mid bid down the lane. HAMMERSCHMIDT had no early foot, three wide with a mild rally down the lane. PERFECT TOM got
off slow, caught up to the field and made a mild bid going three wide. STUCK was near the back along the rail, with an even effort. DONNELLY stalked the
pace early, three wide and dropped back at the three eighths pole. NEVER OVER ME made the lead, saving ground but faded at the three eighths pole.

VIVA EL CAPITAN pressed the pace through the turn, going three wide, then rallied down the lane and was overtaken in late stretch to be second best.
BENDELENE was mid pack down the back stretch, angled out, four wide down the lane for a bid to get third. CANDY ANNE made the lead and gave way in
mid stretch. THINKITASADONATION was mid pack, going four wide and offered a mild bid down the lane. SMART LASSIE was near the back, along the

KELLEY SAID READY set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn and held on well with steady drive to the wire. THATSALOTOFBLING was away slow,
then tracked along the rail to rally on the turn and was closing well in the end. FACESTER raced five wide, then dug in gamely on the turn to close willingly
in the stretch drive. WITT'S TENNY TEN chased the leader while three, made a mild bid in the stretch but was no threat. STONE FOX chased the leader in
the four path then continued to make a mild bid on the turn but was no factor. WHITE DIAMOND SKY chased the leader while two wide, was used up and
through early.

VIETNAM VICTORY ran to the quarter pole, dueling for the lead with TIZ THE BIG ONE, gained command in late stretch and showed his best late for a nice
debut. TIZ THE BIG ONE was hustled to the lead, then dueled with VIETNAM VICTORY, from the inside, through the stretch and faltered late, holding on to
second. DOUGH BOY had no early speed, and rallied, three wide while lugging in down the lane, to get up for show. TAPITURE JONES was near the front,
traveling four wide and flattened out in the stretch drive. MORO MAFIA was near the back, two wide with an even effort. FARM DOG was mid field, four
wide and never fired. MY LITTLE PRINCE was near the front early and dropped back down the lane. LET'S TIE ONE ON was mid pack early on, racing
along the rail and faded.
