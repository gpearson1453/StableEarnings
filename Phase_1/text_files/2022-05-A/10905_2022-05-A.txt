lane, was under pressure from the runner-up after straightening in the lane then held while very close to the rail. BIG PAPER settled off the pace from off the
inside, chased the winner through the turn, bid into the lane to get closer but could not cut into the margin while clearly second best. ASHWINS ORB set the
pace along the inside down the backstretch, yielded to the top two into the far turn, continued to stay on through the lane and lasted for the show spot while
near the rail. BRENTSPENCE was four wide through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and flattened out late. HORSE DADDY chased pace
while near the rail moved three wide into the far turn and into the lane then tired. SUPER LIAISON trailed throughout while in the two path.

Footnotes
LATIGO chased the pace from the two path through late turn, bid in late turn, quickly cleared into the lane, widened through the lane when ridden out.
MANUELITO was four wide through the turn, gained momentum into the lane while in the five path and moved up to be second best while not a threat to the
top one. TAPADERA was in tight at the start and settled to near the back, raced in the two path through the turn, angled into the five path leaving the turn,
gained momentum from the six path and moved up for the show spot. MALIBU CLASSIC chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into
the lane two wide and lacked a closing kick. OVERJOY was never a threat while saving ground. VENICE BEACH chased the pace from the four path
through the turn and tired. REMEMBER HYMN set the pace through the turn then was suddenly done after entering the lane. BOLD BIZNESS raced in the
two path through the turn and steadily lost ground. TOUR THE MOON raced near the rail through the turn and never was a factor. ALTERNATE NIGHTS
was outrun while in the two or three path through the turn. ROCKET DOCKET raced in the five path through the turn and was done after entering the lane.
