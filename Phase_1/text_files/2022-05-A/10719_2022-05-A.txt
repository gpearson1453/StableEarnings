HALF HOPING was allowed to settle in the early going, was roused three deep on the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, caught the
pacesetter nearing the furlong marker and pulled away in the end. ARTISAN DANCER was away alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions
through the turn, came under pressure from HALF HOPING nearing the furlong grounds and was outfinished in the final stages, while just holding for
second. LA POPIS stalked the moderate pace from a two wide path, gained ground nearing the furlong marker and was outkicked in the late stages, just
missing for second. SUNSET STAR hopped at the start and was away slowly, was steered four wide outside of rivals while chasing on the turn and lacked a
late response. CUTETIP was forwardly placed early on while tracking the leader, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was shuffled back heading into the
lane and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
SIERRA MELODY tracked the early moderate pace, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was headed by KATZUMOTO nearing the
furlong marker, dueled with that rival to the wire and gamely prevailed under steady encouragement. KATZUMOTO was three wide while not far back on the
first turn, maintained that three wide position while stalking the pace, advanced three wide into upper stretch, came to even terms with SIERRA MELODY
approaching the furlong marker, dueled with that rival and was nipped on the wire for the win, while holding for second. TWIRLING DERBY stumbled at the
start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried while saving ground, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, came on in the final furlong and just
missed in the end for the win and place, while clear of the rest for third. RUNAWAY KRISTIN was allowed to settle early on, mounted a three to four wide
bid on the second turn, gained ground through the stretch run but lacked the needed late response. DI LAURIAN was a bit keen in the early running while
up close, stayed within range while saving ground into the second turn, lost position nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. HULA KING
took command of the early pace along the first turn, set moderate fractions through the second turn, came under pressure in upper stretch, ceded the lead
nearing the furlong grounds and gave way in the late stages.

TRAFFIC STOPPER was sent to the front, disputed the early pace then took a narrow lead along the turn, was confronted by BREAKING THE CODE
nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and gamely dug in to prevail in a blanket finish. JAN JAN CAN settled off of the early pace while
saving ground, advanced along the inside in upper stretch, battled with the winner through the late stages and was gamely bested in the final strides, while
just getting up for second. BREAKING THE CODE was away alertly, ceded the early lead to TRAFFIC STOPPER, went outside of that one on the turn to go
two to three wide into the drive, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was outfinished by the top pair in the final stages and was clear of the rest for
third. SOMARA chased the moderate pace, improved position four wide on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch drive. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was crowded
a bit at the start and was away slowly, did not show early speed to the turn and lacked a late response. RAMONCITA LIGHT bobbled at the start and was
off a bit slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, was two wide into the drive and was not a factor.

EXCESSIVE CAT was away alertly and set the early pace in hand, shook free of a pressing rival nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper
stretch and pulled away in the late stages. CONTINENTAL UNION lacked early speed, gained ground two wide in upper stretch, shifted out leaving the
furlong marker, was no match for the winner in the end but made a good late rally to secure second. STANFORD BAY was forwardly placed early on while
saving ground, shifted out two wide for the drive, was outkicked in upper stretch and was edged out for second in the late stages. HAWK HILL lunged at the
start and was away a bit slowly, chased the fast pace through the turn, improved position in upper stretch but could not sustain that run and flattened out in
the final stages, and was reported to have bled when pulled-up. MAYBE SOMETIME was slow into stride early on, lacked speed through the turn and was
not a factor. DUMB LUCK was hard used in the early running to track the fast pace, gave ground to the winner nearing the quarter marker, lost position in
upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
MANGOTANGO settled off of the pace while just off of the rail, was roused two wide leaving the three furlong marker, swung widest into the drive, closed
fast in the final furlong, came within aim leaving the sixteenth marker and made a late surge to prevail. CLASS CODE was hustled leaving the break and set
solid fractions while being prompted through the backstretch run, edged clear nearing the furlong marker, came under pressure nearing the sixteenth
marker, could not hold off the winner in the end and just saved second. FOGGY BOTTOM hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was content to
settle through the early stages while saving ground, was roused along the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, continued that rally in the final
sixteenth and could not reel in the top pair but was clear for third. GOOD TIME DOLLY settled just off of the early fractions, advanced on the second turn,
was roused two wide into the stretch run and was outkicked in the final stages. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) stalked the early pace while three to four wide on
the first turn, advanced on the second turn while maintaining that four wide path, lost ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages.
FANTASTIC SECRET was away alertly and took back to attend to the solid early pace, kept a two wide path into the second turn while still close up, lost
ground leaving the second turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BLUSHING BAY was never far back while two to three wide, gained ground three wide on the second turn, closed well leaving the furlong marker to catch
SAY IT WITH ROSES nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. MALIBU JEWEL was prominent early on while attending to the pace,
prompted the moderate fractions into the second turn, could not match strides with BLUSHING BAY in the final furlong and was outfinished by that foe while
just getting up for second in the end. SAY IT WITH ROSES was away alertly and was sent to set the pace, set moderate fractions while being prompted
through the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, could not hold off the winner in the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while just missing for
second and holding for third. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was unhurried in the early going, saved ground while trailing through the backstretch run, was
roused two wide along the second turn, closed willingly in the final stages and just missed for second and third. MOMMY ROSE was off a step slow,
recovered to stalk the pace from a ground saving position, improved position in upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and steadied in traffic inside
of the final sixteenth. SILK ROAD SALLY was three wide while toward the back in the early stages, settled through the backstretch run, was steered four
wide on the second turn, gained ground in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
BOLD ARTICLE saved ground in the early stages while running in mid-pack off of the pace, gained ground on the second turn, was steered three wide for
the drive, closed on MYBLUEBELL inside of the furlong marker, caught that foe inside of the sixteenth pole and edged clear in the end. MYBLUEBELL (FR)
was three wide on the first turn while just off of the pace, advanced along the backstretch run and nearing the quarter marker, took command into the stretch
run, was all out nearing the sixteenth marker and could not hold off BOLD ARTICLE in the end, while besting the rest. PROOF OF JAZZ was away alertly
and was sent to set fast fractions, opened a clear lead along the backstretch run, came back to the field nearing the top of the lane, could not hold off the
top pair in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages, while well clear of the rest for third. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY settled just off of the quick early pace,
advanced along the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn and gave way in the drive. STYLEDOME (IRE) was shuffled back at the start and was
away slowly, was unhurried in the early going, lacked a response along the second turn, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under her own
power. MULHIMA (IRE) was three to four wide while off of the pace on the first turn, settled through the backstretch run, lost contact leaving the three
furlong marker, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
TOM'S MOON chased the fast pace from the inside through the turn, tipped out to the two path for the drive, was put to firm encouragement through the
lane while making a steady advance on PROOF OF REALITY and wore that foe down in the end to prevail. PROOF OF REALITY broke alertly and showed
good early speed, set fast fractions while clear through the turn, came under pressure from the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and could not hold off that
foe's bid, while well clear of the rest. DUDE IT'S A PARTY chased the early pace between rivals, lost ground two wide on the turn, was outkicked in upper
stretch but was clear for third in the end. WIND IN HIS SAIL had an awkward beginning and was away slowly, spotted the field into the turn, kept on while
along the inside and improved position in the final furlong. DEMON SIMMONS chased the quick pace three deep on the turn and did not offer a late bid.
SUBITO SLEW lacked early speed, was steered three wide along the turn and lacked a late response. MR. WILLPOWER was part of a scrum chasing the
early pace to the turn, lost ground four wide approaching the quarter marker and tired in the drive. SHANGHAI WILD CAT was prominent in the early going,
chased the quick early pace between foes to the turn, dropped back leaving the three furlong marker and was empty for the drive.
