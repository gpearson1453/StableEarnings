Footnotes
REMYS GUNSMOKE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, may have had his heels clipped on the first turn, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the stretch. WATCHING SNOW FLY rounded the first turn in the four path then
steadied approaching the top of the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in through the stretch
to hold second. LOGSTRADAMUS stalked the early pace from the three path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased
outward into the stretch, finished well and just missed second. SCARE DEM drifted into the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn, eased out leaving the turn but flattened through the lane. CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE bobbled after the break then saved ground, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn but showed little further. SPECTACULO rounded the opening turn in the four and five
paths, left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch. BUDDY BUDDY became fractious in the gate then rated close inside,
appeared to have clipped the heels of Remys Gunsmoke on the first turn and lost his rider as a result.

Footnotes
VOLTAMOUR rated the early pace inside, was met into the second turn and stalked from that point, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail, angled out leaving the turn and dug in to recover the advantage in the final yards. GHOST ON A MISSION stalked two
deep early, closed to even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, maintained even terms two deep through the far turn and
dug in under steady stretch encouragement, was caught in the final yards but held on to share second. MR. MAZZA settled close three wide early then took
the lead into the second turn, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady
encouragement to match strides with Ghost On A Mission through the stretch, was caught in the final yards, though, managed to share second. DUNLUCE
CAISSLE settled off the early pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled widest into the stretch
and passed rivals. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled back off the rail early on, left the second turn outside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole
but showed little response. JUST NOD AND SMILE stalked the early pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far
turn. SUSPIROS rounded the opening turn in the four path, stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the
far turn.

Footnotes
SARAH BELLUM stalked off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep toward the quarter, dug in under steady handling to deep
stretch but was taken in hand late yards. TOTALLY PERFECT saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, ran five wide on the far turn and came along for second mid-stretch. RHYTHM TREE angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under
pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail nearing the quarter then flattened from mid-stretch. MOONLIGHT MISS settled off the rail the
first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. HOLIDAY CONNECTION stumbled at the break,
rounded the first turn in the three and four paths, bid past the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. LOVE CALIFORNIA saved
ground. BETTER BOAT showed little response. COLETTE'S SPIRIT raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
LIME AFTER LIME pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod past the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep on the turn,
dueled clear in the upper stretch and held well with steady handling. SISTER JOANN broke outward then engaged in close chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the stretch, though dueled for second. REAL APPEAL chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. DEREKA'S BLUFF gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path and finished well. LADY SPARROW chased
the pace, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. MARLEESBEEBEE closed to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a
pressured pace, was caught past the five sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the turn but weakened the final furlong. HAZY WINTER was forced out
at the start then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths and showed little in the lane. TIZ EVAN'S HONEY became fractious and
unseated her rider in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened.

JAYJAYDEE stalked off the rail, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms at the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep on
the far turn and dug in determinedly to draw clear later yards. SAVATIANO ran two deep on the opening turn then lugged in a half path at the seven eighths
pole, raced hemmed in through the front stretch then settled off the pace into the second turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in to take second the final yards. CHARITABLE SPENNY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the
seven sixteenths pole, was met at the five sixteenths and remained close at the rail on the far turn, though, flattened the final sixteenth. HOBE SOUND was
squeezed in tight at the rail at the seven eighths pole then saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and
five paths and ran evenly in the lane. JAMMIN JIMTOWN rated close to the early pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. CANTAKEITANYMORE settled back well off the rail and never factored. TY
RAN A HOMER rounded the first two turns in the four and five paths, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. The Stewards reviewed
a claim of foul against the rider of Savatiano for interference in the vicinity of the seven eighths pole, lodged by the rider of Hobe Sound, and consequently,
disqualified the former to fourth place for coming in on the latter at the aforementioned location. In addition, this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
GOSSIPING rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drew clear
past the eighth pole and held on well with steady handling. LACE REVOLUTION stalked off the rail, bid toward the three eighths pole and contested at a
close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, but drifted into the lane and couldn't recover the lost ground. COOKIE DUNK DUNK settled off the pace inside,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and raced evenly in the lane. RONA hopped leaving the gate and settled off the rail on
the first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in the lane. FORT ZANNA saved ground well off the
pace the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but could only improve her position. WILLOW'S CHARM and MY BEST GIRL showed little
response through the backstretch.
