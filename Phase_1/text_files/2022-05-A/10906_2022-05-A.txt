Footnotes
MORE ICE had a perfect ground saving trip while stalking the early pace stayed along the inside and quickly shot to the front along the rail in the stretch and
drew clear through the lane for the victory. PICKING ROSES raced along the inside well off the pace continued to chase along the inside and was closing
willingly along the inside through the stretch but was never a danger to the winner. CANDIZAR came five to six wide on the second turn to get into
contention and was closing well in the center of the stretch. THE GREEN MO'STER was away in good order and was pressing the pace in the two path held
gamely in the speed duel into the stretch but then gave way. YA GOTTA WANNA broke outward but was quickly taken to the back and was at the rail by the
first turn saved all the ground throughout but could make little headway. SENATOR CON was reluctant to load in the gate but got away in good order to
show keen early speed on the inside held gamely until the top of the stretch and then gave way. GOLD BEAR chased the pace three wide and had little to
offer in the stretch. VINYL was always well off the rail on the turns racing three to four wide and had nothing for the stretch run.

Footnotes
HURRICANE TIZWAY was away best and got the lead and the rail was challenged on the turn and drew clear with little asking to open a good lead and
then was urged mildly through the lane for the easy win. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA broke inwards a bit then stalked the pacesetter in the two path was
alongside that one on the turn but had nothing left to go with the winner through the stretch. KODIAK SKY was off a step slow and was allowed to settle well
off the early pace came out a bit entering the stretch and made a mild bid while never a threat to the top two. MOORAC lost her path early away from the
gates when Custom For Carlita broke inwards was still in a perfect stalking position three wide on the turn but gave way quickly with no apparent excuse.

the margin to the wire. CUSTOM MEDINA was away a step slow lost his path early and was rushed to chase the pace along the inside held second along
the rail while no match for the winner. MRS. DELLA showed good early speed in the two path to be closest to the eventual winner made a bid entering the
stretch but could not go with the winner and was edged for second. EMMAS RULER was in contention while three wide on the turn but could not sustain the
rally in the stretch. CONSERVATVE VALUES raced in the two path in striking position but never mounted a rally. SONG OF PARADISE was along the
inside up the backstretch was shuffled back going into the turn and was well behind the field after that.

HARRIET'S DREAM was the quickest early along the inside responded when challenged and drew clear through the stretch and had plenty left at the finish.
SUMMERJUSTBET HER was at the back of the main pack while two wide was carried out a bit on the turn then came to the inside for the stretch run and
was finishing with interest but could not get to the winner. BLUEBIRD SING broke in the air spotting the field about five lengths stayed along the inside and
was finishing well for third in a sold effort. AIRBORNE GAL was chasing the pace three deep in the turn drifted out through the stretch and could not go with
the top three. SHELLEY'S MONEY was away in good order and up close to the pace seem to want to lug out on the turn and dropped back. PINK POSSE
showed good early speed to chase the pacesetter in the two path but had nothing left in the drive and faded. FASHION MOON was extremely slow away
from the gates and was well behind the field shortly after the start stayed towards the inside but could never regain contact with the rest of the field.

Footnotes
I'M A CUSTOM TO IT showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail by the turn drew clear on her own on the turn and steadily increased the
margin to win as the rider pleased while never asked for run. EYESEEMONEY was well off the early pace along the inside began a four wide sweeping
move into the turn and was closing well while never a threat to the winner. BAD GAL RIRI dropped to the back of the field quickly to gain stride began a four
wide move on the turn and finished well. CAJUN ACES was able to get to the inside going into the turn lost some ground then made a mild bid while never a
threat to the winner. LISTEN JAN raced along the inside going into the turn in mid pack but never mounted a rally. TARGET VISION showed good early
speed but could not go with the winner into the turn and dropped back quickly. T J'S FIRST was mid pack in the early stages in the two path and faded while
never a serious factor. THETHRILLERSGONE was well off the pace along the inside and was never a serious factor. LOOKING HOT was up close to the
pace approaching the turn but gave way quickly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SILVER RATIO was quick early and able to get to the rail going into the turn drew clear on the turn to open a long lead and was never challenged and won
as the rider pleased. GUNNER PAUL was away well along the inside and held the rail drifted out a bit through the lane but was second best. MISTS OF
TIME had a two path trip while never seeing the inside rail and could not make up the needed ground. OTTOMAN EMPIRE was well off the rail the entire
race and could not make up the needed ground through the stretch. WEDINGTON was away very quickly and had a length lead a few jumps out of the gate
but steadily faded. FAR BEYOND was on the inside towards the back of the back into the turn and had the ground saving trip but never mounted a rally.
TOE BANDIT had a two path trip on the turn but backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
GOBLER was well off the pace circled the field three wide on the second turn took a good lead in the stretch and was never seriously challenged. INCA
WARRIOR was along the inside mid pack came through along the rail and then angled out for the stretch run and was finishing well for second. BANJO
BILL showed the best early speed on the rail held gamely to mid stretch then gave way while drifting out a bit. RELUCTANT WARRIOR chased the pace in
the two path was up close into the lane but was outfinished. DUE APEAL raced in the three path into the first turn and then faded into the second turn and
was never a serious factor. SHARPENDUP was up close to the pace along the inside angled out up the backstretch to make his move but then began a
steady fade and was never a factor after that while dropping back along the inside through the stretch.
