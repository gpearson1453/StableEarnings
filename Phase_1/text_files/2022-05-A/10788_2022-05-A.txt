ESSENTIAL BUSINESS vied outside runners three wide through the turn, kicked clear in the stretch. FLASHIN PASSION dueled inside the winner then
between foes into the turn, was no match for the winner. LITTLE PINCH settled off the pace, saved ground through much of the turn before moving out,
shifted out further in upper stretch, got up for show honors. ELIAS GIRL was forwardly-placed contending inside, gave way. WHY BABY WHY went three
wide on the turn and failed to menace. SNOOZY SUZY stumbled at the start, raced mid-pack going four wide on the turn, failed to threaten. SOULFUL
STRUT shifted in from four to two wide on the turn and failed to rally. MOVING VIOLATION broke a half-step slowly at the start, raced five wide into the turn
moving in three deep later on that bend, had no rally. LALIA shifted in and was not a factor. PER RULING 2022-RUI-35 'FLASHIN PASSION' WAS DQD
FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

AUTUMN TOUCH stalked three wide early, swung four wide into the stretch, dueled then edged away late. CORRINA CORRINA switched off the inside
early going two to three wide on the first turn, advanced outside foes into the far turn moving out from four to five wide on that bend, dueled in the stretch
and got the nod for place. ATILL I CHIME pressed the pace three wide, let the leader go on with it up the backstretch, came again to challenge at the top of
the stretch, dueled and got the nod for show in a blanket finish. OVERTIDE set the pace in the two path, moved clear coming to the quarter pole, was
re-engaged and dueled in the stretch but was outkicked. MISS LORDOSIS bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled at the rear racing inside, advanced
between rivals two to three wide on the far turn. MADDIE POPPE raced four wide into the first turn, moved in from three to two wide on the far turn, failed to
rally. QUITE LOVELY tracked inside briefly, steadily retreated.

BONFIRE PARTY moved clear and set the pace in the two path, just lasted under steady urging. BURNZ DA BOSS switched out heading up the
backstretch, went three wide on the turn, steadily gained but missed. HOLLAND chased in the second flight, went five wide on the turn, was gaining but too
late. TEQUILA TIME chased between foes, eased back and angled in coming to the five-sixteenths, gained into upper stretch then evened out. GO RED
RASCAL chased from between foes, moved out nearing the five-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, failed to rally. KEEN CAT chased outside, went six
wide on the turn, failed to rally. BLUEGRASS FAITH checked when in tight between foes at the five-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the turn and
passed some rivals. VODKA TWIST floated seven wide into the stretch and was never near enough to threaten. DEL ARGENT fanned six wide and failed to
rally. MIDNIGHT MYSTERY chased between rivals, was forced out and in tight at the five-sixteenths, shifted in on the turn and failed to rally. FOLLOWING
AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MIDNIGHT MYSTERY AGAINST BOTH GO RED RASCAL AND HOLLAND ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN bucked the rider off pre-race, broke sharply, set the pace racing off the rail, drifted from the two to the three path leaving the
turn, held the challenger at bay and was under vigorous hand-urging late. BETTER BELIEVE stalked the winner three to four wide through the turn, loomed
a threat but was second best. NEW CUT ROAD went three to four wide on the turn, held show honors. NEW MEXICO JEREMY went in the two path on the
turn, needed more. TATAS JOE MARK failed to rally after racing just off the rail. NACHO GRANDE broke awkwardly and was not a factor. SHAME ON SAM
bobbled just slightly at the break and was never a threat.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SPLIT was lightly brushed at the start, prompted the pace outside three deep, moved clear up the backstretch, edged away in the lane under
steady handling. RUNNINGINTHERAIN bobbled ever so slightly at the start, saved ground on the first turn pressing inside, eased back and switched out at
the half, went three wide on the second turn, held the place. MAGIC IS FLYING raced mostly four to five wide and ran on mildly. TIME TO RUMBLE went
three to four wide on the first turn, took closer order heading to the far turn, went four wide on that bend, loomed a threat but evened out. DIA DE PAGO was
forwardly-placed between rivals early, dropped back inside. BRON AND THE BROW bobbled just slightly and lightly brushed a rival at the start, floated five
wide into the first turn moving in just a bit on that bend, went three deep on the second turn and failed to menace. KEARNEY shifted in early, raced two wide
on the turns, failed to rally.
