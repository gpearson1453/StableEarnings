Footnotes
MISS LAUREN stalked from the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in for the lead past the eighth pole,
lugged in toward mid-stretch, drew clear inside the sixteenth pole and widened later yards. TIMETOGETUP raced with the early pace two deep, took the
nod nearing the half mile pole and came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was met past the eighth pole lost momentum in tight quarters at the rail in
the upper stretch then flattened stride later yards. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD saved early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in
the three and four paths and finished evenly outside. MOIRAINE rated a slim early lead inside, was met nearing the half mile pole, gave chase from that
point then flattened off the rail on the far turn. ROO broke a step slow and raced well back.

Footnotes
FORGOTTEN MISSION closed to the lead at the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, drifted toward the head of the lane, lugged in and made
contact with PERTH AMBOY under a right hand crop mid-stretch, then dug in under steady handling to hold on, while the latter chased inside, rounded the
turn near the rail, dug in from the eighth pole, was bumped in tight at the rail causing his rider to lose his whip in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, though,
finished well at the inside withers of the winner. COMMITTEEMAN set the pace the opening three sixteenths of a mile then pressured the pace from the
three eighths pole, rounded the turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. HELLO CARLO gave chase, raced wide into the turn then closed the gap in
an even finish. THE BIG K gave chase toward mid track, rounded the turn in the five path then flattened in the lane. PARISHIONER propped in the post
parade and showed no apparent interest. JUST GETS BETTER was not a factor. After posting the inquiry and reviewing a subsequent claim of foul against
the rider of Forgotten Mission, lodged by the rider of Perth Amboy, the Stewards disqualified the former to second place for making contact with the latter
mid-stretch.

KADRI angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in under
determined handling to hold off the late challenge of NO CHANGE, who saved early ground, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn
about the three path, was carried out and brushed lightly leaving the turn but dug in a game threat through the final sixteenth. SPEIGHTSFORD stalked two
deep, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close through the far turn, drifted making light contact with No Change into the lane then
flattened the final furlong. HUNTER JOE stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little further. DONTMESAWITHME saved ground well off the pace and showed little response through the
backstretch. SOUND OFF raced well back inside and could only close the gap.
