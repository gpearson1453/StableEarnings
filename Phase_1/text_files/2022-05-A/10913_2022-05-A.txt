ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide leaving the turn, battled beside AUNT STELLA
in the stretch and shook free under urging inside the last sixteenth. PRANCIPANTS broke on top then was allowed to settle to the back, picked up hr pace
well off the inside on the bend, fanned widest for the stretch run, was all out and took over second thirty yards out. AUNT STELLA soon had a clear lead,
was challenged from outside nearing the end of two furlongs, drew clear again on the turn, was engaged again upper stretch and slowly wore down.
DIAMOND GUCCI chased from off the inside and was never a factor. RENDLAKE pressed AUNT STELLA from just outside for nearly four furlongs then
gave way.

Footnotes
APPLE VALLEY shared the early lead from inside, retreated some into the bend, was steadied when her path was taken midway on the turn, altered to the
outside, rallied under steady urging in the stretch and got up in the waning yards. RULER DAENERYS contested the pace between horses, took the rail
midway on the bend, drew clear upper stretch, was all out in the late going, did not have enough left but proved easily second best. CYBERTAP broke
inward, bumping MISS SWAMP TALES, was boxed in behind the leaders in the early going, did not keep up on the turn, angled out widest upper stretch
and caught the fading DRIVING WIND for third late. DRIVING WIND soon advanced from outside to share the lead just outside RULER DAENERYS but
gave way for the drive. MISS SWAMP TALES showed little.

outside IMPERIAL MOMENT in the early going, battled for second outside SEMINOLE BEACH in the lane, wore down inside the last eighth but was easily
best of the others. E Z TAPIT raced in contention toward the outside for five furlongs then gave way two wide on the bend. MON AMI FUZZIE chased from

outside, moved clear for the lead into the turn, was challenged from outside leaving the bend, angled outside DELIGHTFUL BREEZE upper stretch and
slowly wore down through the waning yards. RONAN chased from outside on the backstretch, angled in to save ground on the turn, swung widest for the

Footnotes
GO MADI GO broke a step slow and inward, advanced between rivals, weaved through traffic to progress taking the turn, made a strong move under a drive
four wide in the lane, swept past DOLLY'S LINE inside the final furlong then drew away while kept to urging until the last sixty yards. DOLLY'S LINE soon
overcame a somewhat awkward start to be prominent between rivals, took over from path three on the bend, angled in some for the stretch run, was no
match for GO MADI GO inside the last eighth but held onto second under steady handling. WILDCAT BOBBIE chased running widest, lost ground four then
five wide through the turn, surged when put to a drive inside the last furlong and got up for third. TENSE bumped with MISS WINDY SLEW at the break,
contested the pace inside rivals from the early going, was overtaken on the bend and slowly yielded the final furlong. MOON PIES IMAGE prominent early,
faded from between horses on the turn, moved inside upper stretch, improved her position, angled outside TENSE with a sixteenth left then leveled off.
SHINE DOWN displayed early speed between horses but began to tire before finishing a half mile. MISS WINDY SLEW bumped with TENSE at the start,
was well placed from inside on the backstretch but also yielded before the end of four furlongs. MISS KITTY PIE also a step slow at the start, showed little in
a ground-saving trip. Due to a timing glitch, the final electronic time for the race was incorrectly displayed on the board and television monitor.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SECRET bumped from the rear at the break, vied for the early lead outside SHANGHAI POINT, moved ahead of the latter upper stretch,
gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure inside the final furlong, battled on even terms outside TETSU the last seventy yards and got the nod at the
wire. TETSU prominent from the beginning, saved ground taking the bend, was caught in tight quarters along the rail midstretch, squeezed through nearing
the sixteenth marker, came to even terms with WILDWOOD SECRET seventy yards out but had to settle for second best. MKAR THE FAST made a small
leap inward leaving the gate, bumping with WILDWOOD SECRET, chased from outside, lost ground three to five wide taking the turn, rallied belatedly the
last eighth but got up for third. SHANGHAI POINT vied for the lead inside horses but just off the rail, did not stay with WILDWOOD SECRET upper stretch,
was challenged for second from inside nearing the eighth pole, steadied briefly in close quarters with TETSU and as WILDWOOD SECRET came into his
path approaching the sixteenth marker then continued to gradually yield. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN soon trailed, angled out on the bend and had no significant
stretch response. TAP'S BIG SHOT raced in contention between rivals on the backstretch, was four wide taking the turn then gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE kept close, commenced her bid from path four on the bend, was carried out leaving the turn, rallied to edged ahead from the middle of the
track midstretch and held off DUSTY MILLER under steady urging. DUSTY MILLER chased running widest, in path five on the bend, angled in entering the
lane, rallied between horses, fought gamely the final sixteenth but had to settle for second best. WATCHIN THE WHEELS without early speed, saved
ground taking the turn and found best stride too late from along the rail inside the last eighth. ASHLEY ELIZABETH disputed the pace from inside, moved
ahead and began to gradually float out leaving the turn, came into the lane from path five, lost the lead, slowly yielded and was drifting out again in the
waning yards. BOWS N LACE soon trailed, gradually angled in taking the turn and passed inside tired ones the final furlong. RUBY ROUND HERE chased
from just off the inside, progressed on the bend to have a striking position with a furlong to go but flattened out instead. HALO COUTURE displayed early
speed outside ASHLEY ELIZABETH, retreated a bit from between horses on the turn, was steadied briefly as she was carried out leaving the bend, altered
in and gave way through the lane.
