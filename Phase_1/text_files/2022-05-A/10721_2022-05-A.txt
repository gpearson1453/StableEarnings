Footnotes
KANITHAPPEN was sent for pace, took over into the first turn, continued clear on the lead down the back straight and in the two path on the far turn, was
pushed along in upper stretch and briefly driven midstretch, drifted out near the sixteenth but continued to draw off. KING ZION was sent for pace but
outsprinted by KANITHAPPEN into the clubhouse turn, tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, tracked the leading
pair in the three to four path around the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, proved no match for KANITHAPPEN into the lane but chased on willingly
for place. ROUSING SIREN soon trailed, continued unhurried to near the half, rallied in the four path around the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch,
chased on but could not find enough to get up for the place. TEQUILA REVOLUTION tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, chased the
leading trio down the back straight and in the two to three path on the turn, steadied inside in upper stretch when LARK came in on him, altered outside of
that foe, and chased on without finding a late kick. LARK raced near the rear into the first turn, but keenly advanced past the seven eighths, joined outside of
TEQUILA REVOLUTION to chase the pace around that bend, continued eagerly into the backstretch to track the pace outside of KING ZION past the three
quarters, tracked the leader in the three path on the far turn, proved no match for KANITHAPPEN into the stretch, came in on TEQUILA REVOLUTION in
upper stretch, and weakened. TEA AFTER BALLET settled near the rear, hugged the rail around the far turn and mustered no rally. OFF TO THE BEACH
chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, settled back toward the rear outside of TEA AFTER BALLET into the back straight, was outpaced in the two
path on the far turn and had no bid in the lane.

JUDY'S MS. OFFICER tracked the leading pair, began a three-wide bid past the seven sixteenths, engaged outside of ULIKEAPPLES approaching the five
sixteenths, took the lead at the quarter, carried a short lead to the three sixteenths, drove clear from there and held safe. MORRIE'S JOY chased the
leading pair inside of JUDY'S MS OFFICER down the backstretch, chased the leading trio while saving ground around the end, was taken out to the six path
near the three sixteenths, found her best stride approaching the furlong pole and ran on for place. SENSE OF FLURRY broke well, tracked the pacesetter
down the back straight and two wide on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch and shifted out, and chased on mildly for the show while no match for
MORRIE'S JOY in the final furlong. ULIKEAPPLES was sent for pace, went to firm urging near the seven sixteenths, was engaged to her outside by JUDY'S
MS. OFFICER approaching the five eighths, was headed by that foe near the quarter, continued in close range inside of the new leader to the three
sixteenths, and weakened inside. BACKSTAGE BAMBI soon trailed, raced near the center of the track down the back straight, raced in the rear pair in the

Footnotes
KREWE CHIEF settled toward the rear though the first turn, edged closer approaching the far turn, was pushed along in the four path and continued to
improve, engaged outside the leading flight past the three eighths, led briefly near the quarter, continued to pursue as ONE WAY HOME slipped clear again
into upper stretch, drove to the lead again past the furlong pole, drifted out but maintained the advantage to the wire. ONE WAY HOME was placed on the
lead, took some light pressure from ITS MY BAG BABY near the five eighths, continued to set the pace in the two path on the far turn while engaged by ITS
MY BAG BABY and then KREWE CHIEF, was headed approaching the quarter pole, reasserted his lead in upper stretch, was reeled back in by KREWE
CHIEF past the furlong mark, kept on willingly but proved second best. TRY TRY AGAIN settled at the rear, continued to trail in the four to five path around
the far turn, began to improve approaching the quarter, was driven into the lane near the center of the course, found his best in the final furlong and gained
to the finish. ITS MY BAG BABY tracked two wide early, advanced near the five eighths to prompt ITS MY BAG BABY, engaged that foe in earnest in the
three path on the turn, loomed between horses near the quarter, but was no match for ONE WAY HOME and KREWE CHIEF from upper stretch and
chased on only mildly from there. COMFORT ME NOW tracked the early pace inside of ITS MY BAG BABY, chased inside of KREWE CHIEF down the
backstretch, dropped to the inside into the far turn and was pushed along while racing at the rail, bid inside in upper stretch, was in range inside through
midstretch but flattened out inside late.

Footnotes
DISTORTED VIEW saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing on the rail around the far
turn, and drew off down the lane. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace, began to improve position from the three path around the far turn, gained ground in upper stretch, switched to the
outside when SENSE OF SELF drifted into his lane and managed to get up for second. GOOD MONGOLIA saved ground around the first turn, raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid from the rail nearing the quarter pole and
gained ground in the lane, just missing the place. SWEET N SASSY bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the
first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. SENSE OF SELF raced in the two
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the two path, and faded while
drifting out in late stretch. KINGSBURY DREAM trailed the field the entire way around the oval and despite saving ground was never a factor. THE THREE
QUARTER FRACTION IS HAND TIMED FOR THIS RACE.

ROB THE RICH pressed the pace outside of CYRIL'S BOY down the back straight and into the turn, took the lead outside that foe past the seven
sixteenths, began to open up when asked in upper stretch, and drew off while kept to the task. CYRIL'S BOY set a pressured pace inside of ROB THE
RICH, was headed past the seven sixteenths, tracked the leader from inside around the rest of the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch but proved no match
for ROB THE RICH, and chased on a clear second best. COCO BRAVADO tracked the leaders inside of KING TITO down the back straight, chased them
while racing in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in the five path in upper stretch, and chased on mildly while no match for the top two. KING TITO
tracked the leaders two wide down the backstretch, chased the leading pair in the three path on the turn, swung into upper stretch in the six path, and
lacked the needed rally. LAKE MILLS broke with the field but ducked sharply inward in the opening strides, bumped the rail, dropped back, was briefly
driven in the seven to eight path in upper stretch and was never involved.

Footnotes
W W CRAZY raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground between
horses to pull clear late. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, recovered to duel between horses up the
backstretch, pressed the pace while saving ground around the turn, and raced evenly on the rail down the stretch, just holding second from a late closer.
EDITOR IN CHIEF trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, began a bid nearing the
eighth pole and was gaining ground quickly at the wire. ON K P veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead on
the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, showed the way from the two path while racing around the turn, and weakened while drifting out
significantly in the final furlong. LIKEABLE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leader from the two path around
the turn and tired in the stretch. BASEBALL POLITICS was bumped by the horse to his inside and squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the middle of
the pack up the backstretch, began to drop back from the three path around the turn and faded further from there.
