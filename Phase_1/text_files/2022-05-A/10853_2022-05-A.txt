ONE PUNCH CHARLIE stalked the pace along the inside, moved up gamely near the quarter pole and held determinedly in the drive under strong handling.
READY AT DAWN showed good early speed, raced off the inside in the stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. COPINSAY broke in at the start, moved
up five wide through the far turn and gained ground on the top pair late. BEYOND MY DREAMS pressed the early pace and weakened while racing four
wide through the upper stretch. DIAMONDBACK was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MANE SOCIETY
clipped heels soon after the break, raced at the back of the pack after the troubling beginning and trailed while racing near the inside.

Footnotes
CHAIRMAN BOB was slow early on, made an advance through the far turn, angled widest through the lane, surged and got up under strong
encouragement. LIGHT THE LAMP showed good early speed to set the early pace, led inside the sixteenth pole and was wore down late to finish second
best. KIDDIE HOLIDAY settled off the early going, raced four wide to five wide through the upper stretch and moved up late. GIANT TEDDY stalked the
pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. ROMANTIC GAMBLE was forwardly placed to lay up close early on
and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing three wide. I'M A CHI TOO was off slowly, raced four wide and had no late rally. LUCYS CHILD
dropped back off the early pace, raced three wide and had no response. BIG BAD BEAST settled off the early going, raced towards the inside and had no
response. GATLING GUN failed to sustain a bid while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
OCELOT pressed the early leader down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn, raced off the inside in the lane and drew clear late under
strong pressure. CRUDEN BAY stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
gained ground late to get up for the place position. PRINCE OF THIEVES settled off the early pace, waited near the quarter pole, angled in through the
upper lane and made a bid from near the rail and had not enough for the top pair. GANCHO stalked the pace, raced two to three wide and had not enough
in the drive. HIGH HEAT stalked the pace and weakened through the upper stretch while racing four wide. MAD DOG N JOE settled off the early pace,
raced near the inside at the five sixteenths pole, angled five to six wide through the lane and had no late rally. BROWNING ISLAND was slow early, raced
seven wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. AMMUNITION settled off the early pace, raced four wide and had no response.
UNSPEAKABLE dropped back early and failed to respond. HELMS BEAR showed good early foot to set the pace and tired readily.
