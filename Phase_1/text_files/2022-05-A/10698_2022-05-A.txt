MON CAMO broke in front, set all the pace, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack despite right handed urging and edged clear late. GEHRIG had speed
from the start along the inside, shifted outside the winner nearing the turn, was carried out through the stretch, cam on again nearing the furlong marker and
finished second best. LAZARUS PROJECT hopped at the start, was never far back, inched closer in the seven path entering the stretch, dropped into the
four path then leveled off. HALO'S DANCE failed to menace. RULING EMPIRE had good early speed then faded. THE RIDER OF GEHRIG LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE HALF MILE POLE, AFTER REVIEW THE
