deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. RIVER CROSROAD RVF rated a slim lead inside, was met nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, gave up the nod at the rail midway on the far turn and relented the final sixteenth. LIKE SEGAL settled off the
pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled through the stretch for third.
PRAIRIE saved ground on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
MACY'S BOY stalked from the three path, left the first turn outside and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, though, weakened in the three path of the
far turn. MO MISCHIEF came away awkwardly then rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but faded past the

PRIMETIME JET closed to the lead at the three eighths pole and rated the pace, dueled at even terms nearest the rail on the turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to hold off the challenge of CATS DIAMOND BOY, who raced wide through the backstretch, dueled to even terms two deep midway on the
turn and was hand urged through the lane. SECRET SWIRL chased through the backstretch, ran in the four path of the turn, drifted leaving the turn and ran
evenly in the lane. ORANGEBURG chased toward the outside through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals.
SIENTE EL AMOR chased toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly to pass rivals. NEEDNOEXPLANATION gave
chase, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened in the lane. NICE BUT NAUGHTY stumbled at the break, picked up the chase through the backstretch,
ran at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. BIGAIRTOTHETHROWN saved ground. BOO TOO gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six
path and showed little in the lane. GAVINS BOY raced well back saving ground.

Footnotes
MARTIN MAN saved early ground then closed for the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily
handled in the lane. CHARGING LION stalked toward the inside, drew to even terms and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the quarter
pole, raced close nearest the rail on the far turn but had to settle for second best. ALPHA QUEUE took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace, was
met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at the rail from that point, but dropped back past the quarter pole and flattened stride. MIDNIGHT
SHIFT saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. SHAMCAT settled
off the early pace off the rail, showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn in the four and five paths. SUNMAN became fractious
in the gate and saved ground throughout. COURT AND SPARK rounded the opening turn about the five path and left the second turn outside, bid mildly
from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn.

MATH MAN MARCO quickly cleared rivals and rated the pace, came under pressure at the rail leaving the quarter pole and dug in under steady stretch
encouragement to hold off the late threat of COASTAL MISSION, who gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path, finished well and was gaining
slowly on the winner. ROYAL PAIN chased toward the inside, ran at the rail on the turn and came along for third mid-stretch. JEFFERSON NATIVE became
a bit edgy in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. SPIRIT OF WINDSOR
stumbled and lost his rider leaving the gate. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race before posting it official.

FLAT CAT veered out leaving the gate, closed to the front nearing the three quarter pole and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, was asked leaving the
five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn then coasted through the stretch. PLONDER stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and settled for second while flattening later yards. NOT TELLING saved ground racing well back from
early contention, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third later yards. MOUNTAIN TIME settled
off the early pace inside then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed
little further. HACKER MAN was forced out leaving the gate and raced well back about the three path the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch, gave
chase from the seven sxiteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the seven path and passed rivals outside. HOLIDAY AVENUE rounded the first turn in the
three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran two deep on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. TOMMY PIES settled in the three
path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded in the four path on the far turn. CITIZEN'S FIRE saved ground. WALK THE BANK
rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn.
