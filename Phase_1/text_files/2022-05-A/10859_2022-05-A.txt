Footnotes
FLUFFPOINT stumbled at the start to be last away, moved up steadily along the inside to gain the advantage before a quarter, showed the way through the
turn, garnered a larger advantage past the furlong marker, kept to firm pressure to the wire, enough left to withstand a late gain from the runner up.
HOMELAND MESSA lacked early foot, split foes into the stretch, set down, steadily getting to the winner late. PAT ME DOWN within striking distance along
the inside early, fell back through the turn while continuing to save ground, rebid up the rail also be getting to the winning in the waning strides. FELLER
prompted the issue early outside, moved closest to the winner while outside midway on the turn, four wide into the lane, went flat the final furlong. BAYOU
BEAUX off the pace and the inside, moved outside, was five wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing kick. THE FLUSH KING broke alertly to show the way
early, relinquished the advantage to the winner before a furlong, chased that one into the turn, began to fade after three furlongs.

XIETELEHUAS broke out, settled off the rail and the inside, came widest for the drive, set down, closed with good resolve to be up in time. F J'S GEM
closest to the leader off the inside, crept closer to that one turning for home, put a head in front a furlong out, led late, nailed on the final strides. SPIN
TOWN moved up after the start, set the pace inside, continued to show the way into the lane, grudgingly gave up the advantage to the runner at the furlong
grounds, proved stubborn to the end. FIFTYFIVE STRONG in the second flight toward the inside, remained within striking distance into the lane, moved
closer with a furlong remaining then flattened out. VALIANT DEFENDER fell back to trail soon after the start, was never a factor in a dull effort.

Footnotes
CORN SOUP in the second flight outside, three wide into the lane when moving closer, challenged on the outside of the first flight past the furlong marker,
shook clear, enough left to withstand a late surge from the runner up. PROUDTOWN broke back, continued to lag for a half, swung six wide into the lane,
closed with good energy down the center of the strip to be getting to the winner. MR. E EDWARDS a forward factor from the start, continued to force the
issue into the lane, put a head in front with a furlong remaining, could not contain the top two, remained clear of the others. LAST NATIVE CAT broke
alertly,. showed the way up the backstretch by a narrow margin, continued to hold a slight advantage into the stretch, faltered when headed a furlong outs.
PLAY MASTER lacked speed off the inside, improved position gradually while not posing a serious threat. GRAND PRODUCTION in the second flight for a
half inside, came up empty for the drive. ALL STAR SPECIAL lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn and made little impact. YANKEE HAIL CAT
failed to menace while racing one paced three wide. QUADRAJET flashed brief early speed then retreated inside. CHELSEA'S GLORY off a step slow,
raced back throughout and was never a factor. FIGHTING SOLDIER in the second flight up the backstretch, in some traffic late backstretch, gave way in the
turn.

Footnotes
CHEAPSKATE DIVA broke sharp, soon clear, extended that advantage middle half, remained far clear into the lane then coasted home, comfortably holding
the runner up safe. WORLD OF HURT broke out to force out ANN'S STORM, settled well off the pace, came three wide into the stretch, finished willingly to
be well clear for the place while getting to the winner but was was left with too much to do. ANN'S STORM forced out, bumped foe start, fell back to trail,
continued void of speed into the far turn, came three to four wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest out in the course. TRINITY
HOPE off a step slow, bumped, raced back, staged some mild improvement with some moderate interest as well. CZAR'S BALLERINA chased the winner
early, had little left for the drive. BITSY C C LIL GIRL 2nd flight, chased the middle half and into the stretch, caved the final furlong. SHE'S CUSTOM MADE
in mid pack for six furlongs, backed up stretch. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GRAND PRADO asked a bit to maintain inside and frontal position away from the gate, dueled into and through the turn, shook off the other speed to be
clear in upper stretch, held the runner up safe late. FAMOUS YANKEE in the second flight inside, moved out a bit for the drive, moved closer, bothered by a
drifting ENCHANTED MOON with a furlong remaining, proved determined for the place while slowly getting to the winner. BERNIE SPECIAL in the second
group while racing off the inside, moved closer outside the winner in midstretch, outkicked for the second spot. SADIE'S LIGHT void of speed, remained
back into the lane, remained one paced to the wire in lacking closing kick. ENCHANTED MOON dueled up front outside the winner, continued to alternate
through the turn, began to weaken and was unable to keep up when straightened for home, drifted out to bother FAMOUS YANKEE a furlong out, continued
to fade. MR. CURLIN last away, trailed, came five wide into the lane while getting out a bit, no rally. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HENNING last to leave, trailed early, began to move on the outside before a half, reached the front three wide turning for home, spurted clear past the
furlong marker, continued to widen without being asked for his best to win ridden out. WE NEED A FIVE void of speed while in front of the winner early,
trailed the middle half mile, came four wide out of the final turn, rallied to be edging clear for the place, no threat to the victor. ST BASIL raced in mid pack
while inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, finished up best of the rest. PALANTE asked early, chased the dueling leaders early,
advanced and challenged three wide second turn, briefly led then offered short lived resistance to the winner, faltered the final furlong. OAK HILL LG
remained back in failing to menace. BOLD DANCER dueled in the two path, continued to vie into the far turn, gave way from between rivals midway on that
bend and continued to back up through the stretch. BLUE RIDGE RED broke on top, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, stopped after five furlongs.

Footnotes
YOUNG TUSCAN broke sharp, cleared to the inside the opening furlong, continued to show the way into the lane, headed past the furlong marker, found
more to regain the advantage late in a game effort. FIFTY PROTECTION away in good order, chased the winner into the turn, dueled in the two path and
through upper stretch, put a head in front a furlong outside, was outkicked in the late going, remained clear for the drive. M AND M'S CUSTOM forwardly
placed while along the inside, lacked a winning response. LUCKY BIG DADDY void of speed for three furlongs, swung out five wide turning for home,
improved position with some interest down the middle of the strip. ARGYBARGY BUCK also lacked any early speed, came five wide into the lane and
improved position as well. K T'S JILTED GROOM one paced while racing in mid pack throughout. GOODROCKINALVIN forwardly placed for three furlongs
off the inside, had little for the drive. BRAD EYE in the main body through the turn, tired through the lane. SHADY MONKEY remained back throughout in
failing to threaten. P T'S FLASH fell back to trail after the start, remained sluggish and well back, jogged in.
