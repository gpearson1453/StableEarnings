Footnotes
SHACKABOOM quickly established command, set a rated pace just off the inside, responded when set down two wide in upper stretch, kept on under left
handed asking past the sixteenth marker and held firm. RAN CHAR edged up between runners nearing the half mile marker, tracked three to four wide,
circled into the lane and continued gamely to be clearly second best. THEA'S THEME had speed to the inside of the winner, steadied off that one after a
furlong, was lightly steadied leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch, chased but lacked a solid finish. SUZZETTE STAR saved ground while
within range past the three eighths, saw the leaders get away into the lane then gave futile chase to the wire. SING ALONG SUZY , four wide early,
steadied leaving the far turn and lacked a kick. SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS , four and five wide outside a rival into the turn, was under pressure leaving the
three eighths and faded.

STROLL SMOKIN was nudged up between rivals soon after the break then went clear after a furlong, set the pace under a light hold while slightly off the
inside, responded to strong handling in the drive and clearly proved best. JOVIS , away alertly, stalked three wide outside a rival, failed to make serious
inroads through the final furlong but stayed on with good energy to be clear of the rest. GLORY SONG gave hard chase two wide and to the inside of
JOVIS, dropped back a bit in upper stretch but kept on with interest to gain the show. SEANOW saving ground with pursuit but lacked a response. BEAR
FORCE WON broke awkwardly, regrouped and settled in last, moved up two wide mid turn, angled four wide with some momentum into the lane, failed to
kick on past mid stretch and faded.

LITTLE BIT OF THAT sprinted to the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn and drew away through the stretch under steady handling.
HITCH A RIDE , three deep on the turn, chased the winner in a willing effort. MOONSAFE , moved over early, was a forward factor inside horses and
finished well. MAGICAL LUNA , three wide entering the turn, was taken to the inner rail leaving the turn and lacked a rally inside horses. GUSTAV'S GIRL ,
steadied lacking room along the inner rail leaving the turn, moved over to the three path in upper stretch and showed a late move. PEACE OUT , three wide
on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
HOUSE WRECKER had speed then was deftly maneuvered just off the leaders, tracked three wide off the duel leaving the three sixteenths, shifted out a bit
wider and closed in under strong handling, bid outside foes in mid stretch, struck the top a sixteenth out then drew clear in the final yards. FLIRTATIOUS
LASS sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure leaving the far turn, dueled into the lane, fought on through the final furlong and
regained the place. THIEF OF HEARTS prompted the pace outside FLIRTATIOUS LASS, moved alongside leaving the five sixteenths, dueled and gained a
slim lead into the lane, stayed on between rivals leaving mid stretch, had her rider lose his whip with about a sixteenth to go then gave way grudgingly.
LIKELY CHOICE , inside and off the pace, shifted out for the drive but needed more. BOURBON WILDCAT drifted in at the break, corrected and moved up
outside a rival into the turn, chased and kept on with some interest. STARTWITHABANG , sluggish from the gate, raced well back for five furlongs then got
going late towards the rail and kept on nicely through the gallop out.

YOU MUST CHILL , reluctant to load into the starting gate, raced three wide entering the first turn, was confidently handled outside horses down the
backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, gained command in upper stretch, raced on his left lead and drove clear under steady encouragement. INDIAN
LAKE sprinted clear on the first turn, set the pace near the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch then dug in gamely to hold the place. PLOT THE DOTS
lacked speed, circled both turns three wide, was well positioned entering the stretch and flattened out. MONEY RIDE , in the two path chasing the pace
down the backstretch, gave way on the far turn. CROUCHELLI , outrun, swung wide in upper stretch. WHISKEY AND YOU , briefly steadied in close
quarters entering the first turn, chased the pace racing along the rail and faltered on the far turn.

OUR FREEDOM , off the early pace, edged up while saving ground into the far turn, eased out and bumped with a rival soon into the lane, worked between
rivals, angled in to challenge in mid stretch, gained command a sixteenth out then drew clear. STREET LAMP stalked outside, took closer order into the
turn, bid three deep mid turn, vied then cleared four wide into the stretch, dug in when challenged from both sides in mid stretch and continued gamely to
save the place. CLASSY UNION rated inside, moved up into the turn and tracked, angled four wide past the three eighths, bumped with the winner near the
quarter pole, bid outside foes in mid stretch then hung late. ULF broke slowly, settled off the pace, angled four wide with some momentum into the stretch,
shifted in late and kept on with interest. THE THINKER chased off the rail, angled out in the drive but lacked a serious bid. SCINTILLIO prompted the pace,
bid between foes mid turn, dueled nearing the lane, battled inside foes past the quarter pole, steadied briefly near mid stretch and faded. SWALLOW
BEACH was outrun. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR sped to command towards the inside, took pressure into the turn, fought on to about the five sixteenths then
surrendered.
