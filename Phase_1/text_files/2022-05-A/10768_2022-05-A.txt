MAYBEE A DIVA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away.
IKNOWYOURFACE broke sharply to duel for the early advantage while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive to hold the place. TANAGER was void
of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. INEEDAMANIANDAPEDI was away in
good order to dispute the pace from off the rail and gave way in the drive. FANCY GI GI lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention. MY FUNNY GAL was off slow, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

CIRCLE WEST was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing from off the rail, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and was fully
extended to hold off the closing SKY CONFIDENTIAL by a diminishing margin. SKY CONFIDENTIAL pressed the pace while racing four-wide, responded
when set down for the drive and was gaining on the winner late. SOLEROCKER was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to
gain in the drive. TWILIGHT RIDER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ARUGULA was never far back, raced
three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. RENO ROY showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

DAREABIGDREAM was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin
with a quarter to run and held sway to the wire. MIZZEN POWER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain
on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. TRAPALIS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with
good energy. SUPER INTENSE broke sharply to be forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response.
TRINNI VALANTINE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. INCREDIBE MO raced off the pacesetters early,
moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SHADYFIED was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
ROADSIDE lagged early, angled out approaching the stretch and did not reach contention. LETHAL ALEXANDER lacked early foot, raced off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor. BAD BOY BILL set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened after going three furlongs. ELIJAH SCHNELL
was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BOB'S ALL IN tracked the pace of EXETER from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
EXETER was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and yielded to the winner through the final
sixteenth. WILLTOBELUCKY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. BLUES RAPPER
lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late. CIBERTRUCK was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and lacked the needed closing response. OSTINI was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. TOP
OF THE GAME showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. OUTLAW BY NATURE was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MONUMENTAL SEVEN broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened
after going a half.

threaten. LITTLE AXE SOUL was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. NATURAL IMMUNITY
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. PAISLEY'S VISION was off slow, raced four-wide through the turn and did not

Footnotes
BOUNTY OF GOLD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by GO GO SADIE into the stretch, vied
with that rival and gamely held off the late charge of BOLD INTENTION to prevail. BOLD INTENTION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. CHEROKEE PAPOOSE was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with good energy. GO GO SADIE chased the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to
engage that foe nearing the quarter, vied and gave way late. ADDYDIDIT was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a
belated bid. WAY TO FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. WORKIN NINETOFIVE lagged early, saved
ground through the turn and was not a factor. MISCHIEF MAMA was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. SCAT
ATTACK pressed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and weakened. BLUE GESSAMI raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
turn and weakened. GLORIOUS DAY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
