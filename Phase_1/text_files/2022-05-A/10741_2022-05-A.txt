Footnotes
HELLOFAGUY rated just outside YABA DABA DOO on the backstretch, was roused nearing the quarter pole, under a steady drive through the lane and
began to shake off the latter in the waning yards. YABA DABA DOO vied for the lead inside rivals from the start, fought through the stretch, began to yield
slightly with a furlong to go, his rider lost his whip just inside the sixteenth marker and had to settle for second best. COOL AMBITION moved to the inside
after a furlong and a half, progressed along the rail on the bend, rallied to loom a threat midstretch but could only just hold third late. RIPE ATTACK caught
in crowding shortly after the break, moved to the inside early on, found himself boxed in nearing the turn, was steadied, altered out three wide with three
furlongs left, gradually drifted out upper stretch, was straightened with a furlong to go but could not close the gap. RICHIESONARAMPAGE gave way widest
on the turn.

Footnotes
SWEET LITTLE RUE moved to the inside early on, commenced his bid along the rail on the bend, angled outside LAYTON THE DAY upper stretch, took
the lead inside the last eighth, was clear of the others with a sixteenth to go and held off BONNIE DANCES under steady handling. BONNIE DANCES
without early speed, was blocked on the backstretch, lost considerable ground moved to the outside on the bend, came widest into the lane, was all out,
came up short but proved clearly second best. THACKER FROMM raced in the second flight between horses, stayed outside SWEET LITTLE RUE upper
stretch, angled in behind that one with a furlong to go and leveled off in the late going. LAYTON THE DAY broke alertly and soon sprinted away from the
rest with little encouragement, began to yield some leaving the bend and continued to gradually flattened out through the lane. TEARS ON A RIVER was
hustled along from between rivals then came up empty for the drive. HIYO SILVER AWAY was a brief contender from outside but began to fade after three
furlongs.

stretch, kept a straight path the last furlong and edged ahead for third. FRIEND prominent just inside MARIA'S GIFT on the backstretch, moved to the inside
midway on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, drew clear for third but did not have enough left to keep her position in the waning yards. BURNING

MKAR THE FAST rated from inside, was let out along the rail on the bend, moved clear under urging upper stretch and was kept to task to the waning
yards. FULL MAGAZINE helped prompt the pace from between rivals, angled out three wide on the turn, drifted out some entering the lane then drew away
for second just inside the last eighth. A BOLD RYDE without early speed, though hustled along, rallied from inside in the stretch and caught GREAT
PLAINES for third inside the final sixteenth. GREAT PLAINES soon gained a clear lead, stayed off the rail taking the turn then wore down from between
horses in the stretch. TIZRIK raced in contention from between horses for three furlongs then began to yield. A MERRY HEART was an early factor running
widest but began to flatten four wide on the bend.

Footnotes
TONYS MORNING LINE exchanged bumped with LUKE ATTACK after the break, quickly recovered to share the lead from between horses, moved ahead
from path two on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, opened up under urging and maintained full control while kept to task to the wire. WALKER'S
WIN in contention early from outside, lost ground five wide on the turn, began to angled in leaving the turn, moved to the inside upper stretch and pulled
away for second inside the last eighth. BRIANS WAY disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, angled outside TONYS
MORNING LINE with two furlongs to go, floated out to path five into the lane, was no match for the latter, began to wear down, his rider lost his whip with a
sixteenth left but proved easily best of the others. TRUIST raced in contention between rivals early, advanced two wide on the turn but flattened out just off
the inside or the stretch run. INSIDE THE CIRCLE bumped with SKIP AWAY CARTER at the start, contested the pace between rivals, began to yield some
four wide on the bend, gradually drifted out upper stretch, was corrected but continued to fade. LUKE ATTACK exchanged bumps with TONYS MORNING
LINE at the start, shuffled back from crowding into the turn, came into the lane from path four and had no late bid. SNOOZER displayed early speed from
outside, did not keep up on the turn, angled in some with two furlongs to go then gave way between foes. DARREN'S LEGACY hesitated at the break, was
prominent from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend. SKIP AWAY CARTER bumped with INSIDE THE CIRCLE at the start, altered in quickly
to avoid crowding and was never a factor. EIGHT MAY also hesitated at the start and was always outrun. Due to a timer malfunction, the half mile fraction is
unavailable.

Footnotes
PALAGO rated in the second flight from outside, was three wide on the turn, fanned outside SACRED STORM for the stretch run, rallied and got up in time
under a well-judged ride. PLAY TWENTY shared the early lead from inside, moved clear on the turn, lengthened command under a drive in the lane but did
not have enough left the final sixteenth. SACRED STORM vied for the lead outside rivals from the start, did not keep up from path three leaving the turn, ran
evenly through the stretch but was easily best of the rest. LOUIE P was in contention early between rivals but faded two wide on the bend. APOLLO U
ANYWHERE displayed early speed between horses, began to yield on the turn, angled to the outside upper stretch and continued to give way. SIMPLY
FAST raced in the second flight from inside on the backstretch but faded before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
W W CANDY a bit slow at the break, was encouraged up from just off the inside, progressed along the rail on the turn, gained a clear path into the stretch,
took the lead inside the last furlong, was clear with a sixteenth left and kept KHOZAN'S VALENTINE at bay under steady handling. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE
prominent from inside, found himself blocked while boxed in into the bend, was taken in hand, altered out on the turn, was four wide leaving the bend, under
steady urging in the stretch, lacked the extra needed but moved clear for second the last seventy yards. MIZ BLUE bumped from the rear at the start, was
hustled to a clear lead and the inside early on, challenged on the turn, moved clear again leaving the bend, was engaged from inside upper stretch and
gradually wore down the last eighth. W W HOTSHOT broke outward, bumping MIZ BLUE, soon recovered to be a factor from outside, lost ground five wide
on the turn then flattened out for the drive. DIAMOND MAXIMUS saved ground taking the turn and failed to have a significant stretch bid. STALLONE was
hustled along to be a factor between rivals, stayed four wide through the bend, angled out widest upper stretch and steadily faded. NORTH SIDE prompted
the pace outside MIZ BLUE, went for the lead on the turn but gave way from between horses the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
SENORITA AURORA broke on top then was rated off the pace from between horses, angled out to progress four wide on the turn, was put to a drive upper
stretch, hand ridden the last eighth and edged ahead of HEART OF REASON in the waning yards. HEART OF REASON soon moved to a clear lead,
showed the way just off the inside, was put to a drive midstretch but did not have enough left. TOUCH BY FELICTY prominent just off the inside, rallied
belatedly as she angled out the final seventy yards. MIKE'S LADY well placed inside from the beginning, slowly yielded for the drive. TIME BREAK chased
from outside, lost ground four to six wide through the bend then could only make up minor ground the final furlong. TWO MORE TIMES chased running
widest and only passed tired ones deep stretch. BULU bumped with LILL QUEEN B at the start, was a brief contender between rivals but began to fade
three wide on the turn. ABBMAR hesitated at the start, quickly advanced from outside to help prompt the early pace, was three wide taking the turn then
flattened out for the stretch run. LILL QUEEN B bumped with BULU at the break, was hustled along but steadily yielded.
