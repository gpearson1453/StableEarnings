Footnotes
KIZZY broke readily, was urged clear racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, shook clear nearing upper stretch and
made the balance of the pace under pressure. TEA'S DREAM angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, saved ground to
upper stretch and proved best of the others. SUWANNEE CHICK, reserved in the last flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced inside foes
on the far turn, tipped out nearing upper stretch and continued between foes near the inside to gain position to the end while prevailing for a share. PINCH
MINE angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking behind the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and was outkicked for a share. ANAHIYA'S
DREAM tracked off the second flight between foes and continued evenly into the lane. UNMARKED MONEY settled outside foes in the last flight early,
swung out four wide entering the lane but had no rally. LADY MANHATTAN broke slowly, was settled between foes in the last flight and lacked a closing
response. DRILLS ECHO, urged in the three path pursuing the pacesetter to the backstretch, retreated early. KILKENNY BELLA angled inwards to track the
pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into the lane. DIALING VALENTINE, caught wide racing to the first turn,
dropped back early.

MAKIN IT LOOK EASY was rated tracking just off the first flight near the inside in the opening quarter, tipped out three wide entering the turn commencing a
steady advance, moved to terms with the pacesetter midstretch, exchanged some contact with that foe while striking the front, then dueled to the wire to
share the win. UNIFIED RIDE, prominent four wide in the opening stages, angled inwards while moving to wrest a clear advantage racing into the turn,
resisted the winner's bid when challenged midstretch exchanging light contact to the end and just held that rival on even terms at the wire. MISS ENCISO,
forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, tracked off the leaders inside a rival racing into the bend, tipped out racing into upper stretch and
prevailed for a share between foes on the wire. MOOR STRENGTH, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes in early stages, tracked off the first
flight outside rivals racing into the bend and had no closing bid. PAPA DIAMANTE, urged inside rivals prompting the pace to the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. MALIBU SKY, held up just after the start avoiding tight quarters, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ICY STORM was rated off the first flight racing to the turn, tipped three wide on the bend commencing a steady advance, took over racing into upper stretch
and drew away under pressure. NANTUCKETER settled last to the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and found his best stride late to prevail for the
place honors. BODIE CODY reared at the start losing position to the field, switched outside foes nearing the turn and continued with interest to improve
position three wide between foes into the lane. GOLD DUCAT, urged inside rivals pressing the pace from the outset, gave way racing into the turn.
HELLFIRE BOB, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace in the opening stages, pressed the pace outside a rival on the turn, couldn't match the
winner's bid and emptied out late. LUIS TWO GUNS, urged between foes disputing the pace in the opening stages, dueled for command along the inside on
the turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
ALABAMA SLAMMER was urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the first turn, continued to contest the issue inside that foe to upper stretch, then
kicked away in the closing stages to prove best under pressure. BOITANO angled inwards to lead the second flight between rivals from out of striking
distance to the far turn, angled to the four path racing three deep past midstretch and edged rivals for second on the wire. MUNQAD was rated stalking just
off the flight in the opening half, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final kick while
prevailing for a share. PIRATE PARADE was urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset to upper stretch but weakened in the closing stages.
PAPI BELLO tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail approaching the far turn, saved ground to upper
stretch but offered no rally. AZURE SKY angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight to the backstretch but faded after a half. COMMENCE
settled between foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. FEISTY KITTEN dropped out early.

Footnotes
INITFORTHELOVE was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing through the far turn while moving to challenge
the pacesetter, then edged forward through the stretch to prevail under firm handling. OUTRAGEOUS BET, reserved along the inside in the opening half,
steadily gained contention inside foes on the far turn, split foes, nearing the lane, then shifted three wide in the closing stages but continued willingly to close
the gap on the winner. MOTATAABEQ settled last racing to the far turn saving ground, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then angled to the
rail in the lane to edge rivals for a share late. FLY FLY AWAY was urged inside a rival dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, went clear nearing the
second bend, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn and gave way between foes into the stretch. JO JO KATZ was settled between
foes racing to the backstretch, made some brief progress between rivals racing into the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. AND WON settled outside
foes to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn, angled out five wide in the closing stages but made no real impact. WHERE'S
JORDAN tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide midway through the backstretch while being prompted to
advance but gave way racing through the far turn. HOLIDAY DANCER, urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
TONE ELISE, reserved inside rivals tracking the leaders from just out of striking position racing through the backstretch, steadily advanced along the rail
nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage entering the lane and went clear under firm handling. SEA ART forwardly placed tracking just outside the
pacesetter, was prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals four wide between foes racing into the turn, couldn't match the winner in the drive but
was clearly best of the others. ROSY APPLE sprinted to the lead in the opening stages racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch
but yielded to the top pair racing past the furlong marker. KILLARGUE'S GIRL settled last outside foes in the opening quarter, was prompted to make a five
wide run racing through the turn and lacked the needed closing bid. LADY WOOD tracked the pacesetter between foes and dropped out early. DAZZLING
SUNSHINE tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn, was urged to advance in that path on the bend, then was
taken up in the closing stages in some distress and was vanned off the course following the race.

CENTER STAGE, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace, pressed the issue in that path on the far turn then went clear into the stretch under firm
encouragement. CROSS FLEET pulling between foes in the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, steadied avoiding
some traffic racing into the far turn, then continued four deep to the lane but finished with interest to edge rivals for the place honors. PRETTYKEEN tracked
off the second flight between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the rail entering the backstretch, gained position inside foes nearing the far turn, tipped
out on the second bend awaiting an opening, then continued three deep between foes to late stages while just outkicked for second. AU CHOCOLAT was
rated three wide between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, then continued evenly three, then four wide into the lane while
gaining some position. BLOCK PARTY broke awkwardly, was reserved along the inside, switched outside foes leaving the far turn, was fanned five wide in
the stretch but continued to improve position. FROSTY SECRET was rated off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
racing into the far turn, steadied, then altered course approaching the three sixteenths marker and had no closing response. MAGIC LIGHT, urged disputing
the pace a bit off the rail on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes on the far turn into upper stretch and gave way.
LAUGHTER, caught three, then four wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, steadily faded racing into the far turn. MOON PARTY
stalked just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted with an early move to challenge inside the pacesetter after a half,
pressed the issue into the far turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. WHAT A CORKER settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to
menace thereafter. ALL BIZZ tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the backstretch and dropped back early. CHANGE PLANS bobbled racing past
the wire in the opening stages and retreated early.

past midstretch but proved only second best. MANUKA BOBBY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide
entering the stretch and continued with an effort to prevail for a share. THE EQUINEST was rated off the second flight between foes and continued evenly
three wide into the lane. MIDNIGHT TRICK, bumped soundly at the start, settled well off the leaders, angled inside on the turn, then tipped out in upper

Footnotes
MR. SARCASTIC, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three deep after a half, steadily drew on
terms with the pacesetter in that path midstretch and prevailed under firm handling. ESTILO VARONIL was urged dictating the pace on a narrow advantage
along the inside, turned back a rival racing into upper stretch but was collared late. LION CHARMER was urged prompting the pacesetter into the
backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the lane and weakened late. SEA TRIDENT raced between foes in second flight, angled to the inside
tracking just off the leaders racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance along the rail nearing upper stretch, was held up momentarily when caught in
tight quarters entering the lane and came up empty late. SKIPPY'S STRIKE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
switched outside foes racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. JOJO'S DREAM was rated along the inside in early stages but failed to
