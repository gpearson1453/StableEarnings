DIXIE RED sent clear was allowed to set an unhurried pace drawing off on the far turn being ridden out from there. RACK DADDY tracked evenly through
the far turn emerging off a loose leader in upper stretch finishing as clearly second best. FOR MY MOM well back early would save ground to upper stretch
besting a pair of very weary rivals there. DONA CAMILE stalked the early pace fading on the far turn. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) folded up after a half mile.

RUN KITTY broke well rallying to wrest the lead four deep outside the quarter pole, angled in to confront rail running foe in upper stretch dueling in the three
path there needing all to prevail. LA LIMA saved ground engaging from the rail in upper stretch matching strides from the eighth pole missing in a very game
effort. VEGAS SLIPPERS pressured on the turn then weakened in upper stretch mustering enough from the four path to hold off the others. SHE'S SO
SOUTHERN raced evenly along the inside to upper stretch giving steady response there in the two path needing more. MOTHER'S PRIDE brushed at the
break saved ground failing to reach contention. C C'S WORLD played no factor. ROCK OF CASHEL away alertly led on the turn then gave way in the two
path upper stretch. SAVING THE CITY breaking slowly was always outrun. VIMONT swerved out steadying at the break.
