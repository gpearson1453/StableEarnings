SCREEN STAR was well rated early along the inside, shifted out side leaving the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane, closed well to get up late under
a drive. DREAMING OF LOVE dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear by the furlong marker but proved to be not
enough, second best. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was bumped at the start, settled early and was three wide on the turn and offered a mild late rally to gain the
show award. AMERICAN CHESTNUT dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. AFLEET TRAXX was
reserved early and was on the inside on the turn and lacked a rally. STONE SCULPTOR passed the tiring rivals. GEM JUAN broke in at the start, settled
four wide and had no response. EYES OF ZEUS was no factor while wide.

and edged clear to prove best under a drive. SUPER REIGN was well rated early, eased out and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but hung late. MARC
WELLS was settled early, raced on the inside on the far turn and had no rally, bested rest. JOHNNY ICE was off slowly, then reserved early and raced two
to three wide on the far turn and was not a threat. TASTY'S BULLSEYE tracked the pace three wide and came five wide into the drive and tired.

best, driving. ZERTZ set a pressured pace on the inside, was headed by the quarter pole and fell back by the furlong marker and then came again to gain
the place award late. PRIME TIME PLAYER was reserved early, made a inside move leaving the turn and flattened out, missed place award. P JS SILVER
DUKE was allowed to settle early, angled out in the drive and improved late for minor rewards. DOLLARIZATION was settled back early, made a five wide
move on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn and then was empty. DAVIDIC LINE pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for

TAK E LADY tracked the two front runners early, made a three wide bid mid way on the turn, took over leaving the furlong marker and drew off to prove
much the best under mild urging. FUELED UP dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid on the turn to take over, then proved to be no match for
the winner in the final furlong while staying on to be clearly second best. MY LADY'S AUNT MA dueled for the early lead on the inside and fell back on the
turn, shifted out by the quarter pole and came four wide into the drive and weakened. ET'S PREMONITION showed no early speed, raced towards the
inside by the quarter poll and had no rally.
