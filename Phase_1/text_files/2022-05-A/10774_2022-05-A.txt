Footnotes
VALLEY VISTA chased the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, gained ground
outside, drifted in near the eighth pole and drew off to the wire. GET THEM DIGITS dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued
to battle between horses in upper stretch, gave way with a furlong to go and finished evenly, managing to hold second. B G ATTACK bumped with the
horses to either side and was forced back leaving the gate, settled off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, improved position while saving ground
around the turn, gained ground on the inside and was outkicked late. TOP DOG bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed well behind the
field up the backstretch and around the turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and gained ground late while drifting out. IRONMAN RICHIE hopped
up and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and tired in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
BIG IF TRUE set the pace inside, took light pressure from SATIATE early, edged to a clear yet measured lead from the five eighths, saved ground through
the far turn, began to clear further from the five sixteenths, drew off under a hand ride from upper stretch to midstretch and was wrapped up late. ON A
TOUR raced near the rear into the first turn, advanced and attempted to join the tracking flight around the first turn but took up on heels of another horse
near the seven eighths, dropped back toward the rear, continued near the rear down the back straight and in the four path on the far turn, began to take
closer order past the three eighths, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly for place but proved no match for the winner. PRESENT OF HERO tracked
the leading pair through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, chased along the rail around the far turn as other horses bid outside her, was driven
between horses in upper stretch, chased on but was ultimately outfinished for the place. DARING DAMSEL tracked the leading pair outside of PRESENT
OF HERO through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was pushed along into the far turn and improved position three wide, continued three
wide into the lane, and weakened between horses in the final furlong. HERO ALEXANDRA settled at the rear, began to take mildly closer order in the two
path past the three eighths, swung five wide into the lane under a drive, and lacked the needed rally. SATIATE lightly prompted the pace outside of BIG IF
TRUE to the five eighths, tracked in range two wide around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, proved no match for the leader and weakened
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
WINGING WAYS cleared quickly, led in the two path on the turn under a light hold, opened up when pushed along in upper stretch, felt the crop once
midstretch but otherwise continued to increase his advantage under a hand ride. PRESIDENT ELECT trailed early, began to rally when pushed along in the
two to three path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and ran on best of the rest under a drive while no match for the winner. AGAVE KID raced at the
inside of the tracking flight down the back straight, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, angled two wide near the three
sixteenths after DEVIL'S RULE angled inward in front of him, and kept on mildly between horses to secure the show. Z U SOON was urged between horses
early to track the pacesetter, settled back to the rear of the group near the nine sixteenths, lost position in the five to six path around the turn, drifted out in
upper stretch and passed tiring horses late. GOLDENPENCE tracked the leader four wide early, chased outside of AGAVE KID while racing in the four path
on the turn, was driven three wide in the lane and came up empty. DEVIL'S RULE tracked three wide between horses early, continued to track the leader
three wide on the turn, was driven between horses into the lane but proved no match for the leader, angled to the rail near the three sixteenths, and
weakened.

Footnotes
LET'S CRUISE saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, began to draw off while saving ground around the far turn and continued
to extend her lead down the lane, much the best. HOT DAME tracked the leader from the two path around the first turn, moved up to challenge on the
outside while racing up the backstretch, could not go with that rival around the far turn and chased her home, the best of the rest. SUMMER DAY raced in
the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, came around the far turn still in the two path and finished evenly
while never threatening the top two. ZANDREA'S hit the gate leaving it, fought her rider while saving ground around the first turn, settled off the pace for the
run up the backstretch, was asked for a bid around the far turn and had no response. EMBARRASSING raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed
the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AVASARALA attended the pace inside of FIRST SQUADRON down the backstretch, stalked that foe along the rail around the turn, bid inside of FIRST
SQUADRON approaching the quarter pole, took the lead at the head of the stretch, drove clear, drifted out but nonetheless drew off. SUNDAY SCHEMING
settled at the rear, was pushed along into the turn and began to gain along the inside, angled out near the five sixteenths, was driven four wide in upper
stretch, ran on willingly and proved second best. FIRST SQUADRON carried a narrow lead down the backstretch while racing outside of AVASARALA, set
the pace while positioned two wide on the turn, was engaged by AVASARALA to her inside approaching the quarter pole, lost the lead to that foe into the
lane, chased on two wide while no match, and could not hold off SUNDAY SCHEMING for place in the final sixteenth. KHOZYS CROWN tracked the
leading pair down the back straight and in the two path on the turn, was driven two wide behind the leading pair into the lane, could not keep pace with the
leaders, flattened out in the final furlong and drifted out late. PALM COURT tracked two wide down the backstretch, raced in the three path outside of
KHOZYS CROWN around the turn, came three wide into the lane, and proved empty. HER GOLD MINE settled at the rear of the main group down the back
straight, raced in the three to four path on the turn, was relegated to the rear from the five sixteenths, floated into the lane five wide, was driven in upper
stretch and offered no response.

CRANKSHAFT chased the leader in the early going, moved up to challenge headed into the turn, dueled from the two path from there, kicked clear in the
stretch and held off a late closer while drifting in mildly to the wire. RENEGADE BOB trailed the field on the far outside up the backstretch, began to improve
position while racing in the two path around the turn, swung to the outside entering the stretch and gained ground late. HIGH HERO raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground
mildly in the stretch. RED HOT DEVIL swerved out slightly leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. CHOPPER led the field in the opening stages, dueled while saving ground
around the turn and faded in the lane. POWER CRY raced inside at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path
around the turn, was held firmly in place by his rider to prevent him from running out wider and was empty from there.
