Footnotes
CRIMINAL RECORD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, opened a clear
margin in mid-stretch and drew off. MICHELLE WHO pressed the pace from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn, could not match strides with
the winner but finished willingly to hold the place. AUTISM PRISM pressed the pace from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive.
EARLYNTHEMORN was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PREDETERMINATION showed no early speed,
raced six-wide through the turn, was not a factor and was unsaddle on the back-stretch and vanned off. NAVARONES SPARKLE settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. INGLENOOK was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
TRINNI SUNSET lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
COMPLICATE sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by RAIL HUGGER nearing the three-eighths marker and held VINTAGE KITTEN safe
late. VINTAGE KITTEN showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was gaining on the winner late. RAIL
HUGGER chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker and lacked the needed late response. JACKS
OUTLAW was off slow, rushed up, chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gradually gave way. PAYNTER'S BOY was off a step slow, lacked early
foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and failed to menace.

MONTANA JACK raced four-wide through the first turn, was unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the second turn and was up in the closing yards.
ON ICE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take a brief lead with a sixteenth to run but could not resist the winner from over the top.
CROSS TOWN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way grudgingly through the final furlong. HIGH FLYIN TIGER
chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. LUCKY CHAMP settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and gradually weakened. LUCKY CHANCE lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
COASTAL KING sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority.
DUBRONSKY chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. MR FREEBIE was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. BENISSIMO settled off the leaders early, raced
off the rail through the turn and finished evenly late. MYBESTISYETTOCOME raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to
rally. WESTPHAL raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. DALE'S ADDICTION lacked early foot, raced six-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. D P TARGET showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. CHAMPESSA was off
slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. MONARCH WOODS raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, weakened and was unsaddled on the back-stretch and vanned off.

IF YOU WANT IT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore into the lane and quickly drew off.
SHES GOT THE POWER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. PIPER ROSE was void of
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, was bumped in mid-stretch and finished willingly when clear. LADY JADE raced off the leaders
early, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly. LEXOPHILIA settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn, raced
in tight quarters in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. LUCKY STEPPER pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
five-sixteenths marker, led and weakened in the drive. SUBTLE RIDE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. CONVINCE broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. GONE QUICK was away in good
order to vie for the lead from the inside and weakened after going a half.
