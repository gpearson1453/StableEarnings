ZEATRICAL stalked the pace in the two path just behind the leaders came three wide at the head of the lane to engage for the lead wore down the
frontrunners and steadily drew clear for an easy win. MISS EMMA JEAN showed good early speed but was three wide early then two wide into the turn and
was outfinished for the win. PI YO PRINCESS was forced three wide the entire trip and made a mild bid for third on the outside while no threat to the winner.
ALHAMBRA PALACE showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail by the turn but had little left for the stretch run. SIMPLE SUNDAY was off a
step slow to trail early was rushed through and saved the inside but quickly backed out going into the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MUSADA showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail into the first turn was challenged up the backstretch and entering the lane but found
enough to earn the victory. DAPPER DAN MAN chased the pace along the inside angled out entering the drive was getting closer midstretch but could
never mount a winning run. DISIDE was well off the pace in the early stages saved all the ground and made a run through the stretch along the inside but
could not catch the top pair. COUNTERFEIT was closest to the leader entering the second turn while in the two path but had little left and began a steady
fade. CHAMBLISS raced between foes midpack for the first three quarters but had no rally through the stretch. KITTENOFTHE COURT was caught five
wide into the first turn and was hung wide the entire race and could not make up any ground. CIROC O CLOCK was also forced wide into the first turn and
then hung wide the entire race while fading in the lane. STAR APPEARANCE raced in the two path but then gave way while racing wide in the second turn.
SHACKLE THE GOLD raced three wide into the first turn and then dropped back quickly up the backstretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE was quickest away from the gates and was able to gte to the rail took a clear lead into the stretch and held gamely in the final sixteenth.
THATSAFACTJACK was away slow then was hustled into contention along the inside on the turn was making a bid along the rail along the inside then
came out in mid stretch but could not go by the winner. A Stewards Inquiry and an objection by the trainer of Hug The Money against this one alleging
interference going into the turn was not allowed. HUG THE MUNNY was away in good order and close to the pace was checked when in tight quarters
going into the turn and dropped back and then re rallied along the inside in a solid effort. CITIZEN WEST raced in the three path on the turn came even wide
through the lane but could not make up ground. BIG BOBBY BROWN was well off the pace came wide through the lane to get a minor share of the purse
while passing tiring rivals. MCLEAN raced in the two path chasing the leader but faded on the turn and dropped back through the lane. DR. BOEHRER was
always well back and never mounted a rally.

Footnotes
ANGELA'S CELERITY was away a step slow came into contention four wide on the turn and then came wider through the lane to wear down the leaders
and won as much the best. DONTFORGETRDREAMS was between rivals in a three horse speed duel hung gamely between rivals but could not match
strides with the winner in the final eighth. MOODY RAFAELA was hustled to the front in a three horse speed duel along the inside to the top of the lane and
then gave way grudgingly in a good effort. RYDENSEEK raced three wide on the turn and lacked a winning rally. EYESEEMONEY raced three wide on the
turn and entering the stretch and lacked a winning rally. SAY WHAT raced along the inside in good position mid pack but faded in the stretch. CAJUN ACES
was always well back and was never a serious factor. SAVANNAH'S HERE was the outside horses in the three horse speed duel and gave way entering
the stretch.

CHAOSMOS was well back along the inside came out for the second turn and was six wide while entering the strtech to get into contention drifted in a bit
through the lane but edged clear for the win. SILENT TAP raced in the two path angled out for the drive took the lead in the stretch but could not fend off the
winner in the last eighth. VIM AND VIGOR had a good trip along the inside and when the leaders came off the rail had a clear shot but could not go with the
top two. HOLY EMPEROR was close to the pace in between foes and lacked a rally in the stretch. GUILTY LOVER raced along the inside off the pace and
lacked a winning move. PESO IN MY POCKET stalked the pace in the two path until the turn for home and then tired. INDY TOURIST was along the inisde
and in tight quarters early and never mounbted a rally. GIMME SOME MO was away in good order to get the lead and the rail held the advantage to the turn
