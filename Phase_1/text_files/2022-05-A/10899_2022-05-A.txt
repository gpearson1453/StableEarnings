Footnotes
MAKABIM raced three to four wide into the first turn, took over the lead near the half mile marker, widened to a clear advantage and held firm around the far
turn, saved ground into the upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and finished well clear. PROMISING SHOES was well placed stalking the embattled trio
midway up the backstretch, launched a bid for MAKABLM around the far turn, sustained steady response down the lane and finished clearly second best.
MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was unhurried through early stages, made a three wide move near the quarter pole, stayed on through the lane and secured a
share. BIG HEARTED FACTOR vied for the lead up the backstretch, flattened around the turn and offered no late bid. HUNK OF A HIT raced three to four
wide around the first turn, rated off the second flight up the backstretch, urged two wide around the final turn and had no response. GOTTA LOVE IKE held
a slim lead in opening stages, dueled up the backstretch and tired around the final turn. PLUMBAGO settled through early stages, saved ground around the
final turn and failed to threaten.

JOE G'S PAYBACK sped to the lead at the start, shook off the bid from TIMS MAXIMILLIAN midway around the turn, opened up to a commanding lead and
kept to task under steady urging. STERN tracked the pace in early stages, raced two wide between foes around the turn, launched a three wide bid at the
furlong marker and gained second best. FRUGAL BETTY raced up close along the rail then got in tight and steadied sharply near the half mile marker,
weakened, saved ground around the turn, launched a rail bid int9o the upper stretch and stayed on for a share. BLUEBIRD DAY tracked the pace three
wide into the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. TOMS MAXIMILLIAN was forwardly placed in opening stages, roused forward
to challenge the eventual winner entering the turn, could not reach rival and weakened in the lane.

RAINBOW SUREBET sped to the lead at the start, held a slim lead around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, held off the bid from MISS
PEACH a furlong out and kept clear. MISS PEACH was off slow at the start and trailed in the back, circled into contention late on the turn, sustained
response in the stretch and finished second best. GARBO SPEAKS was forwardly placed along the inside in early stages, lacked a clear path along the rail
around the turn, tipped two wide in the upper stretch and prevailed for a share. AMERICAN SUE chased in close contention around the turn, came two to
three wide into the upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. JUST LIKE TRISTA raced three wide in close contention around the turn then flattened in
the lane. LET'S GO LACEY raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide around the turn, shifted five wide in the upper stretch and failed to rally.
CAN'T MAKE ME raced up close four wide around the turn then tired in the drive.

pole and responded evenly. SCRUTINIZER raced near midpack, chased two wide around the turn and ran on evenly. MINECRAFT MANIAC raced off the
