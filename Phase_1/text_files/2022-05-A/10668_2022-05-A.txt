Footnotes
QUIET FOREST quickly assumed command on the backstretch, led along the inside taking outside pressure on the turn, kicked away from rivals mid stretch
and edged away under urging. THINK OF ANITA off slow, showed good speed to vie for lead three wide, went into turn two wide, continued two wide on the
turn, in range at top of the stretch, lost second mid stretch, responded to urging to earn second back at the wire. BALLROOM HUSTLER chased duo along
the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, made progress heading into stretch and launched bid along the inside, had second late
and rival came back to pass him late. ADMIRAL AESCHBACH came in at the start, stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the
inside throughout and failed to rally when asked in the lane. NISHICO hopped and came away slow, trailed throughout, showed mild late run passing tired
rival late. WILLIS vied for lead two wide on the backstretch, entering the turn had to steady when outside rival came in, regathered momentum to stay in
contact with leaders on the turn, weakened under urging in the stretch. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT BLAZE away well, quick into stride, drifted in a path early, and finished strong under a drive. REQUIRED FIRST away well, drifted in early,
maintained a straight path thereafter in a solid debut under hand urging. HENRY D broke in a path at the start, did not level immediately, may have been
bothered by rail, once leveled ran on well in a solid try. ONE COOL DUDE broke in and bumped rival at the start, leveled and finished up one paced along
the outside. DON LAZARO step slow but had a clean path, rival started drifting out and rider attempted to ease out approaching the eighth pole, DON
LAZARO lugged out four lanes instead, finished evenly under a hand ride. ONE SIGNIFICANT HERO off a half length slow, bumped by outside rival at the
start, leveled approaching the gap and failed to rally under urging. EL MYSTERIOUS FIRE away well, had a wide path, weakened badly in the final
sixteenth.
