Footnotes
SAFALOW'S MISSION bobbled at the start, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, angled out with five-sixteenths
to go off the inside to be three wide nudging DEVIL BOY to the four path, swung five wide lightly leaning on that rival into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong out, edged away to the finish kept to task. FORTUNE'S NEPHEW established the front shortly after the start and showed the way
narrowly under pressure from N Y ANTHEM to the outside, shook off that rival nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide for home, dug in under threat
and was collared a furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors. OCEAN'S RESERVE broke in at the start bumping DEVIL BOY in tandem with N Y
ANTHEM, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. OUR SON JAKE stumbled at the start, recovered to cross to the two path early on, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DEVIL BOY got bumped
between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased five to six wide down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn, got nudged
back four wide when SAFALOW'S MISSION tipped out at the five-sixteenths, then got leaned and nudged six wide into upper stretch before tiring in the
drive. N Y ANTHEM broke out at the start bumping DEVIL BOY in tandem with OCEAN'S RESERVE, pressed the pace four to five wide early on before
tucking to the two path through the turn, faded near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the stretch. EMINENCY
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and never got involved.

BELLA SOFIA pressed the pace of MISS BRAZIL from the outside four paths off the inside and then from the two path through the turn, took over narrow
command at the five-sixteenths and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and dueled through the length of the stretch to the finish and
gamely got the nod on the wire. FRANK'S ROCKETTE broke out a step at the start bumping KEPT WAITING, chased three then two wide patiently handled
until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch advancing to get on near even terms with the top one straightened away, dueled through the
length of the stretch fighting gamely head to head but ultimately got bested at the end by the bob of the nose. ASSERTIVE STYLE chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, improved position to secure the show honors. KEPT WAITING bumped at the start by
FRANK'S ROCKETTE, who broke outwards, came under coaxing and chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through
the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MISS BRAZIL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the
backstretch and then along the inside through the turn under pressure from BELLA SOFIA to the outside, yielded the front at the five-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
HAPPY HILL LIL settled into the two path during the run down the backstretch, sat on hold within striking distance making her way around the turn, angled
into the four path for a clear path stepping onto the head of the stretch, responded when asked, was one of a threesome fighting on near terms with each
other for the top at the start of the last eighth, went at it in a spirited tussle with the runner from the sixteenth pole onward and gamely proved best.
THISMIGHTBETHEONE kept watch on the leader while being rated along in the pocket, inched her way to the outside after completing the half, bided time
before splitting foes nearing the furlong marker, grabbed a narrow advantage soon afterwards, got engaged with the winner, and although displaying
willingness to the end, had to to ultimately settle for the place. U SHOULD B DANCING took up position in midpack, underwent a three wide journey on the
turn, was about as wide in the lane rallying for the show. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS patiently ridden stalking the pace from path two for nearly a half, was
put to a drive challenging in upper stretch, loomed boldly finishing in midlane, weakened. MANDY GREEN off the inside throughout, chased the pace three
wide on the bend, fanned out into path five early in the drive, lacked a solid closing bid. STELLA MARS two wide onto the turn, got sent out six wide leaving
it, becoming the widest of all, got taken in hand in deep stretch while appearing to lack a winning bid. MISS DELICIOUS sighted on the rail on the turn,
tipped into path four at the top of the lane, came up empty. MISSING LINK keen on the front end from the inside route for the initial half, caved in when
challenged at the furlong grounds then backed away in a steadfast manner.

Footnotes
LISTENTOYOURHEART away forwardly placed, took up residence in the pocket, was patiently handled keeping watch on the leader, a bit too far back to
make its presence felt, disdained a tight seam along the inside route and instead got guided to the outside coming up to the quarter pole, settled into the two
path before challenging in earnest a sixteenth down the road, emerged as the new leader at the beginning of the last eighth, stayed on well to stave off the
second place finisher. MASKED MARAUDER settled into midpack after the field had been sent off and running, darted over to the rail a short distance from
the half mile pole, sat reserved during the run around the bend, was gradually maneuvered to the outside during the first half of the stretch run, appearing to
possess good momentum, maintained it en route for the place. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS secured a spot on the rail shortly after the start, rode it nearly all
the way to the quarter pole, was moved into the three path in two stages from upper to midlane, showed some energy thereafter securing the show. BREW
PUB off the inside throughout, was primarily two wide in pursuit of the front runners, wandered out to be six to seven wide being fed some left side stick
work, having never made his presence felt. GANDY DANCING forwardly placed three wide, lacked the necessary stretch response. JEMOGRAPHY slipped
towards path three racing down the backstretch, was one path farther off the rail for the stretch run, weakened. SEVEN LILIES towards the rear, entering
the turn from path three, got called upon for the drive, made its way seven to eight wide on empty. BRONX BOMBER retained the advantage after narrowly
breaking the quickest, sat along the inner rim on the two path showing the way on a loosely-contested lead, was closer to the rail when tested by the winner
in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, succumbed.

HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) attended the leader to the outside in the two path, came under coaxing three furlongs from home and advanced to take over
command swinging four wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive through to the eighth pole then repelled a pair to the finish kept busy to the end.
GUFO tracked the pace along the inside until tipped to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, angled
out seven wide into upper stretch and ran on willingly through to the finish but was ultimately repelled by the top one. YIBIR (GB) hesitated at the break and
struck the right side of the gate at the start getting away last and conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, saved ground at the tail
of the field, tipped two then three wide with nine-sixteenths to go before advancing four wide through the far turn coming under light coaxing three furlongs
from home, angled out eight to nine wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in and secure the show honors, clear of the rest. EASTER
(FR) tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the
final furlong. ABAAN established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths when facing
pressure for the initial time, yielded the front and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into
the start focusing on YIBIR before the result was declared official.

Footnotes
ROUGIR (FR) tracked the front two to three wide from near the rear of the field, went three then four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. OUR FLASH
DRIVE raced three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and advanced to take command
nearing the eighth pole, got displaced from the front inside that station and ran on to just best a rival for the place honors. HIGH OPINION just off the inside
in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to the finish
getting just bested at the end for the place honors. LEMISTA (IRE) saved ground near the rear of the field, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch
and kept on to the finish. RUNAWAY RUMOUR two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. STOLEN HOLIDAY just off the pace tracking along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. PLUM ALI coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and weakened. Due to a teletimer procedural error all splits
and the final time were incorrect. The final time provided was hand timed.
