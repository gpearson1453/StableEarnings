Footnotes
KOLSCH was bounced around between horses at the start, chased the pace, rallied two wide to make the lead midway on the turn, set the balance of the
pace and proved best under left handed urging. ON HIS TOES chased the pace three wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead before the quarter
pole, drifted out to the six path giving up ground to the winner then came on again late under right handed urging. ANGEL'S ENTRY broke inward bumping
rivals and closed a gap late in the seven path. FAST CALL offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. NATURAL CHARM passed
tiring rivals. BIKO was bumped at the start then no factor. OSBIN broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace to mid turn then stopped.
