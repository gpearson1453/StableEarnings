Footnotes
ALL EARS showed the best early speed to get to the rail by the first turn opened a good lead took a breather into the far turn and opened up again and was
all out in the final stages in a game effort. SUMMER TSUNAMI broke well and then settled just off the pace made a two wide bid up the backstretch dropped
back just a bit on the second turn was slowly gaining through the stretch but could never go by the winner. STORMY SERMON raced along the rail in the
back of the pack for the first half made a two path move on the turn to get up for third while drifting out in the stretch but was never a match for the top two.
VALIANT MINI STAR was towards the back of the pack made a two wide bid up the backstretch to get into contention but could not sustain the bid and
flattened out at the top of the stretch and was caught for third. IT'S ALL A BLUR did not handle the first turn well and tried to come out into the turn was mid
pack for much of the race and never mounted a rally while three wide. TIZ MY PLAN was caught four wide into the first turn and was never able to get to the
inside and raced three to four wide throughout and had no response in the stretch. DOVE WITH A CAUSE raced along the inside mid pack and never
mounted a rally.

D TWO showed the best early speed but was off the rail in the two path going into the turn shook clear turning for home and then opened a good margin
and was never seriously challenged through the stretch. BAJAN CASH was well off the pace while wide made a nicer mid race move on the outside while
four wide but could only chase the winner home. DREAM HALO raced in the two path off the pace and lacked the needed rally. ROCKDALE was bumped at
the break and then forced to race in tight quarters for much of the run up the backstretch came out for the drive and was finishing with interest. RECKLESS
RANSOM raced in the two path while mid pack and had no rally. THE GRAY BLUR made a big mid race move along the inside going into the turn to get in
perfect position but had little left after that move and faded through the turn and stretch.

Footnotes
MR. FOUR SEVENS stalked the pace in the two path took the lead on the far turn and opened a good advantage was all out in the drive and held on in a
game effort. RUN ROCKET was well back along the inside began his move into the far turn angled out for the drive and made a run at the leader was
inching closer in the final strides but ran out of ground. SOURNOIS raced in mid pack in the two path came out for the drive and was up for third through the
stretch. SYDSTER showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail midway on the first turn took the field into the turn for home and then weakened.
FAST VERDICT was away in good order showed some early speed along the inside but never mounted a rally. CALLINGINTHENIGHT was off very slow
spotting the field four lengths raced wide throughout and was never a serious factor. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE raced three wide for much of the race and
dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
E R'S MIREYA broke like a shot and had several lengths on the field early while off the rail was in the two path on the turn and faded through the stretch. A.
P. STYLE came through along the inside going into the turn to get into contention but could not go with the top two through the stretch. SWEET
JACKIELEIGH was up close in the two path for the first half and then began a steady fade. SPORT PALACE was well back in the early stages while off the
rail came wide into the turn and then wider into the stretch and finished well for second. REBEL VISION was away slow spotting the field four or five lengths
raced wide and was very wide in the stretch before coming in sharply in the late stages. LILLIE AND NAN stalked the pace while four wide made a bid on
the turn and went right by the leaders and drew clear to win as the rider pleased. HEART OF INDEE was well back while wide made a mild bid through the
lane but was never a factor for a major share.

Footnotes
SPACE MOUNTAIN got the perfect inside trip early was allowed to settle in the back along the inside saved all the ground to the far turn went three wide
then swung to the inside to come through on the rail in the stretch and edged clear for the win. LOVETHATCAUSE was quickest early and the lead and the
rail on the first turn took that lead on the inside into the stretch came out just a bit in the lane allowing the winner to come through and was caught in deep
stretch while second best. SIERRA HOTEL raced three to four wide while off the pace though the first three-quarters came wide in the lane and did not find
his best stride until mid stretch and could only pick up a minor share. HAWKWOOD stalked the pace in the two path into the far turn but could not make up
ground. SUPER HANDY MAN raced in the two path while mid pack for much of the race and never mounted a serious rally. ONE KING CAT was up close
to the pace along the inside but faded as the field went into the far turn.

RAMAAH raced along the inside throughout and had a perfect trip into the stretch came through a narrow hole in mid stretch and then was forced to steady
when TROPHY DADDY came in near the sixteenth pole regained stride and was up for the win. After a Stewards Inquiry, there was no change in the order
of finish. OUTERBANKS was well, off the pace early made a sweeping four wide move to get into contention battled for the lead on the outside while drifting
in and had to settle for second. TROPHY DADDY showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail into the turn took a clear lead in the stretch but
veered and steadied near the sixteenth pole as RAMAAH was coming through regathered quickly but could not hold second. SUPER WISE raced along the
inside swung wide for the stretch run to get into contention but could not make up the needed ground. WICKED ALEX was away quickly and up close in the
early stages but faded into the turn. DOCTRINAIRE was up close chasing in the two path to the top of the stretch and then gave way. DATSWHATILIKE
was in the back of the pack in the two path and faded through the stretch.
