Footnotes
HELLO AMIGO came away a bit awkwardly, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, closed to the lead two deep midway on the far turn and
was steadily handled to draw off in the lane. NIGHT BOSS rated close off the rail on the first turn, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead
toward the three eighths, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in through the stretch to hold second. MORE PLEASE rounded the first turn
about the six path, left the turn outside and bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but drifted outward leaving the turn
and flattened stride widest. GABBYS BIG NOTION broke awkwardly then angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure at the seven
sixteenths pole, was caught toward the three eighths and gave way. DIVINAS CONNECTION settled back saving ground on the opening turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. CALL JOHN bore outward on the opening turn then faded from the half mile pole.

Footnotes
C R'S MANDATE raced with the early pace two deep, took the nod into the backstretch and dug in to the challenge of Twilight Years from the three eighths
pole, drew away at the rail on the far turn and dug in under determined stretch handling to hold on. MY BOY CLYDE settled off the rail on the first turn,
started a bid leaving the half mile pole, came through the far turn off the rail and finished well with a solid late threat. TWILIGHT YEARS raced with the early
pace inside then stalked leaving the first turn, challenged at the three eighths pole, though gave way into the far turn. WITH SECRET ENERGY stumbled at
the break, saved ground on the first turn and showed little effort. SETTLEMENT DATE stumbled leaving the gate, ran in the four path of the first turn, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole but checked behind a narrowing opening at the rail off the inside flank of Twilight Years past the quarter pole, and
weakened. The three quarter fraction in this race was hand timed.

JERUSALEMA rated close inside on the opening turn, came through the second turn about the three path and bid toward the three eighths pole, took the
lead at the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. MADY ROSE became fractious in the gate and raced in
the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, improved on the far turn in the three path, took second in the upper stretch
and finished evenly. HOLLY'S PERSUASION broke outward and rounded the first turn about the five path and raced well back from the seven eighths pole,
bid past the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and passed rivals to take third later yards. TRUMPET LILLY angled to the inside
and rated the pace, came under pressure at the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the quarter, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the stretch.
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS rated close toward the inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the
lane. UNCAPTURED RUBY raced off the early pace about the four path then saved ground on the second turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. MI CLEOPATRA AND I rated close to the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
past the five sixteenths. DIXIE SUNRISE mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
TOOLEGITTOQUIT settled off the pace through the opening turn, started a bid into the backstretch, closed to the lead in the three path past the quarter pole
and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS, who settled off the pace in the two and three paths on the opening turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and came between horses midway on the far turn, steadied at the rail nearing the eighth pole but quickly recovered stride and
dug in gamely to the finish. TAPPING SOUTH raced well off the early pace about the five path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn in the five path, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just missed second while gaining on the top two. I B NASTY settled well
off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path, drifted to the outside
into the stretch and finished evenly widest. NAJWA rated close inside the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, took a slim brief lead toward
the five sixteenths but was caught at the rail past the quarter and weakened in the stretch. C V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground racing well off the pace, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail. GRAM'S GAL was hustled for the early lead while tapering to the inside, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the lead toward the five sixteenths and faded readily at the rail. UNDENIABLE TOUCH rounded the
opening turn in the five path then faded through the backstretch. AWESOME INCENTIVE rounded the first turn in the six path, left the turn outside and was
not asked. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Toolegittoquit, lodged by the rider of Howsafearemycolors, for alleged interference
nearing the eighth pole, though found no infraction. In addition, this race was hand timed.
