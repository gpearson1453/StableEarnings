Footnotes
ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN lacked speed, circled horses on the turn, floated very wide in upper stretch, closed outside horses as his rider adjusted his right iron
and drove clear. LAW OF THE LAND , bumped and caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, worked between horses
in mid stretch, angled in and closed along the rail. PATRIARCH ARTIE bumped LAW OF THE LAND when bearing out at the break, prompted the pace
three wide on the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch then weakened. H R H JELLYBEAN between horses in upper stretch, steadied on a rival's heels
when drifting out near the sixteenth pole. ALWAYS MISBEHAVING , well placed outside horses turning for home, had aim on the lead in mid stretch then
gave way. GOLDEN AVIEATOR set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way. STRANGE ARRANGE , well off the rail chasing the pace,
weakened. GALLANT GEORGE was no factor. THRUSTER trailed.

Footnotes
R TENDERONI stumbled badly at the break, regrouped and settled early, was taken three wide for the backstretch run, picked up the pace when roused
leaving the far turn, made a bold three wide run to take over soon into the lane, drifted in briefly while clearing, straightened away and opened up under a
drive nearing the sixteenth marker then held sway while taken in hand for the final yards. LIGHTFOOT MISS , off the pace while saving ground, swung four
wide into the lane, drifted in advancing past mid stretch, switched over to her correct lead then finished up with good energy. CAIRO QUEEN cleared early
and set a rated pace towards the rail, failed to resist the winner's charge near the three sixteenths and weakened. GOT A GOOD REASON broke a step
slow, raced two to three wide and lacked a bid. GOLDEN ACCOUNT rated off the leader and dropped in towards the rail to stalk, stayed inside into the far
turn, eased out with pursuit into the lane and gave way through the final furlong.

NOW brushed with BLO MY BUDGET at the start, stalked the pace to the stretch, raced in the two path and flattened out. TATE , along the inner rail
throughout, lacked the necessary response. ONE TEN , rank mid way on the first turn, circled the far turn three wide and came up empty in the stretch. BLO

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER came out a bit at the break and made contact with the gate causing his rider to briefly lose balance, recovered and edged up off the inside
into the first turn, settled in a good spot back off of the embattled leaders soon into the backstretch, edged closer three wide past the five sixteenths while
hemming in ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ), shifted out a bit wider and moved to strike soon into the lane, spurted clear under a solid drive in mid stretch then
maintained a safe advantage while kept alert. MY MAN POTS N PANS settled in the clear near the five eighths, angled out four wide to advance into the
lane, ranged up to chase in mid stretch, kept on willingly and saved the place. UP AGAINST IT , taken to rate while saving ground past the three quarter
pole, angled out into the far turn, advanced five wide into the stretch, straightened and churned on. TOE CURLIN' KISS lagged off the pace three wide,
angled wider in the drive and had belated action. STRIKING A POSE , off the pace while saving some ground, was under pressure around the final turn,
angled out in upper stretch but lacked a strong finish. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) tracked the dueling leaders, eased out around the final turn, was briefly
hemmed in near the quarter pole but came up empty in the final furlong. IRISHMAN settled in last, saved ground past the five eighths, swung well wide for
the drive but lacked a serious finish. KNOWHOWIKNOW got engaged in a pace battle to the inside of HE'S A SHOOTER soon after the break, carried that
scrum to the head of the lane then gave way. HE'S A SHOOTER dueled two wide outside KNOWHOWIKNOW, stayed on to upper stretch then weakened.
TANKERVILLE saved ground, raced in range to the three eighths then dropped back.

JIMMY THE KID bore out leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was under urging in the stretch and was well clear at
the end. DESHACKLED , three deep around the turn, chased the winner in a willing effort. SWEET ASTA swung to the five path turning for home, drifted out
in upper stretch and rallied. LOADED SNIPER prompted the winner around the turn and weakened in the drive. PANNA MINE , shuffled back leaving the
starting gate, circled the turn four wide, drifted in near the eighth pole and was not a factor. LIFESPAN raced in the three path between horses on the turn,
failed to menace and was steadied in traffic near the eighth pole. FRANCIS X. , briefly steadied when shuffled back at the start, raced along the inner rail on
the turn and was no factor. DIALING DIXIE chased the pace and gave way.

ROYAL WHISPER rated behind a three ply pace scrum, eased out nearing the turn, cruised up four wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths, struck the
top soon into the lane, kicked away under a solid drive in mid stretch then continued to eagerly widen while kept to task. HAPPY TAPPY SUE broke slowly,
regrouped and settled off the pace while saving ground, angled four wide approaching the stretch, straightened and finished up with good energy to be
second best. LADRO DI FICHI vied inside a pair of rivals through the opening three eighths, held off the winner past the five sixteenths to the quarter pole,
failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and gave way. PRAY FOR THE U S A , with the pace three deep, stayed on to the head of the stretch and tired.
TWENTYFORKARATROSE hopped at the break, dueled between foes, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths then retreated.

Footnotes
CALL ME PLUCKY , three deep under patient handling around the first turn, raced in the three path between horses the far turn, closed outside the leader
and was up late. COSMICALITY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. NICKY BEAR , along the inner rail down
the backstretch, eased off the rail on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. LACCO AMENO lacked speed, raced
between horses in the stretch and was steadied late when caught in close quarters. ROYAL NUMBER lacked speed, moved up four deep leaving the far
turn, was well positioned in upper stretch and weakened. MINT GAME , in the two path around the turn, raced between horses in the stretch, had a mild
advance to mid stretch but failed to sustain the move. ACE NINE NINE chased the pace and weakened. GOLDIE'S BOY raced in the two path on the far
turn and gave way. MUST BE LOVE faltered.

Footnotes
BOSS MAN J J , bumped at the break, was hard sent between rivals soon after and went clear after a furlong, secured the inside while setting the pace,
was shoved along to maintain position past the quarter pole, opened up under strong handling in mid stretch then held sway while kept alert. FORTH
chased the leaders two wide, angled five wide into the lane and closed steadily to gain. MUGSY MALONE prompted the pace two to three wide, was under
pressure pursuing into the lane and came up empty. HOWARD'S ROCK dropped off the early pace while saving ground, stayed inside for the drive, moved
up some past the sixteenth marker and kept on with interest. GOLDEN GULLEY , three wide, had a mild response. WINSTON'S GOLD , off the pace while
saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, came four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. ON THE ENGINE stumbled inward at the break and bumped
with the winner, raced off the pace while three wide and lacked a recovery.
