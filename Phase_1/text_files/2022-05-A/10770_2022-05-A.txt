Footnotes
VICTORY BUILT showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the lead to the runner-up outside
the five-sixteenths, fought back into upper stretch, dueled on the inside of the runner-up while rubbing saddles, regained the advantage before the
eighth-pole, continued a dogged fight head to head to the wire and gamely prevailed by a nostril. QUICKFLASH pressed the pace on the outside, drew even
in the four path early on the turn, took a short lead while still in the four path outside the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, dueled
outside of the winner while rubbing saddles, lost the advantage before the furlong marker, battled gamely outside the winner to the wire and was denied
while clear for the place. CAJUN COMMANDER was well placed just off the pace, chased inside around the turn, moved to the two path inside the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch, bumped with CENTAVO while inside that foe under a left-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, brushed with
that rival in the final furlong and earned the show while unable to threaten the top two. CENTAVO broke out and bumped hard with a rival, was taken back
early then moved out, raced off the pace while ridden along, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, bumped with CAJUN
COMMANDER outside the eighth-pole, brushed with that opponent in the final furlong and missed the show. MR. BUCKLEY was bumped hard at the start
then checked between foes and dropped back, spotted the front several lengths, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground around the turn and was no
factor.

Footnotes
ELEGANT LAOBAN hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, dug in under growing threat to the outside and came outwards under a left handed crop a furlong out herding ROZ a lone path before being
corrected, dug in on near even terms inside that station, came out once more under a left handed crop near the sixteenth marker and herded her main
danger three paths while never making contact and was corrected again, then repelled the challenge to inch away in the late stages to the wire. ROZ three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the aforementioned foe near the eighth pole
and got herded out a path at that station, got on near even terms for command and was herded three paths near the sixteenth pole, then got rebuffed in the
late going while well clear of the rest for the place honors. DANCE FOR BOURBON chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. KEEN DANCER coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. EMERALD BANKER hustled from the start, chased along the
inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. KAY TEE GAL coaxed from the start, chased five
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and tired. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of ROZ
alleging interference against ELEGANT LAOBAN in the stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the
race being declared official.

Footnotes
ROYAL TRYST settled under some urging, came under stronger encouragement late on the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, was put to the
crop at the three-eighths, gained into the stretch then took the lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady
urging. SIX PERCENT was last to commence, settled at the rear, was urged three then four wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch and got up for the
place while no match for the winner. O'TROUBLE stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two path around the turn,
gained the advantage passing the three-eighths, inched clear late on the bend, lost the lead to the winner under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out into the
final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. AIR SHOW bumped with a rival at the start, settled under some urging, raced inside early on the turn
then moved to the two path, held a good striking position into upper stretch, steadied when O'TROUBLE came out in front at the furlong marker, altered to
the outside before the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. FOREVER WICKED was urged along on the outside, went five wide around the turn
and was no factor. PURPLE HEARTED bumped with a rival at the start, was hustled to the front then showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on
the turn, lost the lead under urging at the three-eighths and stopped then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

VALLELUJAH veered in at the start bumping OAK LOVES A FIGHT into BOSS OF ALL and in turn CAPITAKL GAL, then got taken in hand briefly when
corrected, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, took over command at the
three-sixteenths, dug in under threat to the inside and gamely staved off that rival to prevail at the end. CAPITAL GAL got bumped askew at the start in a
chain of bumping begun by the aforementioned foe veering inwards, raced five paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader before tucking three wide
through the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over brief and narrow command straightened away into
upper stretch, got headed at the three-sixteenths and battled on inside to the wire but was ultimately repelled. WINE GODDESS six to seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, strode greenly two to three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
tipped out two to three paths inside the three-sixteenths and kicked on belatedly with interest to secure the show honors. BOSS OF ALL got bumped
between foes at the start, chased four paths off the inside early on and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MO NIGHEAN DONN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the four path
before tucking to the two path thro0ugh the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole under threat from a pair to the outside, yielded the front
straightened away into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. OAK LOVES A FIGHT got bumped solidly between foes at the start when
VALLELUJAH veered inwards and in turn bumped BOSS OF ALL into CAPITAL GAL, crossed to chase three wide down the backstretch before tucking
inside through the turn, got patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch and came up empty. SECRET HIDEOUT chased just off the
inside until tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
LORD GATLING went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, bumped with the runner-up inside the
three-sixteenths, dueled with that foe while jostling some in the final fulong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. FLOKI'S FLIGHT tracked the pace on
the outside, was given his cue in the four path around the turn, gained to make a bid in the three path coming to the quarter-pole, bumped with the winner
inside the three-sixteenths, dueled outside that foe while jostling some in the final furlong and missed but was well clear for the place. NORTH POLE chased
the pace down the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole and weakened while best of the rest.
DESERT LION settled on the outside at the rear, was urged four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, continued on his inside lead in the
drive and failed to threaten. VINNY TWO CENTS pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path around the turn, dropped back under urging
with five-sixteenths to run and tired. SMART JOKER settled just off the pace, dropped back two then three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch and retreated. TURTLENECK TED bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, angled in towards the rear of the field, saved ground under
urging around the turn and failed to respond. KID CASH suffered an injury inside the three-quarter pole and was pulled up then vanned off.

SECRET LOVE was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside around the turn, was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, made a bid between horses in the
two path approaching the quarter-pole then spun three wide into the stretch, took over near the three-sixteenths, shook clear under a right-handed crop into
the final furlong and proved best while placed under a hand-ride in the final sixteenth. EQUAL PAY set the pace under pressure to her outside while off the
rail, vied near the inside around the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the winner before the three-sixteenths and
was outfinished but clearly held the place. VIENNA CODE settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. HONEY MONEY was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three
path around the turn, dropped back four wide into upper stretch and tired. FROSTY BREW was taken in hand early then was reserved at the rear, came
under urging in the two path late on the turn and failed to threaten. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS was taken in hand early then settled at the rear on the
outside, went four wide under urging around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
SEARCH RESULTS coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of LADY ROCKET to the outside while three wide, remained patiently handled and swung
four to five wide into upper stretch getting on near even terms, took over the front straightened away and was roused with three-sixteenths to go coming
inwards while safely clear and edged clear under a drive to prevail. ROYAL FLAG brushed the off side stall at the start getting away last, chased two then
three wide from the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the
place honors inside the final sixteenth. LADY ROCKET broke out a step at the start under coaxing and established the front to show the way in hand just off
the inside under some pressure from SEARCH RESULTS to the outside through swift splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun two to
three wide for home, yielded the front straightened away into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along well clear for the show honors.
BANK STING was a bit reluctant to load the initial time in, then grew a bit fractious and was backed out of the gate, grew hard to load the second time
around before eventually being coaxed back into the stall, got away near the rear of the field and chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MAKE MISCHIEF four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing two
to three wide at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. ZAAJEL five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch, tired, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
AMOUNT settled off the pace, was asked while three then four wide around the turn, made a five wide bid into the stretch then took the lead at the
three-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. LUNI SIMA settled nicely off the pace, moved
from the rail to the two path around the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide while gaining coming to the quarter-pole then took a brief
lead, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths, fought with that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place.
FULL MOON FEVER brushed with a rival at the start, moved out towards the rear of the field, started the turn in the three path, shifted five wide at the
three-eighths, gained six wide into the stretch, held a good striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show. SON OF AN EX
raced well back in the field, went two to three wide around the turn, moved out in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten.
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged four wide early on the turn then moved to six wide, came seven
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. NICHOLAS JAMES broke very fast then quickly sped clear while dropping in, raced inside to the two path around the
turn, lost the lead while shortening stride at the quarter-pole and tired. MISTER WINSTON bumped with an opponent at the start, followed the leader from
second, ranged up three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. BRACIOLE was bumped on both sides at the start then taken
up between foes, raced towards the rear of the field, dropped from the three path to the rail early on the turn and was no factor. ONCE A GIANT brushed
with a foe at the start, moved out at the rear of the field, was urged four wide around the turn and showed little. HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED
DUE TO SOMETHING TRIPPING THE SENSOR EARLY
