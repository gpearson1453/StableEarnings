Footnotes
RANDELLO chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, gained a short lead into the lane, cleared outside the
eighth pole then was kept under pressure to maintain the diminishing advantage. GEMO RAIN vied for the lead from the two path, continued on the lead into
the far turn, dueled with the winner through mid-turn and into the lane, could not keep up with the winner when straightening into the lane, angled off the rail
and was gaining to the wire. ROMPED broke to the outside, brushed the gate and was steadied while throwing his head, raced along the inside into the lane
and gained the show spot while not a serious threat. HARD NIGHT was in the four path through the turns, asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
continued into the five path when straightening in the lane and lacked a closing bid. PRINCE OF MAYHEM pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch
and was done into the far turn.

CHANDANA vied for the lead from the three path through the turn, shook clear into the lane then drew off through the final eighth while finishing in
mid-track. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) vied for the lead through mid-turn, could not keep up with the top one then chased that one to the end while well clear of
the show rival. SEA LEVEL was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up for the minor share. MURGATROYD
was near the rail throughout while never a serious factor. CAT ATTACK pressed the pace three wide into the turn, continued to chase the top two into the
lane then faded. Race was hand-timed duel to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
WILDCARD PRADO was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the two path late in turn, cut the corner into the lane and gained the lead soon after,
was still with the lead with a sixteenth to go then was just caught and finished on even terms. MUSIC TO MY EARS was in the four path through mid-turn
while in close proximity, bid four wide in late turn, lost some ground into the lane, gained momentum once straightened and was inching up to the end to be
even for the win. SEMINOLE JUSTICE vied for the lead two wide and in the three path through the turn, led into the lane then could not keep up with the top
two while finishing clear for the place spot. CLOSE THE CASE was close up early while near the inside, shuffled through late turn then lacked an impact
through the lane. HOPPED UP raced in the back while in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six or seven path and never
was a serious factor. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER vied for the lead along the inside through late turn then gave way.

SMOOTH JUSTICE vied for the lead from the three path through the turn, gained a short lead into the lane, maintained the advantage inside the eighth pole
and inched away a bit late. POETIC VERSE led early while under pressure, continued to duel into the lane then needed more late while turning in a game
effort. LIL EVIE saved ground through the turn and into the lane, shifted into the four path inside the eighth pole and was slowly gaining to the wire. FLIRTY
DANCER raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and finished evenly. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE was in the two path
through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and offered a mild gain. ELUSIVE JUSTICE in the five to the four path through the turn, came into
the lane from the eight path and never was a threat. D D SEVEN THIRTY was checked in between rivals entering the far turn, dropped back and never was
a factor. FOUND MY MAN was checked nearing the three-eighths pole when in tight and never factored. SUMMER HOME pressed the pace early, stepped
in entering the turn and steadily faded. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #5 FOUND MY MAN AGAINST THE RIDER OF #7SUMMER HOME FOR

TORONTOTORO settled off the pace while in the four path through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, was four abreast outside the eighth pole when
moving to challenge for the lead then edged up through the final eighth. BIG NICK was along the inside through the turn, cut the corner and became a threat
then was outfinished by the top one. ALEBRIJE was along the inside through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive and moved up. PRESSURE
vied for the lead from the two path through the turn, was between rivals and two wide nearing the eighth pole then could not keep up. COURTHOUSE
COVE vied for the lead two wide through the turn, came into the lane a serious contender while three wide and between rivals, was in tight just inside the
eighth pole, checked and settled back. GORMLEYS GOT GAME was never a threat while in the two path through the turn. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR A CHANGE OF ORDER.

finished with good energy to be closing in late. AMERICA RULES saved ground through the turn, came off the rail for the drive and was gaining to the wire.
WEST COAST JUSTICE raced along the inside through the turn, continued near the inside through the lane and lost the show spot late. EVERYTHING'S

BELLA'S PRAYER vied for the early lead then settled back to chased the pacesetter into the lane while racing in the two path, bid from the four path into the
lane, caught the leader inside the eighth pole then drove past. KILLER HOTROD was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five
path and was gaining to the end. DOSSIER was bumped and bobbled at the start, settled back to eighth, hustled up along the rail to set the pace through
the turn and into the lane, was caught near the eighth pole, yielded to the top one and lost the place late. GO EARLY STAY LATE raced in the four to the
three path through the turn, came into the lane three wide and moved up while not a threat. LITTLE JOHN COLONY never a factor while in the two path
through the turn. SHINEONBRAD never a threat while in the two path through the turn. THUNDERBOLT ZEUS chased from the four of five path through the
turn, came into the lane from the seven path and tired. MY BUCKAROO was done after traveling a half along the inside. BRIGHT BRIAN was rank early and
slow to settle then trailed throughout.
