from the inside, gained command entering the stretch drive but was caught in the end. DA COACH'S WIFE dueled from the inside while two wide, was in a
hard drive into the stretch but gave way late. ATHENIAN PRINCESS was off slow, then stalked the leaders from the inside into the turn, then bid mildly in
late stretch and missed show. HOT CAVIAR chased the leaders while three wide, menaced on the turn was hard used and weakened. J M SKY CLASSIC
chased the pace between rivals, was four wide on the turn then flattened out in the end. GRANDIOSE SUMMER broke out at the start and trailed

two wide, but was out nodded at the wire, holding on for third. PALUXY was in contention early, going three wide and had no late stretch run. TAPIT WISE

ALTERNATE TIME assumed the lead, being pressed from the outside until the stretch drive, drew clear in mid stretch and won easily. FRANK THE MAYOR
was near the front down the backstretch, three wide, rallied from the outside to get up for second. IRISH EXPECTATIONS stalked the pace from the inside,
made a mild bid and held on to show. CONATIVE had no early speed, traveling four wide all the way, closed a bit too late. WESTFEST pressed the pace
early, two wide and failed to fire down the lane. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK was mid pack, going two wide and had no late run. EYES ON RED was mid field,
two wide and failed to respond in the stretch. MR. UNUSUAL was near the back, three wide and dropped back at the three eights pole.

CHA CHA MISSION settled in the two path down the backstretch, then was slowly gaining on the far turn to rally in the stretch and was in hand late to
prevail. GASTOWN was unhurried early into the far turn, made a bid six wide on the far turn to close belatedly in deep stretch. WORLD WAR was well
placed two wide into the first turn, then lead down the backstretch, was gamely entering the stretch but gave way in the end. GLITTERARY settled along the
inside down the backstretch, made a two wide bid on the far turn but was blocked in the early stretch and was no threat. ENDLESS ROMANCE settled
along the rail into the far turn, was in tight then steadied at the eighth pole, then drifted in along the rail to bid but was no threat. LANDONS CONGO was
between rivals entering the first turn, then settled in the two path, then continued to race evenly throughout. SIP chased the pace while three wide, was in a
hard drive into the far turn then weakend in the stretch drive. MIZONEY chased the leader while two wide down the backstretch then dropped back on the
far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
IMALUCKYCHARM gained command from the gate, getting pressed into the stretch, then drew clear of the field to win going wire to wire. GREAT IN RED
was near the front throughout, racing along the rail, made a bid at the three eighths pole and just held on to second. STELLACZAR was mid field early and
rallied on the outside but just missed second at the wire. TAHITIAN BREEZE was near the back early, then had a mild rally going four wide into the lane but
was too late. MATH MYSTERY pressed the pace down the backstretch, two wide with an even effort in late stretch. FETCHING ran a little rank early on
going two wide and offered a mild bid in late stretch. KEEP THE BLING got off slow, passing tiring rivals and showed little. LUCK IS FICKLE stalked the
pace down the back stretch, four wide and faded down the lane. NEEDS NO ALIBI was mid pack, three wide, then dropped back at the head of the stretch.
