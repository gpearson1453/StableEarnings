Footnotes
DOMINANT SOUL broke in and brushed rival leaving the gate, set the pace on the inside, shook loose on the far turn, carried a comfortable lead into the
final furlong and held safely. BUD KNIGHT raced two then three wide around the first turn, traveled three deep into the second bend, advanced three wide
through that turn, finished well but had to settle for second best. PRIMER DIMER broke out, tracked four then three deep early, stalked outside a rival up the
backstretch, raced two wide then between rivals into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick but saved the show. KIMMER chased between
rivals around the first turn, dropped back off the pace into the backstretch, steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped off the rail and earning a
minor award while never threatening. WARRENS CANDY MAN checked off heels into the first turn, went two to three wide around that bend, was along the
two path into the stretch, moved out some and never responded to urging. SUNDOWN WARREN got brushed leaving the gate, pulled a bit early along the
inside, stalked behind the leader up the backstretch, coaxed on the far turn and remained near the fence into the lane and weakened.

PADDLE ON POLLY away quickly in the beginning, vied between runners into and around he turn, dueled outside MISS LUCILLA through the stretch and
gamely prevailed. IT'S SAUL RIGHT chased off the rail, two wide into the turn then angled four wide, closed well outside the top pair but was too late.
SMOKEM FOR YOU sent for the front from inside, vied along the rail through the turn, dueled with the winner down the stretch and went gamely to the line.
MISS LUCILLA was off slow to begin, chased along the inside at the back into the turn, swung out leaving the turn and traveled widest at the top of the lane,
finished well through the final furlong but needed more late. THE REIGN SONG chased from outside then went up to challenge three around the turn, lost
touch entering the stretch and weakened down the lane.

and got up for second at the wire. A NEW PEACE stumbled leaving the gate then recovered quickly to clear the field and steered to the inside, took
pressure from KUORA (PER) at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared that rival briefly on the far turn before being challenged again with a quarter mile left to

Footnotes
SYNTHESIS hit the gate and was off slow to begin, advanced inside then ran up on the leaders heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, waited for room through
the turn, roused in upper stretch, rallied along the fence and bested OFFSHORE AFFAIR in the final sixteenth. OFFSHORE AFFAIR showed speed from
along the inside, set the pace under pressure to the turn, vied for command around with a pair of rivals around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch but
got outfinished by the winner in the late stages. QUICK FINISH raced up close early between rivals, chased two wide outside a rival on the turn, angled out
and came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly and gained the show. JAMMING EDDY away quickly from outside, attended the pace four deep up the
backstretch, launched a bid three deep on the turn, fought on to the eighth pole then flattened out in deep stretch. ZIMBA WARRIOR dropped back early,
went two wide into the turn, raced three to four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. OCTOPUS got bumped by FULL DRAW early but still had early
speed, pressed from outside into the turn, vied between foes around the bend, then folded in the lane. FULL DRAW drifted in and bumped OCTOPUS early,
tracked off the inside, rounded the turn four then three wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) trailed in the early going, advanced three to four wide around the turn, rallied from outside and overhauled the top pair to win
clear. WHOOPING JAY vied for the lead from inside to the turn, dueled with CHAOS THEORY around the bend, held a short lead into the furlong grounds,
could not fend off the winner in the late stages but held the place. CHAOS THEORY vied three deep up the backstretch, dueled outside WHOOPING JAY
through the turn, kept the pressure on into the final sixteenth but never found the needed late kick. CITY RAGE vied for command between rivals then got
shuffled a bit leaving the backstretch, lost touch into the turn, chased two to three wide into the lane and weakened. ROOKIE MISTAKE broke a bit slow,
chased outside a rival then two wide into the turn, angled to the rail past the quarter pole and flattened out. OLYMPIC LEGEND raced up close on the inside
then ceded the lead and dropped back, trailed the field into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
SUPER CHIEF raced up close from outside early, bid three deep into the turn, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the stretch, drifted out in the
final furlong and held well. LEYAS CANDY chased five deep early, crept closer five then four wide around the bend, angled inside the winner in midstretch
and lacked the late kick to get by. DUTCH BUS was off a bit slow to begin, sent early and went up to challenge for command at the half-mile pole, got put in
a bit tight midway through the turn, tipped out then came back inside and kept on to earn the show honors. CREATIVE PEAK away quickest from the gate to
take control early, dueled outside DUTCH BUS past the half-mile pole, vied between into the turn, dueled inside SUPER CHIEF past the five-sixteenths pole
and weakened in the lane. GRAZED raced in range four deep early, chased three wide into the lane and faded. IRONDALE was off a bit slow to begin,
tracked two wide into the turn, steered out and came four wide into the drive and weakened. ARMAVEER was off slow and steadied briefly at the start,
trailed off the inside to the stretch and made no impact. DOYOUSTILLLOVEME was off a bit slow, raced near the back up the backstretch, saved ground
through the turn and was not a factor. TORRID TOMMY raced between then steadied behind rivals early, chased six then five wide on the turn and came up
empty.

Footnotes
TEDDY'S BARINO stalked the top pair from outside early, bid three deep with three-eighths remaining, dueled from outside past the five-sixteenths pole,
took over and cleared in upper stretch and widened in the final furlong. RACE JUDICATA dueled for the lead from inside, took over at the seven-sixteenths
pole, battled through the turn and into the stretch, could not kick on the with the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best.
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH bobbled a bit leaving the gate, dropped back early, moved to the inside, steered out and raced four to five wide into the stretch and
produced a mild rally to gain the show. DRIZELLA showed early speed between rivals then got crowded and steadied near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased
along the rail through the turn and flattened out. LI'L GRAZEN broke a step slow from outside, tracked the pace outside a rival, approached the quarter pole
four deep and could not rally. NORAH'S PRINCESS broke slow and lost her pat leaving the gate, chased three deep near the quarter pole and weakened in
the drive. PRAY FOR MY OWNER broke out while displaying early foot, showed the way outside a pair of rivals then dueled past the nine-sixteenths pole,
dropped back between rivals around the turn, eased in the lane, fell while returning and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NINEELEVENTURBO stalked three wide around the first turn, followed the leader while outside a rival up the backstretch, bid two wide on the final turn,
took over in upper stretch then drew away in the final sixteenth. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT was off slow to begin, lagged behind early, angled four to five wide
on the far turn and rallied belatedly to gain second. MO THEM DOWN sped to the front and steered to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, received a
challenge from the winner around the turn, got headed into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. AMADMADWORLD was off a bit
slow in the beginning, pulled and had to steady first time through the stretch, settled along the inside, tipped two wide and went between rivals on the far
turn and failed to threaten while earning a minor award. TODAY MATTERS chased four wide into the first turn then angled to the three path, stayed off the
rail and entered the lane three deep and could not rally. GEBO stumbled leaving the gate, coaxed early then rated on the inside, went two wide around the
first turn, steered out and raced outside a trio of rivals at the quarter pole and into the lane and failed to find the needed response. LOOKOUT POINT
allowed to settle well off the pace while moving inside, navigated the second turn two wide, steered out in the lane and failed to menace. TIZ TACT TOE
forwardly placed in the early going outside the pacesetter then moved to the two path, lost ground around the far turn while traveling along the rail and faded
through the lane.
