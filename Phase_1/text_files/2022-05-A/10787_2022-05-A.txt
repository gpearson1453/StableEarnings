Footnotes
PIRATE MISCHIEF Away with field and lined up into first turn fanned four wide, took initiative around first bend and into backside to challenge lead while
cutting off SCRATCH ME, made clear lead at three-eighths pole and moved to rail for turn, pulled clear leading into the stretch and held off oncoming
challenger. CATHRYN VALENTINA Sent to lead and was clear into first turn, engaged by rival to the outside into backstretch, conceded control halfway
down backside, switched to two path to re-rally on leader, made headway down the lane but could not match winner. K P KRYPTON Tracked off leaders
towards center of course throughout running, chased with steady gain beginning at quarter pole, small gains through closing stages but failed to be more
than third best. EARLY RISER (IRE) Eight path on first turn, maintained a tracking position throughout well off the well, eight path again on second turn,
finished well off the winning pace. SCRATCH ME Broke in stride, lined up in group of four moving into the first turn when space was minimized by PIRATE
MISCHIEF, forced to take back near rear of field heading into backstretch, picked up swiftly along the rail rounding the far turn, motored past weakening
rivals late. WHISPERING FLAME Far back throughout, commenced short rally at quarter pole, late foot allowed for passing of tiring foe in closing stages. EZ
QUEEN Stalked between rivals while wide into first turn, settled in this position on the backstretch, rounded far turn in the seven path, and flattened out from
that point on. ALEMOON Always detached in the rear of the field, failed to make an impression. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, #5 PIRATES
MISCHIEF WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE HEADING INTO THE FIRST TURN WITH #4 SCRATCH ME.

Footnotes
ROYALSTELLARTAKEOFF Broke in stride, raced outside of tight knit group, surged in dying yards to get up in time. TORETTO Broke straight to front, led
from outset, caught late. HIGH RATE GINGER Battled outside of rivals, mild gain late not enough. FIRE STICK Fought between rivals early, backed out of
hole between at midway point, evenly to line. DASHIN FOR FORTUNE Dueled between second set of rivals of pace, never enough to play a part of
outcome. STEL BEST CHANCE Ran inside of quintet of runners along the rail while battling for the lead, faded in closing stages. OKEY DOKEY BLUE
Broke a touch slowly, never able to factor from inside.

TROPHY CHEST Broke with field but was taken ahold of early, moved up heading into the first turn to establish a stalking position, continued to gain and
made lead at eighth pole leading into the stretch, drew clear under mild urging. PICK YOUR BID Stalked inside early, advanced inside and passed tiring
leader at eighth pole, no match for winner. YOU NEVER CALL Away quickly and naturally found herself first flight early, backed out leading into the
backstretch and was taken to the outside of horses, attempted a three wide bid from the fourth path heading into the far turn, nosed out for place after
battling for spot through stretch. O G GULFSTREAM GUS Dueled outside for lead into first turn, took clear advantage and moved to rail for backstretch,
called upon for more at quarter pole but failed to respond and backed out from there. DEPUTY'S DANCER Taken to tracking position early, moved off rail
on backstretch, attempted to rally into far turn and drifted to outer rail, regrouped to pass weakening rivals. RANDOM PLEASURE Far back throughout,
showed mild gain between around bend, never close. GOLDEN GODDESS Trailed throughout, never fired.

CAPTAIN RED Sat in a stalking position just off of early lead, maintained position through shifts in race complexion, pounced on leader approaching eighth
pole, went on to victory. ORATORY GLORY Set up in stalking position just off the rail, assumed leading role at half-mile pole and tried to go on with it, led
until eighth pole when overtaken by eventual winner, attempt to re-bid unsuccessful. RED HOT CAT Away in stride but outrun in opening stages, last early,
moved up along the rail first time past the stands and made it to a pressing position of leader heading into backstretch, unable to sustain full rally and tired.
WINDI'S MOMENT Established position in back half of field, went to five path on first turn, attempted to move up with fellow challengers along backside but
could not keep pace. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE Straight to lead from the start, led along rail until half-mile pole when approached by a host of rivals, tried
to keep pace from that point but faded down the lane. MALIBUENA Quick early foot to challenge for early lead, didn't handle first bend and ended up in nine
path at widest point, continued to press lead after making way back to pack, failed to keep up and backed out at three-eighths pole, not persevered with.
