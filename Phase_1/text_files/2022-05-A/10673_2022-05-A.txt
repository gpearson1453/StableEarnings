Footnotes
LONE SCOUT stalked the pace in the two path, pulled between runners on the backstretch, chased two wide through the far turn, tipped to the outside in
the lane, surged late and got up in time. FLINTMORE stalked off the rail then moved to the two path, applied pressured up the backstretch, remained
alongside the leader into the stretch, took over with a furlong to go and got nailed on the line. MIGRATION dueled outside a rival first time through the
stretch, cleared around the clubhouse turn and angled to the rail, showed the way with company alongside to the far turn, maintained a short advantage into
the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and flattened to third late. BALDORO broke well then dropped back off the pace, went three to four wide around
both turns and needed to find more in the furlong grounds. BIRTH OF COOL settled early, traveled two wide then moved to the rail, steered back to the two
path around the far turn and failed to threaten. LIL BRO COOP sat off the pace two then three wide early, traveled three deep into the far turn, remained
three wide into the drive and could not rally. TORAJIRO forced to steady early, moved to the inside, moved off the rail and three wide into the stretch and
failed to menace. TUSKEGEE CAT dueled from inside first time through the stretch then ceded control to MIGRATION and took a stalking position, started
to weaken on the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
MAD CATTER dueled for command outside CATBERNAY, bumped with that rival twice in upper stretch, continued to battle into the final sixteenth and drew
clear late. CATBERNAY dueled with MAD CATTER while along the inside, battled around the turn and into the lane, drifted and bumped out and bumped
twice in upper stretch and yielded in deep stretch. TOM BOMBADIL forwardly placed early then lost his path when MAD CATTER angled over and caused
him some ground, remained in range to the turn, lost ground three then two wide around the turn, then kept on willingly through the stretch run and closed
the gap while earning the show. DIVINE FEMININE chased between then got crowded between rivals, angled in and saved ground around the turn and
showed a mild rally to round out the superfecta. ME MACHO raced wide up the backstretch at the back, rounded the bend five wide and never threatened.
RANTANEN threw his head and broke slow, recovered quickly and went up to stalk behind the top pair, traveled along the inside then steered out to the
three path but could not rally in the lane. MESA EMPIRE tracked well off the rail up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn then raced between runners
and could not rally. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT CATBERNAY
DRIFTED OUT AND INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH MAD CATTER AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

IT'S SIMPLE broke well then pulled while trying to be rated in a forward position, angled down to the inside and saved ground around the turn, waited for
room leaving the bend, tipped out at the top of the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and inched away. BIG BEAUTY moved off the rail and raced on
heels between rivals on the backstretch, went two wide into the turn then angled to the inside, rallied up the rail in the lane and got up for second. D'S
LOVELY SOPHIA sped to the front from outside then cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the way through the turn and into the stretch,
challenged from outside and relinquished the lead with a sixteenth remaining and got edged for the place. GOTHAM DESIRE sat off the pace, went three
then four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. ALL DIALED IN was off slow to begin, raced near the back of the pack, lugged out into
the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and kept on to improved position. NORTHERN GEM broke slow, trailed early on, got
floated out by ALL DIALED at the three-eighths pole, exited the turn four wide, angled widest in the drive and could not rally. VELLA broke through the gate
and was reloaded, chased between rivals and bumped with EVERLYS GIRL early, continued between while moving out, went two wide around the turn,
came out in the stretch and weakened. SPANISH CHANNEL raced up close between runners and got shuffled back a bit early, moved back up to recover
the ground lost and went three deep into and around the turn, then weakened in the lane. EVERLYS GIRL raced up close down on the inside, bumped with
VELLA and put in tight along the rail, raced up on heels behind the winner leaving the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SETTECENTO stalked two wide then moved inside, moved out and took aim three wide leaving the far turn, reached the front approaching the eight pole,
put away inner rival and coasted in late. KING ROB sped clear and moved to the two path, set all the pace to the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and
stayed on to prove second best. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM tracked three to four wide around both turns, kept on through the lane but failed to make an
impact on the top pair. MONGOLIAN BONUS went four then three wide around the first turn near the back, crept closer up the backstretch, had the rider
lose his whip at the five-sixteenths while advanced from outside, urged with a pair of goggles in the lane and improved position. PRINCE ZIGGY was off
slow to begin, traveled two wide through both turns, moved inside in the lane and was not a factor. MISSING MAURICE tracked off the rail, angled in on the
far turn and lacked further response. AWKWARD MORNING pulled while rank on the first turn, continued to pull early on the backstretch, settled into stretch
and moved closer along the inside and came up empty in the late stages. ERIK THE VIKING stalked four then three wide early, dropped back three wide on
the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
WITH THIS VOW dueled from outside into the first turn, drifted out around the bend then cleared inner rival, opened up on the far turn, carried a comfortable
lead into the final furlong and held well over the runner-up. TMORROWISALONGTIME reserved in the early going and was guided to the inside, tipped out a
bit on the far turn but lacked room and steadied around the bend, moved to the inside in the lane then steered back out in deep stretch while making a late
run but could not get to the winner. WITCH MOON trailed into the far turn, angled out and exited the bend five wide, drifted in a bit at the eighth pole, closed
well but was outkicked for the place honors. RENEGADE PRINCESS went three to four wide around both turns, got put in tight quarters and checked hard
at the eighth pole, had the rider lose the whip at the sixteenth marker and held a minor award. FOR THE GOOD TIMES was off slow to begin, ran up on
heels at the half-mile pole, steadied early on the far turn then waited for room through the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch and improved position.j.
ICE QUEEN stalked outside a rival then between foes, got blocked behind ROMAN EMPRESS dropping back on the far turn, altered out around rival then
angled out further in the lane and could not rally. ICE COLD GOLD went three then two wide early, chased outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, was
closest in pursuit of the winner two wide into the lane, drifted out and bothered rival at the eighth pole and weakened in the furlong grounds. BEACHGRASS
checked off the heels of ICE COLD GOLD on the first turn, moved out and raced outside rivals on the backstretch, forced to check hard by ICE COLD
GOLD again at the eighth pole and was not persevered with. MO CONNELLY tracked along the inside on the turns and tired. ROMAN EMPRESS dueled for
command from inside early then ceded control to the winner, stalked between rivals leaving the backstretch, dropped back readily between rivals and
checked on the far turn and had nothing left for the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED
THAT ALTHOUGH ICE COLD GOLD DRIFTED OUT AND CAUSED BEACHGRASS TO CHECK AT THE EIGHTH POLE, IT DID NOT COST
BEACHGRASS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
SILKEN PRINCE allowed to settle in the early going, angled five wide around the turn, rallied to the front in upper stretch and kicked clear to win going
away. SHADY EMPIRE stumbled leaving the gate, chased down on the inside and raced in tight quarters then steadied near the seven-sixteenths, swung
four wide into the stretch, finished well but got outkicked by the winner. ACTIVE ACCOUNT was off a bit slow to begin, swung seven wide leaving the turn,

Footnotes
ALL FOUR WINDS broke in and bumped rival, sped to the front with POSEIDON'S KID to the outside, cleared that rival around the bend, then kicked clear
in the lane and powered away in the final furlong. POSEIDON'S KID raced up close outside the winner, could not keep pace around the bend, chased three
wide into the stretch and saved second. CAROL'S COMIC was off a bit slow to begin, ran up on heels and checked hard leaving the bend, angled to the
inside, rallied up the rail and missed second. DICK BEST bobbled leaving the gate, sat off the pace, went three to four wide around the turn and never
threatened while earning a minor award. TRIBAL DANCING chased four deep up the backstretch, rounded the turn four wide and lacked the needed
response. HEAVEN'S MUSIC tracked three deep early, went two wide into the turn, angled to the inside and could not rally. TAKE THE TWO TEN hit the
gate and broke inward, trailed into the turn along the inside, came out and entered the stretch five wide and improved position. MUNNY BALL traveled
toward the rear of the field well off the inside, navigated the turn five wide and failed to menace. IRISH CIRCLES got bumped from both sides at the start,
went up to chase between rivals, moved inside then back to the two path around the bend and weakened. HEY JASPER broke out and brushed rival at the
start, tracked along the inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
CANOODLING vied for command from inside into the first turn, took control around the bend, cleared leaving the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch,
urged right and left-handed in the lane and remained clear to the line. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM vied four deep into the first turn then moved back a stalking
position in the three path, raced outside a pair of rivals midway on the far turn then shifted into the two path, steered out at the top of the stretch and gained
the place. ENGLAND'S ROSE off slow from outside, steered down to the rail trailing early, went two wide into the far turn, angled out around the bend and
entered the lane three to four wide, finished well through the final furlong and earned the show honors. AMY C (GB) stalked the speed from along the rail,
tipped out on the far turn and took aim as the closest threat entering the lane but could not find the needed late kick in the final furlong. JAVANICA got
crowded and took back briefly shortly after the start, steadied off heels entering the first turn, tracked inside up the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane
and failed to rally. KEYFLOWER (FR) broke a step slow, steadied off heels slightly in the three path entering the clubhouse turn, remained off the rail into
the stretch and also lacked a rally. STELLA NOIR vied three deep early but got put in tight quarters and had to checked into the first turn, traveled widest up
the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and had little left for the drive. QUIET SECRETARY showed speed between rivals early then prompted the pace
from outside while in hand, lost touch with the winner at the seven-sixteenths pole, weakened two wide around the far turn, tired and eased in the stretch
and walked off.
