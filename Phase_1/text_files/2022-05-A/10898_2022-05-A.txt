Footnotes
HALITE lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide, drifted in slightly when challenging for the lead approaching the finish and prevailed under urging.
BEYOND THE VICTORY , taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear mid way on the first turn, set the pace and drifted out a bit inside the sixteenth pole
when tiring. IRISH RIVIERA , well placed in the two path around the far turn, advanced to mid stretch and steadied in close quarters between the top two
approaching the finish. KRUG , along the inner rail to upper stretch, swung to the four path in mid stretch and showed late interest. MAID THE JOURNEY
raced near the inner rail throughout and failed to rally. An objection by the rider of IRISH RIVIERA against HALITE for alleged interference in the stretch
drive was not allowed.

past the three sixteenths and held firm under a drive. COLOROFACLOUD broke a step slow, edged up two wide between rivals leaving the far turn, angled
and circled four wide with momentum into the lane, ranged up in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and flattened out. TIPSY TOURIST rated off the
leaders in the opening sixteenths, secured the inside and stalked, was under pressure pursuing into the stretch, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded.
TOUGH ONE prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, was under asking past the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded.
HURRICANE DIRECTOR , brushed at the break, was hung out four deep into the turn, lacked a kick past the five sixteenths and gave way. TOUCH OF

UNCLE JEROME prompted the pace outside PHRA PHROM, moved to the attack nearing the half mile marker, took command then went clear under a firm
left handed grip leaving the three eighths, opened up a lengthy advantage into the lane, wandered outward and held sway while kept to right handed asking.
COASTAL CHAOS settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out gathering some steam leaving the far turn, circled four to five wide into the lane,
moved up near mid stretch, drifted out a bit, was corrected and angled in to finished with interest. EXIT , three wide and in the clear stalking past the five
eighths, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths and faded. KING SERAF lagged back while off the rail and failed to rally. SWALLOW BEACH , off the
pace, saved ground into the lane, angled out but lacked a bid. PHRA PHROM sped to the front and secured the inside, was hounded by the winner, ceded
the lead leaving the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
UNORTHODOX , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled horses on the far turn, closed steadily outside foes and was up at
the wire while drifting out. WONDER WATER , stalked the pace, moved up in the two path on the far turn, challenged for the lead turning for home, held the
advantage in mid stretch and just missed after his rider briefly dropped the right rein inside the sixteenth pole. ULF lacked speed, raced four wide leaving the
far turn, took aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. STIMULUS MAKER , clear into the first turn, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened
late. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , five deep leaving the far turn, showed a mild gain. LIGHTNING LAD , fractious in the starting gate, was not a factor. GET
OFF MY CLOUD , in the two path chasing the pace down the backstretch, gave way on the far turn. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE was not a factor.

ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , with the pace four deep early on, emerged past the half mile marker vying outside RAGTIME BLUES, moved clear of that one
without much effort mid turn, opened up while three wide in upper stretch then held sway while ridden out. DAY THE MUSIC DIED hopped at the break and
away slowly, rated well off the rail early on, dropped in around the turn, moved up near the three sixteenths, shifted out and closed gamely. RAGTIME
BLUES disputed the early pace between runners then to the inside of the winner, saw that one clear leaving the three eighths, angled out, circled four wide
to chase into the lane, failed to seriously kick on past mid stretch and saved the show. NO MORE TALK rated off the leaders after an alert break, saved
ground, moved up some in upper stretch then flattened out. SEANOW forced the early pace to the inside of foes and faded. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU
flashed speed, angled out and gave way.

FLY ME HOME accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. R AVERIE LYNN , outside the winner,
chased that one around the track and flattened out. AWAY TO RETURN bumped TORRE BRANCA when bumped and forced out by TIZ SUSAN ANN
leaving the starting gate, was four deep on the turn, rallied and drifted in late. TRITONE GAL raced in the two path on the turn, remained off the rail through
the stretch and finished willingly. HUFFLEPUFF hugged the inner rail, chased the pace and faded. TIZ SUSAN ANN bumped AWAY TO RETURN when
bearing out at the break, was not a factor and raced near the inner rail on the turn. KILLY START , well placed three deep around the turn, faltered in
midstretch. TORRE BRANCA , steadied when bumped leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
MONYINTHEBANKSEY sped to the front into the first turn, was nicely handled and unfazed as BOONDOGGLE pulled his way to the lead past the three
quarter pole, shifted out near the half and rebid in hand into the far turn, kicked away under coaxing leaving the three eighths, opened up a big lead in mid
stretch then maintained a safe margin while kept to task. CAMP PENDLETON broke a step slow, edged up behind rivals then checked off heels near the
seven eighths, regrouped and moved up wide into the far turn, circled four wide under pressure into the stretch and closed steadily. ANTIPOISON saved
ground and offered a mild kick. SNOW CANDY , three wide chasing the pace, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. WHERE'S THE BEN'S lagged inside and
was outrun. BOONDOGGLE , keen outside the winner, pulled his way clear leaving the three quarter pole, dropped in, was headed around the far turn, gave
futile chase to mid stretch and faltered.
