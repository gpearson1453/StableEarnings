HELMS DEEP vied for the early lead two wide, then went on to set a fast pace and move to the inside on the backstretch, drew off leaving the turn and then
was kept to mild pressure to widen the margin to prove much the best. MY MAGICAL MAN chased the pace on the inside and then was up for the place
award while still saving ground. REBEL RULER vied for the early lead on the inside, then tracked the pace two wide on the backstretch, faded in the drive
while saving the show award. DOMINANT FACTOR was off a beat slow, then was void of early speed, angled out in the drive, had a belated rally to just
miss the show award. CRYPT chased the pace and made a mild three wide bid on the turn and then was empty.

second best. BOUND BY TRUTH dueled for the lead two wide and weakened in the drive, bested rest. FAIRY DREAMS chased the pace and was four wide
on the turn and had no rally. SPECIAL BEAM prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened. SOCIAL EXCLUSION

DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was well placed early on the inside, eased off the inside and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn
and drew off while being ridden out to prove much the best. BUFF AND SHINE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short
lead leaving the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. DOUBLE TIME BAY set a pressured pace on the inside
and weakened, bested rest. MAGNETIC CHARM was off slowly and broke inward, then was settled in the back, was climbing on the turn and racing
greenly, then passed the tiring rivals. CIRCLE OF COURAGE tracked the pace from between rivals and weakened. LTL BEAR SALOON pressed the pace
between horses and weakened. THE LITTLE SPROUT was bumped at the start, then chased the pace four wide on the turn and came five wide into the
drive and was empty.
