Footnotes
SPEIGHT AND MALICE pressed the pace down the backstretch and through the turn, going two wide, then rallied at the eighth pole, drawing off from the
field to win convincingly. PIKNITUPLAYNITDOWN stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, then was looking for racing room mid stretch and
finally angled out to close and grab second. CHARLIECANDO was near the back traveling five wide, had a mild rally in the stretch drive to get up for show.
CHIEF BRADY bore out at the break and was a little rank, running off for a bit down the back stretch, then lacked a late response. SILVER WINGS made
the lead out of the gate, racing along the inside, but tired down the lane. FLEXATI trailed the field from the start, traveling along the rail and was no factor.

AND GOLD was mid pack early on, gathered up and closed five wide in the stretch drive to get up for second. TEXAS TITAN pressed the pace going two
wide, then angled out in mid stretch to make a bid and get up for show. POPEYES HEART was well placed early racing along the rail, made a bid in the
stretch but lost the path in late stretch and was steadied. MORO WARRIOR made the lead, running along the rail but was tired in late stretch. RUNNIN THE
RED was unhurried early, three wide and passed a tiring rival. GOLIATH RIDGE was three wide, dropped back and was no factor. The rider of POPEYES

around the turn, but hung a little late and held on to show. DUCHESSOFLOCHWOOD was mid field early, then had a mild rally down the lane, but lugged in

back up to the leaders, dueling though the turn, but faded in the stretch. ANNA B was mid pack along the inside and dropped back. BIG TOUCH was near
