PROSPECT by the eighth pole and fought gamely in the final furlong to prove second best. STAR ISLAND KITTY bobbled at the start and was hustled to
the lead from the two path was challenged by SAYAAD AIN'T SO going into the stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. PIPPA'S PROSPECT

Footnotes
WILD RUMBLE was four wide into the first turn cleared and dropped in to set a clear pace throughout and was much the best. BULL RING was within
striking distance through the final turn made a rail bid but didn't have enough to catch the winner. SOME DUDE tracked the leaders down the backstretch
made a three wide bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch. MUSCLE UP saved ground off the rail but failed to menace. SINNER REJOICE went five
wide into the first turn and raced near the back down the backstretch made a mild bid on the final turn and passed tiring rival in late in the stretch. IDENTIFY
was five wide into the first turn and was forwardly placed through the final turn and weakened. GREAT REALIZATION trailed and was not a threat.
