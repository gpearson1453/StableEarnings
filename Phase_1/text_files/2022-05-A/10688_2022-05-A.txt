BEST OF YOU prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run to
win going away. SWEETALKINGJUSTICE with the second flight three wide, angled out to the five path entering the stretch and finished clear for second.
ALL THE BEST with the second flight along the rail, altered course to the five path for the drive giving up position then came again late.
WHERETHERE'SSMOKE was antsy in the gate, checked over heels into the clubhouse turn, moved up three wide entering the far turn then came up
empty. WELLOILEDCAT was no factor. WAR MOON broke in front, set a pressured pace for nearly six furlongs then weakened.

WINKING AT THEDUDE stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely and proved best under an
energetic hand ride. BUFFALO MAX allowed to settle, closed fast four wide, drew on even terms for the lead in mid stretch then hung. PRETTY STORMY
pressed the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. PARADE GRAND passed tiring rivals.
PALTARREVENGE was a forward factor for six furlongs then weakened. KLAATU set a pressured pace along the inside for five furlongs then weakened in
the stretch.
