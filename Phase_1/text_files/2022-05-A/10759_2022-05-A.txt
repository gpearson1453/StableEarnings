RON DON SCORESE set the pace while racing removed from the rail, was challenged leaving the turn and to the furlong marker, dug in gamely to hold
sway under a drive. SEPICATO was well rated early on the inside, made a inside move leaving the far turn to loom boldly leaving the furlong marker but
hung late, second best. CRUSH IT tracked the early pace three wide and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out, bested rest. PAL CAL
stalked the pace four wide and came five wide into the drive and stopped.

BOURBON MUSIC was well placed on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn, lugged in slightly leaving the three sixteenths, was corrected and
closed on the outside to get up in time under strong handling. FED CHAIR was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, then dug in gamely in the
stretch but was caught late to just miss, held place award gamely. GANDI prompted the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, had a
long drive but was out kicked late. CRITICAL THINKING was settled early and chased the pace four wide on the turn but was empty in the drive. WISH FOR
PEACE was reserved early four wide and was four to five wide on the turn and never threatened. SASSY LAD was off slowly and then raced on the inside
early, shifted to the outside on the turn and came wide in to the drive and stopped.

under mild urging. PAPA TONY chased the early pace and was four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and finished willingly, got place award.
NICE WEATHER was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead on the inside, could not go with the winner on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and
was outfinished for the place award. CHEEK TO CHEEK was reserved early, split rivals on the turn and came three wide into the drive and had a belated
rally. VICTOR'S DYNASTY was settled early and was four to five wide on the turn and had no rally. NAUTICAL NATURE had a inside trip and failed to

pressure to late stretch. DIAL ME MAYBE chased the pace three wide and proved to be no match for the winner while getting up to be second best. SMOKE
AND MIRRORS chased the early pace on the inside and weakened, bested rest. PRETTY SPECTACULAR lacked a rally on the inside. REAWAKENED
was reserved three wide early, came five wide into the drive and was not a threat.
