out mildly late. VICTORIA'S DOLL bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, was squeezed back to trail the field up the backstretch, began to
improve position while racing outside around the turn, launched a three wide bid entering the stretch and gained ground from there to get second.

bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung
wide entering the stretch and was no match from there. AMARI S. pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path

Footnotes
I LOVE TO RACE settled near the rear outside of GODSGIFT in the opening furlong, chased outside of PERFECT DIVA from the nine sixteenths, was
pushed along in the three path in the chasing flight on the turn, raced three wide into the lane, angled out to the six path midstretch, rallied under a drive and
took the lead five jumps from the wire. PERFECT DIVA chased inside, hugged the rail around the turn, was driven up the inside into the lane, responded
with a rally, headed AH LEAH near the sixteenth pole but could not hold off I LOVE TO RACE in the final jumps, returned to be unsaddled but was vanned
off the course. AH LEAH tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, took closer order on the leader when driven four
wide into the lane, took the lead approaching the furlong mark, but was caught near the sixteenth and flattened between horses. UPSIDE DOWN was sent
clear, set the pace in the two path on the turn, faltered into the lane, was headed approaching the furlong mark and weakened between horses. GODSGIFT
was hard to settle, raced at the rear of the pack, was outpaced from the nine sixteenths, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, was driven three wide in
upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally.

Footnotes
OMAHA RED dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch
and drew off down the lane to win easily. BOAT SONG was bumped hard and forced to check when the horse to his inside veered in at the start, trailed the
field in the early going, was bumped again near the half mile pole when MISSOURI GENT came into his lane, switched outside to began a four wide bid
around the turn, gained ground on the outside in the stretch and was by far the best of the rest. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and gained ground mildly while drifting out the length of the stretch. NO
MORE Z U veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the two and three path and faded in the final furlong. MISSOURI GENT brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of
the pack on the outside up the backstretch, veered in sharply and bumped with BOAT SONG near the half mile pole, trailed the field from the two path
around the turn and was empty from there. BOURBON TEDDY hit the gate leaving it, recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

driven for an inside bid in upper stretch, led at the three sixteenths, and drew off. GOLDEN GOPHER tracked the pacesetter outside of MISSION BELLE
around the first turn, applied light pressure outside of CERTAIN HEARTS down the back straight, prompted the leader while racing in the three path around
the far turn, came three wide into the lane, was no match for MISSION BELLE from the three sixteenths but chased on willingly for place. PINK CHANNEL
settled at the rear, began to improve four wide nearing the half mile mark, chased in the four to five path around the far turn, swung five wide into upper
stretch, and offered a mild rally for show while drifting out. UNION PARK GAL (IRE) floated three wide into the first turn, chased the leading trio, continued
midpack in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch and did not find the necessary kick. SPECIAL CONQUEST chased
toward the rear, hugged the rail near the rear around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. CERTAIN HEARTS
cleared to the lead, took some light pressure from GOLDEN GOPHER down the backstretch, continued to set the pace in the two path on the far turn while
prompted by GOLDEN GOPHER, was engaged by MISSION BELLE to his inside in upper stretch and headed near the three sixteenths, and weakened.
READY AT MIDNIGHT settled near the rear, pulled a bit down the backstretch to join inside of PINK CHANNEL, was pushed along two wide on the far turn,
stopped approaching the three sixteenths, slowed to a jog, but completed the course under his own power and walked off.

ASTI SKY was sent for speed inside, cleared from the five eighths, set the pace in the two path on the turn, floated to the lane in the four to five path,
opened up to midstretch under a drive, and held to the finish. AHEADOFTHEGAME tracked the leading pair outside of FLASHFIRE, raced in the three to
four path outside of that foe around the turn, floated into the lane in the seven path, drifted inward and then outward again, but nonetheless gained to the
finish under a drive. DASTARDLY DEEDS settled near the rear inside of DASH TO THE CASH, raced in the two path in the turn with the rear flight, race
into the lane in the four path, drifted inward slightly in upper stretch, and kept on mildly between horses to secure the show. DASH TO THE CASH settled at
the rear, continued in the rear flight outside of DASTARDLY DEEDS in the three path on the turn, swung into upper stretch in the five path, chased on mildly
and was outfinished for the show. ROCKET MAN ATTACK acted fractious in the gate, was sent for speed but outsprinted by ASTI SKY from near the five
eighths, tracked the pacesetter from there, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, continued in range into upper stretch but weakened from the
three sixteenths. FLASHFIRE tracked the leading pair inside of AHEADOFTHEGAME, was urged in the two path from the seven sixteenths, began to flatten
near the three eighths, was driven inside in upper stretch, stopped approaching the furlong pole and was allowed to trail home.

TOUGH TO TAME saved ground while racing in tight quarters around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail
approaching the three eighths pole and wore down his rivals to pull clear late. SERMONONTHEMOUNT saved ground around the first turn, settled off the
pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and gained ground
in the final furlong. GITA'S LAD raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two
path and chased the winner home while finishing evenly. RICHIESGOTGAME steadied slightly headed into the first turn, raced in the two path from there,
came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, launched a bid three wide while racing around the far turn and was outkicked in the final furlong.
LAUDA SPEED broke sharply, led the field while saving ground around the turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, battled from the rail around
the far turn and weakened late. TWOKO BAY raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to
save ground around the second turn and made no bid. LAVENDER EARL raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the
backstretch, began to drop back while racing around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
CLEAR N CONVINCING chased toward the rear of the main pack inside of TAP THE MOJO around the clubhouse turn, settled behind the chasing flight
down the back straight, began to improve between horses into the far turn, bid four wide in tandem with TAP THE MOJO approaching the quarter pole,
swung seven wide into the lane, rallied while drifting out, took the lead with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and kept on to prove best. TAP THE MOJO
chased toward the rear of the main pack three wide on the first turn, chased outside of DUCHOSSOIS down the back straight, continued to chase three
wide around the far turn, swung out for a five wide bid approaching the quarter in tandem with CLEAR N CONVINCING, swung eight wide into the lane,
rallied while being carried out by CLEAR N CONVINCING, and was ultimately outkicked. DUCHOSSOIS raced between horses around the first turn, chased
at the middle of the main pack inside of TAP THE MOJO down the back straight, bid three wide into the far turn, led three wide past the three eighths, vied
outside of HALF OF MANHATTAN through midstretch, was headed by CLEAR N CONVINCING near the sixteenth and drifted out late. HALF OF
MANHATTAN tracked the leader two wide, bid on the pacesetter between horses around the far turn, vied in the leading flight in upper stretch, continued to
vie inside of DUCHOSSOIS to the sixteenth and flattened late. CHRISTIAN C settled near the rear, took closer order past the five eighths in tandem with
TALLESTOFTHETALL, trailed along the rail around the far turn, was taken five wide into upper stretch, and drifted slightly in while rallying under an all-out
drive. WILLING TO SPEED was asked for early speed inside, tracked the leader inside of HALF OF MANHATTAN through the clubhouse turn and down the
back straight, chased inside around the far turn, was in range inside into upper stretch, but flattened out from the three sixteenths. TALLESTOFTHETALL
settled at the rear, took closer order in tandem with CHRISTIAN C past the five eighths, was pushed along in the two path on the far turn, and lacked the
needed rally three wide in the lane. DOLLAR BLUE cleared to the lead, set the pace inside until he was engaged by DUCHOSSOIS and HALF OF
MANHATTAN into the far turn, was headed past the three eighths, vied inside of the new leaders into upper stretch, and weakened between horses from
the three sixteenths. BORA BORA settled at the rear of the main pack, gradually flattened down the back straight, raced in the three path near the rear on
the far turn, swung six wide into the lane and did not rally.
