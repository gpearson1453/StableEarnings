Footnotes
KEEP SCROLLING set a pressure pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, drew off slightly through the lane, then lasted under brisk handling. OLD
FORTY FIVE broke a step slowly from the gate, rated tracking the leader, raced boxed through the turn, waited, got through inside into the stretch, angled
out and lacked the needed late kick, while closing the gap on the winner. GOODTIME ARTIE mid pack and off the rail, angled to the two path saving ground
through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick while holding position. SHAENA BUE vied for the early lead on the outside,
bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. MULETRAIN rushed up outside in the early going, dropped back quickly saving some
ground through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. KOOSMAN never far back, lost some ground four wide through
the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain. NATHANIEL'S HOPE well placed and three while, held position through the turn, bid four wide
into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE CHATTER broke in bumping a rival at the start, straightened to track the pace pulling, drifted out slightly through the turn, bid three wide into
the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. TONIGHT MAYBE allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled out slightly in
the stretch and edged up to gain the place late. MIDNIGHT FROST pinched back at the start, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed late kick. TIDAL WATERS stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position and bid outside of that one into the lane,
gained a short lead, then weakened and held a share. SIDE ACTION allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and improved position. BELL THE CAT bumped at the start, ran evenly. COUPLE OF NIKKIS well placed and outside, held position three wide
through the turn, then had no stretch rally. RUNAWAY PHYLLIS set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final
furlong. TAILADIOS was never involved.
