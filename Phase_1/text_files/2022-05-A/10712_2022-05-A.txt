Footnotes
CHRIS AND DAVE prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide advancing to take command nearing the quarter pole, swung four to five wide
into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. GIOCARE chased two to three wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to just best DARK STORM for the place
honors. DARK STORM four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and offered up a mild kick.
KUMAR broke out at the start bumping CHRIS AND DAVE, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and weakened. AUBURN HILLS showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from CHRIS AND DAVE, came under coaxing just
off the inside at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside at that station, then weakened in the stretch. EASY
SHOT six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. LIAM'S FIRE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SWEET FRANNY LU saved ground around the opening bend, tugged at the bit under restraint onto and early on the backstretch, was reserved off the pace,
traveled four wide while confidently handled around the final turn, was asked turning into the stretch, rallied on the outside to get the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. SHE'S A MIA went around the first turn in the four path, was rated on the outside, came under urging
in the three path on the far turn, gained to take the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the place.
SOLIB bumped soundly with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe, dropped to the three path around the opening bend, moved up to take
the lead near the seven-eighths then went clear, controlled the action while inside around the final turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage to the runner-up in upper stretch and weakened while able to hold the show. KANNON FIRE dropped in towards the two path on the initial bend,
was reserved towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the three path, was roused five wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the three-sixteenths then
bothered a foe, was straightened by the rider then moved out into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. FREEDOM MACHINE was bumped in
the hindquarters at the start, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, was rated off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far turn and failed
to rally. INFRINGEMENT settled while saving ground, shifted three wide into the stretch, steadied between foes when KANNON FIRE came in outside the
furlong marker and failed to threaten. LADY THORNHILL went to the front while dropping to the inside, lost the lead early on the backstretch then tracked
the pace, raced in the two path around the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. TALES OF MAKENNA bumped hard with a
rival at the start and was off a step slow, went two to three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

HIGH TIDE broke at the back of the field, was rank under restraint at the rear while inside of IRWIN early on the backstretch, angled out with six furlongs to
run, advanced quickly on the outside, went past all the clutch and grabbers to his inside to take the lead outside the five-eighths then moved clear, went
around the turn in the two path, responded well when set down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop while drifting out some into the final
furlong, had the rider put the crop away outside the sixteenth-pole and maintained a save advantage under a strong hand-ride to the wire. IRWIN (IRE)
broke at the rear of the field, was keen under restraint early on the backstretch then carried out around the three-quarter pole before dropping back in, went
three then four wide around the far turn, was roused nearing the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch and finished with good courage to just get the
place. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, raced keen under stout restraint early on the backstretch, was
rated off the pace, went two wide for most of the turn then shifted three wide, was roused five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just
miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. BAY STREET MONEY was asked leaving the gate, went to the front then set the early pace in hand, lost
the lead outside the five-eighths then dropped back and tracked the pace, saved ground around the turn, was asked turning into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick then just missed the trifecta. THIN WHITE DUKE bobbled at the start, was rated on the outside, went four wide around the turn, was asked
near the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ALADO was hustled from the gate then taken in hand
early and rated just off the pace, saved ground through the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SUPPLY CHAIN was
asked from the gate then taken in hand early, stalked the pace down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths and failed to respond. KHAFRE was taken in hand then keen under hard restraint early on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the
turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
MEXICAN WONDER BOY was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch then was asked for his best around the three-sixteenths, responded well in the final furlong and held sway under steady urging. NEXT FLIGHT was
sent hard from the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, battled outside of the
winner in the drive and was outfinished but willingly earned the place. MR. PETE was well spotted just off the pace, moved from the two path to the four
path around the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, chased five wide into upper stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong and weakened but was
clear for the show. GET SET settled comfortably off the pace, was roused four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. BAD GUY was hustled from the start then ridden along at the rear on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two
path and failed to threaten.
