Footnotes
MOMMASGOTTARUN was away alertly to clear at once, remained on a clear lead while in the two path, was asked for more after straightening in the lane,
widened to the sixteenth pole then geared down to the wire. MI CRESCENDO chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was asked in late turn,
could not gain on the top one into the lane then kept on to finish well clear from the next rival. SIMPLY COMPLICATED chased the winner into the turn,
continued in the two path into the lane, lacked a closing response but stayed on enough to save the show spot. STRONG DEMAND stepped out at the start
and steadied, raced in the two path and never factored. FREE LOVE moved up along the inside into the turn, continued along the rail into the lane then
faded. KENDALL SPIRIT saved ground through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CASHABLE stalked the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane, caught the leader near the eighth pole, dueled with that one through the
final eighth and inched up late. PURR SEA set the pace on a clear lead into the lane, was joined by CASHABLE outside the eighth pole, dueled with that
one through the final eighth and was just denied in a game effort. MISS BETTE LUTE was in the three path while unhurried through the turn, came into the
five path for the drive, was gaining on the top three in deep stretch when angling in and was up for the show spot. LOFTHOUSE chased the pace from the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, took aim on the dueling leaders, had every opportunity to go past in deep stretch but hung
in the critical stages. VOODOO JUSTICE was along the inside into the lane and was done nearing the three-sixteenth.

Footnotes
DIAMOND LYDIAMARIE pressed the pacesetter two wide through late turn, moved to bid for the lead into the lane, edged to the lead outside the eighth
pole then slowly widened to the end while being kept to the task. NINJA KITTEN set the pace while under pressure into the turn, vied for the lead into the
lane, could not keep up with the winner but kept on well to be clearly second best. SWEET GINGER chased the pace while in the two path through mid-turn,
dropped closer to the inside into the lane then chased the top two home while not a threat. DEEP DISH close up early, settled back off the pacesetters
through the turn while moving from the three to the two path, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing bid. JERSEY GOLD settled off the
pace into the turn then settled back and never was a factor. POLYESTER BRIDE was along the inside through the turn and never factored. BEIRUT
BEAUTY raced in the four path through the turn when a contender, swung into the lane from the five path and weakened in the drive. SWEET TOOTSIE LU
was in the two or three path through the turn when trailing, came into the lane from the four or five path then angled out to the seven path when closing in on
the pack of beatens.

Footnotes
EVIL EYE pressed the pace while in the three path into the backstretch, gained the lead before a half, continued on a clear lead through mid-turn, was
challenged into the lane, dueled, lost lead just outside the eighth pole then came again to inch up late in a very game effort. UNDERDRESSED chased the
pace from the three path through mid-turn, moved up into the lane, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole then could not maintain the advantage while
floating in the winner late. FLY NIGHTLY saved ground through the turns, came into the lane from the two path with aim on the top two then could only offer
a mild bid while ending up in the four path. COUNTER OFFER was in the two path throughout and offered a mild gain. TIZ OUR TURN set the pace into the
backstretch, pressed the winner into the far turn, chased the top into the lane then weakened. UNBRIDLED BEAST was never a factor while along the
inside. ESKENFORIT was in the three path through the far turn and tired. Upon receipt of a ruling (IG-2022-2691), dated 6/13/22, from the Indiana Horse
Racing Commission, Evil Eye was disqualified and placed last due to a positive test. The purse was redistributed.

Footnotes
BELLA BOLLE dueled inside of a foe, was clear late, then lasted under mild urging. STARLET EXPRESS was shuffled back early, raced in the three path,
angled five wide in the stretch, rallied and missed. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE dueled outside of the winner before giving way at the sixteenth. HOOSIER
PREMIUM raced in the two path but had no closing move. NO MORE FAKE NEWS was off awkwardly and unrushed early, then had a mild late bid outside
to finish on even terms with EXPRESS LADY who raced in the five path with no bid. VENTANA DANNA raced in the four path, then faded in the stretch.
URNOTTHEBOSSOFME stalked in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then faded in the stretch. BERTIE THE BEAUTY pressed the pace inside,
then faded on the turn.
