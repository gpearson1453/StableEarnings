the place spot while weary. KILLER BEE was unhurried while in the two path into the lane then showed energy late. INHERENT POWERS was off to an
awkward start, moved up to chase the pace from along the inside into the lane then tired. SCHENECTADY STAR was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
FIRING RANGE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, was asked for more in nearing the five-sixteenths pole, cleared before the quarter pole,
widened to the eighth pole then was under a hand drive the last sixteenth to hold. PALMER'S PASS was in the four path into the far turn, asked in mid-turn,
gained from the three path, lost ground into the lane when straightening then settled for second best while finishing in the six path. ONE FOR THE MONEY
raced in the back while near the rail into the turn, came off the rail and into the three path entering the lane, came into the lane from the five path and was
never a threat. JUST PHIL set the pace while under pressure from two others into the far turn, was challenged after mid-turn then gave way. WHITE
SILVER SANDS stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn then was finished before entering the lane. TUCKER'S STAR tracked the pace while
along the inside and was done in late turn.

Footnotes
BABY VINCENT chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then
drew off through the final eighth. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE tracked the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane then kept on well to be up for
the place spot. BINGE set the pace through the turn while on a clear lead, gave way to the winner after straightening in the lane then lasted for the show
spot. VENICE BEACH raced in the four path through the turn while in mid-pack, came into the lane from the six path and finished evenly. GO RODNEY was
in the three path through the turn and into the lane and moved up while not a threat. PRINCE ACT in the four path through the turn while chasing the pace,
came into the lane from the three path with aim on the leaders then tired. RED LIAISON never a factor while in the two path through the turn. CAN'T SAY
ELLY MAE saved ground into the lane and lacked a response.

Footnotes
BOULDER BAY tracked the pace while along the inside, came off the inside in late turn, came into the lane from the three path and rallied while drifting in a
path and outfinished the runner-up. BONNE CHERE unhurried while in the two path through the turn, gained momentum into the lane, had a clear track and
aim on the leader as that one drifted out, was joined by the winner outside the eighth pole and rallied with that one while being outfinsihed. CONSIDER was
unhurried while near the rail into the far turn, was steadied nearing the quarter pole when gaining momentum, regained energy after straightening in the lane
and was up for the minor share. SOCKET stalked the lead down the backstretch while in the three path, bid into the turn to gain the lead, widened through
the turn and into the lane while drifting into the six path, continued with a large lead with an eighth to go then faltered through the final sixteenth. SMOOTH
TALKING MAN was in the three or four path through the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a closing bid. AIR PAYNTER was never a factor while
off the inside. JUSTICETHEBEAST chased the pace from the three path into the far turn and was done nearing the quarter pole. JEOPARDY THEORY set
the pace along the inside into mid-turn then gave way once passed in mid-turn.

LATIGO vied along the inside of two others through the turn, was joined by runner-up after straightening into the lane, kept that one at bay to near the
sixteenth pole then cleared and widened late. CHARLIE TWO SOX pressed the pace three wide and in the four path through the turn, got closest to the
winner straightening in the lane then could not get past that one while saving the place spot. BLAZEN JUSTICE was in the two or three path through the
turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path, chased the top two down the lane and showed late energy to be closing in on the place
spot. GIMMEFUELGIMMEFIRE raced close up early when in tight and steadied turning into the turn, chased the pace along the inside and never was a
serious threat. PARTY BOY FLOYD was in a bit tight at the start, saved ground through the turn and moved up while not a menace. SPOKE vied for the
lead from between top two then faded through the lane. EVEN MONEY was in the three or four path through the turn and lacked a response.

Footnotes
OVERTHOUGHT chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, asked nearing the five-sixteenths pole, engaged with the leader outside the
eighth pole then edged away through the final sixteenth. DANNY'S LIL DANA set the pace from the two path into the far turn, was challenged through
mid-turn, continued with a short lead into the lane then could not keep up with the winner through the final sixteenth. GALLANT DUDE pressed the pace
while two wide into the turn, was still a serious contender in late turn then weakened through the lane while saving the show spot. FIFTY TWO PICKUP was
in the two path through the far turn and lacked a closing response. MECHANICVILLE was in the two or three path through the turn and never was a serious
threat. SANGFROID steadily faded while saving ground. FIRST CROWNED done after half while saving ground, dropped far back and was eventually
pulled up near the three-sixteenths pole and walked off.
