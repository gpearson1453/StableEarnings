Footnotes
ROUSING JEWEL was away sharply and was hustled to the front, set solid fractions through the turn while extending the lead and drew clear in the stretch
in a good debut. PASSARANDO tracked his stablemate through the opening fractions, was two wide into the turn and slipped to the inside for the drive, was
no match for the winner in the final stages but was well clear of the rest for second. RAVENCOIN chased the pace from the inside, angled out to the two
path for the drive, was outkicked in the stretch by the top pair but was clear for third. DOGE OF VENICE was away a bit slowly, chased the pace two wide
on the turn and did not muster a late rally. SMOKEM O'NEIL chased the pace from the inside and weakened in the drive. WOLF'S LIFE broke in at the start
and was off slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, trailed to the quarter marker and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
ROBIE was three wide while up close into the first turn, attended to the solid fractions through the backstretch run, was roused leaving the three furlong
marker and overtook the pacesetter, extended the lead in upper stretch, ducked in a bit in the late stages and pulled away in the end.
THEULTIMATEPRAISE settled off of the early pace, was unhurried through the backstretch run, was roused three wide on the far turn, swung widest into
the drive, closed with good late interest and could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. DADDYS SPECIALDARK was shuffled back at
the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried while saving ground through the backstretch run, advanced in upper stretch and was outfinished in the
final furlong while getting up in time to secure third. SAFE COMBINATION was forwardly placed on the first turn while four wide, stalked the pace to the
second turn, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker but could not go on with that run into the drive and faltered in the late stages.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS was up close on the run into the first turn, took back off of the pace while two wide through the backstretch run, lost ground on the
second turn and did not mount a late rally. OMMANEY BAY was a bit fractious in the gate, was away in good order and was hustled to the front early on, set
solid fractions while being prompted through the second turn by the winner, was overtaken by ROBIE leaving the three furlong marker and faded in the late
stages.

furlong marker, lacked room in upper stretch, could not sustain that bid in the drive and tired in the late going. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ broke alertly and was sent
to the front, set solid fractions while being prompted to the half-mile marker, ceded the lead nearing the quarter marker and faded in the drive.

MEET THE SHERIFF chased the early pace, steadied a bit in tight quarters midway through the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, overtook the
QUANTUM QUEST leaving the furlong pole and responded well in the end to kick clear. BOBBY'S ALIBI lacked early speed, was coaxed along on the turn
while two then three wide, rallied inside of the furlong grounds, shifted out nearing the sixteenth marker and closed well in the end to secure second.
SHOULD BE ILLEGAL tracked the quick pace four wide through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the late stages while holding on
for third in the end. QUANTUM QUEST broke alertly and was sent to the front, was engaged by GREAT STORY and dueled with that foe to the turn, shook
clear of that one nearing the quarter marker, inched clear into the drive, could not hold off the winner's bid leaving the furlong marker and was outfinished in
the end, while just being edged for the show. TIZ VICIOUS was off a bit slowly, lacked early speed while at the rear, saved ground into the drive and did not
mount a late rally. GREAT STORY was off a step slowly and was hustled into early contention, dueled on the front end with QUANTUM QUEST into the
turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded in the late going.

STAY LIT was three wide on the first turn while just off of the pace, advanced three wide on the second turn, was put to firm urging in upper stretch,
confronted CHARLIE THE GENT leaving the furlong marker, brushed with that foe nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. CHARLIE THE
GENT was away in good order and was sent to the front, set modest fractions through the first half mile, kept on into upper stretch, came under pressure
from the winner leaving the furlong marker, brushed with STAY LIT nearing the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in the final stages, while clear for second.
TRIBUTE TO AFLEET was three wide on the first turn while stalking the pace, maintained position through the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch
but was well clear of the rest for the show. SIERRA SNOW STORM settled just off of the pace while saving ground early on, lost ground three wide on the
far turn and did not mount a late rally. TAP UNION was forwardly placed in the early stages, lost ground two wide on the second turn and gave way in the

SYNC settled two wide off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, continued that bid three wide on the second turn to catch LYING GHOST,
shook clear of that foe nearing the eighth pole and pulled away late. LYING GHOST broke alertly and was hustled to the front, set solid fractions while being
prompted to the second turn, was collared by the winner nearing the quarter marker, battled against that bid but could not hold off SYNC in mid stretch and
kept on to gamely earn the nod for second. DIMMI QUANDO saved ground while stalking the solid pace, advanced on the second turn, was outkicked in the
drive and was edged for second in the late stages. STARRY SIERRA was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, saved all of the ground to the second
turn and did not offer a bid in the stretch. DIAMOND WILLOW settled off of the early pace, was steered four wide for the turn on the second turn and lacked
a late response. KEEP ON DANZING was prominent early on, prompted the solid pace through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and
faded in the late going.

Footnotes
KODIACTION settled just off of the solid early pace while in midflight, slipped to the inside for the run onto the second turn, advanced along the inside
nearing the top of the lane, overtook the tiring pacesetter, edged to a narrow lead approaching the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. MOUNT
PELLIAR was crowded at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled two to three wide on the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, continued that
rally on the second turn while four wide, briefly vied for the lead in upper stretch but was outfinished in the end by the winner, while well clear of the rest for
second. LIL MIRACLE MAN was three wide on the first turn while stalking the early pace, maintained that path through the backstretch run and into the
second turn, steadied at the top of the stretch in tight quarters, was outkicked in the drive but kept on to be clear for third in the end. TRIBAL NATION was
sent after an alert beginning and set the quick early pace, was rank on the first turn and drifted four wide before recovering to go two wide into the
backstretch and kept on with solid fractions, was clear into the second turn but was quickly overtaken by the winner heading into the drive and tired in the
late going. LESSONS OF AUTISM settled three wide off of the early pace, shifted to the two path into the second turn and did not offer a late bid. HARBOR
SKY was crowded at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the pace while saving ground and lacked a late response. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD stalked
the early pace from the inside, lost ground along the backstretch run, dropped back along the second turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
BECCA TAYLOR was off a half step slowly but was sent in hand to the early lead, was engaged by LAGATHA soon after the break and dueled that one for
pace duties to the turn, kept up that battle through the turn and into the stretch, was able to hold the game runner-up at bay through the lane and edged
clear in the end. LAGATHA was hustled leaving the break and engaged BECCA TAYLOR on the front end, dueled for pace duties with that rival through the
turn, battled on against the winner in upper stretch and grudgingly gave way in the final stages, while besting the rest. MY LEGAL BET ducked in leaving the
chute soon after the break and was away a bit slowly, chased the quick pace three wide through the turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive but
came on in the late stages to be clear for third. DAMN THE TORPEDOES chased the early pace to the turn, was floated five wide nearing the half-mile pole,
slipped to the inside for the run along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. EMMA'S DANCE chased the pace three deep to the turn,
lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the drive. CANAM GAL was a bit slow into stride, was void of early speed and lacked a late bid. LA AGUILILLA
chased the quick early pace four wide, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. DANIELA BELLA was a bit fractious in the gate and
was away slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a factor.

MIRACLE IN MOTION pressed the early pace to the turn, advanced on the pacesetter and took command nearing the quarter marker, opened a clear lead
in upper stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up in the final sixteenth but held safely in the end to prevail. MS MOAB was away a step slowly but
recovered well to track the early pace, was shuffled nearing the quarter marker and lost position while two wide, dove inside for the drive, was in tight
nearing the sixteenth pole while skimming the rail and got up for second in the end in a good effort. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY chased the pace two wide
between runners, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the late going, while clear for third. DANGEROUS ILLUSION chased the pace three
wide between foes on the turn, advanced to come within aim in upper stretch but could not go on with that bid and weakened in the drive. CIRCLE OF
ROYALTY was a bit slow into stride early on and was void of early speed, was steered three wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked a late response.
BABTISTE LASALLE was under a tight early hold while keen in the early going, chased the pace four wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired
in the final stages. DEAREST BARBARA was a bit hard to load into the gate, was away in good order and was sent to the front, set the contested early pace
to the turn, was overtaken by the winner nearing the quarter marker and faded through the stretch run.
