Footnotes
KELL'S KISS angled in heading into the first turn, saved ground under light rating tactics content to track, came out four wide past the three-sixteenths, took
aim and drove past. INDIAN AFFAIR attended the pace from outside four wide, bid three wide heading into the far turn, moved clear turning into upper
stretch but was outkicked. JASMINE WHO stalked three wide, had no late kick. CURL raced outside foes four to five wide and had no late bid. LOOKOUT
FOR LANDRY set the pace racing just off the rail into the first turn, was challenged up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn but weakened when
headed. UNDER RAPPES went three wide on both turns and was encouraged along into the far bend but did not produce a rally. TRAVELIN LADY altered
course and veered at the five-eighths, moved back in to be two wide passing rivals on the far turn but was never near enough to threaten. LOADED GUN
broke a step slowly and moved out, went three wide into the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, was inside on the far turn and failed to menace.
MISSY MIA broke awkwardly, raced near inside early, three to four wide on the far turn and was never a threat. AXIS CHARM was forwardly placed
three-wide, appeared to take a bad step and pulled up near the five-sixteenths, was vanned off.

Footnotes
ATHENA'S STORM tracked the leaders, saved ground on the turn and bid inside, held well. IM COMING OVER set the early pace, drifted three wide on the
turn, was a game second but no match for the winner. CAUGHT STEALING raced mid-pack, went four wide on the turn, ran along for show honors.
AWESOME GALAXY was urged at the break, chased three then two wide, ran on evenly. SHADOW JUMPER went three to four wide on the turn and
improved position in the stretch. JASMINE BABY shifted out five wide late on the turn and failed to menace. TEF'S LITTLE CAT shifted in trailing the field,
saved ground on the turn. DAZZLING MIST chased briefly, dropped back three wide on the turn and continued to weaken. DESERT BEAUTY failed to
threaten after going three wide on the turn. FEEL THIS MOMENT was fractious in the gate, hopped at the start and spotted the field a couple lengths, went
two wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DISCREET TIGER was forced outwardly four wide into the first turn, stalked the leaders, made a three then two wide bid leaving the far turn and moved
clear then just held. HARROVIAN set the pace inside, was headed late on the turn but kept on gamely. FLICKERING LIGHT stalked two wide early, went
three to four wide on the far turn and was gaining. THIRSTY JUNIOR raced off the fence into the first turn, tracked two wide before moving out three deep
on the far turn, ran on evenly. GORKY PARK was in tight and forced out past the five and one-half into the first turn going six wide before moving back in
four deep, went four to five wide on the far turn. DIRT ROAD RED broke just a step slowly, shifted in heading to the first turn, advanced inside up the
backstretch, could not sustain the effort and evened out. NORTHERN QUEST altered out five deep into the first turn before coming back in, raced at the
back two to three wide and did not threaten. DESERT DANGER was forced seven wide into the first turn when rivals came out, moved in a bit but still raced
outside five to six deep on the far turn and failed to rally. ARIMONY was in tight three wide into the first turn, shifted in and was not a factor. FOLLOWING
AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF FLICKERING LIGHT AGAINST DISCREET TIGER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RANEEM shifted in two deep into the first turn, moved two then three wide on the far turn to engage the leader, dueled then edged clear. CITYONTHENILE
set the early pace two wide, dueled with an inside foe then was engaged by an outside rival turning for home, dueled but yielded grudgingly. MISS MELODY
pressed from inside and lacked the required late kick. DIRT FLIRT bobbled ever so slightly and brushed with a foe at the start, went three wide through the
first turn, was content to race last but one up the backstretch, advanced two wide on the far turn coming out at the top of the stretch and improved position.
TYLER'S DREAM was up close but mid-pack racing four wide, steadily weakened. CLEOPATRAS CHARGE exchanged a very light brush at the start,
settled at the rear in the two path, went four wide on the far turn. BYE BYE JILL stalked three wide, faltered and faded.

NO PASA NADA was up close early four wide, shifted in a bit up the backstretch, advanced inside rivals moving out about three wide late on the far turn,
drove past. SHINING SOURCE saved ground early, tipped out heading up the backstretch, advanced outside rivals swinging six wide on the far turn and
gained late. TUCUM set the pace racing off the two path facing some pressure throughout, weakened. DIABOLICAL RULER shifted in early racing two
wide, went evenly. SEA EMPEROR was brushed entering the first turn, raced mostly four to five wide, flattened out. IZERIGHT was mid-pack three wide
early, dropped back and tired. JET N G was reserved early while switching off the inside, raced mostly three to five wide taking closer order on the far turn
but flattened out. DELBERT TOO was four wide early, was forced out a bit into the first turn and lightly brushed a rival, raced up close to the far turn and
came up empty. CHEESE TRAY saved ground, faced some traffic early up the backstretch, failed to menace. ALL CHROME shifted in two wide early and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
THATGIRL'SONFIRE set the pace inside, drifted out a bit past the three-sixteenths, was headed near the sixteenth pole but dug in gamely to surge and
prevail. MARQUIS LIGHTS stalked the winner two to three wide, bid and took a narrow and brief lead about the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. FOXY
RED tucked in behind rivals into the first turn going two to three wide, continued two to three wide throughout and was no match for the top pair but best of
the rest. RIGHT FOR YOU shifted in two wide early, moved out three to four wide racing mid-pack on the far turn, needed more. DOM PROUD settled off
the early leaders shifting in to save ground, improved position. PASSION BELLE angled in early saving ground on the first turn, was mid-pack two to three
wide on the far turn but failed to rally. CAROLS BOUTIQUE went three to four wide early racing well back and was never a factor. DIXIE JEN broke a bit
awkwardly spotting the field about three lengths or so, raced off the inside into the first turn, was never a threat. SUERTUDA stalked three to four wide,
faltered and faded. MISS ABILITY was outrun.
