five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, rallied inside the final furlong taking command in the last jumps to the finish to prevail. ALITE
bumped at the start by the the aforementioned foe and MAD DOCTOR, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five
wide for home, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in and was caught in the final strides to the finish. TUESDAY'S CHILD prompted the pace three
then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, took over command nearing the quarter pole, and spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was displaced nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. PLATINUM ROAD showed the way in hand just off the inside under some
pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front inside
that station, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. DISENGAGE chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. MAD DOCTOR broke in at the start bumping ALITE, chased two to three wide until tucked inside
into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. MARSHAL DILLON coaxed from the start, chased

Footnotes
LIFE CHANGER showed speed then chased the pace on the outside, inched closer late on the backstretch, vied in the four path around the turn, took the
lead near the five-sixteenths, drifted in under a right-handed crop while shaking clear into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and drew away under steady urging. TOP OF THE MINT bumped lightly with a foe while off a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged
along in the five path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. DAUFUSKIE
ISLAND bumped lightly with an opponent at the start then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path around the turn,
took the advantage at the three-eighths, lost the lead to the winner before the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was
clear for the show. CENTAVO was hard ridden early while off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. STORM
SHOOTER brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled, moved up to set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage at the three-eighths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. FORTY COMETS brushed with a rival at the start, settled under some coaxing,
saved ground while put to stronger encouragement around the turn, came a bit off the rail into upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SAFE CONDUCT coaxed from the gate, established the front into the backstretch and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from
FORTY UNDER to the outside while widening away as a pair from the rest of the field, remained along the inside patiently handled through the far turn and
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive, dug in and held well to prevail. FORTY
UNDER coaxed from the start, led early on until displaced from the front into the backstretch by the aforementioned foe, tipped to the two path and
prompted that rival from the outside widening away in tandem from the rest of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun two to three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to chase the winner home just holding for the place honors. IT'S A GAMBLE chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. KINENOS chased along the inside from the tail of the
field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share.
DEVAMANI (FR) just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. SIFTING SANDS (GB) just off the inside tracking from the front from mid pack, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked to the finish.

Footnotes
TALE OF MINESHAFT dropped back between horses early then settled off the pace, tracked four wide around the turn, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, gained to take the lead under a drive in upper stretch, drifted in while inching clear outside the furlong marker and proved best under steady
urging. BRUNATE bumped soundly with a foe at the start then bobbled, recovered to press the pace loosely between horses, vied in the two path while
between rivals on the turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while just able to
get the place. IRISH GIANT broke a bit slow then bobbled and dropped back, settled at the rear, went two to three wide around the turn, came four wide into
the stretch, lugged in some while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead around the sixteenth-pole and finished
willingly to just miss the place but was well clear for the show. TRUEBELIEVE was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied
along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole and tired. DOUBLEPOUR bumped
soundly with an opponent at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path around the turn and came up empty. QUINTARELLI
chased the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
BALTASAR tracked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path around the turn, gained the advantage while put to a
drive in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up inside the furlong marker and edged clear under strong urging. CAPONE was hustled to the front, showed
the way down the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, lost the advantage to the winner while under a drive in upper stretch, fought with that foe into the
final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. SHREVEPORT settled on the far outside, was roused four wide on the turn and lacked the
needed response while able to get the show. SUKOON was taken in hand while crowded briefly early then moved out, raced well off the pace under urging,
traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. BREAKWATER was well placed just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path,
shifted four wide at the quarter-pole and came up empty. MUGGED broke a step slow, was ridden along near the back on the outside, rounded the turn in
the three path and never reached contention. SHARPOON broke in at the start, was ridden along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor.

Footnotes
BRATTLE HOUSE broke very fast then was taken under restraint while in front, showed the way in hand, vied inside to the two path around the turn, kicked
clear when set down into upper stretch and powered away under a strong hand-ride to prove much the best. OK HONEY settled on the outside, was asked
four wide on the turn, chased the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. WITCH HUNTER broke in and brushed with a foe,
stalked the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, made a very brief bid near the quarter-pole then weakened but was well clear
for the show. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA angled in at the rear of the field while taken under a strong hold, was reserved at the back under restraint, came
under urging while saving ground around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. A BIT O'IRISH SASS was rated just off the pace on the
inside, saved ground while asked on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered. PAY GRADE brushed with a rival at the start, tracked the pace
down the backstretch, chased in the two path early on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and retreated.

to engage the leader through the final furlong dueling through to the finish and just got the bob on the wire. QUALITY G coaxed from the gate, tracked the
pace maker in closest aim just off the inside, advanced on that rival patiently handled and took over narrow command near the quarter pole and was set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside and dueled inside the eighth pole to the finish and was nailed by the
nod of the head on the line. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE tracked along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. MACKILLOP broke in at the start forcing
