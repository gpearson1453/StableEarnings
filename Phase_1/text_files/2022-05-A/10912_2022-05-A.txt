Footnotes
SHAWK'S LIL AVA raced off the rail, off the pace, rallied three wide into the lane, took over at the furlong marker and drew clear under urging. SWIFTY
DAWN was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, then between rivals, rallied outside in the lane and was along for the place spot. DEDE'S TRICK
vied between rivals for the early lead, chased on the turn, dug in on the rail in the stretch and lost second. GOSPEL JOSY JAN vied three wide for the lead,
chased between rivals on the turn and weakened. RIVER BISCUIT was bumped at the start, vied inside for the lead, chased inside on the turn and tired.
SAVE A PENNY vied four wide for the early lead, shook free nearing the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and faded. EXQUISITA was reluctant to load
and outrun.
