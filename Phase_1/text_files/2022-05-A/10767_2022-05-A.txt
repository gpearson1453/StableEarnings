CRAFTY CHIEF broke in full stride to set all the pace, drifted past mid track entering the stretch and prevailed under right handed urging. WEST LEONARD
unhurried early, closed fast in the middle of the racetrack and finished second best. THE MAN CAN never far back, finished with good courage along the
inside. MUSTANG WILLIE unhurried early, closed a gap late three wide. IRON MEN OF METZ pressured the winner along the inside into the turn, shifted
outside that one, swung widest then faded late. GRAND STRATEGY stalked the pace three wide and failed to respond. KOLE MAN CAN steadied at the
start and was no factor. SKYTOWN CAT was through early.

OHIO PLAYER broke outward bumping BLUE MONARCH, sped to the lead, set all the pace, drifted out past mid track and prevailed under mild urging.
PLATE IT UP pressured the winner into the stretch, swung wide, the rider lost his whip near the furlong marker and finished second best while out past the
middle of the racetrack. MOBIL AT LAST trailed through the turn, was carried out past the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, angled inward late
and closed some ground. BLUE MONARCH was bumped at the start, swung out past the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, also angled inward
then went evenly. SPLIT MY BRITCHES failed to menace. POWERS OUT stalked the early pace along the inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
PULPIT'S PURRFECT prompted the pace two wide for a quarter, dropped back, came in again with a burst of speed through the five furlong in the five path
and got up in the final strides. SENORA ROMA sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace while getting quick fractions, widened into the stretch,
drifted from the rail to the four path when struck with a left handed whip then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. TEMPLEMENT unhurried early,
swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. SHE'S PURE SILVER unhurried early, moved up three wide into the stretch then leveled off.
PASSIONFORTREASURE well placed, failed to respond. SIERRA DIAMOND failed to menace. TOTALLY OBSESSED stalked the early pace along the
inside and was through after a half. MISS OXBOW was outrun. HEART FULL OF SOUL was no factor.

Footnotes
DIRECT DECEIT sped up the inside to gain a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured rapid pace, shook clear in upper stretch and prevailed under
strong handling. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN unhurried early, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. MOBIL
SOLUTION allowed to settle, closed a gap late three wide. OHIO EAGLE bumped at the start, was unhurried then found his best stride late five wide. FIRST
SONG well placed inside, angled out to the six path entering the stretch then needed more. SWEET LEMON DROP was bumped then squeezed between
rivals at the start then failed to reach contention. MIDNIGHT MIKEY contested the early lead three wide, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then faded.
PLAY BALL battled for the early lead between horses two wide then weakened in the stretch. MISTER MOBIL also bumped and in tight at the start, was
never a threat. ROSCO P. COLTRANE also bumped between rivals then squeezed at the start, failed to menace.
