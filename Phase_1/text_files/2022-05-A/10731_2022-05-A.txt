Footnotes
PEACEFUL WAY broke readily, prompted a rival's pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, moved to wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch,
edged forward in late stages and gained a clear advantage in time under pressure. TRUE ATKA angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders on the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and advanced inside rivals to narrowly prevail for the place honors. SUSIKIN was urged to a clear advantage
dictating the pace off the rail on the backstretch, dueled for command on the turn to midstretch and weakened in late stages. U KNOW I B LION broke
awkwardly losing position to the field, switched out three wide on the backstretch while being prompted in pursuit of the leaders but faded in the drive.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
FELIX THE FOX, reserved out of close quarters while switched off the inside in early stages, tracked the leaders off the second flight racing to the turn,
angled to the rail entering upper stretch when presented an opening, then came through inside foes to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under some
right handed encouragement. CHROME FINISH, urged between foes, then inside a rival disputing the pace into the turn, pressed the issue between foes
past midstretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. TEDDY'S HONOR joined the pace three deep in the opening stages,
pressed the pace outside a rival through the turn to upper stretch, continued three deep past midstretch but yielded late. EXCELLENT MARK, forwardly
placed along the inside in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight into the turn, tipped out to race three wide between foes into upper stretch but had
no closing bid. LIL BULL angled to the inside early and soon dropped out. STAYIN OR STRAYIN tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening
stages, was caught four wide racing into the bend and gave way.

Footnotes
BOURBON BROWN was urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset to the backstretch, edged clear leaving the far turn while shifting out and
just held MISTER FERNANDO on a diminishing margin to the end under firm encouragement. The latter tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight,
tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap nearing the wire. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked off the second flight outside a
rival to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the lane gaining on the top pair, shifted inwards under pressure midstretch but had no final kick. MAGIC
BOMB settled inside foes racing to the backstretch, switched off the rail racing through the far turn and continued with interest to gain between foes late.
WICKED MOMENT angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, saved ground to the stretch but offered no rally. PRAKRITI settled last to the
backstretch, swung out four wide nearing the lane but offered no closing bid. JOHNNIE GOT JETS, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace
from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. RAGING WHIRLWIND settled between foes early and failed to menace. AGENT MULGANNON
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never proved a factor. MOSES BY A NOSES, restless prior to loading, was prompted in brief pursuit of the
leaders three wide to the backstretch and gave out after a half.

RULING FRONT was urged between foes, then inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, shook clear leaving the midway point
of the bend, tipped to three path entering the stretch, widened under pressure and was taken in hand approaching the wire. BOCA GUY was reserved last
on the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing the lane and edged a rival for the place honors in late stages. RASMALAI was urged to terms with the
pacesetter four wide between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing that rival into the turn and came up empty midstretch. MONEY SONG,
forwardly placed five wide in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn but had no closing bid. JACKS WILLIE made brief pursuit of the leaders
between foes on the backstretch but faded early. ALMONASTER was urged inside foes in the opening furlong but retreated early.

CHARGE IT JENN was rated stalking off the first flight to the backstretch, advanced three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge, shifted inwards once
gaining the advantage and held NOBLE INTENTIONS safe to the end under firm handling. The latter, reserved while guided to the inside, saved ground to
the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. AFFICIONADO (FR) was urged forcing the pace outside
a rival leaving the chute, angled to the rail once dispatching a rival into the backstretch, dueled for command through the far turn to upper stretch but
weakened inside the top pair late. GO YEOWOMEN, forwardly placed just outside the leaders racing to the first turn, moved to press the pace after a half,
dueled for command through the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. PLATINUMCENTS angled to the rail leaving the chute while being urged to
prompt the pace inside a rival, eased off the leaders tracking those rivals along the inside saving ground throughout but lacked the needed final bid.
SIMONELA, held up along the inside in early stages, saved ground to the stretch and passed inside some tiring rivals. NO SNIVELING tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally. AUBURN tracked off the second flight inside rivals to the backstretch and retreated after
a half. PLAY THAT TONE proved no factor. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE switched out of tight quarters at the start, then raced outside foes to the backstretch and
failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF GO YEOWOMEN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE
STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
HEAVY WEIGHT was urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, turned back a rival's
challenge while drifting well out in upper stretch, swerved inwards under pressure while being roused to resist the bid of TAPINTOYOURBEER bumping that
rival soundly near the sixteenth marker and just prevailed under brisk handling. The latter tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, steadily
advanced on the leader three deep between foes entering the stretch to bid for command inside that foe, was bumped soundly while knocked off stride
racing past the sixteenth marker and was just outfinished. ARIES REIGNS was settled racing to the backstretch while dropping out last, split foes on the far
turn gathering momentum, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. TELECAST tracked off the
first flight inside foes, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final bid. GOLDEN WONDER broke slowly, raced wide to
the backstretch and proved no threat. WOOTDAREITIS, urged prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF TAPINTOYOURBEER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF HEAVY WEIGHT WHILE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED HEAVY WEIGHT
FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
OUR STUIE angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, was prompted to
advance along the rail nearing upper stretch, came through inside foes when presented an opening to challenge for command and wrested a narrow
advantage in time under firm handling. BARAHIN, bumped at the start, was rated between foes off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance three wide on the far turn, angled out four wide racing through the stretch and continued willingly to challenge the winner nearing the wire.
GUNMAN, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge while shifting out
in upper stretch and yielded between the top pair late. SHED A TEAR, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter in early stages, advanced to
press the issue on the far turn and flattened out in the drive. MONETIZED tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, shifted out three wide after a half
while being prompted to maintain contention but steadily faded between foes nearing the lane. MY WAY OR NO WAY tracked off the second flight inside
foes to the backstretch and offered no rally. SWIFT KID, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, never gained contention. ASSERT DOMINANCE
broke inwards making light contact with BARAHIM, was settled last to the backstretch and proved no factor. PRETTY DUDE drifted out racing through the
first turn quickly losing contact with the field, was pulled up after a half, then was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
LADY FRIJOLES broke sharply, sprinted clear of the field remaining a bit off the rail to the turn, was prompted to widen her margin entering upper stretch,
then forged well clear late under brisk handling. WINDY REIGN tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn, shifted
inwards nearing the stretch and proved best of the others. AMOR Y CONTROL, bumped at the start, switched out five wide on the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide in second flight racing through the turn and finished evenly in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. LYLA'S MARK
settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight racing to the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and made an effort to improve position.
DIAMONDS FOR LILY tracked the pacesetter between foes just off the inside racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. LIL GRACE broke
outwards bumping AMOR Y CONTROL, was righted to track the leader between foes in second flight racing into the turn while making a brief advance but
gave way abruptly in upper stretch. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL tracked the pacesetter inside foes in the opening quarter but retreated early. J J MONET was
off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KATIES A LADY, pulling a bit against light restraint along the inside prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue racing into the far turn, drifted out entering
upper stretch carrying out BLUE NEITH but continued gamely between foes to prevail under pressure. BLUE NEITH was urged prompting the pace outside
a rival in the opening half, dueled for command into the far turn, was carried to the three path in upper stretch but continued with a grudging effort to just
miss. CAIRA tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing to the backstretch, tipped a bit off the rail to bid inside the top pair in upper stretch but was
outkicked. TREASURE TAILS, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, swung out six wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve
position. HUNTRESS MOON tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide in upper stretch but had no closing bid.
IRAZU angled inwards to track just off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and continued evenly to late stages. TWELVE RED ROSES was
rated near the inside in early stages, saved ground on the far turn while being prompted to advance but came up empty in the drive. BEAUTY GENIUS
tracked the leaders outside foes behind the second flight to the backstretch and faded early. LHEEAS JOY stumbled, then was bumped at the start, then
was soon outdistanced.
