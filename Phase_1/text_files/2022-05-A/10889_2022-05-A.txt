VON DOM away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the backstretch, continued to battle through the final turn from the
inside of SEA CADET, got the better of that rival entering the lane, and inched clear late. SEA CADET away well and pressed the pace from the outside of
VON DOM entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and through the final turn, struggled
to match strides with the winner entering the lane, but battled gamely two out from the rail in the lane to prove second best. EYE BE SEEING YOU tracked
the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the
stretch, and closed evenly to garner a share. CERTIFIABLE broke sharply and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside,
pulled his way up into a tracking trip in the run to the final turn, continued to save ground through the turn, but needed more while finishing from along the
rail in the drive. THE VALENTINE KID trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide through the final turn, and
finished evenly in the lane.

pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival entering he lane, and pulled clear
late while drifting out approaching the wire. FOOT SOLDIER away alertly and pressed the pace while racing to the outside of LUCKY LUKE entering the first
turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his
pace rival late, but battled gamely three wide in the drive to prove second best. MR. QUALITY stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch
while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing three wide in the drive.
KNOPFLER settled well off the early pace while racing four wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two out from the rail entering the final turn,
but needed more late while finishing four wide in the drive. WE'RE IN COMMAND broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact.

JUVEE TOO away well, and chased three wide through the first turn to force the issue three wide from the outside of BETTIN' MAN entering the
backstretch, assumed command while continuing three wide into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and held NORTHERN KID safely at bay
with little urging. NORTHERN KID tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, shifted three wide for the drive and closed willingly to prove second best. BETTIN' MAN broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail
entering the first turn, was pressed by JUVEE TOO in the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, was unable to keep tabs on that rival
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to hold on for a share. JACK DON'T DRINK settled off the early pace while racing two out from
the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. ONE TOONUMAANY was devoid of
early speed while settling off the early pace racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a
serious impact while finishing two out from the rail in the drive. B C BISCUIT away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

ARIKARA stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, collared
the pacesetters leaving the turn and quickly took command, and was all out to hold off a late surge by ONE FLEET PRINCESS to prevail. ONE FLEET
PRINCESS settled off the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn,
and closed with a rush three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. VALUE DANCER unhurried early while dropping well back while trailing the field into
the backstretch, rallied with interest from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the final turn, and finished full of run to get up for a
share. PAGODA RIDGE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
