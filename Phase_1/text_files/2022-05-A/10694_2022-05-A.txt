MORE HARDER was unhurried early on, made a quick move around the far turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to be clear under
strong handling. WHEELS TURNING settled off the early going, moved up four wide through the stretch run and finished second best. BIT PART was off
slowly, moved up around the far turn, raced widest through the lane and flattened out. FREED showed good early speed from the inside and weakened
along the inside. CONQUISTADOR GOLD tracked the early leader down the backstretch and tired while racing along the inside. MULTIDIMENSIONAL
stalked the early pace and tired while racing three wide.

LAKE MARIE was quick to begin to set the early pace along the inside and drew off through the stretch run to be well clear under strong handling. IRONIT
stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up along the inside into the lane but was no match for the winner late. BOSTON BELLE was coaxed along
while racing two deep and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. PINEAPPLE ALLEY was hustled along early, drifted out briefly near the three eighths
pole and had no final winning bid. IRON BANNER was slow early, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no late response. ZUMRA BAYOU was
hustled early and failed to respond.

TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH stalked the early pace, moved up four to five wide in the drive and finished well to be well clear late under strong handling.
SWIMHARD DREAMBIG showed good early speed early on to angle over to the rail to set the pace, continued to race near the rail in the lane and was no
match for the winner late. NINE LINE BIND dropped back early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled five to six wide through the stretch run
and moved up. AGIRLNAMEDSYD stalked the early pace and weakened while racing three wide. QUICK HEAT was forwardly placed to lay up close early
on while racing between rivals and faded. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY was tangled at the break, assistant starter had a hold of rein after gate had opened,
stewards ruled Younmehoneybunny a non starter for the unfair start.

CARLOS LOVES TEE was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up two to three wide through the far turn into the lane, angled in to make a good rail
bid and proved best late under strong handling. VANCOUVER SNOW stalked the early pace, made a good three to four wide in the lane and finished
willingly to the wire. TRACK QUEEN raced up close down the backstretch, raced four wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. CHARLIE'S
GAL was unhurried early, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive. GLENNEYMAX stalked the early going, raced
along the inside, clipped heels near the three eighths pole and had no final bid after the troubling outing. TAIPANS CHERRYBOMB stalked the pace and
tired while racing three wide. GOODBYE ROSIE showed good early speed to set the pace and gave way. JUNIE was slow early and never threatened.
UNION GRAD raced far back and never threatened. Official race time was hand timed.

Footnotes
LIZZ A BEE settled off the early pace, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole, shifted four wide and just got up under strong handling. PEACEFUL
VISION stalked the pace, raced two to three wide, led late and missed in a game effort. COLD HEARTED WENCH was allowed to settle early on, shifted
out five to six wide in the drive and moved up. VELVET ISLE vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened. BE A BANDIT settled to the middle of the
pace, raced four wide in the drive while racing between rivals and had no final bid. DOBBY SUE pressed the early pace and gave way. SAND DRIFT
dropped back early, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. SASSY MALLORY settled off the early pace and failed to
respond. FOR REAL ALICE stalked the pace and tired readily.
