FULL MOON LOVER took the lead on the chute and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, cleared SAYYESTOTHELADY midway on the turn and
was steadily handled to hold on well. The latter pressured the pace through the backstretch, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn, though, finished
well. SHENANDOAH CAT exchanged contact with Just Ask Me leaving the gate, angled to the outside to give chase, raced off the rail on the turn and ran
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. GLOBAL EMPRESS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in
the lane. JUST ASK ME exchanged contact with Shenandoah Cat leaving the gate, engaged in close early chase inside, steadied at the rail in the vicinity of
the three eighths pole, angled to the four path leaving the turn but showed little further. IHEARTRAINACOMN gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn and
showed little further. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL hesitated at the break, angled to the outside to give chase and rounded the turn about the four path. VALUED

Footnotes
BULL SHARK was hustled to the front at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, drew clear past the three eighths, widened at the rail on the
turn then kept alert down the lane. WIDGET FACTORY gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail, cleared second mid-stretch and finished well. BARRY
KARAFIN BETS pressured the early pace inside, ran at the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FEDERALE gave close early
chase, rounded the turn in the five path and finished evenly widest. EPIC WEST steadied on the chute, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. GRAND FIBER pressured the early pace, rounded the turn about the three path then weakened. RESIDENT
gave only distant chase and rounded the turn about the three path. BOATSWAIN gave chase inside and was not a factor.
