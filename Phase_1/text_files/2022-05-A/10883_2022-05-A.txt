Footnotes
NABOKOV established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from CLOUD FOREST latched
on to the outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and remained patiently handled through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged
clear under a light drive to the finish. CLOUD FOREST coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of NABOKOV from the outside three then two wide, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on under a drive to chase the winner home preserving the place
honors over a rival on the wire. DIGITIZE chased along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, balked along the rail briefly at the
three-sixteenths, then kept on inside to secure the show honors. BRAILLE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and weakened. PREDICTED bobbled at the break, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung
three wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
NOW YUS CANT LEAVE got bumped at the start by SYNONYMOUS and in turn bumped BELLA PRINCIPESSA, chased two to three wide from near the
rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command
seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish kept to task. BELLA PRINCIPESSA got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe due to
pressure inside from SYNONYMOUS, then got steadied off that rival when she came out directly in front as ACT LIKE ARTIE veered out from the inside,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in and
was caught with seventy yards to go and just held on for the place honors. LADY OF THOROTON got bumped solidly at the start and was forced to steady
when squeezed between foes as LOVE'S MISERY veered inwards, conceded two to three lengths to the front, tracked along the inside coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to miss for the place honors. LINNY KATE tracked just
off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch
and stayed on one paced through to the finish. SYNONYMOUS broke out at the start then got steadied after the start when ACT LIKE ARTIE veered out,
saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the
late stages. SWEET SENSATION bumped at the start by LOVE'S MISERY, who veered in at the start, tracked the pace just off the inside down the
backstretch before tipping three to four wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and
offered no rally. ACT LIKE ARTIE veered out shortly after the start forcing SYNONYMOUS to steady and in turn BELLA PRINCIPESSA in behind her, raced
three then two wide in closest aim of the leader latched on early on, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. LOVE'S MISERY veered in at the start bumping LADY OF THOROTON solidly before squeezing that foe back against SWEET SENSATION,
then bumped that rival lightly, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused into upper stretch,
yielded the front a furlong out and weakened to the line.

Footnotes
GOT THE GOLD pinched at the start, was allowed to settle into stride, tipped into the three path at the beginning of the run around the bend after taking the
two path journeying down the backstretch, was yet under a firm hold by the pilot narrowing in as the half was being completed, swung out five wide onto the
head of the stretch, was given his cue and kicked in, saw a spirited head to head tussle with the second place finisher get ignited a furlong down the road,
proved relentless, stealing away the verdict by getting the head down in time at the wire. KINGSTOWN leaned in shouldering HEREBY at the start,
proceeded to race four wide on the turn, moved up to take on the leader coming up to the quarter pole, settled onto the top of the stretch and was put to a
drive, fought his way to a slim advantage over the course of the next furlong, got hooked up in a duel with the eventual winner, was determined to the end
only to lose the bob. HEREBY underwent a three wide trip after making slight contact with the runner up in the shadow of the gate, ventured between foes
on the turn, was cued up spinning into the stretch, got outfinished. MAKART went on to stalk the pace from the two path after brushing with GOT THE
GOLD at the start, kept pace until the general area of the furlong grounds before giving way. FAIR TO MIDDLIN gathered after breaking a bit to the outside,
was moved into the two path at the half mile pole, got called upon, was maneuvered to the six path during the opening stages of the stretch run to no avail.
DENIS hand ridden while showing the way from along the inside route for the initial half, gave out.

Footnotes
KLICKITAT just off the inside just off the duel, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied in tandem with STRAW INTO
GOLD to his inside, overhauled the leader inside the sixteenth marker and dug in and prevailed over a rival on the wire. STRAW INTO GOLD tracked the
pace along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe to his outside overthrowing
the leader as a pair inside the sixteenth pole and ran on willingly to the finish. NOT PHAR NOW dueled two to three wide with SAINT SELBY to his inside,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away to sole command a furlong out, dug in and was
overhauled inside the final sixteenth and kept on to be along safe for the show honors. CHULAINN tracked just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. QUIET OUT EAST chased three then
two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. SAINT SELBY dueled inside of NOT PHAR
NOW from the get go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole and
weakened in the late stages. PANSTER chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. CHOWDA chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide for home, tired in the stretch.

BAIL OUT brushed at the start by LEFTY'S WAR, who broke outwards, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. HOOKY PLAYER just off the inside in pursuit from
mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. I AM THE
LAW three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. STRIKE PRICE forwardly placed three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. FAZARO spurted away in the very early stages before settling to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught near the
eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong. LEFTY'S WAR broke out at the start brushing BAIL OUT, came under coaxing and chased along the inside, got
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no rally. KENTUCKY KNIGHT chased four then three wide
under coaxing from midway on the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. IRIE SPICE chased five wide under a ride from the three-eighths,

Footnotes
DR ARDITO away well, sat reserved four wide for nearly three-quarters. was asked to pick it up at the five-sixteenths marker, swung into the lane, rallied
with willingness to attain a slim lead upon completion of the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, shied out from left side stick work at the
eighth pole, locked in battle with a pair of opponents to the its inside, then shied inward after the pilot applied some stick work from right side in deep stretch
yet held sway. THREE JOKERS secured the pocket after the field had been sent on its way, was rated along keeping watch on the leader, without benefit of
that one's cover, was put to a drive approaching the quarter pole, became the innermost of a threesome vying for control shortly afterwards, failed to forge
to the front end, but stayed on well nonetheless to procure the place. JERRY THE NIPPER established control soon after the start, got sent over towards
the two path, showed the way, lightly coaxed, got turned loose stepping onto the head of the stretch, was the middle member of a three-way fight for the top
for a good portion of the stretch run, albeit not tightly spotted between foes, weakened late into the show slot. AMERICAN RULE prompted the pace three
wide until the top of the lane before backing away. SOUTH STREET took up the chase from the two path on the turn, was one path farther off the rail after
swinging into the lane, lacked the needed response. PERCEIVED got spotted into the three path after the start, was towards the back of the pack in pursuit
of the front runners, came into the stretch, never having made his presence felt. CIVIL WAR saved ground to no avail.

good finish rolling home on the outside taking command just inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed going away at the end. MISS DRACARYS tracked the

and narrow command a sixteenth out before being overhauled in tandem by the top one and ran on to secure the place honors. CHAMPAGNE LADY
showed the way in hand along the inside, got let out spinning in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in head to head through the stretch and was collared
a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors. EVVIE JETS saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got let out taking the inside route into upper

Footnotes
SENBEI showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down the backstretch and began to tuck inwards into the turn settling in the two path through the
bend, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under threat through the final furlong and gamely rebuffed the challenge to the
wire holding well to the end. PROVOCATEUR bumped at the start by FLUID STATION, raced four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through
the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and was paused briefly before being roused with three-sixteenths to go as the rail opened up, rallied up the rail
issuing a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled at the finish. RUNNINSONOFAGUN chased three then two wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FLUID SITUATION broke in at the start bumping PROVOCATEUR,
then got brushed by that rival as he came outwards slightly, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. DANCE CODE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside early on before chasing three to four wide through
the turn under coaxing from midway, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DON'T WAIT UP five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
