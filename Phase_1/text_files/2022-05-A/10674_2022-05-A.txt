late-stretch and ran on. WHERE IS TROCHU dueled inside, weakened. BITTEN was in a bit tight early, swung out five wide and failed to threaten.
TURQUOSIE MONSTER broke a bit awkwardly, went three wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
INDIAN FIREBLOSSOM stalked four to five wide, contended up the backstretch, continued four wide on the far turn, fought on to just get up. SHORT
POCKETS shifted in two deep into the first turn off the leaders, advanced inside to press, eased back entering the far turn, angled out five deep late on that
bend, rallied but just missed. AUTUMN TOUCH set the early pace racing off the inside in the two to three path, faced pressure inside and out up the
backstretch, was out kicked. LATENITE SLEWZY pressed three to four wide, had no late kick. NOWORRIESTODAY was restless in the gate, shifted in
early and moved forward to press briefly, dropped back and failed to rally. MAX A MILLION RSS raced mostly four to five wide and failed to threaten.
QUESTA shifted in from five to three wide on the first turn, went three wide on the second and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GOGO OXBOW dueled outside three to four wide, drew off when asked. COMMISSIONER DAVID stalked going four wide on the turn, was no match for the
winner. ARROGANT PUNCH dueled inside the winner but off the rail, weakened. BLUE LUNA WHO went three to four wide on the turn and improved
position. HOT CHARLIE shifted in from three to two wide on the turn while losing ground on the leaders, evened out. STORMIN L D broke open the gate,
was mid-pack racing two wide on the turn, failed to rally. REAL POUCH shifted in to chase inside on or just off the rail, dropped back and failed to rally.
DIAMOND RAPPER switched off the inside racing in the three to four path on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. ZESTY JAZZMAN raced four to
five wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HEAR ME ROAR set the pace in the clear racing off the rail, extended the margin leaving the turn racing in the two to three path, held. CHARLIES
HURRICANE stalked the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, closed the gap but ran out of ground to catch the winner. BIKINILESS broke slowly, soon
switched out and advanced rapidly outside, went four to five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. FLOWER POWER was within range, went four to
five wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and evened out. CHARITY WATER switched out going from two to five wide on the turn, steadied on
heels and altered course at the sixteenth pole. LA DIAMANT swung seven wide turning for home and passed tired rivals. LAS TRES MARIPOSAS chased
inside on or just off the rail then weakened. N M SNOWBIRD was restless in the post parade, failed to menace after going three wide on the turn. CRAFTY
WARRIOR stumbled at the start, went five to six wide on the turn, failed to menace. JAZZY MELODY chased briefly inside, faded.
