nearing the sixteenth pole and gradually drew clear. CURLING SECRET saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly during the drive, responded
when challenged and held on gamely for the place. AMERICAN BUDDHA was allowed to settle in stride, swung out to rally 4-wide into the stretch and made
up some ground. RINGS OF SATURN was forwardly place to the stretch, but lacked a late response. PERFECT ONE lacked early foot and failed to
menace. NORTHWEST RAIN forced the issue to the stretch from along the outside and tired. MOSQUITO FLEET gave way after showing brief speed from

FRANKS FIX IT disputed the pace from along the inside, shook clear entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage. NATIONHEART was allowed to
settle in stride while saving ground, angled out to split rivals during the drive and was gaining late. NAVAL ESCORT unhurried early, rallied along the inside
into the stretch and finished well. DEMOCRAT disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened slightly late. ETHAN'S ANIMAL came four-wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN settle off the early pace, ranged up to offer a mild bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened
out. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN was three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. DECIMATE dueled for the early lead from
between horses and tired.
