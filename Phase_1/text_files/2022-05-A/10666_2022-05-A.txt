Footnotes
IN A SPIN rated kindly while saving ground, was patiently handled past the five sixteenths then angled out, raced about five wide past the three sixteenths,
leveled off under left handed asking inside the furlong grounds, closed determinedly outside MARY JANE CHROME and nabbed that one at the wire. MARY
JANE CHROME , a bit fractious in the gate, broke a beat slow then was unhurried early, commenced a run while off the rail leaving the three eighths, circled
five wide into the lane, rolled up outside rivals to take over inside the sixteenth marker, edged away a bit, kept on gamely but just failed to contain the
winner's charge. EVANGELINE ALLONS rated within range while about three wide early on, took closer order past the five sixteenths, moved in four wide
then challenged between rivals leaving the eighth pole, kept on willingly and saved the show. CLOSERTOTHEHEART saved ground, moved up leaving the
far turn, eased out with progress into the lane, bid between foes inside the eight pole then kept on trying while caught inside rivals late. AMPLIO ESQUEMA
settled off the pace while saving some ground, eased out into the far turn then edged up three wide into the stretch, had to navigate through traffic through
the final furlong, angled out and finished well. LOLA FLO , keen early, opened up past the three quarter pole, set a sharp pace, continued well clear while
two wide into the lane, fought on under a drive once collared past mid stretch then faded very late. GLOSSAMER had speed then rated off the leader
nearing the six furlong marker, relaxed stalking off the inside, advanced under coaxing into the lane, bid between runners leaving the eighth pole but failed
to seriously kick on in the final seventy yards. CAMELIA ROD drifted in at the break and brushed with a rival, saved ground under early rating, moved up a
bit past the five sixteenths, cut the corner into the lane but came up empty. BACKSTREET GAL was outrun. MIZ THE BEST , off the rail into the
backstretch, failed to respond.

Footnotes
DANTASTIC relaxed four wide early while in range, dropped in a couple paths leaving the far turn and edged up, angled back out to be four wide into the
lane, closed in steadily while under a drive, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear. UNREQUITED LOVE quickly went clear, was nicely rated
setting the pace towards the inner rail, turned away an initial challenge approaching the stretch, kicked back clear, dug in leaving mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. FOLLY settled off the pace three to four wide, circled under a ride into the lane and rallied mildly. HASHTAG LUCKY angled out leaving the
chute and tracked the leader three wide, steadily advanced to take closer aim mid turn, bid soon after, drifted out a bit entering the lane, failed to kick on
leaving the quarter pole and faded. ELUSIVE AMELIA dropped in nearing the five eighths and settled off the pace, came under a ride leaving the far turn but
failed to respond. LADY FOX , sluggish from the gate and was put to urging soon after, lagged off the pace, angled four to five wide for the drive but lacked
a rally. FORTES , in the clear leaving the half mile marker, failed to kick on nearing the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
ZOLA B saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased off the rail turning for home, swung to the five path in mid stretch for clear sailing, led late and
drove clear. CIRCLE HOME lacked speed, worked between horses in upper stretch, swung outside inside the eighth pole and rallied. ASHARA saved
ground around the turn disputing the pace, edged clear in mid stretch and finished willingly. PRINCESS PALMER stalked the pace three deep around the
turn, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR circled the turn four deep, was fanned to the six path in upper stretch
and lacked a rally. MADE MY WISH disputed the pace outside ASHARA and gave way the final furlong. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS bumped DAISY
BUCHANAN when bearing out at the break then was not a factor. SULLIVAN STREET , no factor, was steadied lacking room along the inner rail in deep
stretch. DAISY BUCHANAN , bumped leaving the starting gate, was in the five path in upper stretch and weakened. LONG DISTANCE PASS raced along
the inner rail on the turn and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET GRACIE broke a step slow, recovered and moved up in hand while saving ground to the half mile marker, tapped the brakes awaiting room mid
turn, eased out three wide into the lane, dropped back in and bid inside foes leaving the eighth pole, took command a sixteenth out, kicked clear then held
sway under a drive. MAMA G'S WISH tracked the contested pace four wide, bid three wide between runners leaving the three eighths, poked a head in front
leaving the five sixteenths, dug in after being headed soon into the lane, battled gamely to the inside of SHE'S A BIG DEAL and came back to out finish that
one for the place. SHE'S A BIG DEAL , five wide early on chasing the leaders, quickly moved up and bid four deep mid turn, gained a slim lead soon into
the stretch, held the lead while sparring past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. LADY ZETA chased to the inside of a rival, angled four wide under a
hearty ride past the five sixteenths, straightened away but could only manage a slight kick. CARTEL QUEEN saved ground off the pace, slipped through
towards the rail near mid stretch, eased out and kept on with some effort. SHE'S MO BETTER sped to a short early lead, took pressure then dueled from
the far turn, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. LOVE RAN RED , taken back from between runners at the break, angled five wide for the drive but
lacked a solid bid. I'M GITTIN THERE lost ground three to five wide, gave hard chase into the lane and faded. ROUGH TOUGH LOVE forced the early pace
three deep, steadied near the three eighths, steadied again near the quarter pole and weakened. MY BOSS was sent up early to engage SHE'S MO
BETTER, dueled with that one into the turn, was surrounded mid turn, failed to kick on entering the lane and gave way.

EXCELLORATOR set the pace well off the inner rail, opened up turning for home, was kept under urging and raced erratically late. INK , unhurried down the
backstretch, circled the turn four wide and rallied outside horses. STONE COURAGEOUS , taken to the inner rail leaving the turn, remained inside horses
and failed to sustain his move the final furlong. COBBLE ROAD , taken to the outside soon after stumbling at the break, was kept five wide on the turn,
remained outside horses and had a mild gain. TOY , between horses early, bumped with ARTISTIC REASON approaching the turn, raced in the two path
turning for home and failed to be a factor. ARTISTIC REASON , between horses and outside TOY down the backstretch, bumped with that one approaching
the turn. ALIFEROUS , a forward factor in the three path between horses on the turn, gave way the final furlong. SHADY MUNNI showed speed along the
inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
TWIST 'N TWIRL , patiently handled while saving ground in about mid pack, moved up towards the rail past the three sixteenths, eased out, split rivals with
a sixteenth to go, took a short lead soon after and dug in under solid handling to prove best. RIPKEN , well placed while towards the rail, edged up nearing
the half mile marker, remained forward under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, angled out into the lane, moved up to draw on near even terms
approaching the sixteenth pole, was headed from his inside by the winner and continued on gamely to the wire. TRASH TALKIN LARRY , off the pace and
between runners leaving the far turn, swung out five to six wide for the drive and finished well to gain. BUSHWICK BRUISER , unhurried early while off the
inside, angled out six to seven wide in upper stretch, straightened and closed steadily. CROSSLAND prompted the pace outside GRAND MANNER, got the
better of that one past the three sixteenths, spurted clear but failed to hold on through the final sixteenth. DECEIVING , in range and outside rivals, took
closer order four wide and under a ride near the five sixteenths, chased into the lane but went evenly through the final furlong. GRAND MANNER sped to
command inside foes, was hounded by CROSSLAND, ceded to that one leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. CAPTAIN QUINT , brushed and in
tight at the break, saved ground off the pace, was asked leaving the far turn but lacked a rally. TEMPLE OWL LIAM broke inward, corrected then rated off
foes early, raced two wide leaving the far turn but came up empty. SPRITZER , three wide stalking the pace, failed to kick on under pressure past the five
sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
WATCH YOUR TONE grabbed command soon after the break and set the pace off the rail while getting some pressure towards her inside, moved clear
leaving the three eighths then bore out extremely wide entering the lane, corrected near the three sixteenths, came back under right handed asking, forged
to command nearing the sixteenth pole and widened while minimally hand ridden the final seventy yards. ICY REPLY prompted the pace to the inside of the
winner, rated off that one leaving the far turn, inherited the lead while dueling into the lane, shook clear a furlong out but was no match through the final
sixteenth. SHE'S A TRIPP , bumped at the break, raced off the early pace, came three wide for the drive, shifted in and had a mild rally. MI YAYIS , jostled
from both sides at the break, steadied soon after, showed a burst and moved up towards the inside, drifted out approaching the turn, eased out and bid
outside ICY REPLY, dueled with that one into the lane, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. PLEASE MARRY ME , bumped at the break, chased
off the inside, was floated out a bit nearing the half mile marker and failed to respond. CANDY CORNER , off awkwardly and to the inside bumping with a
rival, corrected and rated off the pace, was forced out a bit near the half mile marker, lost ground four to five wide past the five sixteenths and came up
empty. SATISFIED , four to five wide, was carried out briefly nearing the turn, angled in a bit and failed to respond.
