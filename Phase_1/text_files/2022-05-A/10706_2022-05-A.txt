the two path, was collared near the three-eighths pole, angled out soon after, chased the winner and was clearly second best. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY
had her head turned at the start, broke inwardly and bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and was along for the show. HARDLY
SOCIAL was in range inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. ELLIEREESEASTON was bumped at the start, trailed inside early, angled out
on the backstretch, went three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
THE BLUE DRAGON rated along on a clear early lead inside, drifted to the three-path brushing with MOMZA as that one challenged and wrested a short
lead at the top of the stretch, moved back to the rail and battled gamely to regain the advantage near the wire. MOMZA ranged up outside THE BLUE
DRAGON after six furlongs, brushed with that rival while forging to the front leaving the turn, dueled outside through the stretch and was outgamed.
VALHALLA AIR BASE saved ground close up from the start, and lacked a solid closing bid while much best of the others. JEALOUS BOYFRIEND broke
awkwardly, trailed outside to the stretch, and gained belatedly. WILD TEXAS TOM raced three wide and failed to become a serious threat. POLITICAL
RIOT was no factor near the inside. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF MOMZA,
THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

TIL THE END stalked the pace inside, got through in upper stretch, reached the front leaving the eighth pole, vied inside of foes and prevailed. CATCHING
FISH set the pace along the rail, drifted out nearing the lane, led past the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging late and just missed. OFFICER
COUNTRY was forced out entering the first turn, raced in range three and four wide, had aim outside of the pacesetter through the lane but could never get
by. PARLOR was off slow, steadied incessantly and lacked a clear path until deep stretch. HEZA KITTEN raced off the pace four and five wide throughout
and had a mild stretch gain. HARD BELLE constantly fought rating while hard held three wide and weakened in the drive. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE, TIMES
CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW. PER CASE #2022027794 FROM THE FLORIDA GAMING CONTROL COMMISSION, CATCHING FISH WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

WHATS GOIN ON vied outside VELOCE BELLA for three furlongs, moved clear into the stretch, stayed on her left lead and held for the decision.
CHITIENNE was well placed tracking outside the dueling leaders three wide, had aim through the stretch but could only gain mildly. MOUNT SINAI was
outsprinted two wide to the end of the turn, moved out for the drive and rallied belatedly. VELOCE BELLA contested the pace inside WHATS GOIN ON to
the top of the stretch, and weakened. WAR OF AGES moved off the inside to the three-path on the turn, and could not make her presence felt. KINGSTON
QUEEN cut the corner into the lane, and was empty.

ROYAL SQUEEZE stalked the pace from the rail, got through near the three-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of TOWN CLASSIC while drifting out under
right-handed urging and prevailed. TOWN CLASSIC bobbled at the break, advanced inside down the backstretch, angled four wide near the three-eighths
pole, bid outside in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and just missed. BENEFACTOR had his head turned at the start, prompted the pace in the three
path, bid between foes turning for home but was no match for the top two. TONE FEELIN broke awkwardly and was in tight soon after, raced well back four
wide and improved position in the lane. BLESSED JOURNEY failed to menace while racing three wide. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT set the pace in the two
path and retreated through the lane. GENERAL PADDY played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
MIA CAMILA prompted SONG OF THE HEART from outside, wrested command approaching the top of the stretch, and spurted away through the furlong
grounds under pressure. JAN'S GIRL steadied at the back nearing the first turn, lagged well out of it through the opening half-mile, swung four wide rallying
into the lane and closed with good energy. L. E. GRAY went along under a snug hold early near the inside, continued to save ground through the far turn,
and was one-paced when roused for a response. SONG OF THE HEART hustled clear early, showed the way into the far turn, proved no match for the
winner by upper stretch, and faded. INES'S HATS raced three to four wide on the far turn, and could not menace. KELSEY'S SHOT was no factor three
wide on the turns. KATNISS saved ground to no avail. RITABOOK stayed in range for a half, and had no response when asked on the far turn. HAPPY
TWEET was hard to load, and showed nothing at the rear. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
