Footnotes
MIZ CHAPLIN led the field under a hold up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn and remained in command to the
wire. FROSTED ANGEL raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, could not go with the
winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. KATESALUCKYGIRL pressed the pace on the inside early, dropped back to chase the
leader up what remained of the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and faded in the final furlong. LEGS LIKE SHACK
trailed the field the entire way around the oval, came around the turn in the three and four path and never fired.

Footnotes
VENOMOUS STATE dueled for the lead on the far outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and in upper stretch,
edged clear in the final furlong and held that margin to the wire. KITTEN'S SOLUTION dueled for the lead between horses through opening quarter of a
mile, raced in the two path around the turn, and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. BEYOND THE BEND bumped with the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, and gained ground mildly in upper stretch while
proving to be no match for the top two. YES IT'S ROO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace from inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded entering the stretch. SIR ROCKPORT bumped with the horses on either side leaving the gate and was
shuffled back, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path and was empty from there. EQUAL JUSTICE dueled for
the lead on the inside in the early going, raced between horses in the two path around the turn, and tired in the stretch.

ARTIE CHILLER veered out leaving the gate, took over the lead on the outside while racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two
path around the turn, and drew off down the lane to win easily. PAULINO chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two and three
path around the turn, and continued to pursue the winner in vain down the stretch. TOUCH OF PRINCE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the
early going, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground between horses in the final furlong. MR DUBAI bumped with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the front runner between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and finished evenly on the
outside while never threatening. VOODOO CAT trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing in the three

bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the pace setter from the two path while racing in tight quarters around the first turn,
moved up to duel between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in the final furlong. SMART TART hit the gate

HIPNOTIZADA was away from the gate quickly, opened up a significant early lead, continued to race in command while saving ground around the turn and
held that margin to the wire under a drive. PERFECT HIDEAWAY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the
turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground from the rail in late stretch. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER bumped with the horse to her inside
leaving the gate, recovered to race in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made a mild
improvement of position on the outside in the stretch. POLISHED GEM bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the
inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and finished evenly. QUEEN OF THE
LAND bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the
final furlong. UNION RALLY trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and

of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground late. HAPPY GUY bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and finished
evenly while never threatening. IRON CLASH trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two and three path around the turn, swung
