Footnotes
SHIPSHAPE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path and drove clear. GUARD DUTY set the pace while along the
inside while under pressure, continued with the winner after straightening in the lane, yielded to the top one then stayed on to be second best. JUSTICE IN
VEGAS pressed the pace three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response while saving the show spot.
FORENSIC FILE was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and never was a serious threat. JENNSTONE raced in the four path through the turn,
was asked for more entering the lane, moved into the five path with aim then flattened out. CONCRETE CHARLIE raced in the three or four path through
the turn, swung into the lane from the six path and never factored. IT'S THE SUNRISE saved ground into the lane and was empty.

GO FOR SHERRIE stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, was asked for more into the lane, caught the leader outside the sixteenth pole and
edged clear. INCORRIGIBLE set the pace while in the two path through the turn, dueled with the winner after straightening then yielded to that one nearing
the sixteenth pole while staying on for the place spot. CAN'TBETEMALL unhurried while trailing the small field, moved through the turn while in the three
path, entered the lane from the four path with aim on the top two then could not sustain the effort. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER chased the pace from the two
path and lacked a response. BAD BOY tracked the pace along the inside into the far turn then was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
DULCIMER DAME tracked the pace while along the inside through the turn, got through when leader remained in the two path, cut the corner into the lane
and quickly became a serious contender, gained a short lead near the eighth pole and stayed on well to hold. DESTINY'S DARLING chased the pace from
the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, got closest to the winner outside the eighth pole but could not get past and settled for
second best. MAMA LOU was in the two or three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path and moved up for the minor share while not a
threat to the top two. SHAPE OF YOU bobbled at the start, moved to press the pace through the turn then weakened after straightening in the lane.
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path, was bothered when another veered out and
never was a menace. BELLARIFIC set the pace through late turn while in the two path, was tiring when another rival came in, checked sharply and veered
out near the eighth pole and was done. GRANITE CANDY raced in the five path through the turn and tired.

TOO BAD JUSTICE vied for the lead into the turn while two wide, cleared after mid-turn, widened into the lane when roused one time right-handed then was
under minimal urging the final sixteenth. SHINEONBRAD raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path with momentum
then could only chase the top one home while clearly second best. BLUEGRASS PRAYER was tough to load, bothered at the start when outside rival took
his path, moved to the inside into the turn, continued with good momentum into the lane but too much work was to be done. T. G. PRADO was in the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and never was a serious threat. TRAVELINJUSTICE stepped in at the start, raced well back into
the lane then moved up without being a factor. PURSUANT was in the two path through the turn and was losing ground. SMILE LIKE KYLE vied for the lead
with the winner into the turn then gave way in late turn. SPARKY THE SLAYER tracked the pacesetters into the turn and was soon done.
WHOSPACKINMYLUNCH was outrun while in the two path.

BAYOU CAT set the pace while in the two path, patiently handled into the lane was asked near the eighth pole then drew away. MAX EXPRESS chased the
winner from the three path through the far turn,asked in late turn, appeared to be a serious threat into the lane then was no match for the top one when that
one asked for more, then stayed on for the place spot. JUNGLE WARFARE was near the rail throughout and never seriously threatened. KING'S MISCHIEF
raced off the rail through the turns and tired through the final eighth.

Footnotes
RICHEBOURG stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then drew off and geared down late while ridden out for the win. BALLOT
INITIATIVE was unrushed early, circled the field on the far turn, rallied and proved second best. COURTING WAR was three wide early, went clear on the
backstretch but gave way on the far turn. BLESSING THE FLAG raced evenly. QUARIA BRAVA stalked the pace inside, then faded in the stretch. MADRE
DI GRANDEZZA was not a factor. TIZ SO FINE pressed the early pace between foes, then was through early.

stalked in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. BRUCE ON THE LOOSE pressed the early pace inside, then gave way. LILY'S TRUMPET was not a
