Footnotes
PRAYFORPEACE bobbled at the start, set the pace early on, raced in the two path into the lane, inched clear down the lane and held late. SUMMER IN
MALIBU was a tad slow at the break, stalked the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn, shifted into the four path entering the lane, made a bid
down the lane and slowly gained on the winner. TURNSANDCONDITIONS was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early, made a three wide bid near the
five sixteenths pole, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. AMERICAN HERO chased the pace early, raced in the four
path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. BUREAU was never a factor. COLE SPUR pressed the pace early,
raced from between horses along the turn, was in the three path into the lane and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
DUNVEGAN DOLL raced back early on, rolled up to the leaders four wide near the five sixteenths pole, coasted past from the five path entering the lane,
drew off down the lane while geared down in the final stages. NIBBLES stalked the pace early from the inside, came off the rail nearing the far turn, raced in
the two path along the far turn, was in the three path into the lane and prevailed for place in the final stages. CHOPIN DRIVE set the pace early, was on the
inside into the lane, faltered down the lane and lost place in the late stages. WILDCAT DREAM chased the pace early, raced on the inside into the lane and
leveled off late in the stretch run. LAYLA'S SONG tracked the pace early, made a three wide bid near the five sixteenths pole, was in the four path into the
lane and faded late in the stretch drive. AVENDORE was through after a half. KISS THEORY was never a threat.

SONIC CITY stalked the pace early from the inside, waited behind a wall from the quarter pole to the upper stretch, split horses nearing the eighth pole, took
over command and shot away while geared down in the final stages. FIGHTVILLE tracked the pace early, raced three wide along the far turn, was in the five
path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but was no match for the winner. FERRYBOAT stalked the pace early, raced from between horses along the
far turn, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. RONITHELIMODRIVER raced back early on, swung into the six path
entering the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. CHASE TRACKER chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the
stretch but faded late in the drive. KIDYOUNOT set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and gave way down the lane. TIGHTWAD was never a
threat. MONEY PIT trailed the field throughout.

WALKATHON fought restraint early on and along the first turn, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the upper stretch, edged past the leader near the
eighth pole and inched clear in the final stages. ZAWISH stalked the pace early on, took over command near the five sixteenths pole, cleared the field
entering the lane, was overtaken near the eighth pole and held place in the final stages. SCHLOFMITZ raced in the three path along the first turn, chased
the early pace, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and just missed place in the final stages. LOVE TO RUN raced in the three path
along the first turn while back early on, was in the five path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run. ARROBATIC raced in the three path along the
first turn and was back early on, swung into the six path entering the lane with a mild gain late in the stretch drive. GLENALL (IRE) trailed the field early on,
was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane with late interest. FANCY MARTINI chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch drive. HIGH SPEED was never a threat. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH was never a factor. RED HOT MAMA was done early.

Footnotes
QUICK TO BLAME staggered a bit at the start, stalked the pace early on, loomed nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane, drew clear in the
stretch and held safely in the final stages. JEDREK chased the pace early, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane, rallied
down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. UNCLE BERLEY tracked the pace early on, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path
into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE broke awkwardly and raced back early on, was in the five
path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. ONE AMERICA set the pace early, raced on the inside along the turn, was in the two path into the
lane and faltered in the stretch. COMMANDER COMPTON was unhurried early on, raced in the six path into the lane and improved position down the lane.
ARROW STRIKE was never a threat from the inside. GRAPNEL tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run.
FIFTY CENT DOLLARS was a beat slow at the start and never a factor. CURLIN LANE was through after a half.
