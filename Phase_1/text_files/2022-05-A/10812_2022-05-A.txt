Footnotes
HUNTERTOWN stalked the two rival duel through mid-turn, moved three wide nearing the quarter pole under minimal encouragement, rider peeked
between legs into the lane while clearing from the four or five path then extended the margin through the final eighth while in hand. BAYTOWN JAGGER
vied for the lead two wide through the turn, was no match for the winner into the lane, lost ground to the place rival straightening into the lane then stayed on
to regain the place spot. CONQUERED brushed early while contending for the lead, continued on near even terms into late turn, was closest to the winner
with an eighth to go then weakened and lost the place spot. AMIRA WINS was never a factor while racing into the two path through the turn.

Footnotes
APACHE chased the pace while in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, took aim on the winner after straightening, caught
that one inside the eighth pole then edged clear in the final fifty yards. KITCHEN FIRE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the
lane from the three path, gained the lead and cleared outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while clearly second best.
SHACKLEFORDS STORM set the pace while in the two path through the turn, was challenged into the lane, no match for the top two while saving the show
spot. MELTDOWN was in the three path through the turn and lacked a closing bid. GOTTSACKER settled back entering the turn, raced in the three path
through the turn and never factored. GOOD ONE never a factor while saving ground. ONWARD was never a menace while in the two path through the turn.

SEACHROME set the pace while in the two path through the turn and into the lane, continued under a strong drive inside the eighth pole then edged clear
late. ARAYA was off with a slight hop, hustled up to challenge for the lead while saving ground, continued very close to the rail into the lane then yielded
late. SHAYMYNAME broke in and bumped inside rival, raced near the rail through the turn, came off the inside into the lane and was never a threat while
being best of the rest. CHICA CHULA was off a step slow and spotted the field at least two lengths, raced in the two path into the lane and moved up while
not a threat. PEPPER SWEET was never a factor while in two or three path through the turn. TIA FRIDA chased the pace while along the inside then faded
through the lane.

Footnotes
PRIME N PROPER chased the pace while in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, was clear on top with a sixteenth to go
then was under a drive to last. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY was unhurried while moving off the inside, came into the lane from the five path with momentum
then rallied through mid-track and missed. TIME TO CONFESS set the pace from the two path into the lane, dueled with the winner to the eighth pole,
yielded to that one, was no match for the runner-up but stayed on to last for the show spot. NEW YEAR'S DELIGHT saved ground throughout and gained
belatedly. WINDOW SHAKER tracked the pace while along the inside into the lane then weakened in the drive. DON'T BE TURPRIZED chased the pace
from the three path through the turn and into the lane then weakened. MYGIRLJUSTICE raced in the two path through the turn while in mid-pack and never
was a threat. IMA N H LADY CAT was bumped at the start, raced in the three path while not far back then tired. READY FOR IMPACT was last away, raced

CIBOLO tracked the pacesetters while along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, dueled near the eighth pole then quickly cleared and extended the
margin to the wire. D'ORO'S WISH was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn, swung into the lane in the seven path, was seven wide
while straightening then continued on in good order to gain the place spot. ON THE RAYDAR stalked the pace while in the four to the three path, bid into the
lane, was a serious contender with an eighth to go then could not sustain. ROOKWOOD vied for the early lead then settled to chase the pace through the
turn, came into the lane from the four path and was not a serious threat late. HITCHPIN raced in the two path through the turn, angled into the six path into
the lane and moved up. FOR MAMA in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and flattened. VORTEX RISING never a
factor while angling from the two path to the six path for the drive. WHERE'S MOE never a factor while in the three path. BASSCOAT was well back through
the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the five path and never menaced. SPINEL set the pace along the inside into the lane then was done

Footnotes
TREASURE HUNTING was unrushed early, lacked running room around far turn and stretch, spied an opening near the sixteenth pole and motored through
between the leaders to get up in time. FIERCE ASSAULT raced well back, angled four wide on the far turn, then rallied five wide and missed. MIRACLE ON
ICE trailed early, rallied four wide and closed fast. BAILEYS RUN led inside, dueled through the stretch and was caught, finishing on even terms with
LONGSHANKS who pressed the pace in the two path before dueling with the leader, and being caught. LEVY was bumped at the start, raced inside, then
lacked a closing response. RYEGATE STONE stalked the early pace five wide, settled, raced in the two path around the far turn and then had a mild bid.
FLOYD G stalked the early pace in the three path, then faded on the far turn.

MR. SPRINGTIME chased the pace from the two or three path through late turn, took over into the lane, quickly cleared and was kept to the task to the end.
AMICABLE unhurried early while in the two path, came into the lane from the three path, dropped to the rail with aim on the winner then slowly gained on
that one to the end and was second best. ME AND CHILI raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and kept on well to
be up for the minor share. FAITHFUL NOTION raced in the three path through the turn and turned in an even effort. CIELO BLU raced in mid-pack through
the turn while in mid-pack. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE trailed for half while in the two path, angled from the two to the six path for the drive and moved up
while not a threat. SHOTGUN JOE was four wide through the turn and never factored. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE was five wide through the turn and raced in
the seven path through the lane and never menaced. MUSTY RED was outrun while along the inside. GEORGE THE MAN sprinted clear at once, set the
pace into the lane then was done.
