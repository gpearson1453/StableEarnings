the stretch and flattened. LADY BERNADETTE led early in the two path, prompted the pace then just missed the show. SEIZE THE WHISKEY forced the

FULL SEND vied outside, led in the stretch, drifted in about a sixteenth out and pulled away in a drive. ITS ABOUT MY TIME dueled inside to the final
sixteenth, steadied in tight, angled out and tired. THE METHOD dropped well behind, advanced wide and was up for the show. YANKEE JOE chased inside
and began fading on the turn. EXPLAIN prompted the pace three wide and gave way readily. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for
interference in the stretch was dismissed.

DIVINE MIRACLE stalked the pacesetter, collared the leader into the stretch, earned resisted advantage and edged away in a determined score. STAY
HYDRATED set a clear pace under rating, was hooked into the stretch and battled gamely to the finish. KIDNAPPED hesitated at the start, trailed far behind
then moved wide to get up for show late. STONEGATE raced wide off the pace, made a brief bid into the stretch then flattened out. NORTHERN EXPRESS
moved up inside before half a mile and lacked a further response. LIAR SIDE CHAT broke through gate prior to the start, was urged close up for half a mile
and stopped.

SEVIER moved clear inside, controlled the pace, drifted out through the stretch and remained driving to the finish. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE pressed the
winner inside, proved no match for the winner but was easily second best. MR. ROUNDTREE saved ground off the leaders and showed some late energy.
KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE chased inside, bid into the stretch then flattened out. DOUBLE THE HEART urged just off the pacesetter between foes and began
tiring on the turn. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN dropped back outside and lacked a rally. FOREST FIRE lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. MACH
TRIAL far back early, moved very wide on the turn and was no factor. THOUSAND PERCENT prompted the pace outside down the backstretch and
faltered. KOWBOY KARMA lacked speed despite urging and was always outrun. MANAHAWKIN broke sluggishly and trailed throughout.

SNOW FORECAST vied outside, shook clear into the stretch and was kept to a drive. OCEANO ROSSO chased in two path, bid into the stretch and was
just up for the place. ANGINETTI raced off the pace and closed well through the stretch. J J LOVES BILLY lagged far behind wide, continued wide and
closed strongly. KNOCK OUT KID prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and weakened. MRS. CREWS chased within striking range and lacked a
rally. HAY NINETEEN pressed the winner along the rail to the stretch and faded. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR broke slowly and steadied soon after then was no
factor. ATLANTIC AVENUE dropped back early and was always outrun. STORMBEAM saved ground, was put to urging on the turn but gave way.
