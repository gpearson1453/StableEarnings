Footnotes
MCMERCELUS moved clear outside foes at the three-eighths, dictated terms through the turn racing off the rail, drifted five wide turning for home and drew
off. DIABOLICAL PACKAGE contended between rivals early, chased the winner three to four wide on the turn and was no match. I AM THE JUAN was
urged at the break, chased inside just off the rail, had no late kick. RED CHILE was unprepared at the start and spotted the field roughly three lengths,
saved ground on the turn and improved position. CHARLIE DYNASTY lacked early speed despite encouragement, went four to five wide on the turn and
passed tired foes. WHO'S ON THE RUN shifted out four to five wide on the turn and faded in the lane. STELLA WHEAT chased four then three wide, tired.

QUANTICO JOE dueled inside a rival but off the fence, edged clear. SALTIE FIRE dueled outside the winner going three wide on the turn, was no match
but held the place. BISCUIT SNATCHER chased the dueling leaders four to five wide, kept on evenly. DRIVE THRU GARY steadied at the start, shifted in
and advanced while saving ground on the turn but lacked the needed late kick. FLYING ROLLEX chased three then two wide, came up empty. TICO TIME
chased outside, went five then four wide on the turn and failed to rally. BIG HITTER was very reluctant to load, hopped at the start, steadied early, went five
wide on the turn.

Footnotes
SEXY DEXY brushed a foe lightly at the start, moved forward inside to set the pace, edged away in the two path on the far turn, drew off in the lane under
steady handling. JAN'S RESERVE was forced five wide on the first turn, broke away from the others while chasing the winner four then three wide on the far
turn, was second best. INQUISITEUR pressed two wide early, moved out on the far turn going four wide having lost position but regained placing to garner
show honors. PHOENIX FIRE brushed with a rival at the start, was well back four to five wide early, advanced outside foes five wide on the far turn and kept
on in the lane. EL CHUMELITO settled two wide early, went three deep on the far turn and continued to improve position. CAUSE AND EFFECT was forced
four wide in the early going, continued to pursue the leaders three then two wide on the far turn but was empty in the lane. COLOR ME GONE was bumped
at the start, saved ground and ran on mildly. OFFENSIVE was up close three wide early, steadily retreated. EBB AND FLOW was bumped into a rival at the
start, saved ground on or just off the rail, failed to threaten. BECOME AN INSIDER was in tight and brushed with a rival at the start, raced just off the rail
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FEISTYFILAMINA attended the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, was in command past the three-sixteenths, drew off under hand urging.
MOTOWN MAMMA was forwardly-placed inside the winner racing just off the rail, switched outside that one at the top of the lane but was no match.
NATION OF LAWS hopped at the start, raced on or just off the rail, was along for show. DATQUICKCAT failed to rally after chasing three then four wide on
the turn. LALIA was devoid of speed despite urging at the start, trailed racing off the rail. ELLIE CAN PLAY pursued the leading pair three wide and came up
empty.

Footnotes
SIGUR ROS attended the pace outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was clear in mid-stretch and held. IZE A CRAFTY GAL tracked inside, came out
on the turn then angled five deep leaving the bend, was gaining but too late. HOLLYWOOD HENRY vied two to three wide between rivals, kept on evenly
late. MR PAYTIENCE advanced between foes four to five wide into and on the turn, gained gradually late. TWO BILLS was coaxed forward to contest the
pace inside on or just off the rail, lacked the needed late kick. NUMEROLOGIST settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was gaining inside but left
with too much to do. CLASSY CLASS failed to rally after racing inside just off the rail. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO failed to rally after going five wide on the turn.
COMPETITIVE IDEA chased three wide but was not a threat. J T'S LA NENA chased the leaders, floated six wide into the stretch and turned up empty.

Footnotes
GEE ETTA broke outwardly juts a bit, set a pressured pace inside, was challenged in upper stretch but dug in to hold a foe. LONG RANGER settled inside
early, shifted out at the half-mile marker, made a three then four wide bid turning for home but was held at bay. DANIEL'S GIRL attended the pace two to
three wide, weakened. HEMATITE raced mostly two to three wide and was never near enough to threaten the top ones. L M SPARKLE was mid-pack three
to four wide early and had no rally. KEEP IT ROLLIN went four wide on the turns and failed to rally. STAR FEVER broke a step slowly and was in tight at the
start, raced two to three wide early, was not a factor. SWEET BABY RUTHIE broke in just a bit, tracked inside, steadily dropped back and faded. D ORO
LANE was up close early four wide, dropped back and faded.
