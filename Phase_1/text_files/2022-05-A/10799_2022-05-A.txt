Footnotes
CARSON RESERVE showed the way from inside while in hand on the backstretch, was let out with two furlongs to go, moved clear leaving the bend and
maintained control under urging through the lane. BETWEEN prominent from outside, threatened three wide on the turn, battled outside PECOS AUTUMN
through the stretch, could not close the gap on the leader the final sixteenth but shook free for the place. PECOS AUTUMN was sent to press CARSON
RESERVE from just outside, slowly yielded when set down for the drive but was clearly best of the others. VIVA VIOLENCE bumped at the break, was
orwardly placed between horses in the early going, just off the inside on the bend, moved to the rail at the top of the lane and flattened. CHRISTY ATTACK
chased from inside, came off the rail some for clear path entering the stretch and had little to offer. GRAMMAR broke inward, bumping VIVA VIOLENCE,
trailed from inside, angled out widest on the turn, drifted out into the lane and had no late bid.

Footnotes
THAT KHENNY was sent to share the early lead outside READTHETRANSCRIPT, moved clear when asked leaving the quarter pole, opened up under a
drive in the lane and was kept to urging until just inside the seventy yard marker. AWESOME SKIPPY crowded briefly at the start, recovered to race in
contention early, did not keep up on the turn, commenced his bid between horses leaving the bend, altered to the inside nearing the furlong marker, moved
clear for second but was no match for THAT KHENNY. VIOLENZA D'ORO brushed with AWESOME SKIPPY then bumped G MONEY LIV at the start, did
not keep up widest on the turn, was five wide into the stretch and caught CRAPS SHOOTER for third in the waning yards. CRAPS SHOOTER pressed the
pace from outside, fought for second outside READTHETRANSCRIPT in the stretch and slowly wore down the final sixteenth. READTHETRANSCRIPT
displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with THAT KHENNY leaving the bend, swung outside that one entering the stretch, tried to keep second but
did not have enough left in the late going. G MONEY LIV bumped shortly after the start, was boxed in behind the leaders on the backstretch, had the rail on
the turn and flattened out for the stretch run.

NEXT TIME YOU WIN, was without early speed, was three wide on the bend, angled in some for the drive, lacked a serious rally but finished on even terms

AROSE FOR LYLA forced inward at the start, was encouraged along once straightened, progressed two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch
run, continued her bid under a drive and drew off inside the final sixteenth. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN broke inward, was hustled along to gain a clear lead,
saved ground, lengthened command under urging upper stretch, did not have enough left in the late going but was easily second best. DIAMOND STELLAR
rank at the start, chased from outside once under control, was widest taking the turn and passed outside tired ones in the stretch. MAJESTIC RAJ saved
ground taking the bend, angled out some upper stretch and had no late bid. JUST A WONDER was urged along to be prominent just outside GHAALEB'S
DOMAIN but tired the final three-sixteenths.

Footnotes
ASTOROTH broke inward, was hustled along to stay in contention early, advanced two wide on the turn, fanned outside LIFE IS GRAND for the drive,
rallied under a drive, took over just inside the last sixteenth then began to draw off. BIG TIPPER soon moved up from inside to share the early lead, moved
clear upper stretch, could not hold back ASTOROTH in the late going but was unchallenged for second. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE was fractious and broke
through the gate before the start, ran in the second flight on the backstretch once reloaded and the race began, did not keep up from path three on the
bend, swung outside ASTOROTH for the stretch run, could only make up minor ground the final furlong but gained third late. MUNCH without early speed,
advanced two wide on the turn, moved to the rail leaving the bend, gained a striking position upper stretch but leveled off the last eighth. LIFE IS GRAND
displayed early speed outside BIG TIPPER but flattened out for the drive. BLEEDING BLUE in contention from outside on the backstretch, gave way four
wide on the turn. LUCKYVILLE hesitated briefly at the start, saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
SAY CHEESE shared the lead between rivals from the early going, was three wide taking the bend, battled outside BAILESTON LASSIE in the stretch and
shook free inside the final sixteenth. HOPTOWN HONEY in the second flight from inside on the backstretch, was forced to keep the rail on the turn, altered
out three wide when her path was taken nearing the furlong marker, found best stride too late but caught BAILESTON LASSIE for second. BAILESTON
LASSIE took the lead and the inside soon after the start, edged ahead while just off the rail on the bend, was challenged again in the lane, moved back to
the rail upper stretch and slowly wore down in the late going. AFOOLER vied for the early lead from outside, took the turn four wide then flattened out for the
drive. INDICIA hesitated at the break, saved ground on the turn, fanned out for a clear path entering the lane, altered in to regain running room inside the
last eighth and passed some tired rivals. GHAALEB'S APPEAL forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch, began to yield fie wide on the bend. TIZ
HOPPIN displayed early speed between rivals but began to fade nearing the end of three furlongs. TAP'S LULLABY also hesitated at the stat, was without
early speed, though hustled along and steadily faded racing widest.

TALIS PARK GRAD was hustled along to keep in contention between rivals from the beginning, angled to the outside on the bend, came five wide into the
stretch, rallied and shook free with seventy yards to go. ONE PUTT RICHIE without early speed, lost ground widest through the turn, surged through the
lane, came up short but caught SHMILY for second. SHMILY pressed from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, fought
for the lead between horses but slowly yielded deep stretch. AZRAEL contested the early pace from inside, was outrun into the bend, steadied slightly when
his path was taken nearing the three furlong pole, came off the rail some, had a striking position with a furlong left but leveled off instead. PITAMAN
disputed the pace outside D'ARCHER but wore down the final furlong. LICHITA broke in the air then bobbled on her landing, was without speed, though
hustled along and never a factor. D'ARCHER vied for the lead from between foes, gained the rail into the bend then gave way the final three-sixteenths.
