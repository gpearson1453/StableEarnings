Footnotes
FOOT RUB LOVE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and edged clear in the final furlong
under a drive. CHECOTAH was off a step slow leaving the gate, moved up on the outside coming up the backstretch, challenged from the three path around
the turn, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. NICE AND TRUE dueled under a strong
hold up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and gave way between horses in the final furlong. SINGING ALLI pressed the
pace between horses early, dropped back while racing in the two and three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked in the
lane. SILVERA tracked the leaders between horses in the opening stages, dropped back to trail while saving ground around the turn, improved position
slightly in upper stretch and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
FAMA Y DINERO was sent for speed, set the pace while racing a bit keenly early, cleared into the turn, saved ground around the bend, and kept on in the
lane to hold while under a vigorous hand ride. RECKLESSNESS settled at the rear, raced in the three to four path at the rear around the turn, began to rally
past the five sixteenths, swung six wide under a drive into the lane, sustained his rally but was held at bay. MINISTRY OF ART tracked the leading pair
between horses early, chased between around the turn, was taken to the inside in upper stretch and bid under a drive, kept on in range to the sixteenth and
flattened out late. POWERFUL MAN settled near the rear, began to improve four wide from near the three eighths, swung five wide into the lane, and lacked
the needed kick. IRISH TUFF tracked the leading pair outside of MINISTRY OF ART down the back straight, chased three wide into the turn, tracked the
leader in a clear second past the three eighths, was driven three to four wide in upper stretch, and weakened while drifting in. TSALI prompted the pace
inside of FAMA Y DINERO in the opening half mile, did not accompany the leader as he opened up into the bend, chased inside around the turn, weakened
from the three eighths and had no more in the lane.

GO STORMIN GIRL chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, was forced to check hard at the three sixteenths
pole when HELEN MAE'S SONG drifted into her lane, switched to the outside and closed gamely to get up for the win in the final jump. HELEN MAE'S
SONG led the field between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, shifted in near the three sixteenths pole and dueled to the
wire, getting caught late. FLYING BUSINESS raced outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing in the three path
around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. HEY HEY settled in behind the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
gained ground mildly in the lane while never threatening. SHOWIT chased the leader in the early going, moved up to press the pace from the two path
around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and weakened between horses in the final furlong.

join the tracking flight three wide near the five eighths, bid outside of STACK SHACK into the the far turn, headed her at the three eighths, raced into the
lane between horses on a narrow lead and kept finding enough under a drive. GRAND PRIZE chased inside around the clubhouse turn, inched forward to
the inside of the tracking flight near the five eighths, tracked in close range in the two to three path around the far turn, came three wide into the lane, had
aim on the leader through midstretch but could not reel her in. KIMBERLY FRANCES settled at the inside of the rear flight, inched forward down the
backstretch in tandem with LAUNCH AWAY, saved ground near the rear around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, and kept on willingly while
proving no match for the top two. KITTEN ROCKS was hung four wide into the clubhouse turn, settled toward the rear, was waited with down the
backstretch as LAUNCH AWAY and KIMBERLY FRANCES inched closer, trailed in the four path on the far turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and
passed tiring horses. RANK AND FILE was fractious in the gate, tracked between horses through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, began to
flatten out in the three to four path past the seven sixteenths and continued to weaken in the lane. LAUNCH AWAY settled at the rear, inched closer in
tandem with KIMBERLY FRANCES down the back straight, raced toward the rear in the three path on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and
had no rally. STACK SHACK set the pace, was headed at the three eighths, kept in close range inside of ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM to near the five sixteenths,
and then emptied out inside.

MANGO TREE trailed the field from the three path around the first turn, began to move up on the inside while racing up the backstretch, navigated the far
turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground outside, pulled clear in the final furlong and held that margin to the wire.
MISTER CHARMING raced in the middle of the pack from the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the far turn, began a bid while swinging wide into the stretch and gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN saved
ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the far turn and weakened
in the final furlong, but managed to hold third. TWO COOKIE RULE dueled for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and into upper stretch and gave way with a furlong to go, just missing the show. EL MAS LOCO
raced into traffic in the three path and steadied slightly headed around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop
back while coming around the far turn, was pulled up in midstretch and walked off the track.

MOMENT was placed on the lead early, continued to set the pace while keen down the back straight, saved ground on a clear lead around the far turn, was
pushed along in upper stretch, felt the crop twice in midstretch but otherwise finished under a hand ride. ON A SPREE chased behind the tracking flight,
raced keenly under a tight hold near the five eighths, advanced into the far turn to track the leading pair three wide, raced three wide into the lane, and ran
on willingly to prove a clear second best. GITA'S LAD raced two wide with the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight,
continued to stalk the leader while positioned two wide on the far turn, was outkicked by the pacesetter while racing between horses into upper stretch, and
was outfinished for place. DIAMOND DAVE raced at the inside of the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, was slightly
outpaced by the leading group into the far turn and chased along the inside, went to a drive inside in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. JOLTING
JOE chased toward the rear, continued patiently down the back straight and with the rear pair in the far turn while racing in the three path, went to a drive in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC was unprepared at the start and came slowly into stride, settled at the rear, took
mildly closer order past the five eighths, raced in the four to five path on the far turn with the rear pair, came six wide into the lane and offered no rally.
HONEST TO GOODNESS settled near the rear, took closer order past the five eighths, was urged for a rally in the three to four path on the far turn, emptied
out five wide into the lane and drifted out.

LOVE THE NEST dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, took over while saving ground around the turn and was in command the length of
the stretch. COUSVINNYSACANUCK trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide to began a bid passing the
quarter pole, and gained ground on the outside down the lane while proving to ne no match for the winner. ADIOS ASHER was away from the gate quickly,
dueled on the inside up the backstretch, raced in tight quarters headed into the turn, dropped back to chase the leader while saving ground from there and
finished evenly while not threatening the top two. TRIGGER HAPPY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
came around the turn between horses in the two path, dueled in upper stretch and weakened late. LUCKY SHOT swerved out leaving the gate, settled in

Footnotes
CINDY'S G MAN was sent for speed, set the pace clear in the two path on the turn, continued clear in upper stretch, went to a drive midstretch, and held off
a late-running foe. PADDY'S HOUSE raced outside of EMPTY HOLSTER in the rear pair early, began to improve in the two to three path on the far turn,
was taken six wide into the lane, found his best in the final furlong, gained with a rush but missed. TUFF ATTACK chased midpack down the back straight,
was urged in the two path on the turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for PADDY'S HOUSE in the final furlong but kept on willingly
to prove best of the rest. EMPTY HOLSTER settled inside of PADDY'S HOUSE, raced in the three to four path with the rear pair around the turn while
outside of COMING UP ACES, swung six wide into upper stretch, and improved mildly past tiring foes late. DEORA STORE settled toward the rear inside of
COMING UP ACES early, saved ground near the rear around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch but lacked the needed kick. CRANKSHAFT
tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven outside of DEVIL'S RULE in upper stretch but proved no match for
the leader, chased on to the sixteenth and weakened. COMING UP ACES settled toward the rear outside of DEORA STORE, raced in the two path on the
turn in the rear pair, raced three wide with the rear group in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. SUPRISE CAT broke slowest but advanced to track
the leading pair inside of DEVIL'S RULE, steadily lost ground on the leading trio along the rail around the turn, and proved empty between horses in the
lane. DEVIL'S RULE tracked the leading pair outside of SUPRISE CAT, chased the leading pair in the two to three path around the turn, was driven in upper
stretch inside of CRANKSHAFT, and faded in the final furlong.
