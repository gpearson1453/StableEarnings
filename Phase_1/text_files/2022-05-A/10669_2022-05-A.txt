EASTBOUND N DOWN pressed on lead edging to daylight on the turn digging in near the rail in upper stretch abruptly swinging out near the sixteenth pole
using outside position to hold rival at bay late. SO COURAGEOUS went evenly through the turn rallying to threaten outside the leader in upper stretch only
to outmaneuvered losing that position late being held at bay along the rail. ISLAND CADGER pressed then chased through the turn weakening in upper
stretch holding the others with an even finish in the six path. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY fractious in the gate tossed the rider pre start, was away slow
playing no factor. OMEGA GOLD was bumped and carried out at the break, showed early speed then faded on the turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE
RIDER OF SO COURAGEOUS AGAINST THE RIDER OF EASTBOUND N DOWN FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS
DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
