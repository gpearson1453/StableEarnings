Footnotes
BOSSY BABY was mildly coaxed forward at the break, dictated terms on a clear advantage racing on or just off the rail, drew away when roused.
FABULOUS FORUM saved ground on the first turn, switched out heading up the backstretch, advanced past rivals three wide on the far turn but was no
match for the winner. GRAN MANNA was mid-pack two to three wide early, advanced three to four wide on the far turn and improved position. MS
HIGHSPEED settled well back in the two path, advanced inside rivals but off the fence on the far turn and improved position. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC shifted
in heading to the first turn then came out early on that bend, chased the winner three wide, weakened. ATTACKING GIRL was up close early three wide,
dropped back and faded. PARTYATTHECAPITAL stumbled badly at the start, raced three to four wide early, was never near enough to threaten. LITTLE
PET KITTY raced off the inside part of the track and was not a factor. WIN LIKE COACH P was outpaced. HOT LIL MESS raced mid-pack three wide,
pulled up and walked off.
