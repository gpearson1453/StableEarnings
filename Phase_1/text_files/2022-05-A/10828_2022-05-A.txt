Footnotes
TIZ NO CLOWN bore in in front of rivals soon after the break, went to the inner rail entering the turn, remained along the rail, raced on his left lead in the
drive and prevailed under brisk urging. COFFEEWITHCHRIS , steadied in close quarters soon after the break, swung to the three path approaching the
stretch and rallied mildly. DONTINVADEMYSPACE placed COFFEEWITHCHRIS in close quarters when forced in by TIZ NO CLOWN soon after the start,
chased the pace two wide around the turn and flattened out. MY MAMBA hit the inside of his starting gate stall when breaking awkwardly then circled the
turn four wide. ROSCO rail around turn, weakened. Following a stewards' inquiry and objections by the riders of COFFEEWITHCHRIS and
DONTINVADEMYSPACE, TIZ NO CLOWN was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
GOLD TIME VIXEN prompted the pace two wide under rating, bid outside the leader while in hand leaving the far turn, secured command leaving the three
eighths, opened up under a strong ride in upper stretch and maintained a comfortable margin while kept to task. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN , well placed
while saving ground in range and in the clear, angled out leaving the far turn, circled three wide with pursuit into the lane and kept on willingly to the wire.
POSTINO'S SECRET , taken off the rail for the backstretch run, settled off the pace, circled four wide under asking into the lane but failed to generate a
legitimate response. MISS MORENO took over inside foes into the first turn then cleared, set a rated pace towards the rail, was confronted leaving the far
turn, battled past the five sixteenths then weakened. LIFE IN FLASH lagged back, raced two wide into the lane, angled out in the drive but failed to menace.
ARBUTUS was hung out three deep early on while forcing the pace, stayed on to chase to the far turn then faltered.

mid way on the first turn, raced along the inner rail throughout and lacked the necessary rally. DAILY PLANET , steadied in traffic entering the first turn,
steadied entering the backstretch, raced in the two path, swung four deep in upper stretch and failed to menace. FORETELL prompted the pace outside
CALIFORNIA BELLA and weakened through the stretch. SAINTS VICTORY broke slowly, was outrun and raced three wide on the far turn.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE IRONY settled in the clear while saving ground, moved up into the lane, swung out past the three sixteenths, closed outside rivals to take
command inside the sixteenth pole, remained on his left lead and drew clear under a drive. RECYCLE had speed to the inside of rivals then rate back off the
leader around the first turn, was patiently handled as the closest pursuer into the far turn, eased out when advancing into the stretch, closed in and bid
between rivals near the sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner but kept on willingly to earn the place. POWER BACK took over between runners early
then opened up under some rating, set the pace towards the rail, was collared nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. HONOR MY WORLD
saved ground off the pace, angled out for the drive and had belated action. SAMUI SUNSET failed to menace. EMPHASIZE drifted in soon after the break
and steadied off heels, saved ground nearing the five eighths, angled out and failed to threaten. MIGHTY MEISTER settled off the pace, raced three to four
wide and was not a factor. ROOKIEOFTHEYEAR , squeezed back at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, lightly steadied into the far turn,
swung wide for the drive but lacked a bid. MR EVERYTHING gave early chase off the rail and weakened. TYLER TIME , three wide forcing the early pace,
remained a presence to the half mile marker and faltered.

Footnotes
WHAT SAY YOU took command soon after the break and then went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up after being set down in upper
stretch, kept on under a solid drive to about the sixteenth pole then was steadily hand ridden from there. DR RAGS stalked the winner while saving ground,
eased out in upper stretch, continued on willingly and was clear for the place. SCAREDY CAT , five wide outside rivals nearing the turn, steadied and got
out a bit soon after, corrected to chase well off the inside, angled six wide and churned on willingly while nabbing the show. CLEVER BOB broke slowly,
raced off the early pace, saved ground into and through the lane and finished with decent energy. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON , bumped at the break,
regrouped and raced four wide between rivals while in range heading to the half mile pole, steadied when shuffled into the turn, altered in after recovering
but lacked a serious finish. NO ME DIGAS angled down to about the two path early and chased, shifted four wide for the drive, had aim in upper stretch then
faded. NINETYNINE EXCUSES chased three wide, remained in range to about the three sixteenths then faded. CALLYOURIGHTBACK , bumped at the
break, moved up early between foes, steadied in close quarters into the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
I'M BLUSHING , a bit rank approaching the first turn, was in hand along the rail waiting for room, had ample room along the rail through the stretch, swept to
command inside the eighth pole and drove clear. EXCEPT TEMPTATION stalked the pace racing slightly off the rail, swung to the three path inside the
three sixteenths pole and rallied. QUIET IMAGINATION lacked speed, raced outside horses on the far turn, angled to the seven path in mid stretch and
rallied. WHY NOT TONIGHT , brushed at the start, steadied in traffic approaching the first turn, steadied in traffic on the far turn, checked to avoid a rival's
heels inside the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly. HOT CHOICE , along the inner rail throughout, was in hand waiting for room around the far turn,
found room along the rail through the stretch and rallied. HELLUVA LADY set the pace, was well off the rail in the stretch, tired and was eased late. MY
CANDY GIRL , three deep both turns, floated to the six path in upper stretch and gave way. WHO KNOWS WHAT prompted the pace outside HELLUVA
LADY and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT SERVICE secured the inside soon after the break and went clear, set the pace under a light hold, responded when set down two wide in upper
stretch, opened up a long lead in mid stretch and was kept alert to the wire. DEJOHN , soundly bumped at the break, edged up inside and angled off the
heels of the winner into the first turn, stalked the winner two wide, was under pressure pursuing into the lane and stayed on well. TEXAS TOWER , jostled
and pinched leaving the gate, regrouped and saved ground, edged up a bit nearing the half mile marker, eased out for the drive and kept on with some
interest. ROCKIN RON , four wide around the first turn, pursued three wide into the far turn and gave way. ILLUSTRIOUS drifted in and bumped soundly
with TEXAS TOWER, raced off the early pace, raced between rivals into the far turn and came up empty. REBEL VICTORY , three wide the first turn,
chased four wide outside rivals into the far turn, had no response soon after, faltered and was eased through the final furlong.
