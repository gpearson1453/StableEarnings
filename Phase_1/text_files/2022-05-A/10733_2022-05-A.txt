gamely and earned the place spot. ULTIMATE ANSWER tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail and was
outkicked for second. SALTY CANDY stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole and closed belatedly on the rail. TWO
YEAR CONTRACT was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. J M R JAX raced off the
pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
GOLD FORESTER stalked the pace, tracked on the turn, came three wide into the lane, angled out, rallied in the four path, gained a short lead passing the
sixteenth marker and then dug in gamely late to hold off the runner up. RAVEN ECHO steadied at the start, raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came
four wide into the lane, rallied outside, bid outside of the winner in deep stretch and was denied. CEDAR VALLEY stalked three wide, rallied three wide into
the lane, dueled and was outkicked. GREEN GABLES was bumped at the start, rushed up early to contest the pace, vied on the rail, briefly shook free at
the quarter pole, then dueled and weakened. THE HARD WAY was bumped at the start, chased two wide, raced inside on the turn, made a rail bid entering
the stretch, altered course at the eighth pole and finished evenly. STOLE THE RING was off slowly, raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came
three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ARRA GO WAN showed speed racing two wide, dueled and tired. LAILA'S CHARM stalked outside, came
three wide into the lane and tired. HUMORUS HOLIDAY chased inside and faded.
