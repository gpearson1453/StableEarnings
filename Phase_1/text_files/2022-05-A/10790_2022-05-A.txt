Footnotes
KAWACATOOSE showed good speed up the inside to set a pressured pace, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear, then remained clear to the wire
under mild right handed crop urging. SOUPER RIVER was rated along three wide early, made a four wide move at the quarter pole, lugged in through the
stretch while finishing willingly to be clearly second best. EXCEED was bumped at the start, then was settled early while being guided down to the inside,
saved ground throughout while improving position to best the rest. JACKIE'S PRIDE pressed the early slow pace and made a bid two wide on the turn and
then weakened in the drive. CHANCEL was bumped at the start and then was up on the pace in between horses early and then dropped back. BEYOND
BORDERS prompted the early pace four wide and then was three wide on the turn and put to a drive nearing the quarter pole and was empty.

DIXIE MORNING was allowed to settle early towards the inside, was boxed on the turn and by the quarter pole, eased off the inside and angled out leaving
the three sixteenths for racing room, closed nicely to edge clear late under a drive. EGBERT J hopped at the start, then made a four wide move on the turn,
took over nearing the furlong marker but was caught in deep stretch, held place award. FIRST ROUND PICK was reserved early, came five wide into the
lane and rallied. SPEED CHESS tracked the early pace and saved ground on the turn, lacked room by the three sixteenths, then got through on the inside in
the furlong grounds but needed more punch. TIZ BIZNESS set the early pace on the inside and faded in the drive. MUSKOKA SUMMER tracked the pace
from between rivals and weakened. DREAM NOW tracked the pace three wide and folded.

sixteenth pole, then gained command seventy yards out and edged clear to prove best under a drive. SILVER BULLET LADY set the early pace and then
floated out two to three wide leaving the turn, then shifted back to be two wide when straighten, dug in gamely in the stretch and dueled for command by the
sixteenth pole but could not hold off the winner late. THEODOROPOULOS stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but flattened
out, bested rest. GAYELETTE was off five lengths last, then made a four wide run on the turn and weakened. I HAVE AN IDEA chased the early pace on
the inside and weakened. BIG GINGER was settled early on the inside, shifted out and was four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had no

OUR SECRET AGENT stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn, drew clear to prove best under
right handed crop urging. BOARDROOM was off a step slow, settled towards the inside early, shifted out to be four wide on the turn, came four wide into the
lane and finished well to gain the place award. DREAMING OF DREW tracked the early pace, came three wide into the lane and then shifted to the inside
and had a late rally on the inside to gain the show award. ARTIE'S PRINCESS dueled for the early lead three to two wide, made a bid to shake clear on the
turn, then was headed by the winner leaving the turn, drifted out late while weakening, bested rest. MILLENNIUM FORCE was settled early and was three
to four wide on the turn and offered no rally. LORENA dueled for the early lead on the inside and weakened on the turn. DIRTY DANGLE chased the early

Footnotes
FULL EXTREME was well rated while two wide, drafted behind horses down the backstretch, shifted out three wide to make a bid on the far turn, then
continued that bid and edged away in the final sixteenth to prove best, driving. FARAWAY KITTEN set the pace on the inside and was well handled while
dawdling along, then was sent down leaving the turn and responded well but could not go with the winner late while staying on to be clearly second best.
JUAN PABLO was allowed to settle on the inside, then was three wide by the quarter pole but had no late kick. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was well placed on
the inside but lacked the needed winning bid. COLEYVILLE was reserved early on the inside, angled out ibn the drive and had no significant rally. TAOS
(FR) stalked the pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
ELEKTRONIC set a pressured pace on the inside, was headed leaving the turn but turned back that bid and drew clear to prove best under left handed crop
urging. AIM FOR THE SKY pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid leaving the turn but hung in the final furlong. SOUPER WATSON was reserved
early on the inside, swung out four wide for the driver and closed well late. GOZILLA was allowed to settle early, shifted out side on the turn and was four
wide by the quarter pole, offered a late rally but needed more. HAVE A SOUPER DAY stalked the pace three wide and then faded on the turn. EXECUTIVE
SIGHT chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
AMERICAN GAMBLE prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew out under mild urging to prove
much the best. ABSOLUTE JEWEL was void of early speed, came five wide into the lane and closed the gap fast late. SACRED DANCER was slammed at
the start, settled towards the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid but needed more, bested rest. AERONAUTICA hopped at the
start, then chased the pace four to three wide and faded. SHE MAKES ME TIZZY tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. INFINITE PASSION was
settled early, then saved ground on the turn, angled out in the drive and had no rally. WALTZOFTHESAMURAI broke in bumping SACRED DANCER at the
start, went up to set the pace on the inside and gave way in the drive. FREE CARRYCOMB was settled four wide and failed to menace.
