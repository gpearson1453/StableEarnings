Footnotes
THERE GOES HARVARD raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, bid two wide with three furlongs remaining, dueled into the stretch, put away
inner rival with a furlong left to run and widened to the wire. VANTASTIC lost his path briefly early, went up outside a rival and rated in the two path, chased
between foes through the far turn, tipped out in the lane and bested the rest. TIDAL FORCES stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, lost
a clear path and altered out a bit at the eighth pole and kept on to earn the show honors. MOODY JIM (IRE) set the pace on the inside, took pressure on the
far turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HUDSON RIDGE threw his head and broke slow in the beginning, traveled
between runners at the back around the clubhouse turn, moved out a bit and rounded the far turn three deep and could not rally. SWORD ZORRO (IRE)
reserved in the early going from inside, tipped two wide on the far turn and weakened in the stretch run. IRIDEO (ARG) was off slow to begin, raced three
deep early then moved out a bit further on the backstretch, entered the far turn four deep, moved into the three path around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
STRESSED set the pace from inside with company alongside, maintained a short advantage through the turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew away
under right-handed urging then coasted in late. FOUNDER'S DAY forwardly placed outside the top pair early, spun three wide into the stretch, could not
make any headway on the winner but bested the rest. AVENTAPP took a bump from inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace from outside into and around
the turn, lost touch in upper stretch and flattened to third. GIRL RANGER broke a bit slow, sat off the pace up the backstretch, went two then three wide on
the turn, moved out a bit further in the lane and improved position. ROSES AND CANDY showed early speed three deep and between rivals then got
shuffled back near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SHE LOVES KARAOKE was off slow and bobbled at the start,
pulled the rider to a forward position on the inside, urged right handed exiting the bend and could not respond. WESTWARD BREEZE broke out and
bumped rival in the beginning, settled inside, tipped out a bit but lacked room into the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
THIRSTY JOHN was closest in pursuit early, bid outside the leader into the turn, took over past the three-eighths pole, put away GOLF DRAMA exiting the
turn and drew away under mild urging. GOLF DRAMA took control early from inside, dueled along the rail on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper
stretch and kept on for a clear second. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING got squeezed back in the beginning, rounded the turn three wide and gained the show.
SMOKIN AMELIA chased along the rail through the turn and failed to respond to urging. MY MAN BIGGIE broke slow from outside, trailed five then four
wide on the turn and failed to menace. KRIXUS FLASH came away slow, raced near the back four then three wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) stalked inside then two wide into the stretch for the first time, steered back to the rail and remained there to far turn, tipped out late
on the final bend, took aim at the leader and drew alongside in midstretch and proved best late to win clear in the end. QUEEN GODDESS took control early
from the rail, controlled the pace through the early stages, saved ground to the stretch, led into the final furlong but could not stave off the winner in the final
sixteenth. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE got crowded between rivals and shuffled back to last early, unhurried through early going, crept closer three deep on
the far turn and four wide into the stretch, drifted to the inside in the lane and needed to find more late. CARPE VINUM prominent early three deep into the
first turn, drifted out a bit crossing over the dirt, stalked in the two path then three wide around the clubhouse turn, went three deep on the backstretch,
chased between rivals entering the stretch and weakened. COVER VERSION raced up close between foes into the first turn then stalked the QUEEN
GODDESS from the two path, lost ground exiting the backstretch, dropped back around the final turn, eased through the lane and walked off.

RESPECTFULLY showed the way up the backstretch with company alongside, held command through the turn, cleared into the stretch, inched away and
held well under right-handed urging. HARPER'S GALLOP broke a step slow to begin, traveled in range outside a rival into the turn, came three wide into the
stretch, finished willingly but could not get by the winner. DRAW ME angled to the inside while racing near the back, tipped two wide around the bend,
steered out in the lane, closed well and earn the show. INVINCIBELLA (GB) broke well then settled inside off the pace, roused in upper stretch but lacked
room behind rivals and was forced to check midstretch, gained a clear path and kept on to earn a minor award. STORMING LADY traveled between rivals
off the pace, angled out and went four wide into the stretch and could not threaten. FLYING TO THE LINE stalked inside to the stretch, urged along the
fence and lacked the needed response. RESPECT MY CANDOR sat off the pace outside a pair of rivals, exited the turn five wide and could not rally. SUITE
MADAM BLUE prompted the pace from outside into and around the turn, failed to keep with the winner into the stretch and weakened. NORTHERN GEM
broke a bit slow and dropped back, trailed up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, came out exiting the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TROUBADOUR pressed the pace from outside, challenged around the far turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, got overtaken by PALAGIO at the eighth
pole, fought back from inside and dug down deep to edged that rival in the closing moments. PALAGIO rated along the first turn from inside then tipped two
wide, stalked the top pair through the middle stages, angled out on the far turn and bid three deep into the stretch, gained command with a furlong
remaining, fought with TROUBADOUR in deep stretch and got outgamed. GO JOE WON cleared and angled from the three path down to the rail on the
clubhouse turn, set the pace with TROUBADOUR alongside up the backstretch, dueled with that rival through the far turn, relinquished control in upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. ONE MORE BID stumbled badly leaving the gate, took up soon after, pulled around the first turn, came four wide
into the stretch and could not rally. LORD SHELDON raced three wide into the first turn then got forced out to the five path, managed to steered back in a bit
around the bend, raced outside a rival then off the rail up the backstretch, entered the far turn three wide, came five wide into the stretch and made no
impact. Q B ONE pulled the rider along then shifted out into the first turn, lost ground around the second bend and tired.

Footnotes
AGREETODISAGREE reserved in the early going, traveled two wide then along three path into the stretch, rallied from outside, surged late three deep and
got up in time. FLORAL ESSENCE sped clear and moved inside, roused midway around the far turn, met the challenge from WITH THIS VOW at the eighth
pole, resisted through the final furlong and was able to hold on to share the victory. WITH THIS VOW broke in and bumped rival, stalked in the two path
through both turns, took aim entering the drive, bid outside at the eight pole, fought through deep stretch and missed between rivals in a blanket finish.
ROSE'S CRYSTAL took up soon after the start then steered down to the inside, tipped out leaving the far turn, steered out further in upper stretch,
summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. VIRULENTE (FR) unhurried two wide then tucked in on the first turn, raced a bit off the rail into the
stretch, tipped three wide in the lane and needed to find more late. SKY ON ICE bumped and got shuffled between in the beginning, trailed to the far turn,
lacked room into the stretch, angled to the inside and showed a mild rally to advance. DREAM PRINCESS settled three wide early, raced three deep up the
backstretch, went three to four wide into the lane and faltered. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT tracked along the rail through both turns, cut the corner into the
lane and flattened out. BRITTLE AND YOO got bumped leaving the gate, rated three to four wide around the first turn, entered the far turn two wide, eased
out and exited the bend four wide and never responded to urging. SONG OF FIRE bumped with inner rival at the start, traveled three then two wide around
the first turn, went three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out and raced eight wide in the lane and failed to menace.
