BUSTER BRUNO pursued the dueling leaders three wide, sustained gradual gain and wore down pacesetter late under steady handling. LAST MINUTE
MARIO vied outside with a narrow advantage then led to the final stages in a game debut. PORSUPUESTO forced the pace along the rail and weakened
slightly in the final furlong. TOLEDO GOLD trailed early then angled out on the turn with a mild bid. BULLS IMAGE saved ground close up early then began
fading on the turn. LEA'S ROAD lacked speed saving ground and gave way readily.

SAILOR AGAIN dueled along the rail, shook loose after half a mile then stayed safe under constant urging. MASTER OF WAR lacked speed, angled wide
on the turn and closed well too late. BIZZY GILLESPIE vied with the winner outside to midway on the turn and finished willingly. AGNELLI saved ground off
the leaders and continued well to the finish. VERO SUN chased between rivals and flattened out in the stretch. GO HUSKIES raced three wide throughout
and gradually faded. DON'T RECALL turned his head inward at the start breaking far behind his field then trailed throughout. The stewards conducted an
inquiry into the incident at the start.

front inside, moved clear on the turn, was collared battled to the finish. BLUNT FORCE well placed outside, was asked for run on the turn then went evenly
late. TWIRLING WIND broke alertly then dropped back outside and lacked a rally. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT trailed for half a mile, raced very wide and was
no factor. SIZZLING ROMA saved ground, passed rivals then faded in the stretch. MAKEAJOYFULNOISE stumbled at the break, raced between rivals and

TONAL VISION reserved off the pace, moved out on the final turn, hooked the pacesetters then drew away in the stretch. CHELSEA WALL dropped far
back inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. MOONCHILD quickly moved clear, widened before half a mile then came up empty in the lane.
SUGAR STREAK pursued the loose pacesetter outside, was asked for run on the final turn but flattened out. SOLID GOLD DANCER broke alertly, forced
the pace inside then gave way in the stretch. BRAVO REGINA trailed early, bid briefly closer wide before half a mile then stopped. GOD STILL LOVES ME
saved ground and was finished early.

DERBY HOUSE wide early, advanced on the final turn, led into the stretch and edged away under steady urging. SILVER EDGE stalked the dueling leaders
outside, led at the quarter pole, was collared and continued gamely in the stretch. FLAT OUT FLYING steadied in tight near the three eighths pole, angled
wide on the final turn then closed well late. COMMISSIONER G lacked speed inside, swung extremely wide into the stretch while no factor. FAST BOB
raced off the pace between rivals and was blocked inside at the top of the stretch. BRETT'S WORLD dueled outside for five furlongs and gave way.
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM settled three wide then faded on the final turn. OVER SENSUAL dropped back early and was far back throughout. RUFFY earned a
narrow advantage inside then was finished on the final turn.
