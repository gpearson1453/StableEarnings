Footnotes
CARSON'S PRINCESS stalked the pace in the two path throughout while well in hand was asked on the turn and drew clear through the stretch under mild
urging while much the best. RUNAWAY HENNY trailed the field while racing off the rail for the first half made a wide run through the lane for second while
never a threat to the winner. LIMITLESS MAZIE broke towards the inside rail took the advantage from the outset on the inside while pressed throughout by
Carson's Princess held gamely to the final turn but then gave way and could not hold second. DREAMIT chased the duel on the lead for the first half mile
but then backed up and was not a factor. DIXIE LOVING raced well off the pace while well off the rail and never mounted a rally and was not a factor in the
outcome.

SWEET RACHEL stalked the pacesetter in the two path took the lead on the turn drifted out through the stretch but had enough to hold off the late run of
the runnerup. CALLEN FEELS GOOD raced in the two path on the turn came wide through the lane and was making up ground but ran out of distance in a
good effort. ON TILT sprinted from the gate and was able to get the lead along the inside was stalked on the outside by the eventual winner and tired
through the stretch while drifting out. ROBTADI STORM raced along the inside drifted out through the stretch and could not make up the needed ground.
SPIRIT SOUL was always towards the back of the pack while racing four wide never mounted a serious bid and was not a factor. I LIKE DREAMING broke
in very sharply towards the gap spotting the field about ten lengths and was never a serious factor after that.

POST CLOSE raced three wide the entire race while in contention came out even wider through the lane and was just up in the final strides under strong
handling. CAP ROCK MINER showed the best early speed but raced off the rail was given a breather up the backstretch opened a clear lead and was under
a strong drive through the stretch but was caught in the final yards. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS raced along the inside towards the back for much of the race
angled out turning for home then came back to the inside through the stretch and was gaining ground. GUITAR SLIM was off the rail between foes for much
of the race while in the two path early then forced three wide turning for home showed some late interest but was outfinished. HARDCORE FOLKLORE was
along the rail and close to the lead up the backstretch but had little left and faded. CABO'S RUMOR was in tight along the rail going into the first turn
dropped back and was never a factor after that.

JUST PASSING THRU was in the two path in a tight pack up the backstretch was able to find a hole along the rail as the leader raced in the three path
came through to engage for the lead opened a good lead entering the stretch and was able to hold sway. MADAM HENNY raced three to four wide the
entire race drifted out a bit through the lane but was able to get up for second. SERIOUSLY SASSY showed the best early speed and was able to clear the
field and get to the front while racing at least three off the rail allowing the eventual winner to slip through u[p the backstretch battled gamely but gave way
through the stretch. MISS KENNEDY was along the inside just off the leaders in a good p[osition but had no rally through the stretch.
MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA raced three wide for much of the race in mid pack but had no rally through the strtech. COUNTRY TIME was pinched back into
the first turn losing several lengths came back along the inside up the backstretch to get into contention then tired in the final turn. FASHION MOON raced
five wide the entire race while well behind the field and was not a factor.
