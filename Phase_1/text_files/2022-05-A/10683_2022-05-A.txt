Footnotes
MILLEFEUILLE set the pace in the two path while inside of a pressing rival, showed the way while well in hand around the turn, drew off when let out a
notch entering the lane, and widened under light urging. HIGH FASHION tracked three wide, came under a drive while in striking range into the turn, took
the bend in the four path, got floated to the five path while failing to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, but stayed on to secure place in midstretch
before flopping back to her left lead in the final furlong. LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH lagged well behind the field into the turn, produced a quick rail blitz while
launching a rally turning for home to cut the gap, stayed on to bid for show entering the final furlong, and claimed that position while leveling off. SUPER
CHIANTI prompted the pace two wide, but came under a drive to keep pace leaving the three furlong pole, failed to do so while drifting to the four path
entering the lane, and gave way. IF YOU PLEASE stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home. BLAZING STAR (GB) tracked the pace two wide
and from between horses, but gave way with three furlongs remaining.

BABY QUINN pressed the pace two wide, vied in the three path passing the three furlong pole, led approaching the lane, drew off at the furlong grounds,
and was kept busy under a stiff drive through the late stages. NAVAL OFFICER tracked in the three path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch to be
outside of the leading pair, chased a clearing BABY QUINN after flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and reached place entering the final
sixteenth. LUNAR ROCKET was pinched back between horses at the start, took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, and stayed on while chasing
NAVAL OFFICER through the lane. TEO set the pace, led inside of the pressing eventual winner around the turn, but was headed approaching the quarter
pole, and gave way in midstretch. OFFICER NICK broke a bit inwardly at the start, raced far back in the three path around the turn, drifted to the five path
entering the lane, and surpassed tiring rivals. JOYFUL CANDY raced in midpack in the three path, but made little impact. LEAGAL was void of early speed,
got taken back mildly between horses passing the eleven sixteenths pole to trail the field soon after, and got outrun. STUBBORNKINDAFELLA was
forwardly placed along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair at the half mile pole, and steadily faded.

Footnotes
CURBSTONE vied two wide approaching the first turn, remained in the two path after clearing his inner counterpart around that bend, inched a clear margin
into the far turn after his outer presser gave way, then drew off in upper stretch and was driven home to seal the deal. JEEPER stalked along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, managed place while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and lasted for that position
from an outer rival late. GATE RUNNER tracked four wide around the first turn, took aim on the leader from the three path around the far turn, but failed to
keep pace with that one in upper stretch, chased between horses through midstretch, kept on to re-challenge for place in the late stages, but was kept at
bay. PIONEERING SPIRIT laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out into the far turn, tracked from the four path around that bend, inched closer while
fanning five wide turning for home, but leveled off in the final furlong without menacing. CONSULATE tracked two wide and between horses, checked lightly
among those foes into the far turn before being slightly shuffled back behind a tiring ONE MORE BABY at the three furlong pole, then shifted four wide
entering the lane, but lacked a bid. MADISON LUVS DUKE saved ground in midpack, shifted off of the rail turning for home, but only managed to chase,
and faltered in the final sixteenth. SCATTERSHACK lagged behind the field two wide, cut the gap around the far turn, improved inside of rivals entering the
lane, but failed to menace. ONE MORE BABY pressed the pace three wide, but faded between horses into the far turn. DEPUTY CONNECT was keen to
place behind kickback early on, raced off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, then tired in the four to six path turning for home. CRYPTIC
CODE lagged behind the field, and showed little.

Footnotes
NIGHT TIME pressed the leader from the outside while in the three path, vied in the four path in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds,
drew clear approaching the final sixteenth, and held sway. COLTONATOR tracked along the inside, shifted five wide entering the lane, and rallied in the
final furlong to reach place late. VERB set the pace in the two path, resisted NIGHT TIME's challenge through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong
grounds, gave way approaching the sixteenth pole, and lost place late. ON YOUR MARK tracked two wide, tipped four wide entering the lane, but only
offered a mild kick, and flattened out in the final furlong. THANKS MR. EIDSON laid close up in the two path, was restrained back via a snug hold to rate
along the inside approaching the turn, but only managed to chase inside of the leaders through upper stretch before fading. JAMMERS JUSTICE was
outrun.

ENCHANTED NILE set a clear pace in the three path, met SARIAH SARIAH's bid entering the lane, repelled that foe at the furlong grounds, and drew clear
once again. MALIBU MARLEE laid off of the pace in the three path, and stayed on to reach place between horses at the sixteenth pole. MATT'S HONEY
took up in tight quarters at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and moved up between horses late. SARIAH
SARIAH tracked in the five path, bid for the lead outside of ENCHANTED NILE entering the lane, but was turned away at the furlong grounds, and
weakened. AURA stalked outside of the leader while in the four path, failed to keep pace with that foe and an outer rival entering the lane, keep ton to re-bid
for place at the sixteenth pole, but faltered soon after. STROLLIN THE BAYOU tracked two wide, chased in the six path around the far turn, but weakened.
KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked inside, but was through after a half mile. FUNNYBET was done early, eased up in midstretch, and walked off.
