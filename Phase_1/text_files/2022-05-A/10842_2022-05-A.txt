Footnotes
UNCLE ARMANDO broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, swept to the front near the quarter pole,
quickly drew off and widened under mild urging through the final furlong. CHAO steadied entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace, steadied nearing
the five-sixteenths marker, angled three wide turning for home and finished willingly to be clearly second best. SKYWALKING trailed two wide for six
furlongs, swung six wide in upper stretch and was along for the show. MACK stalked the pace two wide and faded in the lane. EXPONENTIAL failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. NEVERSTOPDREAMING was up close inside while a bit keen around the first turn, moved up between rivals early
on the backstretch, pressed two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, briefly led near the five-sixteenths pole but wilted in the lane.
BOLDNESS set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

OLD TIME REVIVAL grabbed the lead soon after the start, showed the way in the two-path, and was driving to remain in command. HIGH YIELD KITTEN
chased outside the winner throughout, and held for the place on his left lead. THE ICE BEAST was no menace through a ground-saving trip. NEW YORK
STYLE raced four wide and lacked a rally. JOE DI BAGGIO broke a step slow, stayed close between horses into the turn, was taken widest in upper stretch
and failed to fire. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

while racing five wide. SHADILEE was outrun while racing three wide. MS BIG SPRING had brief speed and retreated four wide around the turn.

stalked the pace two wide, angled in nearing the head of the lane, bid inside of the pacesetter, took the lead late and lasted for a share of the win. INTER

SEPTEMBERTEN at the start, raced well back four and five wide and rallied widest. LUDINGTON tracked the pace three wide, stayed on through the lane
but was outkicked by several. SEPTEMBERTEN bumped with UNIVERSAL PAYDAY at the start, raced two to three wide and never threatened.

METEORITO settled off the early pace two wide, angled out early on the backstretch, bid four wide around the far turn, took over turning for home, dueled
outside of CASH IN A FLASH to deep stretch and drove clear. BACKCHAT saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the
place. CASH IN A FLASH set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner in upper stretch, vied to deep stretch and weakened late. BIG AND
CLASSY stalked the pace two and three wide and faded through the lane. EXCHANGE DAY was outrun inside. AZTEC chased the pace two and three wide
and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
DOMINEERING hugged the rail in midpack on the turns, tipped to the three-path into the stretch, responded well and was up in time outside rivals. ASTERS
D'ORO set the pace inside, dug in when challenged by CRYSTAL COAST a quarter-mile out, and fought gamely to the finish. JAZZY T saved ground at the
back to the far turn, swung widest for the drive and was gaining steadily late. CRYSTAL COAST tugged her way along three wide early between horses,
lodged a bid outside ASTERS D'ORO on the far turn, battled through a long drive and was outfinished between foes. BALL LIGHTNING was four wide on
the first turn, stayed in range to the stretch but lacked a late kick. ALPHA BABE broke slowest, raced three wide much of the way and failed to factor.
MOON OF LOVE (IRE) prompted the pace two wide for a half-mile, and faded. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
