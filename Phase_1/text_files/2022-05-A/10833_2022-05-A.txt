UNCLE CURLY chased along the inside from afar as the leader spurted clear down the backstretch, remained patiently handled coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to roll by the leg weary leader seventy yards from home and inched away to the finish to prevail.
MR. KRINGLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and closed well to get up for the place
honors in the final jumps to the finish. MISSIONATTHESPA spurted away on the pace in hand along the inside, widened away into the turn and remained
patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole, grew a bit leg weary inside that station and
was overhauled with seventy yards to go and held safe for the show honors. MASETA chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. BARREL OF QUESTS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home, offered no response. COURAGEOOUS OH LA broke out at the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the
inside through the far turn, came under coaxing midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. JUMPSTER bumped after the start by
COURAGEOOUS OH LA, chased three to four wide until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SEAVER vied four then three wide with a pair of rivals coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command a
furlong out, dug in under late threat and willingly held safe to prevail. MISTER CHAIRMAN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled out seven wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. BE THE BOSS hustled from the gate, vied from the two path inside a
pair of rivals, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared a furlong
out, weakened in the late stages while just preserving the show honors on the wire. BOINTHEBACK hustled from the start, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and offered up a mild bid. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. SUIT OF ARMOR
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late going. ELECTROLYZER broke a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. LORD BROWNIE struck the right side stall at the start getting away awkwardly,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered
no response. MY GAL VAL hustled from the start, vied three then two wide between foes under coaxing from the three-eighths, began to fade near the
quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. RAW COURAGE stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground, chased
five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and tired. MY INSPIRATION
chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. ABLETON coaxed from
the gate, chased along the inside under urging from three furlongs out, went three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

HEELS TOGETHER away without apparent mishap, dove over to the rail a short distance before the end of the backstretch, kept within range travelling
around the bend, worked her way to the outside after getting set down spinning into the lane, getting into the five path by the three-sixteenths marker,
gained on the front runners in a steadfast manner, struck the front with approximately a sixteenth remaining and edged clear, kept under a ride. AFILADA
broke a length the tardiest, was along the inside route well before completing the journey on the backstretch, was briefly steadied after closing into close
proximity of the winner late on the bend, cut the corner into the stretch and saw the pilot go to work, rallied with willingness to secure second. TEKILA in
hand prompting the pace towards the two path, slipped into path four during the initial stages of the stretch run, lacked a winning bid. U CANT HANDLE
THIS placed under a snug hold after securing the front end in short order, showed the way from the inside route, feeling the presence of a twosome on the
outside, was set down to a hard drive heading into the stretch, got reeled in with about a sixteenth to go and weakened. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT rode the
rail, was asked to pick it up by midpoint on the turn, swung out five looking for position in upper stretch, responded mildly afterwards. SARATOGA
COMMANDO attended the pace three wide until the furlong grounds before giving away. FLEUR ELYSE bumped lightly with POSITIVE SUM after bobbling
in the shadow of the gate, chased the pace three wide, backed away steadily six wide down the stretch. POSITIVE SUM made contact with FLEUR ELYSE
shortly after the field had been sent off and running, pursued the pace three to four wide on he turn, the widest of all, entered the stretch, was kept to active
handling for another fuirlong before finishing on its own power.
