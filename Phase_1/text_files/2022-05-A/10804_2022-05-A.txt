RIDING IN THE WIND trailed for six furlongs, responded readily when set down, went around IT'S A MANS WORLD past the quarter pole, dropped inside,
got through along the rail to make the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under left handed urging. GRAD BASH allowed to settle, offered a bid four
wide on the far turn and finished well clear for second. INSPIRED TO ROCK stalked the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly three wide then came up
empty. SCHMULTZY pressed the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. IT'S A MANS
WORLD broke in front, set a pressured pace along the rail for five furlongs then stopped.

IAMGOINGTOSHINE broke in front and set an early pressured pace, gave up the lead before the turn, came on again two wide to regain the advantage
nearing the top of the stretch then drew off to win as much the best. PAYTON PRETTY never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path and finished
clear for second. BUSYBEING FABULOUS pressed the early pace two wide then went evenly. SWEET OUTLOOK bobbled a few strides out of the gate
then was in tight along the rail, rushed up inside rivals to gain a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then weakened.
DISCREET ENERGY had good early speed then faded. BEAUTIFUL VICTORIA trailed.
