Footnotes
SLEEP OVER was sent leaving the break and set the early fractions, was engaged by DI LAURIAN nearing the half-mile marker, contested the pace with
that foe to the quarter marker, was able to repel the runner-up into the stretch and edged clear in the end. DI LAURIAN attended to the early pace,
advanced on SLEEP OVER along the backstretch run, continued that gain into the second turn, gave a bit of ground to the winner in upper stretch and
could not close the gap in the drive but was best of the rest. HAWK'S RISING stalked the early pace, was two then three wide into the backstretch run,
maintained that three wide path into the far turn, lacked a late bid in the stretch run but was clear for third in the end. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE crowded
ALLEYCAT at the start, was unhurried in the early going while just off of the rail, continued to save ground into the second turn and mounted a mild late bid
in the drive but could not make an impact on the top three. ALLEYCAT was crowded at the start by BUBBLES IS ON FIRE, settled just off of the pace while
three wide on the first turn, maintained position into the second turn and did not offer a late response. FOUR O'FIVE settled off of the early pace, lugged out
entering the second turn to go four then five wide nearing the quarter marker and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HEAVEN SHINES tracked the quick pace from an inside position on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, advanced to confront HOLIDAY HUSTLE
nearing the eighth pole, responded to firm urging in midstretch and drew clear in the end. HOLIDAY HUSTLE was sent along the inside leaving the break
and took command of the fast early fractions, extended the lead nearing the quarter marker, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker and
could not hold off that bid and was oukicked, while besting the rest. MAKE MINE WINE chased the fast pace two wide into the turn, was outrun in upper
stretch and lacked a late rally, while well clear of the rest for third. MILEYS BLUECAT bobbled at the start and was off slowly, saved ground while chasing
the leaders through the turn and did not make an impact in the end but showed late interest in the stretch. MESA EMPIRE lacked early speed to the turn,
was steered three wide along the turn and was not a factor. CHUMLY contested the quick early fractions to the turn, lost ground approaching the quarter
marker, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT was hustled leaving the break and took command of the early pace, was pressed through the turn while carving out fast
fractions, shook free in upper stretch, was kept to task through the lane and drew clear in the end. BLUE WILDCAT chased the early quick pace from the
midflight, advanced four wide on the turn, was outkicked by the winner in the drive but held safely in the end for second. SMILING THUNDER broke out at
the start and was off slowly, chased the pace from the inside on the turn, closed in the stretch run and held safely for third in the end. TIZ A TIGER was
shuffled at the start and off slowly, lacked early speed while saving ground, was unable to make an impact in the stretch but improved position in the final
furlong. AUTISM INNOCENCE chased the early pace, gained ground three wide nearing the top of the stretch but could not go on with that bid and flattened
out in the late going. LOUD FUSAICHI broke out at the start, was sent along the inside to press the fast early pace to the turn, kept pressure on the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and faded late.

Footnotes
ENJOY IT STRAIT was forwardly placed early on while stalking the solid fractions, was roused two wide nearing the top of the stretch, overtook COOL
ACCLAIM In upper stretch and edged clear while holding the runner up at bay in the final stages. YOU KIDDING ME saved ground while racing in the
midflight through the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, was two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, carried QUIDPROQUO
JOEBLOW out approaching the top of the stretch, was outfinished in the late stages while on the left lead but was clear of the rest for second. COOL
ACCLAIM contested the early pace then took command into the backstretch run, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off the
winner leaving the turn and gave way, while holding for third. QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW saved ground early on while settling toward the rear, was three
wide on the second turn while in traffic, was carried out to four to five wide at the top of the stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker but flattened
out in the late stages. THE LONNA RANGER settled just off of the early pace while two wide, lost position while four wide on the second turn and did not
offer a late rally. RESURRECTED NOBLE settled off of the early pace while just off of the rail, improved position in upper stretch but lacked a late response.
FANTASTIC DREAM was unhurried in the opening stages, saved ground into the second turn and was not a factor. TOO TALL TO CALL contested the
early pace, ceded the lead along the backside, lost position on the far turn and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
LIAM'S SECRET was off a step slowly, chased the quick pace along the inside, gained ground on the turn, angled out leaving the bend, quickened in
midstretch to overtake the leading pair and drew clear in the end. COASTARANDO chased the pace three wide into the turn, closed in midstretch, was
outfinished by the winner in the final stages but held for the place over an oncoming rival. PREMIUMONSATURDAY broke in a tangle and was off slowly,
lacked speed to the turn, was three wide nearing the top of the lane, made a good late rally and just missed for second while clear for third. SHOUT IT OUT
attended to the early pace, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, dueled with JANERO ROSE to the eighth pole but lost position in deep
stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. ZAKKIYYAH chased the quick pace, was two wide on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way.
JANERO ROSE was sent leaving the break and showed good early speed while setting the pace, was confronted by SHOUT IT OUT nearing the quarter
marker, dueled with that foe to the furlong grounds, could not hold off the winner leaving the eighth pole and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
SWEET TALKED was never far back while just off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, loomed three wide along the second turn,
confronted RUN FOR MY HONEY in upper stretch, wore down that rival through the lane and drew clear in the end. RUN FOR MY HONEY was sent
leaving the break and contested the early pace, shook free of PACIFIC ZIP along the backstretch run and opened a clear lead into the second turn, met the
bid of SWEET TALKED at the top of the stretch but was worn down in the drive by the winner and was best of the rest in the end. J AND M EXPRESS
saved ground while allowed to settle early on, advanced on the second turn while three wide, was outkicked in the drive but kept on in the final stages to
secure third. PACIFIC ZIP was prominent early on while contesting the early pace, was a bit keen to go on on the first turn, was under a tight hold into the
backstretch run and ceded the lead to the pacesetter along the backstretch run to stalk the pace, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. SURFLINE settled off of the early pace while midpack, improved position along the backstretch run, continued to advance on the second turn while
four wide but lacked a late rally in the drive. FLIPLIT settled off of the early pace while two wide, came three wide along the second turn, passed tiring rivals
in the drive but did not threaten. ICY BREEZE was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn and lacked a late rally. SWEET DUCK was a bit keen
early on while in traffic on the run into the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run, came two wide on the second turn and gave way in the late
stages. FILLY PELLI was forwardly placed early on while saving ground, lost position along the backstretch run, steadied approaching the three furlong
marker while still on the inside, dropped back along the second turn and lacked a late response.

EVENEREVENWORSE away quickest of all, established a commanding lead, increased that lead around the turn, felt late pressure but held safely in the
end. FAR WEST was off a step slowly then took up a few strides out of the gate when bothered somewhat by CANONBALL COMIN, switched to the outside
path while well behind the field, then made a nice run through the lane to gain the place. SATANTA allowed to settle into stride, rated near the back of the
pack, started a four-wide move into the turn and made steady progress to just nip IMPICITLY for third. IMPLICITLY took a rail path behind the early speed,
checked slightly while waiting for room along the rail, swung out into the three-path entering the stretch and ran on but got caught in the last jump by
SATANTA for the show. JEDI KNIGHT was hustled from the gate and angled in to join the early leaders in the run to the turn, was passed by
CANNONBALL COMIN after a quarter, regained the second position from that rival coming out of the turn and was outkicked in the late stages.
CANNONBALL COMIN broke a step slow then encroached the leader while not being asked, was well placed around the turn but had little to offer when the
running began and faded quickly to the rear.

Footnotes
SEATTLE BOLD contested the early pace then took command into the backstretch run, set solid fractions into the second turn, opened a clear lead into the
drive, was put to steady encouragement through the final furlong and felt late pressure but held safely to prevail in the end. MEMO DADDY (CHI) settled in
the midflight while two wide on the first turn, maintained position into the second turn, found traffic nearing the top of the stretch, tipped out four wide for the
drive, finished well through the final furlong and could not reel in the winner late but was up in time for the place. LOAFERS BOY settled off of the early pace
while saving ground, improved position while three wide on the second turn, swung widest into the drive to be six wide at the head of the lane, found his
best stride late and was just edged out for second. SECRET CLUB was unhurried early on while two wide, was blocked behind horses nearing the quarter
marker, swung five wide into the drive, was shut off nearing the eighth pole and altered course, closed willingly in the final sixteenth but was outfinished by
the top three. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) stalked the early pace while two wide, gained ground three wide on the second turn to come within aim, was outrun in
upper stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was forwardly placed early on while saving ground, lost position on the
second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the late going. SAL N LOUIE settled along the inside while running in the midflight, lost position
along the backstretch run, continued to save ground into the second turn and did not mount a late rally. DRAW THE FOUL contested the early pace with
SEATTLE BOLD, took back along the backstretch and stalked the pace to the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and faded through the final stages.
KOWBOYKABIN settled off of the early pace while three to four wide, lost position along the backstretch run, came four wide along the second turn and
lacked a late response. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN UPPER STRETCH INVOLVING SECRET CLUB AND
MEMO DADDY AND RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH. ALSO, THE RIDER OF
SECRET CLUB LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF MEMO DADDY AND THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MR. MISCHIEF was sent along the inside and edged to a narrow lead in the early stages, steadily extended the lead along the turn and into upper stretch,
was given a few reminders through the lane and drew clear in the end. DANNY MICHAEL was in tight while in traffic in the early going, chased the pace
three wide through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was no match in the end for the winner but finished well and held on for second over an
oncoming rival. HOLIDAY AROUSAL lacked early speed, improved position on the turn while four wide, found his best stride in the final furlong and just
missed in the end for the place, while clear of the rest for third. HAKUNUI was up close early on while contesting the early pace, came four wide on the turn,
gave ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the drive. WEAR THE CROWN chased the early speed outside of rivals, lost ground while five wide
midway through the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. DICK BEST brushed with PEQUENO AVELITO after the break, then
was bumped again but still challenged for the early lead, chased the pace between rivals while three wide through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and
faltered in the late going. THE CALABRESE KID took up when PEQUENO AVELITO and DICK BEST came together in front of him, dropped back to last on
the turn, improved position in upper stretch and offered a mild late bid in the drive. WHISPER AND WINK was bumped at the start and was away slowly,
lacked speed to the turn, was steered six wide into the drive and did not threaten. GLORIOUS CITY took the rail path and settled behind the dueling leaders
but was done after a quarter and showed little thereafter. PEQUENO AVELITO broke outward after the start, brushing with DICK BEST, then bumped that
rival once again a few strides later causing him to bother DANNY MICHAEL, joined a contested early pace to the middle of the far turn, dropped back in
upper stretch and faded in the late going.
