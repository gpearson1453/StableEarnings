Footnotes
VICIOUS VELMA was in complete control in a soft pace while one out from the rail was challenged both from the inside and outside on the far turn but had
plenty left to draw clear for the win. C C'S FREEDOM had the perfect rail trip throughout as the winner raced one out from the rail made a bid on the inside
on the second turn but could not match strides with the winner and was clearly second best. RECKLESS SERGEANT broke to the three path the entire race
made a bid on the outside on the second turn but gave way entering the stretch. C C'S COWGIRL raced along the inside in the early stages came wide on
the second turn but had little to offer in the stretch run. YOUR MEMORY broke a step slow had a two path trip but steadily faded.

Footnotes
CALAJA broke best and had the lead from the outset was quickly challenged by Kalliniki and they were head and head almost the entire race was headed
several times but came back to win very gamely. KALLINIKI hooked up with the eventual winner soon after the start of the outside and the pair raced as a
team for almost the entire race exchanged the lead with the winner several times but could not hold off the winner in the final yards. GOLD INCLUDED was
in the perfect striking position behind the speed duel came three wide for the leaders and was making up ground but flattened out through the stretch. VITA
raced along the rail for much of the race came out for the drive but could not make up the needed ground. BOBBIES REASON raced along the inside the
entire race never mounted a rally and was outrun. SUPER LEGS raced in the two path into the first turn and steadily faded while not a factor.

steadily drew clear through the stretch for the win. WOMAN WITH A BOOK made a three wide move up the backstretch to get into contention going into the
far turn but could not hold off the winner through the stretch. TUNE MY GUITAR made a big move three wide on the second turn to get into contention but
could not sustain the rally and was tiring some in the lane. LUCKY STREAKER raced along the inside and caught tired foes in the later stages.
PERFECTURE showed good early speed along the rail held gamely to the top of the stretch and then gave way quickly. THIRTYSIX G'S showed good early
speed into the second turn and then backed out quickly in the second turn.

Footnotes
SEE SASSY RUN was away in good order and had the early lead but allowed to settle just off the pace in the two path made a move into the turn and then
held sway while challenged to earn the victory. MILA'S GOLD raced mid pack in the two path going into the far turn made a four wide bid to get into
contention but could never go by the winner. AIR GUITAR STAR chased the pace in a good position in the two path but could make little headway through
the stretch. MISS BILLIE K took the lead in the first turn and held the advantage along the inside until the turn for home and then gave way through the
stretch. G'S DEADLINE raced in tight quarters between foes for much of the race and had to back off a but into the far turn and had nothing left after that.
EXACTA made a three deep move on the backstretch was on the outside at the top of the lane veered in then back out after that and lost ground. LIL
ASHLEY B. was away very slowly spotting the field about five lengths losing all chance and could not make up the needed ground after that. MOLLY
GOLIGHTLY raced along the inside mid pack but faded into the second turn and was not a factor.

MY HARBORS DREAM stalked the pace up the backstretch then came on in the two path and drew clear for the win while drifting out a bit. SON CARLOS
sprinted to a good lead going into the turn but was no match for the winner through the stretch while clearly second best. BLUME chased the pace while off
the rail and could never make up ground on the top two but held third. HE'S GOT THIS broke a bit awkwardly and raced along the inside angled out for the
drive and was making up some ground in the three path. MR. B CAUSE was in the back of the pack two wide and never mounted a serious rally. MR. K W
raced three wide on the turn while mid pack and then faded. ROOSTER RUN was four wide mid pack on the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
CREME DE BALI was quick away from the gates and had the inside was hooked up with Calabash in a head and head duel for much of the race but edged
clear through the late stages for the win. CALABASH showed good early speed and was the outside horse in the battle on the front end but could not match
strides with the winner late but held second. FRONT PAGE was wide on both turns then swung towards the inside for the stretch run and made a mild bid
between foes in the stretch to get third. SPACE ODESSEY was carried out three wide in the first turn then made a sweeping three wide move into the
second turn but could not sustain that rally and flattened out through the stretch. ANICLUDE raced three wide into the first turn then came four wide into the
stretch and could not make up ground. THUNDER ROAD was along the inside and came out a bit into the first turn continued on the inside but could not
make up ground in the stretch. MY CALL raced along the inside the entire race and had little to offer in the stretch. MAYBERRY SALOON was away a step
slow to trail from the outset raced along the inside and never made a serious challenge after that.
