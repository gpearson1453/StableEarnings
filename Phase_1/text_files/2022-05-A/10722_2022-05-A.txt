MARKETABILITY settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, took over past the five sixteenths pole and widened in the three path on the far turn,
then kept alert through most of the lane. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL saved ground racing well back from early contention, started a bid nearing the three eighths
pole, eased out to the five path on the far turn and took second toward mid-stretch. DUBAI WAS LIT settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and maintained position in the three path of the far turn, then weakened. CHEESE LOUISE rated the pace inside, came
under pressure at the three eighths pole, was caught leaving the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. MY
EXPENSIVE GIFT stalked off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn.

the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. HOLY PINK engaged in close early chase, ran in the three and four paths of the turn then dueled through
the stretch for second. PRINCESS MIA ROSE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted into the lane then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. GOLDEN GLOW gave chase, ran off the rail on the turn, angled to the outside leaving the turn and passed rivals
widest. LUNAR NOTION pressured the early pace but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the turn then weakened. SO STORMY

SEE YA MANANA stalked in the three path the first turn then challenged at the three eighths pole, took a slim lead three wide approaching the quarter pole,
raced at even terms through the far turn, dug in determinedly to take the nod from Stowe Angel mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to just last. THE
BETTER ONE settled off the early pace saving ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in through the final
furlong but just missed. STOWE ANGEL showed the way most of the opening quarter mile then stalked inside from the nine sixteenths pole, challenged at
the three eighths, contested at a close disadvantage at the rail on the far turn, dueled at even terms through the upper stretch but relented the final
sixteenth. MISS WAVE took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, was met at the five sixteenths, contested the turn between
horses then weakened in the lane. BOUNDTOBEOK rounded the opening turn about the four path and stalked leaving the turn, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn.

SUGAR DADDY bore out early strides then rated the pace when straightened away, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the
edge at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. CIELO AZUL rated just off the pace inside, picked up the chase approaching the
three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn but had to settle for second best. UNEQUIVOCAL was forced outward to about
the four or five path into the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole then flattened the final sixteenth. CAPE LOOKOUT was forced outward to
about the five or six path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and showed little further.
LOST IN MANHATTAN bore out entering the first turn then settled off the pace and saved ground on the far turn.

HAPPY CHAMP took over at the rail into the first turn and rated a slim lead, was met nearing the seven sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn
then steadily encouraged through the lane. BRIAN'S AVENUE saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on
the far turn, eased out entering the stretch and finished well. HE'S NOT CURLY saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn in the four path, left the turn in the six path then dueled through the stretch for third. WALL raced well off the pace in the two and
three paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BROTHER SKYE
saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sxiteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. BUCKED TOOTH stalked in the three path,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened. SILVER CASTLE stalked two deep, challenged
toward the seven sixteenths pole then weakened on the far turn. DAMISELA rounded the opening turn about the five path and was never a factor. This race
was hand timed.

COMBINATION rounded the first turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced
close three wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead toward mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. OUT OF CENTS dropped back from early contention
and saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and was steadily encouraged to take the nod for
second under the wire. OUTLIER rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure and dueled at mostly even terms from the three eighths pole, contested the
edge at the rail on the far turn, was caught toward mid-stretch then missed the nod for second under the wire. TRINGALE raced with the pace and
challenged at near even terms toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep through the far turn but dropped back past the
eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth.

DRIVE BY LAYOVER rated off the pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn, dueled
clear past the eighth pole and held well under steady encouragement. JASONTAKESLONG stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
took a brief lead nearing the quarter pole, was caught midway on the turn, dropped back past the eighth pole and settled for second best. ELVIRUS stalked
inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and showed little more. DUDE AND
JUMPER rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and passed some
tiring rivals. MIDNIGHT SHIFT steadied lightly soon after the start, rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn still about the three path and weakened into the lane. DIVINING DANCER showed little response. PAYITO closed to the front
approaching the three quarter pole, moved to the inside into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole,
