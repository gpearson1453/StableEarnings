Footnotes
SAFE TRAVELS was a bit keen while saving ground around the first turn, settled on the lead while racing up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, turned back a challenge in upper stretch and maintained a comfortable margin to the wire. WESTERN SKIES chased the leader from
the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to pursue while saving ground around the far turn, challenged the leader at the top of
the stretch and chased that rival to the wire. COME WHAT MAE saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
began to improve position from the rail while racing around the far turn and finished evenly, just holding third place. SHE TAKES FLIGHT veered out leaving
the break, raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained
some ground mildly in late stretch, just missing the show. BOMBARRA GOLD raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and weakened late.

HELEN MAE'S SONG was sent for speed, saved ground around the turn, was engaged by FLYING BUSINESS to her inside and G CITY WARRIOR to her
outside in upper stretch, began to edge clear of them approaching the furlong mark, and spurted further clear when driven past the eighth pole. FLYING
BUSINESS tracked the leader inside of G CITY WARRIOR down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, bid inside of HELEN MAE'S SONG
into the lane and loomed in upper stretch, proved no match approaching the furlong mark, but chased on inside to prove narrowly best of the rest. G CITY
WARRIOR tracked the leader early outside of FLYING BUSINESS, continued to track the pace between horses around the turn, was asked from the five
sixteenths, raced three wide into the lane, loomed in upper stretch, proved no match for the pacesetter approaching the furlong mark and was outkicked
between horses for the place. LADY ATLANTIC settled at the rear early, advanced outside foes approaching the half, chased three wide around the turn
and four wide into the lane, and chased on under a drive while being ultimately outfinished for the place. HEY HEY settled near the rear early, raced at the
rear of a compact group in the three to four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the lane and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
JOY ENAMORADA broke outward, stalked the pace outside of DANCING BARBIE down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, raced four wide
into the lane, cleared in upper stretch, and maintained her advantage while kept to the task. CAIRO SUMMER settled at the rear, hugged the rail on the
turn, began to take closer order from the three eighths, was urged inside into the lane and bid in earnest, shied out near the rail in upper stretch, was put in
tight when NEW CHINA angled inward in upper stretch, veered out and bumped soundly into NEW CHINA's hind quarters, continued to bolt outward six
paths, cutting in front of DRAGONFLY KISSES and forcing HARD LIKE HOLLY further out, straightened out, and finished full of run under a drive. NEW
CHINA tracked the pace inside early, was taken back near the nine sixteenths after running up close behind DANCING BARBIE, chased the leading trio in
the two path on the turn, raced two wide into the lane, came slightly inward in upper stretch putting the already shying CAIRO SUMMER in tight to her
outside, was bumped soundly in the hind quarters as CAIRO SUMMER darted out, regained his stride once she cleared CAIRO SUMMER, chased on
willingly but was ultimately outfinished for the place. HARD LIKE HOLLY was bumped by DRAGONFLY KISSES in the opening strides as a result of JOY
ENAMORADA breaking outward, sent forward to stalk the pace three wide, tracked the leading pair in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the
lane, was forced further out by CAIRO SUMMER when that foe veered out, and kept on mildly past tiring horses. DANCING BARBIE was sent for speed, set
the pace while prompted into the turn, saved ground around the bend, was driven three wide into the lane, and flattened out. DRAGONFLY KISSES was
bumped by JOY ENAMORADA in the opening strides, settled in second last, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane,
checked in upper stretch when CAIRO SUMMER ducked out in front of her, and was allowed to trail home. THE TRAINER OF NEW CHINA CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST CAIRO SUMMER, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. ADDITIONALLY, THE JOCKEY OF DRAGONFLY KISSES
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CAIRO SUMMER, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

KID'S INHERITANCE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the three
sixteenths pole, gained ground and pulled clear near the wire. DIVE DEEP dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn,
continued to battle gamely down the lane and was caught late. IGNITED bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack
on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, brushed lightly with ROMAN POET
near the three sixteenths pole and gained ground steadily from there. COMISKEY PARK dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the
turn, continued to battle down the stretch and gave way late. ON K P bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began to improve position in upper stretch, veered in at the eighth pole and finished evenly from
there. FROOME (IRE) trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved
position on the rail in the stretch and was outkicked. ROMAN POET pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leaders
between horses around the turn, brushed lightly with IGNITED in upper stretch and faded from there. SUPRISE CAT raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. TEE BURNS pressed the pace on the outside in the early going,
entered the turn in the four path, ran out to the middle of the track shortly after and was empty from there. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.

despite being carried out by that foe, and got up in the final strides. W W COOKIE MONSTER was sent for speed between horses, cleared past HUEY
ATTACK to his inside and dueled inside of VALIANT VINNY, saved ground around the turn while still disputing terms, shook clear of VALIANT VINNY in
upper stretch, gamely clung to the lead in the final furlong while drifting out, but was caught in the final jumps. WHAT'S UP DUDE settled two wide in the
rear flight, swung six wide into upper stretch, chased under a drive, found his best in the final sixteenth, and got up for show in the final strides. DEVILEYE
settled at the rear inside, saved ground through the turn in the rear flight, began to rally approaching the quarter pole, improved up the inside into the lane,
flattened out slightly in the final furlong and lost the show late. ARCHIEMYBOY tracked the leading pair while racing keenly early, chased the leading pair in
the three to four path on the turn, raced five wide into the lane, and weakened. GHAALEB'S BIG WIN was fractious in the gate, settled near the rear three
wide early, continued toward the rear in the three path on the turn and into the lane, and mustered no bid. VALIANT VINNY was sent for pace, dueled two
wide to the head of the stretch, proved no match for W W COOKIE MONSTER , and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
COYOTE ROAD tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path racing around the turn, took over entering the
stretch and maintained his margin to the wire. ROCKET HOTSHOT dropped back to trail the field from the rail up the backstretch and around the turn,
switched to the outside in upper stretch and got rolling late, gaining ground steadily to the wire. THRILL RIDE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and chased the leader home, finishing evenly. LAPIS LAZULI raced off the pace on
the inside up the backstretch, ran into traffic while saving ground around the turn and was forced to steady slightly, found room to gain ground between
horses in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. ALEBRIJE raced off the pace between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the
two path, made a mild improvement of position in upper stretch and flattened out from there. MARQUEE RIDE raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked from there. TALKTOEACHOTHER opened up a clear early lead while
racing up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired in the lane. DUST DANCER chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and tired turning for home.
