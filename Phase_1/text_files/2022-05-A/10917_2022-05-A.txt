sixteenths pole and tired. CONGRATS ANSWER was urged close up between rivals early then faded on the turn. DIAL A LADY hustled up inside down the

GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN stalked the dueling leaders, bid three wide on the turn, collared the pacesetter and was just up after a long battle. SEA FRET
dueled in the two path, was challenged again in the stretch and resisted in a game effort. DECISIVE CAUSE ducked out early, angled to the rail, angled
wide in the stretch and flattened out. TANGERINE DREAM earned a narrow advantage inside, vied through the turn and faltered. ARUMA was ordered a
late scratch at the gate on the advise of the track veterinarian.

Footnotes
LITTLE HARBOUR stalked the pace outside, moved very wide into the stretch then surged clear late in middle of track. MANOLETE saved ground
throughout, loomed a threat in midstretch but was outfinished. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, led briefly in midstretch
then tired. MR FANTASY sprinted clear inside to the stretch then faltered badly. NOON TIME GEM angled inside when trailing early and lacked a rally.
STREET TAIL was roughed between rivals in the opening eighth, moved outside and faded. GRAVEL ROAD dropped back wide and raced far behind
throughout.
