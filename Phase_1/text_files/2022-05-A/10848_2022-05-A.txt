COLD AS YOU dueled for the lead with OUR CLOVER GAL, battled heads apart into the lane, dug in gamely in deep stretch and edged by. OUR CLOVER
GAL dueled inside of COLD AS YOU for the lead, fought on gamely from the inside and got nipped on the wire. SHAITAAN hustled up three wide around
the turn, sustained steady response through the lane and prevailed for a share. ISA'S NIGHT FLIGHT roused up the rail around the turn, stayed inside down
the lane and lacked the needed surge for impact. DONNA'S HOPE was outrun in early stages and passed tiring foes in the lane. REMITTANCE SENT
chased in contention then weakened. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS showed brief response then faded.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MELODY sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, turned back the bid from KASA mid-stretch, cleared command then drifted
inward under right handed encouragement and impeded the progress of rail running PEGGY RULES. PEGGY RULES chased inside around the turn,
launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, began to inch up the inside of ANGELS MELODY in late stages, got in tight quarters and steadied when
aforementioned rival drifted in losing all momentum. ADD IT ALL UP hustled up along the rail into the lane, sustained steady response and got up late for a
share. KASA was the closest pursuer of the early leader, launched a bid for rival leaving the turn, raced in striking distance mid-stretch, brushed with foe
then flattened and got edged for show. TAPTHATLUCK raced off the early speed, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally.
EBONY PEARL chased near midpack and weakened in the stretch run. RAISIN RAISIN raced in contention around the turn then tired in the drive. THE
STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND RIDER OF PEGGY RULES LODGED CLAIM AGAINST ANGELS MELODY, AFTER REVIEW ANGELS
MELODY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH

ROME stumbled at the start and recovered quickly to duel for the early lead, showed the way by a slim margin around the turn, came three wide into the
upper stretch and pulled away while ridden out. BUZZER chased the top trio in the opening quarter, hustled along three wide around the turn, continued to
chase after the clear winner and settled for second best. R SERENGETI vied inside of the eventual winner, could not match with rival at the head of the lane
and weakened to show. OH LITTLE BRUTHA showed brief response then folded up.

Footnotes
SPEEDOMETER vied inside of DEMIDANU for the early lead, shook free leaving the three eighths pole, cleared on top and came two wide into the upper
stretch, hustled along two wide in the drive and held late. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR was allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
launched a rail bid at the furlong marker, steadily edged up closer on the winner and ran out of time. HARTLEY rated just off the early pace, made a three
wide move near the quarter pole, sustained steady response down the stretch and prevailed for a share. DEMIDANU vied inside of the winner up the
backstretch, could not match strides mid-way around the turn but stayed in pursuit then fattened in the final furlong. DYNAMIC MIMI raced in the last flight,
chased two wide around the turn and lacked a rally. MISS HARD KNOCKS raced in contention off the top pair in early stages, chased two wide around the
turn then gave way.

Footnotes
PRIVATE LAKE vied for the lead heading into the backstretch, dueled with MIGHTLY GHOST around the far turn then shook free entering the lane, turned
back several challengers through the lane and held firm. ASTUTE WARRIOR rated just off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the far turn, angled in
to race two wide at the furlong marker, sustained steady response and gained place. ALWAYS A CATCH settled through early stages, made a two wide bid
around the far turn, angled to the inside in the lane and got edged out late for place. ROCK CITY ROADHOG settled through early stages, made a move
three wide near the quarter pole, continued a four wide bid in range a furlong out then ran on evenly. CLIFTON PARK was reserved racing in the back,
hustled up two wide around the final turn and lacked a rally. HOLIDAY MAN rated not far off the early pace, saved ground around the final turn then gave
way. MIGHTY GHOST tracked near midpack up the backstretch, dueled with the winner around the far turn then tired in the drive. MITZRAYIM dueled for
the lead with the eventual winner around the first turn, matched strides up the backstretch then faded.
