Footnotes
SOMMER VELVET stalked the pace around the turn, advanced in the two path entering the stretch, gained command in upper stretch and held sway under
brisk urging. ROCKINHIPPIECHICK , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and rallied. LOVE RAN
RED lacked speed, raced between horses in the stretch, moved up to mid stretch then flattened out. MISS FOXANN , four wide on the turn, lacked the
necessary rally. DIXIELAND DANCER , a forward factor three wide around the turn, weakened. LA FAMILIA accelerated to the early lead, hugged the inner
rail and faltered in mid stretch.

Footnotes
ELOQUENT LADY sped clear early, set the pace off the inside, began to wander outward leaving the far turn, continued to drift out in the lane but held firm
under a drive. PARCHED GHOST , four wide, moved closer past the five sixteenths, kept on willingly through the drive and out finished JOYFUL NOISE for
the place. JOYFUL NOISE , three wide early, dropped in some leaving the far turn, edged up to have aim mid turn, gave hard chase past the eighth pole,
kept on with effort but was out kicked for second. RUN AWESOME TIZ bobbled inward at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, angled out
near the quarter pole but came up empty. MARVELLA NASTY , towards the inside, failed to respond mid turn and faded. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL , off slow
then steadied, was urged four wide around the turn but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GHOST STALKER broke alertly and saved ground into the first turn, angled out soon after and stalked in the clear and under some coaxing, moved up and
bid three deep heading into the far turn, responded to firm asking and kicked clear approaching the stretch, shifted in and opened up under a hearty drive in
upper stretch then held firm while kept to task in the final furlong. THREETHEHARDWAY , patiently handled while saving ground, took closer order leaving
the five sixteenths, swung out past the five sixteenths, made a bit of a run at the winner nearing mid stretch, flattened out but was well clear of the rest.
EXCALIBUR , off the pace, was under pressure between rivals near the five sixteenths, angled five wide and churned on while nabbing the show. PAY THE
KID lagged inside, angled out under a ride for the drive but could only muster up a mild rally. JAMMIN STILL prompted the pace two wide, moved between
foes to apply more pressure after a half mile, held a slim lead leaving the far turn, dueled to the inside of the winner past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly
to upper stretch then gave way. HAYNE'S FEVER had a wide trip pursuing and failed to respond. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN cleared early, set the pace
towards the inside, was joined past the five eighths, battled into and around the far turn, failed to keep pace leaving the five sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
ICY REPLY sped clear in the opening furlong, set a rated pace in the two path, opened up a long lead after being roused in upper stretch and continued to
widen under a solid hand ride. ILLUSION OF HOPE reared behind the starting gate unseating her rider, regrouped and showed speed to the inside of the
winner, eased back to the inside of rivals leaving the far turn, stayed inside to advance to mid stretch, angled out and came back on gamely to get up for the
place. HARPER'S DO , three deep chasing leaving the far turn, circled four wide with some run into the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch, switched
over to her left lead in deep stretch and was out kicked for second. SHE'S A TRIPP , between rivals nearing the three eighths, shifted out for the drive and
offered a mild response. MEJORAMIGA , off the pace while saving ground, swung six wide in upper stretch but lacked a serious bid. SUPERIORITY chased
two to three wide and faded in the final furlong. KISSES FOR HANNAH , off slowly after veering in towards the gap, recovered and raced well back while
saving ground, eased out in the drive but failed to menace. PETITE ROUGE , sluggish from the gate, lagged back four wide nearing the half mile pole and
failed to threaten.

FANCY PRINCESS bumped with MONARCH BEACH soon after the break, gained a three deep lead on the turn and drew off through the stretch under
steady handling. DATE NIGHT KISSES saved ground around the turn chasing the winner and herded out two rivals when drifting out in mid stretch.
FORTES , in the three path around the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and bumped CAMELIA ROD when herded out by DATE NIGHT KISSES in
mid stretch. CAMELIA ROD , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, raced four deep turning for home and was bumped by FORTES when that one was
herded out. MONARCH BEACH , along the inner rail turning for home, bumped with MAIL CALL in upper stretch, suffered a catastrophic injury during the
gallop out and was euthanized on the track. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL , along the inner rail down the backstretch, was outrun. MAIL CALL showed speed well
off the inner rail, gave way and bumped with MONARCH BEACH in upper stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of FORTES,

Footnotes
THE GRASS IS BLUE bobbled slightly at the break then steadied off the heels of MARGIE'S HEAVEN, regrouped and relaxed four wide and in range of a
spirited pace battle, was given her cue leaving the the far turn and picked up the pace, circled four to five wide into the lane, responded to some right
handed asking, leveled off nicely near mid stretch, forged to command a sixteenth out and drew clear while steadily hand ridden. PAISLEY SINGING broke
a step slow, recovered and was sent up towards the rail and engaged MARGIE'S HEAVEN, dueled and poked a head in front leaving the far turn, shook
clear into the stretch, widened a bit past the three sixteenths, drifted out and gave way grudgingly. MARGIE'S HEAVEN dueled outside PAISLEY SINGING,
ceded the lead leaving the far turn, stayed on to force the issue to mid stretch and faded. FOGGY DREAMS , off the pace while saving ground and under
urging, swung out for the drive and had a belated response.

Footnotes
SAX , three wide on the turn chasing the pace, challenged for the lead outside MO FIRE in upper stretch and drew off under a hand ride after her rider
dropped his whip near the eighth pole. MO FIRE , rank leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and weakened the
final furlong. NO MORE MASK raced between horses most of the trip and finished willingly. MARKET OF STOCKS lacked speed, circled the turn four wide
and failed to rally. MIZ THE BEST , no factor, swung to the six pace in upper stretch. SALTY SAUL hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened
through the stretch.
