Footnotes
TEMPLE OF LIGHT tracked the dueling leaders off the inside, saved some ground second turn, shifted back out when straightened for home bothering a
tiring FORT BONZ and brushing with GOTTATAKEHIMTO inside that one, split foes late to challenge, dug in final strides to narrow prevail. CUSTOMIZE
MY QUEST broke alertly, alternated up front closest to the inside, garnered a briefly larger advantage in upper stretch, responded when confronted by the
winner and a second foe late, stubborn to the end. GOTTATAKEHIMTO unhurried moved out and advanced three wide in the second turn, brushed nearing
the furlong grounds with the winner, late bid outside, not enough. MISTA VALENTINE went one paced throughout while saving ground, lacked closing bid.
FORT BONZ away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, was beginning to weaken in upper stretch when bothered by the winner, continued to tire
to the wire. UNBRIDLED PULPIT trailed throughout in showing little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
NORTHERNREFLECTION broke in to help pinch back TIME TO MOVE, came in soon after forcing FLASHBACK WIND into the gap, settled in the second
flight toward the inside, moved out a bit and advanced on the leaders entering the stretch, long drive to the wire, narrowly gained the nod at the wire in a
determined effort. CHARLIE G broke in, advanced to the front while firmly in hand past the wire the first time, dueled up front off the inside, narrowly showed
the way into the stretch, continued to do battle inside the winner the final furlong, narrowly missed in a game effort. FLASHBACK WIND floated into the gap
by the winner soon after the start, steadied, fell back, moved out and staged a mild rally to annex the show, no threat to the top two. FAHAN broke on top,
dueled up front outside, began to weaken turning for home, continued to tire the final furlong. TIME TO MOVE pinched back at the start, moved up to race in
the second flight three wide, finished after half. FOLLOWING CLAIMS OF FOUL BY BOTH THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF FLASHBACK WIND AGAINST
THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MAD GOLD closest to the dueling leaders, ranged up to collar that pair three wide into the lane, drew steadily clear while kept to pressure.'. DOUBLE ON
THE RED sluggish leaving to trail early, came four wide out of the turn when beginning to rally, finished willingly to be clear for the second spot, no threat to
the winner. R T'S IRON MAN in mid pack off the inside, between rivals into the lane, shifted out a bit the final furlong to be up for the show. PRODUCTION
TIME dueled up front from along the inside, led into the stretch, weakened when headed by the winner. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT lacked early foot, made
little impact through the lane. STARSHIP FESTIVAL broke on top, set or forced the pace in the two path in dueling, stopped stretch, jogged in late.
DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY finished early, fell back, well beaten.

Footnotes
HOORAY AUSTIN broke back, saved ground into the turn, advanced through the bend, steered out once straightened for home, closed with good energy to
be going away at the end. SMOOTH COLLIERY in the second flight off the inside, came three wide for the drive, rallied for the place while unable to match
strides with the winner late. ROCKY BAR SIX alternated up front off the inside in the run up the backstretch, held a narrow advantage into and through
upper stretch, unable to contain the top two, narrowly saved the show. CHIMNEY ROCK lacked early foot, came four out to five wide exiting the turn,
displayed some moderate interest out in the course to be gaining for the show. MUCHO MARVIN went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response
while four wide into the lane. COCO TIGER dueled up front closest to the inside for three furlongs and faltered. CHANNEL WON was finished early. COROT
in the second flight outside the runner up, four wide turning for home, gave way.

Footnotes
KAPPA HILL hopped at the start, settled well off the early pace, steady advance before a half, collared the leader into the lane, in turn was headed a
sixteenth out, battled back in determined fashion. US SECOND CUTE PIE chased the early leader, relinquished the runner up position to the winner into the
lane, went after that one and gained a brief lead inside the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going to lose the advantage. CRAFTY PRINCESS settled off
the pace and the inside, advanced three wide into the lane, lodged a late bid while widest of the first flight at the wire, not enough in the final strides.
CUSTOM MAIDEN lunged just prior to the start to break in a tangle while detained by the start, trailed, improved position. SOCIAL DATE settled in the
second flight, had little for the drive. MOMENT TO DREAM sprinted well clear to hold a sizable early advantage, continued to show the way up the
backstretch by a wide margin, faltered when headed and stopped in the drive. TOOSIE was detained at the start, finished after a half, far back, distanced
after losing contact with the field through the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, BOTH CUSTOM MAIDEN AND
TOOSIE WERE DECLARED NON STARTERS. MUTUEL PRICES WERE MISTAKENLY BRIEFLY POSTED WITHOUT REFLECTING THE TWO NON
STARTERS BEFORE CORRECTED PRICES WERE REPOSTED.

Footnotes
DEER CROSSING unhurried early, moved out, came four wide into the lane, exchanged bumps with SY MICHAEL several times to the wire, proved
narrowly best to gain the nod. SY MICHAEL settled off the pace, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, gained the advantage, came out to
bump with the winner then exchanged repeated contact with that one to the wire. BATTLE OF WILL lacked early foot after breaking back, early advance,
took over nearing the furlong marker, proved no match for the top the final sixteenth. SCORING DRIVE chased early, fell back, saved ground second,
improved position through the while not a threat to the top three. PORT O' CALL settled in mid pack soon after the start, lacked a closing response.
FORGED IN STEEL off a step slow, moved up race in the second flight, tired. BIND FAITH sprinted clear to set the pace, vied late second turn, gave way
when headed in the drive. STARVICTORY off slow, trailed well back, never close. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH THE STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SY MICHAEL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
THROUGH THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

STRONG BEAUTY away in good order, pressed the issue up the backstretch and into the turn, took over nearing the furlong marker, drifted out when clear
soon after, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. SCARLETT O'HARA void of speed, came on the outside for the drive, rallied
willingly to be up for the place. LADY HOPPER within striking distance off the inside, came three wide for the drive, closer inside the furlong marker,
outkicked for the runner up position. DIXIE LADY broke on top, sprinted clear soon after, showed the way into and through the turn, began to weaken when
headed in upper stretch. HALF KOO KOO raced back, made little impact through the stretch. SOPHIE'S PRAYER last away, moved up to mid pack, was
finished before three furlongs.

Footnotes
PAYTONSATTHEPLATE unhurried while outside, advanced, three wide bid into the lane, long drive, firm handling. COINMAKER in the second flight off the
inside, challenged between horses and inside the winner turning for home, extended, outkicked for the win late while showing good mettle in annexing the
place. GIRLS COUNT broke alertly, clear early, dueled up front the middle part, continued battle into the straight closest to the inside, gave ground
grudgingly to the wire, saved the show. LONE STAR DIVA in the main body while racing off the inside, switched to the far outside nearing the furlong
grounds, finished well to be getting to the top three at the wire. TOP TEN DUCHESS settled in the second flight, lacked a closing response in the drive.
OUR LITTLE GIRL chased the early, began a steady fade before a half. BEYOND D'ORO dwelt start to spot the field several lengths, trailed throughout.
