Footnotes
FOOLISH HEART, in touch attending a rival's pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue through the turn, took over entering upper stretch and
steadily widened under firm encouragement. CELESTIAL ORB was rated between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide racing through the turn and
continued well enough to prevail for the place honors. KENAI COOL, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn,
couldn't gain terms with the winner and was outkicked for second. THE OTHER CAT, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the outset
into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SUNDRENCHED tracked off the first flight inside rivals in the opening stages but dropped back early. CROWN
OF JOY was never a factor.

Footnotes
VALID EXCHANGE tracked the leaders four wide, then three wide in second flight racing to the turn, made a steady advance entering upper stretch to
challenge for command leaving the furlong marker, wrested the advantage under right handed pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. CPOWER
shifted off the rail in early stages while being urged pressing the pace, dueled for command past midstretch, couldn't match the winner but edged a rival for
the place honors. BASTIEN LE BROWN settled last on the backstretch, swung out to the four path racing into upper stretch and found his best stride late to
close the gap while prevailing for a share. CHRISTMAS PRESENT tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, tipped off the inside
racing through the stretch and continued willingly three deep between foes while missing for a share. LAST INVESTMENT angled inwards to force the pace
outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and yielded in late stages. IBERICO raced between foes in second flight but retreated early.

TONY SMALL broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage between foes racing
into upper stretch and held POSEIDEN to the end with a grudging effort. The latter tracked the leaders three deep just off the second flight on the
backstretch, made a steady advance to join the leaders in upper stretch and pressed the issue to the end while being just outkicked to the wire. BOURBON
WISDOM tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight racing to the turn, tipped out three, then four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to
improve position. NATIVE HAWK, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, weakened leaving midstretch. LOUD N
PROUD tracked off the first flight between foes and faded into upper stretch.

wide while moving to command midway through the second bend, held sway on a clear margin to late stages but couldn't contain the winner. CALZONE

match the top pair in the drive. DISTORTED TIMES, urged while angling to the inside disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing
the lane. HAD RIGHT was urged three deep between foes to gain a forward placing just off the leaders racing to the first turn, continued in pursuit of the
leaders to the second bend and emptied out into upper stretch. GREAT JUNIOR angled inwards while being urged between foes to press the pace from the

Footnotes
JEFF'S ANGEL was settled outside rivals racing to the first turn to track off the first flight, was prompted to advance four wide entering the far turn, was
carried out to the five path racing into upper stretch but produced a steady late response to prevail in time under pressure. MON PARADIS tracked off the
first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders to bid for command three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, drifted out
nearing the lane, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second best. SCHATZI was settled off the second flight racing to the far turn,
switched out four wide entering the stretch and continued with late interest to improve position. TIZ NENA sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside
racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow advantage on the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn, then continued to dispute
the issue between foes into upper stretch but yielded late. BRAMBLE BUSH was guided to the inside early stalking off the leaders under rating, saved
ground on the far turn, came through inside foes to challenge when presented an opening in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SUMMER
HELPER tipped off the inside early tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to press the issue between foes racing into the far turn but came up empty in
the drive. FARCICAL broke very slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MORGAN POINT was rated off the first flight shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch, gained position three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch, came through close quarters while exchanging some contact with LIVEFORTHESONG entering the lane but produced a solid closing response to
just edge TAP FIRST in time on the wire under steady handling. The latter raced in touch with the first flight three wide attending the pace on the
backstretch, pressed the issue through the turn, moved to wrest command while shifting inwards a bit leaving the quarter mile marker, held sway on a clear
margin past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner late. LIVEFORTHESONG switched out four wide on the backstretch tracking off the first flight,
advanced in tandem with the eventual winner in that path nearing upper stretch, exchanged some contact racing past the three sixteenths marker into upper
stretch and was outkicked by the top pair. MY MAN VITO settled last while angling inwards on the backstretch, gained contention inside foes on the turn,
was forced to check off rivals avoiding traffic nearing upper stretch, swung five wide entering the lane but made no real impression. GRUMLEY, urged
between rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled into the turn, drifted out a bit while exchanging bumps, then was
steadied nearing the three sixteenths marker and soon gave way. JUST PLAIN ORNERY, urged inside foes prompting the pacesetter through the
backstretch into the turn, was caught in tight quarters momentarily approaching the three sixteenths marker and quickly gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE RIDER OF JUST PLAIN ORNERY AND GRUMLEY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TAP FIRST, THE RIDER OF
LIVEFORTHESONG LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY, BUT
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

TREASURE RUN tipped off the inside racing to the first turn stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far turn,
drifted out once gaining the advantage in upper stretch but held GOLOVKIN safe to the end under steady pressure. The latter was guided to the inside
tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide leaving the far turn and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner. MR.
EINSTEIN angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to bid between foes racing through the stretch and edged a rival for
a share. HIGHLY NOTED sped to the lead while angling inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace to the second bend, dueled inside the winner on the far
turn into upper stretch and weakened late. IN HONOR OF ARTIE, shuffled back out of close quarters after the start, was reserved along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground to the lane but made no impact. OSPREY tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch, continued three, then
four wide to the lane and steadily faded. VINTNER tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch but dropped back early. OVERPRAISE
tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way racing through the far turn.

Footnotes
CATCH THE RAINBOW broke readily, raced in close attendance to a rival's pace under light rating in the opening stages, pressed the issue on the turn to
gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, then responded to firm right handed pressure to kick well clear of her rivals in the last furlong. BALLYMENA
was rated tracking off the first flight outside foes on the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn to loom outside the winner nearing upper stretch but
proved no match while best of the others. TAP SOLO was settled off the second flight near the inside in the opening quarter, tipped out racing through the
turn and continued to gain position three wide while gaining a share. LUNA AMARILLA angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn
but had no closing response. VALIANT SPARK, urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled inside the
winner on the bend and gave way into upper stretch. OUR GIRL tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, drifted wide nearing upper
stretch and never proved a serious threat. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA was settled between foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. BACKSPARK,
reserved outside foes racing through the backstretch, failed to gain contention. NO MORE FIRE ducked in at the start losing position to the leaders and
soon dropped out.

Footnotes
R REPOSADO LOCA angled inwards while prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong
marker and went clear late under firm encouragement. POMME SAUVAGE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the turn,
dueled for command past the furlong marker and prevailed for the place honors while proving no match. RIBALDRY (IRE) angled to the inside tracking off
the first flight racing into the turn, tipped out nearing midstretch and prevailed for a share between foes on the wire. AVE FENIX tracked the leaders outside
a rival in second flight racing to the turn, gained striking distance three deep nearing upper stretch, drifted out racing through the lane and continued well
enough to share third with a rival on the wire. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE was rated off the second flight between foes in early stages, angled out four wide
entering the stretch but made no impression. MARACAS BAY settled off the second flight racing to the turn and offered no rally. GALLEY HEAD, reluctant to
load prior to the start, was reserved along the inside racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. AN EASTER LILLY broke slowly, raced a bit
erratically to the turn while dropping out last and proved no threat.
