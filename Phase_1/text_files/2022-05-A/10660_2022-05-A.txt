Footnotes
COLLOQUY prompted the pace two wide, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and inched away in the late stages. CURLIN'S
WISDOM set the pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong, but gave way in the closing
stages, and held place. KONG LOVES A FIGHT trailed in the three path around the turn, tucked approaching the lane, improved inside of rivals to claim
show approaching the furlong grounds, and grinded away at the leading pair's advantage thereafter. RIA'S ANGEL tracked along the inside, chased the top
pair from the two path around the turn, failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, lost show to an inner rival approaching
the furlong grounds, but kept on. FRONT PORCH tracked in the three to four path around the turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
BAR FOURTEEN managed a loose lead while well in hand around the far turn, inched further away in upper stretch, and held sway through the final
sixteenth. PRACTICE SQUAD tracked from the two path, saved ground around the far turn before tipping back to the two path entering the lane, bid for
place inside of rivals approaching the furlong grounds, shifted outwardly while battling with UNCLE CURLY for that position in the final sixteenth, and
prevailed. UNCLE CURLY tracked three wide, chased four wide through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over approaching the furlong
grounds, vied for place outside of PRACTICE SQUAD through the late stages, but failed to reach that foe. BREADMAN settled off of the pace in the three to
two paths, shifted inwardly in upper stretch in hopes of making a rail charge, but lacked adequate racing room, failed to kick through the narrow rail seam,
and was no menace. BARLEEWON trailed along the inside around the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rally and made tittle
impact. SUNDAESWITHSANDY stalked the clear leader from the outside, chased that foe while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, and gave way
between horses in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DONTBELATE dueled for the lead outside of NOBLE JOURNEY early on, gained an advantage at the three furlong pole before meeting TOUGH TICKETS'
bold bid at the five sixteenths marker, gamely clung to an advantage from that foe through upper stretch while drifting out subtly, and held tenaciously
through the final sixteenth. TOUGH TICKETS tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair at the three furlong, loomed a danger while bidding
with five sixteenths to go, sparred outside of DONTEBELATE through upper stretch, battled through the late stages as an outer RED REVOLUTION surged,
but was denied while saving place. RED REVOLUTION bumped with an outer rival before taking up hard between horses a few strides out of the gate,
lagged well behind the field into the turn, picked up stride at the three furlong pole, quickly cut the gap on the rest of the field turning for home, rallied
between horses while shifted ground outwardly in upper stretch, surged in the final sixteenth in hopes of reeling in the top pair, but ran out of ground. MR.
FIDGET settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path turning for home while tracking the top pair, but flattened out in midstretch. NOBLE
JOURNEY dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the three furlong pole, and tired through the lane. FOTIS
moved to stalk the dueling pair from the outside in the early stages, but weakened at the three furlong pole. ACTUARY (GB) tracked the pace four wide, but
was through after five furlongs.

Footnotes
CANISY remained out four to five wide around the opening bend, was reserved on the outside, traveled around the far turn in the four path, was roused near
the quarter-pole, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid just inside the furlong marker, battled outside of several foes into the final
sixteenth, fought with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CONTEMPORARY ART was well placed towards the front while
saving ground, drafted behind foes coming to the quarter-pole, was asked with room in the two path into upper stretch, gained to make a bid between foes
inside the three-sixteenths, battled with multiple rivals into the final sixteenth, fought with the winner to the wire and just missed while able to get the place.
SAHLABIYA was rated on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, gained to make a four wide bid into upper stretch, battled outside of rivals into the
final furlong, came in under a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while able to get the show. MOZAY bumped
soundly with a foe early, stalked the pace on the outside, was let out in the two path around the final turn, made a bid in the three path into upper stretch,
battled between horses into the final furlong, checked when SAHLABIYA came in while dropping back a bit into the final sixteenth and just held the last spot
in the superfecta. MISS BONNIE T went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage down the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, was asked
under threat near the quarter-pole then was headed in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and gave way. RHOMBIQUE bumped soundly with a foe
early then was taken in hand, raced off the pace under restraint, was roused in the two path on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. SIEMPRE ELEGANTE was bumped solidly early then taken up and dropped back, settled towards the rear, went four to five wide
around the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. OH MRS. MAISEL was reserved on the inside, saved ground through the far
turn and came up empty. QUEEN QUIST was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and was no
factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
TANGO TANGO TANGO was reserved on the outside while three to four wide, ranged closer late on the far turn, gained to make a bid into the stretch then
took the advantage, responded well under heavy pressure in the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging. SANCTUARY CITY bumped lightly with
a foe at the start, settled towards the rear in the two path, moved closer around the far turn, steadied off heels coming to the quarter-pole then moved out for
room into upper stretch, rallied on the outside and closed well but missed while able to get the place. SOLDIER RISING (GB) settled on the inside, drafted
behind horses around the final turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole then came under the crop, raced just behind the leader while lacking
room under some urging until around the sixteenth, dropped in at that point and finished willingly for the show. MALTHAEL was unhurried in the three to four
path, produced a run when asked near the quarter-pole, rallied to make a bid around the furlong marker, fought into the final sixteenth and missed.
HOMBRE was rated just off the pace on the inside, waited briefly into the stretch then was roused, chased into the final furlong, moved out late and lacked
the needed kick. TIDE OF THE SEA went to the front, set the clear pace in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then headed in upper stretch,
battled under a drive into the final furlong, checked while tiring into the final sixteenth and capitulated. MEGAYACHT bumped lightly with a rival at the start,
saved ground on the turns and was no factor. SLICKED BACK stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, made a bid into the stretch, battled under a
drive into the final furlong, checked sharply while weakening when a foe came in into the final sixteenth and also capitulated. BOX N SCORE was last to
commence, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and
failed to rally.

Footnotes
KERIK settled off the pace, ranged up four wide around the turn, was asked late on that bend, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth
and got up at the wire under strong urging. ALPINE QUEEN stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, took the lead coming to
the quarter-pole then shook clear in upper stretch, responded well while in front into the final sixteenth but was denied at the wire while clear for the place.
SCOTT ALAIA went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, traveled inside around the turn, lost the advantage to the runner-up approaching the
quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch, came back some in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. HOW LUCKY was rated
off the pace, came under urging while moving from the rail to the two path around the turn, came out some under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. CARLY HUSTLE settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn and came up empty. AMITY ISLAND settled at the rear, raced
inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
ANEJO went to the front, was well rated while showing the way, rounded the turn in the two path, bumped with BEST IDEA while challenged by that foe at
the quarter-pole then jostled again with that opponent in upper stretch, engaged in a spirited tussle, jostled again late while continuing to spar, fought
gamely to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BEST IDEA was urged from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, saved
ground around the turn, gained to make a bid in the two path coming to the quarter-pole, bumped with ANEJO at that point then jostled with that foe while
dueling in upper stretch, battled determinedly outside of the aforementioned foe into the final sixteenth, jostled again late and was denied while clear for the
place. SON OF AN EX settled off the pace, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while able to get
the show. FOREVER WICKED brushed the inside of the gate at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked while vying in the three path
around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. EMPEROR'S CAUSE tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the two path
on the turn and came up empty. PIER FORTY settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, moved to the two path under urging outside the
quarter-pole and failed to rally. GRABBING THE MONEY veered out at the start then was quickly corrected by the rider, raced just off the pace on the
outside, was asked four wide on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
MISS J MCKAY stalked the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, took the lead when asked in upper stretch, kicked clear into the final
furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. MISS MAJORETTE tucked in while settling off the pace, went around the turn in the two path,
shifted three wide near the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch and got up for the place while no threat to the winner. IGLOO was asked leaving
the gate, showed the way in hand with a clear advantage, raced inside around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the
winner in upper stretch and weakened then lost the place but held the show. ALWAYZ LATE broke a step slow, settled on the outside, tracked three wide
around the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TOO SEXY was off a step slow, settled at the rear, moved from the
two path to the three path under strong restraint around the turn, shifted four wide near the quarter-pole then was carried out in upper stretch and also
lacked the needed response. GOGO SHOES settled just off the pace, saved ground through the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S OUTLAW broke a step slow, was urged along early then settled towards the rear, went three wide while roused on the turn, shifted five wide inside
the five-sixteenths then was shaken up six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under good handling. URBAN FOREST settled near the middle of the field, went three wide around the turn, gained four wide into the stretch,
bumped with a foe while taking the lead outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while
able to hold the place. SMOKE AND HEAT was rated while tugging keenly at the bit, went four then four wide while let out around the turn, came under a
drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. STREET FIGHT bumped with an opponent at the start, was reserved off the pace, moved from the
rail to the two path around the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch, was blocked behind a wall of horses from the
three-sixteenths to the sixteenth-pole, checked in the process then altered to the outside and lost any chance while up for the last spot in the superfecta.
ACAMAR was taken under a vigorous hold then stalked outside under heavy restraint, made a bid in the two path around the turn, led between horses
passing the quarter-pole, continued between horses while fighting into the final furlong and weakened. STJAMES was off slow, settled towards the back,
went three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. TORPEDO RUN was rated while tugging at the bit, moved out late in the backstretch, was asked in
the three path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, bumped with a foe while battling between horses outside the furlong marker and also
weakened. RUGGED UNION bumped with an opponent at the start, was taken under a hard hold then became rank, passed the five-eighths pole under
stout restraint, continued to tug at the bit under a hold while inside through the turn, remained under resistance while behind some tiring horses in the
stretch and was never let out. DADS GOOD RUNNER went to the front, showed the way in hand, was challenged while inside on the turn, lost the
advantage coming to the quarter-pole and gave way. ISLANDMAN was taken in hand early then pulled keenly on the bit, traveled four wide around the turn
and came up empty. NECCO was off slow and spotted the front several lengths then quickly darted in, saved ground around the turn, turned into the stretch
in the two path, checked sharply behind a hard held RUGGED UNION in upper stretch and was no factor.
