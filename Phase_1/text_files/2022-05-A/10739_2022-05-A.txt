Footnotes
MI LIA dueled inside of ISOLATION for the early lead, battled back from the inside around the turn, cut the corner and shook free entering the lane, widened
to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady urging. ALLIACEOUS rated off the early early pace, picked up the tempo midway through the far turn,
set down four wide at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid for the winner and cleared second best. ISOLATION dueled outside of the eventual
winner in early stages, remained on equal terms on the far turn, could not move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane and ran on for a share.
EXPLOSIVELY HOT tracked the embattled duo through early stages, failed to progress when called upon on the final turn, then weakened in the lane.
HAVINFUNYET raced in the back, saved ground on the far turn and had no response when called upon.

GUITARZAN sped to the lead at the start, set the pace through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, roused for more in the upper stretch,
responded willingly and finished going away. QUESTION AUTHORITY stalked the pace through early stages, launched a three wide bid near the quarter
pole, continued to chase after the winner down the lane and cleared second best. GREELEY WENT WEST settled inside through early stages, saved
ground on the final turn, angled three wide entering the lane and churned on for a share. TURN ON THE MAGIC stalked the pacesetter, prompted two wide
around the far turn and failed to move on. MEDITATE was forwardly placed on the first turn then weakened and settled off the early pace, came under a ride
late on the far turn and had no response. SWEEPING EDGE raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO stalked the early pacesetter, dueled three deep around the far turn, dug in and gained the advantage over KIND WAYS at the
furlong marker and drew clear. KIND WAYS set the pace through the backstretch, dueled inside on the final turn, battled back into the final furlong then
failed to move on with the winner in final stages. ANGEL OF VERDUN tracked up close through early stages, dueled between foes on the final turn, could
not move on with the top pair in the upper stretch but stayed on for a share. FLURRY OF FEATHERS tracked the pace in the backstretch, failed to progress
around the far turn and offered no late bid. BURNING DESIRE was reserved in the back, raced two to three wide around the final turn and never threatened.
AMELIA MADELYN saved ground on the first turn and rated just off the early pace, flattened two wide around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.

Footnotes
JOEY'S SASSY SHANA was allowed to settle in the opening quarter, made a three wide move on the turn, steadied slightly near the quarter pole, advanced
into close contention, lacked a clear path near the furlong marker, tipped out a path wider, finished willingly and got up in time. FLAT ROSE hustled along
two wide around the turn, remained in striking distance three wide in the stretch run, dug in under firm handling, began to edge by then got denied by the
winner in final strides. ABIGAIL G dueled for the early lead, briefly held on top then got collared by rival leaving the backstretch, took back a slim lead in the
upper stretch, fought on gamely then yielded late. SUFFRAGETTE edged closer four wide around the turn then failed to threaten the top trio in the lane.
SALT LIFE ANGEL dueled for the early lead and came up empty leaving the backstretch. TABLE ONE chased along the inside, stumbled over fallen foe at
the quarter pole, lost the rider and walked off after the race. MADISON JOY took over the lead entering the turn, then fell while injured near the quarter pole,
lost the rider and got vanned off.

Footnotes
WHO TOOK THE MONEY was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced three wide around the first turn, continued unhurried off the pace through the
backstretch, began to pick up the tempo along the outside midway through the far turn, swung six wide into the upper stretch, rallied along the outside and
got up in time. HIGHLAND CREEK tracked the top pair through early stages, made a bid near the quarter pole and took over the lead at the head of the
lane, widened to a clear advantage, continued with good response but could not hold off the winner in deep stretch. VENN rated near midpack in early
stages, lacked racing room along the inside around the far turn, waited then got clear three wide in the upper stretch, gained closer contention and
sustained steady response for a share. RELENTLESS DANCER settled off the early pace, made a four wide move around the far turn, continued in
contention a furlong out then finished evenly. FREE INDEED was unhurried, swung wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. MAGA MAN dueled for the
lead up the backstretch, battled on through the far turn then faded. FATHER GOOSE dueled for the lead, battled on around the far turn, got collared at the
head of the lane and retreated. DREWHUSTLE tracked in range, chased three wide through the final turn then came up empty. TREYS MIDNITE MOON
raced in the back and had no response when called upon.

CUSTOM GUITAR hustled along two wide into the turn, took the inside position and cut the corner, lacked racing room, steadied then got clear and finished
second best. LAWSUIT LUCY chased two wide around the turn, tipped wider for the drive, sustained bid and gained show. CALL ME DARLIN chased three
wide in range around the turn, stayed in the same path in the lane and ran on evenly. LA SMOOCHIE sprinted to a clear lead, held around the turn then got
collared by the winner top stretch and gave way. IMMACULATE GLORY was ridden along three wide through the turn, came four wide into the lane and
failed to rally. HOUSE OF ZONG chased along the outside then drifted out wide leaving the turn and had no late response. BONJOOR MADEMOISEL
saved ground and failed to factor.
