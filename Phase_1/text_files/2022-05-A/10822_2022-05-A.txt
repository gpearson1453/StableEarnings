Footnotes
ACTION POTENTIAL away in good order, narrowly showed the way in the two path up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the turn just off
the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. BRINEE behind the first flight for three furlongs
inside, continued along the rail when moving closest to the winner turning for home, could do little with that rival through the lane, drew well clear for the
place. CRYPTO BRAVE in the second flight while outside, four wide down to three wide entering the stretch, finished up best of the rest. NOON'S
BABYGIRL pressed the winner from the outside for a half, had little for the drive in tiring. MY LITTLE GUERA last away, trailed most of the to prove never a
threat. CANDY'S PRIDE forwardly placed for three furlongs, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER outrun for a half while racing outside, made a solid move to reach a contending position while three wide out of the turn,
challenged outside the leaders soon after, soon clear under light encouragement to win ridden out. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT with the pace up the backstretch
while between foes, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, offered little resistance to the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. JIMMY
TWO TIMES with the pace while three wide, dueled outside the runner up late in the turn and into the lane, weakened a bit, lasted for the show. SR.
CLARKY lacked speed inside, steered out to be three wide turning for home, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals. BROADWAY JONES lacked
speed, failed to muster a rally. CLASSIC GREELEY in the second flight for a half, had nothing for the drive. AW SHUCKS flashed brief speed inside,
stopped after a half, distanced late after losing contact with the field, jogged across.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC SIGN broke on top, set all the pace while just off the inside, larger lead stretch, enough left. MINNESOTA MIRACLE forwardly placed, chased
the winner off the inside past the furlong marker, slowly getting to the winner late. NEW EAGLE prompted the winner while while toward the inside,
continued forward into the stretch, outkicked for the second spot. VARNISHED in mid pack while racing off the inside, continued evenly through the straight
in lacking a closing response. BIG BOY DAVE REX settled within striking distance in the main body, continued within reach entering the straight, lacked a
closing punch as well. NATE'S ATTACK lacked early speed just off the inside, tucked inside and moved closer along the inside late backstretch, shuffled
back early far turn, went evenly after recovering. IM A COWBOY TOO last to leave, continued to trail throughout in a dull effort. FRACTIONAL TIMES
UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER BEING TRIPPED PREMATURELY. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BOSTON LUCILLE broke back, trailed early, swung out to be seven wide exiting the turn, closed with good resolve down the middle of the strip to be up in
time. T R'S FIRST also lacked any early foot, advanced through the turn in some traffic, angled five wide into the lane, was going well to put a head in front
briefly with a sixteenth remaining, could not contain the winner in the waning strides, clear for the place. SOUVENIR CHANNEL was another devoid of any
early quickness, saved ground to improve into the lane, steered out a bit then lugged in upper stretch,was righted and displayed enough late energy to be
up for the show. MO BELLA popped stall doors before start, raced in mid pack off the inside, in traffic then was floated out six wide into the lane, improved
position to the wire. SCRAPPY broke well, showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, shook off a couple of rivals late in the turn to be briefly
clear past the furlong marker but could not last. RESPECT ALL broke up, raced forwardly three wide, lodged an outside bid midway on the turn, could not
sustain that challenge through the lane. SEEMYVALENTINE in the main body up the backstretch, fell back in some traffic turn, improved a bit through the
lane while not a serious threat. LES AND MADGE in the second flight while racing three wide, tired in the drive. SUPER ET within striking distance toward
the inside, was idling in upper stretch when steadied while in tight along the rail, faded. ROSEISALWAYSRITE pressed the issue the opening quarter up the
backstretch, lodged a bid between rivals midway on the turn, faltered in the drive. JOEY'S THUNDER off slow, moved up toward the back of the main body,
gave way while getting out midway on the turn, continued to stop stretch, jogged in. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BLUE DARTER forwardly placed for three furlongs along the inside, tipped out a bit to be in the two path into the straight, challenge between rivals past the
furlong marker, kicked well clear, held the runner up safe late. SIKUM lacked speed outside, came in the four path for the drive, staged a willingly rally to be
clear for the place, slowly getting to the runner up. SWEET PRAYERS dueled early off the inside, fell back to chase the leader through the turn, edged
closer midstretch, stalled while getting up late for the show. MISS JAMIE dueled up front closet to the inside early, shook clear late in the turn and into the
stretch, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, caved in when headed by the winner soon after. FACTOIRE behind the pace off the inside,
continued evenly in lacking a closing response. MISS NITAP last away, improved inside of rivals late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. CATCAKE was
finished early.

A STORM back off the pace while outside, three wide advance into contention into the lane, outside bid late, outkicked in the late going while clear for the
place. FAREWELL TIME broke out but alertly, narrowly set the early pace inside, shook off the other speed by late in the turn, allowed the winner the inside
when beginning to weaken inside the furlong marker, also failed to contain the runner up, remained well clear of the others. CURTIN'S UP pressed the
leader from the outside for just under three furlongs and began to tire. JONATHAN WHO broke sluggishly to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back
and outside, four wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. I'M LOOKING UP behind the dueling leaders early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
AKIANE'S SOLDIER broke back, lagged near the back first turn off the inside, continued back up the backstraight, four wide far turn, asked along late in that
bend while remaining four wide, rallied past the furlong marker, bothered slightly by a drifting MIZZEN MONARCH a sixteenth, regained momentum to be up
in time. MIZZEN MONARCH settled off the pace just off the inside, advanced on the two leaders and challenged three wide turning for home, held the
advantage a furlong out when drifting out to impede the winner slightly, could not hold that foe off in the waning strides. FIRST I'VE SEEN lacked early foot,
saved some ground while improving through the second turn, steered out to three path for the drive, up for the show through traffic, outkicked by the top two
late. HERE COMES LOVIE chased the early leader, lost some position in the second turn, encountered traffic while being asked inside the furlong marker,
finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. LUTIE MO void of speed for six furlongs, came four wide out of the final turn, improved position with some
belated interest while remaining well out in the course. THE GREY BEAUTY forwardly placed past the wire the first time, chased the leader onto and up the
backstretch, continued to pursue that one into the far turn when moving closer, challenged between rivals and inside the runner up approaching the furlong
grounds, faltered in the run to the wire. MACEE moved up to take command into the first turn, clear through that bend and up the backstretch, held a narrow
advantage into the lane, caved when headed with a furlong remaining. START WELL broke back, moved up to race in mid pack for six furlongs, tired
through the stretch. LACIS JEWEL was finished early, never a threat. CAJUN TWO STEP forwardly placed early while racing outside through the first turn,
stopped, finished far back.

Footnotes
LUCKY LINDA in the second flight while in the two path, dropped to the inside late in the final turn when moving a bit closer, tipped out for the drive, kicked
down the leader in showing good resolve. LIGHT AS A WHISPER broke on top, set all the pace along the inside, remained clear into the lane, could not
contain the winner late, remained clear of the others. ST MARIA settled in mid pack off the inside, came three wide for the drive, staged a mild rally to be
narrowly up tor the show late. CRIDER CHASE forwardly placed while three wide, chased the runner up into the lane, weakened in the drive, caught late for
the show. OVERLY SWEET lacked speed, improved position while not a serious threat. LAKE RUNNER away in good order behind the early leader, chased
that one for five furlongs and began to weaken. LAST DESTINY four back into the first turn, fell back before a half, never a threat. SAFE KEEPING last
away, remained back in showing little. SHE'S OUR STAR trailed throughout to be always outrun.
