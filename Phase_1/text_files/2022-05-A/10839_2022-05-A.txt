Footnotes
NIN TO WIN last away, continued unhurried to trail early, began to advance into the far turn, got through in the two path through the final turn, rail bid, drove
clear. STORM BREACH within striking distance while racing on the outside first turn, continued three wide through the second bend, challenged on the
outside as the winner was attacking along the rail upper stretch, could not keep pace with that one the final furlong, clearly second bet. DEVASTATING
BEAUTY lacked speed came four wide out of the final turn, staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top two. MISS MIRACLE GIRL chased early, dueled
in the two path briefly before taking over into the far turn, offered little resistance to the top pair while between them up upper straight. TRICKY MOM back
off the pace, made little impact. BETISON moved up to clear early, dueled the middle part closest to the inside then gave way in the far turn. MEAN
AMERICAN asked early to race forwardly, stopped after a half, finished far back. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER BEING TRIPPED
PREMATURELY. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TOTAL MALICE worked way clear early in the first turn, backed the pace down under firm restraint, continued to rate into the far turn, shrugged off a couple
of foes with a quarter remaining, well clear again through the lane to win. STORIED TRIP settled off the pace and the inside, three wide bid in the second
turn, could not keep up with the winner through the lane, remained well clear of the others. BE A BANDIT closest to the winner off the inside, tried that foe in
the two path far turn, could not keep up with that same rival or the runner up through the lane, narrowly gained the nod to save the show.
TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH broke back, lacked early foot, moved a bit closer along the inside before a half, shifted out three wide far turn, improved through
the lane, just missed the show. C. F. SHELAUH last away, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
SWEET AMELIA remained always back. CAJUN SHOTS forwardly placed early off the inside, four wide through the second turn when weakening,
continued to tire through the lane.

Footnotes
FISH N CHICK unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn under confident handling, tipped out nearing the furlong grounds, late surge to win
going away under light pressure. KNIGHTS SWORD broke out, bothered SPIDER LEGS, was righted to set the pace inside, continued to show the way into
and through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner, game for the place. SPIDER LEGS bothered a bit at the start when KNIGHTS SWORD broke
out, tracked inside, moved out, challenged midstretch, proved no match for entrymate, outkicked for the place. ROARING QUINN settled in mid pack,
continued one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. MY LOVELY CHARLIE pressed, dueled off the inside for three furlongs, gave way in the
drive. SISTER CHLOE fell back after the start, four wide turn, lacked a rally. REMI'S ROSE pressed outside, gave way.

Footnotes
MAC LEGACY lacked early speed, came four wide into the stretch, dueled, edging away late under firm handling. GRACE'S VISION in the second flight
outside, came three wide and between rivals into the lane, raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. ZIPITY
in the second flight while racing inside, behind a wall of horses into the lane, along for the show three wide final furlong, not a threat to the top two.
GOODBYE ROSIE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, vied into the lane when challenged while remaining closest to the rail,
faltered. SHA U CUTE chased early, challenged in the two path and dueled through the turn, faltered in the drive from between horses. RENE'S NEW BOW
broke back, failed to menace. STERLING MEMORY in the second flight, got out turn, faded. ABSOLUTELY MINDY lost action soon after the start, pulled
up, walked off.

Footnotes
LIL' SISTER LOU came in start to bother K R LUCKY DAY, was straightened to race in the second flight, came three wide into the lane when challenging,
drifted in inside the furlong grounds then continued to drift with a sixteenth remaining under a right handed crop to bother GABY'S PROMISE, edged clear.
GABY'S PROMISE forwardly placed toward the inside, came in the two path into the lane, bothered when LIL' SISTER LOU drifted in with a sixteenth
remaining, recovered after steadying to be up for the second spot. IZANAMI away in good order, narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to past
the furlong marker when headed by the winner, caught late for the second position while proving stubborn to the end. BLUE RIDGE HEAT broke alertly,
dueled through the turn off the inside, between horses turning for home, weakened the final furlong. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH raced in mid pack off the inside,
went evenly while three wide out of the turn. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK failed to menace while racing in the two path and between horses. K R LUCKY DAY
last away, saved ground to no avail. BOSSY'S TROUBLE remained back throughout while four wide out of the turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, LIL' SISTER LOU WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND. A CLAIM OF FOUL
BY THE RIDER OF BLUE RIDGE HEAT AGAINST LIL' SISTER LOU FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
PRAYERS SAVED within striking distance three wide and between foes into the turn, dueled in the two path outside the early leader exiting, put that foe
away with a sixteenth remaining, held the runner up safe late. TAKENFORGRANTED lacked early foot, angled out to be five wide into the lane, made a late
run, not enough for the winner late. CREOLE BABY broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, dueled with the runner up into the lane while continuing
along the rail, gave ground grudgingly until late, saved the show. CITIZENS REWARD last away, raced three wide into the turn, closer in some traffic late in
the bend then failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. GLADS LOVE CAT away in good order, raced along the inside, main group late turn when in a
bit tight along the rail, steadied then went evenly to the wire after recoveriing. CAMP HALO in mid pack in the run up the backstretch out in the strip, closer
through the turn then weakened in the drive. BEAR TOOTH PASS broke back, trailed most of the way in never threatening. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE
chased the early leader, in some traffic late in the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
TOUCHUPONASTAR broke on top, cleared before exiting the chute, set all the pace, widened under minimal pressure through the lane to win ridden out.
RISKTAKER lacked early foot, rallied three wide out of the turn for the place, no threat to the winner. JAYS HOLIDAY chased the winner up the backstretch,
lost some position through the turn, regained the second spot in the stretch while far back, could not contain the runner up, finished up best of the rest.
DIXIE STAR mid pack early, advanced the middle part to race closest to the winner through the turn, weakened in the drive. OLDER AND WISER hesitated
at the break to be away slowly, trialed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ROCK STAR ALEX in the second flight early,
retreated. CATCHIN DRAMA in the second flight, also steadily faded.

Footnotes
POSEIDON WRATH unhurried in the early going, moved closer after a half, split foes when moving to challenge midstretch, took command then held the
runner up safe late. INTIMIDATION chased the early leader, pressed the issue the middle half while between rivals, proved stubborn to the end, well clear.
MUCHO VELOCE settled off the pace, dropped inside to save ground through the final turn, mild bid a furlong out, could not match the top two to the wire.
FULL OF GLORY cleared along the inside the opening quarter, vied closest to the rail through the middle half, weakened in the drive. INDEFENSIBLE void
of speed in trailing for six furlongs, picked off a couple of faltering rivals after the issue had been decided. SCREWBALL forwardly placed, vied three wide
into the far turn, gave way through the strtetch. RITHMICALLEA in mid pack early, was finished after a half.
