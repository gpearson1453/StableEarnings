from early contention, ran at the rail on the turn, angled to the four path leaving the turn and passed tiring rivals. RED LIL SHIPMENT gave chase, raced
near the rail on the turn and showed little further. NOBLE CITY had a brief early lead then pressured the pace, dropped back past the quarter pole and

Footnotes
GOLDEN G gave chase, ran in the five path of the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched clear the final yards. KUKULKAN accelerated to the front
at the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, was met leaving the eighth pole, gave up the lead mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded the final yards.
QUAD EIGHTS engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. MY CANDY BIZ gave chase, rounded the turn
off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. GAMING JACK chased, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. I'D LIKE TO KNOW set the pace
through the opening three sixteenths then gave chase from the three eighths pole, dropped back in the three path of the turn and weakened in the lane.
COUNT THE SHELLS gave chase and rounded the turn in the five and six paths.

Footnotes
MAKE WAY broke in to make contact with Steal The Cash then settled off the pace about the three path, bid past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn
three wide, drifted into the stretch but took over past the eighth pole and held well with steady stretch handling. BOOK OF DELANCEY rounded the opening
turn about the four path and raced well back, started a bid leaving the half mile pole, came through the far turn in the five and six paths then steadily
improved to take second late yards. COASTAL CHAOS raced well back off the rail early, bid past the half mile pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second but just up for third. SUCCEED rated a short lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point,
kept the edge nearest the rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. ARE YOU HAPPY was bumped leaving the gate and settled off the rail, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. STEAL THE CASH came away awkwardly and made
contact with Are You Happy then stalked two deep, drew to even terms into the backstretch and dueled from that point, had a brief slim lead two deep
midway on the far turn then weakened in the lane. VITO ANDOLINI was through early. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MY HANDSOME MAN settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, progressed steadily in the three path of
the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged away late yards. SKY OF GOLD closed to the lead past the three quarter pole and rated the pace
inside, came under pressure at the five sixteenths, kept the advantage near the rail on the far turn, was caught flattening stride mid-stretch and just lasted
for second. VIOLENT ROCK rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid past the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, ran evenly
through the lane and was gaining on the waning runner-up. GORUN stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the far
turn but flattened toward mid-stretch. NEVER FOR SPEIGHT became edgy in the gate then hesitated at the break, ran in the four path the first turn, picked

mile pole and gave chase from that point, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. WATCHING SNOW FLY rounded the first turn

steadily handled to widen the final sixteenth. AUBURN MILL rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past
the quarter and had to settle for second best. JEFFERY SCOTT settled off the pace saving ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at

TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL tapered in through the front stretch and stalked two deep, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, took over at the quarter and
was steadily handled through the lane. LONG LEGS LOUISE stalked from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the four path
of the far turn, though, had to settle for second best. BAYS CASTLE rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn,
started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and came along for third later yards. HESSICA
saved ground just off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. TENNIS
TAP settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn but showed little more. SARAH'S
WARRIOR was bumped outward and into HOW IS SHE leaving the gate, ran in the three path of the first turn and left the turn outside, bid from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and could only improve her position. The latter was bumped leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn
about the three path and proved no factor. IN TO THE NIGHT was bumped outward and into Sarah's Warrior leaving the gate, saved ground off the pace
and showed little response through the backstretch. MY SISTER PAM broke outward and into Into The Night, settled in the three path the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then weakened. STROLLING THROUGH angled to the inside to rate
the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the quarter, raced near the rail on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ADMIRE stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead approaching the quarter, dueled clear midway on the far turn and dug in
under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR rated close off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn about the three path, dueled for second in the upper stretch and finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner. CRAZY IDEA saved ground on the
first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and came along for third the final strides. WONDER HOW rated the pace
inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the quarter, continued close at the rail on the far turn then weakened
inside the eighth pole. FIND YOUR BOAZ bobbled at the break then saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
though, flattened in the four path of the far turn. TIZEZZY settled back in the three and four paths the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little
response. CASTLE BOUND raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, but weakened off the
rail on the far turn. DEPUTY DREW raced well back. POPPY'S TWO STEP settled back in the three path the opening turn then faded past the three eighths
pole.
