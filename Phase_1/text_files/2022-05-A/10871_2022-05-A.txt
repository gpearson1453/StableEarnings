FLOWERS APRIORITY showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside and held gamely in the drive to prove best under strong handling.
HAVE I EVER pressed the early leader down the backstretch, raced to the outside of flowers Apriority and finished willingly to the wire. LADY CHURCHILL
stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. LITTLE E dropped back early on, moved up six to seven wide through
the upper stretch and made a good late gain. STELLA LINK was hustled along early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened in the
drive. PUT A BOW ON IT broke to the inside, was coaxed along while racing along the inside and had no response. DANCE LIL DARLING broke awkwardly
at the start, lost a considerable amount of ground and trailed while racing far back.

Footnotes
SWIZZLECITY settled off the early going, moved up three wide around the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole ands finished well to be
clear under strong pressure. EARLY DISMISSAL stalked the pace, shifted out four to five wide through the upper stretch, slightly bumped with Miss Tonalist
and dug in late to get up for the place position. Miss Tonalist claimed objection against Early Dismissal for interference through the upper lane and stewards
ruled no change. AMERICAN DEPUTY pressed the early going down the backstretch and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. MISS TONALIST settled
off the pace, moved up through the far turn, was bumped through the upper stretch, raced five to six wide and had not enough late. CONNECT IT stalked
the pace, experienced traffic near the half mile pole, raced towards the inside and had no response. JAGO showed good speed and gave way.

Footnotes
CANADA'S CUSTOMS vied for the early lead from the inside, dug in late and proved best in a determined run under strong handling. EVE'S DELIGHT
stalked the pace from the outside, made a good four wide bid through the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN pressed the early
pace, raced three to four wide and kept on to the wire. MY SISTER ANNETTE broke in the air, settled off the early pace, made a good advance through the
far turn, raced seven deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. SCRAPBOOK settled off the early going, raced six to seven wide through the upper
lane, shifted in through the drive and had no final winning bid. VIOLA STAR was off slowly, raced four wide and never was a factor. DROP DEAD SEXY was
forced to take up in the early stages, raced at the back of the pack early and never was a factor. DEBBIES PASSAGE vied for the early lead and gave way.
TAP OUT FAST was pulled up and had to be vanned off.
