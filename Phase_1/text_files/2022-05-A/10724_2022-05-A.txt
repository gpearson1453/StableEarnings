Footnotes
TOOTIE broke in, stalked the top pair down the backstretch, made a strong move around the far turn and drew off in the drive to be well clear under steady
handling. PEEK FACTOR was bumped hard break, checked hard, forwardly placed to lay up close, raced three wide in the drive, veered out deep stretch,
bothered foe. A stewards inquiry was lodged for the break and stewards ruled no change. An additional stewards inquiry was conducted in the stretch and
stewards disqualified Peek Factor, placed fourth for coming out deep stretch forcing Amante de Sara to check sharply. L L COOL GREY settled off the early
pace, moved up strongly through the upper stretch, raced five to six wide in the stretch run, was bumped slightly deep stretch and kept on to the wire.
AMANTE DE SARA was bumped, took up at the break, stalked the pace, raced four wide in the drive, checked deep stretch and kept on to the wire.
SWEET BABY SHAE broke out at the start, bumped with rival, was sent along to set the early pace and gave way. MORO NALA broke in, was bumped
hard at the break, dropped back off the early pace and failed to respond. BERINGS LIGHT raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no
response. SHE'S A RIDGE was bumped, squeezed at the break, trailed early and never threatened.

FRESH ONE stalked the pace while racing between horses, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and finished well to prove best under strong
handling. MISTER K dueled for the early lead while racing two deep and kept on to the wire. RELEASE THE BEAST was allowed to settle early on, raced
near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up . FINDING SILVER was off slowly, moved up four to five and had no final winning bid.
SHANGHAI'S DREAM was unhurried early, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and had no rally. AUTOCRATIC was slow early, raced six deep
through the upper stretch and never threatened. DECLARATIONOFSPEED stalked the pace and tired while racing five wide. INTHEALY dueled for the

Footnotes
SIGN OF WAR showed good early speed from the outside and drew off to be well clear late under strong handling. GOLDEN ALE was forwardly placed to
lay up close, raced two to three wide and was no match for the winner in the drive. BELEWS GOLD dropped back early, moved up five to six wide and
made a good late rally. MORRICONE was hustled along, raced two to three wide and had not enough in the drive. D C HERO was off slowly, raced towards
the inside and had not enough. LET'S GO ALAMO was hustled along, raced three wide and had no late gain. HIJO GALANTE coaxed along early, raced
four wide between rivals and had no response. HIGH TONE was slow early and never threatened. INVINCIBILITY was hustled along and tired while racing
four wide. MR HANDS ON dropped back early and failed to respond. LIL CARPE failed to sustain a bid.
