GO SPEED RACER GO was unhurried early, then slowing gained ground down the backstretch to menace five wide in the stretch and was up in the final
strides. UNCLE ARTIE settled in the two path, was in tight on the far turn, then menaced two wide in the stretch and closed willingly to prove second best.
READY TO ROLL pressed the leader while two wide, was in a long drive into the far turn but gave way in late stretch. GOLD VERMILION set the pace
inside, cleared the far turn then faltered in the end. PAYNTER PARTY chased the leader while three wide, made a mild bid from the inside on the far turn
but flattened out in the stretch. OLD SOT hopped at the start then settled inside and failed to menace. TRULY DANZIG was two wide on the first turn, then
settled along the rail and was through early.

Footnotes
FINAL NARRATIVE broke sharply, heading straight to the lead racing along the rail, and would not be denied the win, going wire to wire. TEXAS
REMINGTON stalked the pace from two wide all the way around, rallied in the stretch run, coming along side, but unable to overtake. WITT AMERICA was
in contention, right behind the leaders until the far turn, made a mild bid, and got up for show. STONEMEISTER was mid field going four wide, and failed to
fire in the stretch drive. CORD'S KOKO NIGHT was mid pack through the turn going four wide, but failed to respond down the lane. MR. G T O chased the
pace until dropping back at the half mile pole. VALENTORO was near the back racing along the rail and showed little.

Footnotes
BECKY'S TATTOO shot to the lead like a rocket, raced along the rail, drawing off from the rest of the field to win with authority. MARKUP was near the back
early on, angled out around the turn and closed well but was second best. THORNY ROSE was near the front, stalking the pace, two wide, made a mild bid
down the lane and got up for show. FLEW BY YOU was near the back early, going three wide and had a mild rally in the stretch drive. LOVEY DOVEY
pressed the pace down the back stretch, three wide, with an even effort. GEM KEY pressed the pace, going three wide and faded in the stretch. STILL
CARRYING ON showed no early speed, was eased down the lane and walked off.

SUPER BRADY made the lead out of the gate, then drew clear down the lane to be the clear winner with confident handling and a driving finish. TOUGH
CHARLIE stalked the pace traveling three wide, rallied down the lane to get up for second. REBEL POSSE chased the pace along the inside, made a bid in
mid stretch to get up for show. CAPT. ST. JACQUES was near the back going three wide, made a mild rally in the turn, but it was not enough. QUARKY
was mid field early on, going three wide and lacked a late response in the lane. MOVER pressed the pace, two wide and faltered at the eighth pole.
PUTMAN got off slow, was bumped and then squeezed back, and never fired. BEDUIN FIGHTER had no early speed, trailing the field and showed little.
