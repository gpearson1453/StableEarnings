MARGIN OF AIR set a measured pace inside, repelled challenges from both sides in the stretch and edged clear in a moderate drive.
FICTIONALFAIRYTALE settled inside, bid into the stretch, posed a threat but could not get by the winner. MISCHIEVOUS JONES forced the pace in the
two path then weakened in the final furlong. ICE BAR broke a step slowly, chased outside and lacked a rally. DEPLANE dropped back inside and flattened
out in the stretch. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE prompted the pace three wide for half a mile and stopped. GO SKIPPY GO lagged far behind losing contact with
his field and was eased.

MARCO ISLAND controlled the pace inside, widened into the stretch and remained safe under mild pressure. FLIGHT RISK settled between rivals early,
moved inside on the final turn and was up for the place. CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY rated four wide down the backstretch, bid on the final turn and continued
gamely. RISQUE REBEL pressed the winner outside for five furlongs and faltered. ACKER dropped back after the start, raced far back and lacked a rally.
MY MAN ELVIS forced the pace briefly then stopped after half a mile. YONDERING lagged far behind throughout and was never a factor.
SUPERHIGHWAY moved wide off the leaders and gave way readily.

GOGEES vied outside, took over at the quarter pole then quickly drew away under mild urging and coasted home. UNION FLEET broke sluggishly,
advanced wide on the turn and stretch while closing well. BUBBA G trailed in the opening quarter, rallied inside, angled out in the stretch and gained nicely.
THE MASE stalked the pacesetters wide for half a mile and faltered. MUTTLEY raced off the leaders outside and was never in contention. GREAT
ASSUMPTIONS earned a narrow advantage inside and stopped after half a mile.

BACI settled inside, advanced on the turn, angled out in the stretch outdueled rival to the finish. VICS COOL CAT saved ground throughout, lacked speed,
moved strongly on the turn and through the stretch and just missed. STILL ALIVE prompted the pace, faded on the turn then came again for the show.
VANQUISHER dropped back outside then finished with some late energy. THIS ROUND'S MINE quickly sprinted clear, increased her margin on the turn
then weakened in the stretch. ADHWAA trailed early and lacked a rally. SPUN D'ETAT was urged close up wide down the backstretch, bore out on the turn
and stopped.
