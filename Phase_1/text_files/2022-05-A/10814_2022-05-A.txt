Footnotes
ELUSIVE JESTER set the pace while in the two path, drew out on the far turn, and was still clear by the furlong marker and then held sway late while
weakening. BOSSY CAT was well rated on the inside, eased out and advanced three wide on the far turn, shifted out four wide in the drive and rallied. BIFF
was three wide into the first turn and prompted the pace, then fell back nearing the three eighths marker, then came five wide into the lane and bested the
rest. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY was off a step slow, then threw head early, stalked the pace four wide and then moved to the inside on the far turn and tired.
SUPER HOUDINI was off slowly and was never a factor.

WAHOOWA WAHOOWA vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear leaving the five sixteenths, then was kept to right
handed crop urging to remain clear to prove best. LEGIT was rated along early and was five wide on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the far turn,
could not gain on the winner while getting the nod for the place award. BUILT THAT WAY vied for the lead on the inside with the winner and could not keep
up with that rival on the turn while keeping on to the wire but was outkicked for the place award. VITESSE was settled early on the inside, then shifted to the
outside on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole, belated rally for the minor rewards. AUTOMATE was between rivals on the first turn, then was on
the inside on the far turn, made a mild move and swung out four wide for the drive and was empty. KATHERN'S JOY stalked the early pace four wide and
weakened.
