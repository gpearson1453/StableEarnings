Footnotes
UPSTART GENTLEMAN was reserved early and was four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and closed well on the outside to get up
winning the head bob on the wire to prove best under a drive. LONG POND was off slowly, then was between horses early, found his way to the rail nearing
the quarter pole while advancing, then closed and had to alter course in the lane and just missed losing the head bob on the wire, brutal trip. FULL SCREEN
stalked the early pace and then made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command leaving the quarter pole, kept on to the wire holding on to the show
award, good effort. GALVASTON was away alertly, tracked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn nearing the quarter pole, kept on but
needed more late, just missed show award. PERFECT CRIME was settled four wide early, then was three wide on the turn and had no punch in the drive.
READY HERO was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and had a mild late rally. GIANT TEDDY set the pace on the inside and then dueled
for the lead by the quarter pole and weakened final furlong. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. MAD DOG N JOE
was allowed to settle three wide and weakened. COO BIRD failed to menace. J M R BEST OF TURF was not a factor.

DANI'S VICTORY was reserved early and saved ground on the turn, awaited room, found room when straightened and closed up the inside and drew clear
in the furlong grounds under mild urging. TRANQUILITY BASE vied for the early lead on the inside, then stalked the pace on the turn and made a two wide
bid leaving the turn and finished willingly but could not match strides with winner late, second best. BAY OF RUM tracked the pace on the inside, eased off
the inside nearing the quarter pole and came three wide into the drive and was up for the show award but needed more. ROBUSTO tracked the pace three
wide and came four wide into the drive but had no kick, missed show award. HALLIE'S HERO was allowed to settle early, angled out in the drive and had a
belated rally. A I INITIATIVE was bumped at the start, reserved early three wide, came six wide into the lane and showed some late interest. OUR ZUMA
vied for the early lead between horses, then made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn but weakened the final furlong. D'S BEN was
settled early on the inside and lacked a rally. JACK BEANSTALK vied for the lead three to four wide and weakened.

was kept to right handed crop pressure to prove best. ALL IN SYNC was reserved early, came five wide into the lane a d rallied well to be clearly second
best. IRONSTONE tracked the early pace and was two wide on the turn and lacked the needed winning stretch bid, bested rest. DETERMINED KINGDOM

wide by the quarter pole and lacked a rally. SILENT RUNNER was allowed to settler early, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. VICTORY JET
stalked the early pace three wide, then dropped down to the inside on the turn and stopped. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

UNCLE JOE set the early pace and was well handled on the turn, then was sent down leaving the turn and dug in gamely and was kept safe late under a
drive. WINSTON BLUE was bumped a the start, stalked the winner throughout and was two wide on the turn and tipped out three wide in the stretch and
finished willingly but could not get to the winner. ENCHANT ME was reserved early, came five wide into the drive, was bumped by the three sixteenths pole
and then rallied. GUARD OF HONOUR chased the early pace on the inside, tipped out two wide in the drive but needed more. MARITIME MISSION was
allowed to settle early, then had a belated rally on the inside. COMMANDER JOE chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive but had no
late kick. HALL OF DREAMS chased the pace between horses and had no rally. RED MERCURY was taken back early and had no speed and came seven
wide into the drive and found best stride late. MYSTIFIED was settled early and was four wide on the turn and weakened in the drive.

SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was taken back early, moved to the outside and made a bid run on the far turn, came seven wide into the drive, continued that
move and drew away in the furlongs to score the victory under mild urging. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was five wide into the first turn, then settled four to five
wide, came eight wide into the drive and rallied well to gain the place award. MASTER MCGRATH was settled early between horses, came four wide into
the lane and finished with interest to just miss the place. MILANO was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace three to four wide, came five wide into
the drive and had no kick in the drive. GOSPEL WAY set a pressured pace two wide early, then dueled for command on the inside down the backstretch
and weakened in the drive. HOLYFIELD was rated two wide early and then eased out and made a three wide bid on the far turn but weakened. BREAKING
ALONE was allowed to settle early on the inside on the backstretch and lacked a rally. COLLECTIVE FORCE pressed the pace on the inside and tired.
POUND GREEN prompted the pace three wide, then dueled for the lead two wide on the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
TAKE A CHANCE was away alertly and soon clear, opened up a bid lead on the turn, then remained well clear to prove much the best under mild urging.
HELL BENT was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and angled outside and rallied well to be clearly second best. STOP THE HUMBUG was
allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive and lacked the needed winning bid while gaining the show award. WILD RIVER WOLF was settled four
wide early, then made a mild three wide bid on the turn and came up empty in the drive, lost show award late. PUGIN was reserved early, advanced two
wide on the turn but had no ,late kick. KOSMONAVT was settled back early and saved ground to the quarter pole, swung off the inside and came six wide
into the drive and passed the tiring rivals. BEYOND MY DREAMS was settled early between horses, then moved to the inside on the turn and weakened.
INCENDIO was outrun early and failed to menace. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS was settled early on the inside and tired. RIGHT TO STRIKE was three to four
wide and not a threat. CAM WOOLLEY was not a factor.
