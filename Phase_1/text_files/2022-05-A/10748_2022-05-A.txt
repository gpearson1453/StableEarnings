Footnotes
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP pressed the pace three wide through the turn, bid three wide near the quarter pole while between rival, lost ground to the
runner-up when straightening in the lane, shifted in a bit with aim on the leader, dueled with that one through the final sixteenth and inched up late. MISS
DEPUTY STAR stalked the three rival duel through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, cleared outside the eighth pole, was joined by the winner
approaching the sixteenth pole and could not hold the top one safe. DONTYOUREMEMBER raced along the inside through the turn while near the back,
shifted off the inside near the eighth pole and finished with good energy to be closing in late. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE raced in the three to the two path
through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, was gaining momentum when brushed near the sixteenth pole and needed more. GOLDEN
COMMAND saved ground through the turn while along the inside, came off the rail through the lane and was even. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN vied for the
lead along the inside of two others through the turn then gave way entering the lane. BREWSKY raced in the three path through the turn, swung into the
lane from the six path and never factored. CECILIA'S HOPE pressed the pace two wide and between rivals through the turn and was empty turning into the
lane. Raced was hand-timed due to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
PABLO'S MINX settled off the early pace while in the three path, bid between rivals approaching the quarter pole, gained the lead into the lane, maintained
a short advantage with an eighth to go then was confidently handled to the end. WINNING QUALITY set the pace while along the inside through late turn,
was challenged for the top spot by the winner into the lane, stayed with that one for a sixteenth then could not keep up while remaining under a drive and
settling for second best. MAJESTIC CLIMB stalked the pacesetter from the three path, bid three wide in late turn, was a serious contender into the lane, lost
ground to the top two and flattened out nearing the sixteenth pole and just lasted for the show spot. MOMOS HUMOR raced in the two or three path through
the turn, was asked for more before leaving the turn, raced in the four path through the lane and was never a threat while gaining on the show rival. WANNA
HAVE FUN was never a factor while in the three path through the turn. STYLIN UPTOWN chased the pace from the two path through the turn and was
done nearing the quarter pole.

HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE set the pace from the two path through the turn, continued on a short lead into the lane, moved clear outside the eighth pole then
slowly widened to the end. COMPLEX JUSTICE raced along the inside into the turn, was steadied in mid-turn, continued in close proximity into the lane
,could not keep up with the winner through the final eighth and was all out to save the place spot. HIGHEST PRAISE chased the pace the four to the three
path, came into the lane from the five path and just missed the place spot after and extended drive. HE'S A WARRIOR was in tight and taken up entering
the turn, settled along the rail through the turn and into the lane, was no threat to the top ones but finished best of the rest. HENRY RULES raced in good
position into the turn, was shuffled back before mid-turn then was never a threat thereafter. BLUE KALON never a factor while three wide through the turn.
TITLETOWN JUSTICE was brushed early while in a bit tight, steadied in mid-turn the steadily dropped back. LOADEMUPJUSTICE raced in the three or
four path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the five path and tired. ROYAL ICING was never a factor while four wide through the
turn.

Footnotes
KITTANSETT chased the pace along the inside into the far turn, was shuffled to last late in the turn, tipped into the four path for the drive, caught the field
just inside the eighth pole and drove past. IBERVILLE set the pace while under pressure into the far turn, bid entering the lane when under serious pressure
from two others, put those two away but was no match for the closing winner. FIRST GLIMPSE stalked the pace from the two path into the far turn, pressed
into the lane, was a serious threat after straightening in the lane then just lasted for the show spot. POLAR WIND settled off the pace while in the three path,
bid three wide in late turn, loomed as a major threat while in the four path into the lane then could not sustain the effort.

the two path then angled sharply into the five path inside the sixteenth pole and exploded to the wire. CARTIER CAT was unhurried while off the inside,
moved through the four path into the far turn, bid four wide near the quarter pole and into the lane, dueled with two others into deep stretch, gained a short
