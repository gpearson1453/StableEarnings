BIG BLUE LINE set the pace from the outset, raced on the inside through the far turn then drew away down the lane while ridden out to the wire.
BEYBLADER stalked the pace early on, raced in the five path along the far turn, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no
match for the winner in the final stages. GUT FEELING chased the pace early, raced in the four path along the turns, was in the five path into the lane while
making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. DUAL THREAT was slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and
moved up in the stretch drive. GROUP EIGHTEEN tracked the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. DEFIED stalked
the pace early on, raced in the three path along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. BRONZE HALO was a beat slow
and bothered at the start, never a factor. HE'S A KEEPER was steadied into the first turn and through after a half.

Footnotes
LOVE OF MY HEART tracked from midpack in the four path and outside of rivals, shifted to the six path entering the lane, chased while hanging on her left
lead through upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds while inching closer, bid soon after, led entering the final sixteenth, and held from rivals on
either side late. SOCIAL DILEMMA bumped an inner rival while being last away, trailed in the three path around the turn before swinging to the eight path in
upper stretch, rallied outside of foes in the final furlong, took aim on the top pair late, but just missed reeling in the leader. DOWNTOWN ABBY hopped
slightly at the start, tracked two wide while in the three path around the turn, ranged up while floating to the five path entering the lane, chased in upper
stretch as an outer LOVE OF MY HEART rallied alongside, vied while getting outkicked entering the final furlong, fought on through the late stages, but
missed re-reaching even terms while getting outfinished by an outer rival for place. FLASHY CHARGE broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace in the four
path around the turn, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, hung on his left lead through upper stretch, lugged inwardly in midstretch while getting
outkicked by an outer rival, but kept on and moved up in the final furlong. WINGS OF AN ANGEL vied inside of a pair of foes early on, then only inside of a
single rival around the turn, shook clear of that foe at the sixteenth pole, held sway through upper stretch from multiple chasers while hanging on his left
lead, but met a pair of bids passing the furlong grounds, and faltered entering the final sixteenth. URSULINA took a bump from an outer rival at the start,
stalked along the inside, checked behind BELL REBELLE passing the half mile pole, tracked from the two path around the bend, shifted out to the six path
entering the lane, but came up empty and tired. ANNA VOLANTE vied three wide early on, then two wide into the turn, but faded between horses in upper
stretch. BELLE REBELLE laid close up and between the leading pair early on, took back to stalk at the half mile pole, did so from behind the top two and in
the two path, but chased them entering the lane, and faded in upper stretch. ROOKERY took a light tap from an inner rival at the start, raced far back in the
two to three path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
GRAY'S FABLE set the pace inside of a pressing rival, drew clear of that foe in the two path in upper stretch, maintained a clear margin through midstretch,
bet HIDDEN STASH's blitz in the final sixteenth, and was saved by the wire. HIDDEN STASH settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path
entering the lane, unleashed a rally in upper stretch, produced a good kick in the final furlong to take aim on clear leader in the final sixteenth, but just ran
out of ground to reel that rival in. MR DUMAS stalked along the inside, chased the clearing leader in upper stretch to claim place from outer foes at the three
sixteenths pole, but flattened out in the final furlong, lost place entering the final sixteenth, but held show. SPANISH KINGDOM broke a step slowly,
recovered to stalk three wide into the turn, tugged against the bit leaving that bend, then chased the clear leader from the four path in upper stretch, got
outkicked by rivals on either side approaching the final furlong, then kept on thereafter, but missed reclaiming show. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) trailed along
the inside early on, moved out of last in the three path around the far turn, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to menace. MAX K. O.
hopped slightly at the start, prompted the pace setting eventual winner from the outside, but faded in the three path in upper stretch. SPECTACULAR GEM
raced far back in the three path, trailed in the four path turning for home, and was done early.

Footnotes
TOM'S REGRET set the pace inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, shook clear while shifting out entering the lane, and held firm from a rallying outer THE
BIG WAM through the final furlong. THE BIG WAM broke towards the back of the pack raced off of the pace and outside of rivals early on, gained five wide
around the turn, ranged up turning for home, claimed place in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, then chased that foe home while well clear of show
in the final furlong. RYVIT was bumped by an outer rival, forced inwardly,, and into crowded quarters between horses at the start, raced at the rear in the
two path, swung to the six path in upper stretch, rallied between horses in midstretch, and stayed on to reach show in the final sixteenth. MR. GORDY
pressed three wide, got floated four wide into the turn, became the leader's closest pursuer entering the lane, but was outkicked for place approaching the
furlong grounds, sustained his chase thereafter, but lost show to an outer rallying rival in the late stages. HURRICANE DEBBIE was void of early speed,
took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, shifted out to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up in the final furlong. HILL OF TARA broke a
step slowly before being bumped and forced inwardly by outer rivals att he start, raced off of the pace three wide, decidedly moved between horses into the
turn to gain a two wide stalking position, attempted to creep closer between the leaders turning for home, but failed to keep pace with TOM'S REGRET
entering the lane, and faded. BAYTOWN LOVELY tracked from midpack four wide and between horses into the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the
lane after getting outmoved by an outer rival, hung on his left lead while failing to progress in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds, but lacked
a bid thereafter. SIMPLY SUPER broke inwardly and forced inner rivals to go with him, raced off of the pace, was keen to place behind kick back while in
the four path into the turn, tucked two wide at the three furlong pole, tracked turning for home, but faded through the lane. LONE LEADER prompted the
pace two wide and between horses, drifted a path outwardly into the turn, then weakened entering the lane. FERRARI KID tracked along the inside, but
faded turning for home. KING ADROCK broke slowly before shying from an outer rival at the start, rushed soon after, but steadied behind the main group
into the turn, raced off of the pace two wide around the bend, but made little impact. COOL SPIRIT broke a step slowly while getting forced inwardly at the
start, took the turn at the rear in the four path, and was outrun.

final furlong, and reached to reel in the leader on the wire. CHANGE OF CONTROL tracked four wide, bid five wide entering the lane, led approaching the
furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer on-charging rival at the wire. GOIN' GOOD chased from the pocket around the turn, moved between horses
leaving the quarter pole, attempted a bid inside of the leaders in midstretch, but did not have enough. IN GOOD SPIRITS stalked three wide, vied four wide
and between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and chased the leaders home. CATCH A BID trailed in the two
path, shifted to the five path in midstretch, but failed to menace. BROOKE MARIE pressed two wide, vied three wide and between horses entering the lane,
but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. BULLSEYE BEAUTY tracked five wide and outside

Footnotes
QUICK MUNNY broke a bit outwardly at the start, set the pace in the two path, shook clear of pressing rivals in upper stretch, and edged further away
through the final furlong. SHES GREEKANDSLEEK stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase the leader through the lane to prove second best.
SOMEBODY LOVES ME tracked three wide while taking the turn in the four path, and kept on. TACHLIS was herded out mildly at the start, pressed three
wide, then two wide while in the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch. SWEET TRUFFLES took the turn in the four path while
off of the pace, and moved up. MRS. NUSHI tracked two wide, but faded entering the lane. LOVE OF MY LIFE broke a step slowly, raced at the rear in the
three path, and failed to menace. ABBY THE BULL DAWG trailed after breaking a bit slowly, trailed in the four path around the turn, and made little impact.
MONOCACY broke a beat slowly, tracked in midpack in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but tired. MAXINE'S CANDY laid off of the
pace in the three path, but was done early.
