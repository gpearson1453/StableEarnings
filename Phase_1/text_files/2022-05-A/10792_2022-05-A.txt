Footnotes
SHE RANUP THE AMEX set the pace under pressure down the backstretch, cleared in mid-turn while in the two path, continued in the two or three path
into the lane and widened through the lane while being kept to the task. LEA'S DREAMER tracked the pace along the inside through the turns, bid into the
lane, was no match for the winner while finishing clear for the place spot. KENZIE LOU raced in the three path into the far turn, continued in the three or four
path through mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane then could not gain on the top one while being outfinished for the place spot. WRAPPINJUSTICE settled
back while in the three path, came into the lane from the six path and never was a threat. WHOA NELLY WHOA pressed the pace from the three path,
stalked the winner into the lane and faded then was found to have bled during the running. MISSISSIPPI MUSE dropped back down the backstretch while
moving toward the outside, continued far from the rail into the far turn while continuing to drop back and was eventually pulled up.

Footnotes
CLIMBER raced off to a clear lead while in the two path, maintained the same advantage into the lane while entering the three path then continued to hold
the runner-up safe while being kept to the task. Z ZS RED chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, continued in the four or five path
through the lane, could not catch the top one but was clearly second best. GIFT OF FAITH trailed into the lane while moving from the two to the three path,
came into the lane from the five path and moved up to be clear for the show spot while not a threat. MISS LUV SHACK raced in the three path through the
turn when in good position, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. DARNELL raced along the inside through the turn and into
the lane and never factored. GIODORABLE in the five to the four path through the turn, was in the six path after straightening in the lane and never factored.
MAMALA KAMALA inn the two path through the turn when in mid-pack and was done entering the lane. EVIE JEAN was empty after entering the turn while
in the three or four path. DREAMERS DREAM was an early contender while chasing the top two finishers into the turn then dropped back after mid-turn.

Footnotes
LOUDER THAN WORDS settled off the early pace while off the inside, moved three wide and in the four path approaching the turn, continued on the
outside of three through the turn, entered the lane with a short lead and in the four path, continued with a short advantage to the eighth pole and moved
away late. DASH OF SIMPLICITY tracked the pacesetters while near the inside, angled off the rail after mid-turn, came three wide into the lane, loomed a
serious threat when straightening into the lane then could not keep up with the winner inside the sixteenth pole. SPLASH OF TONIC pressed the pace
through the turn while between rivals and in the two path, continued a contender into the lane then yielded to the top two but kept on to save the show spot.
PEEKACHICA trailed early, raced in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the seven path and rallied belatedly. WISHED was in the
two path through the turns and lacked a closing bid. LIEUTENANT KITTY never a factor while in the three path. REVS RUN set the pace along the inside
into the far turn then faded through the lane. LIGHTUPJUSTICE in the three or four path through the turn and tired. SWIFT TEMPLE was outrun while in the
three path.

Footnotes
E STREET ANGEL tracked the two rival duel through mid-turn, bid three wide approaching the five-sixteenths pole, dueled with the runner-up into the lane,
cleared outside the eighth pole and slowly widened. ROYAL TO BE vied for the lead along the inside, shook challenger off and joined by the winner, dueled
with that one into the lane then could not keep up while clearly second best. TAPPINTOTHEBEAT was in the two path through the turn when never far back,
came into the lane from the three path and lacked a closing bid. SHARP JUSTICE was along the inside through the turn and was never a serious threat.
SHES MY TREASURE was bumped at the start, settled back while in the three path and never factored. TRIP CHARGE was never a menace while in the
four path through the turn and the six path through the lane. FLASHY BELLE stepped in at the start, raced near the rail into the turn, came into the lane from
the five path and never factor. FUN KEY TOWN never a factor while well back. STORMY'S HERO vied for the lead two wide into the turn, gave way in
mid-turn and was empty turning into the lane.

SUNNY LANE pressed the early pace between foes, settled off the pace on the backstretch, bid three wide at the three-eighths pole and was clear under
mild urging. CAPTAIRE led inside briefly, was three wide on the far turn and gained late for the place. FRENCH CUFFS hopped at the start, raced six wide
around the first turn, bid at the three quarters and dueled outside, was clear but gave way in the drive. LAZARA was unrushed early, bid in the two path on
the far turn, then faltered. BETTERLOOKOUT stalked the pace inside, then faded in the stretch. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY pressed the pace in the four
turn, then faded on the far turn. PEACH COBBLER faded.
