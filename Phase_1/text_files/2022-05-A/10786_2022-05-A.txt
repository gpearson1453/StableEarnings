Footnotes
SQUARE CAT rated on the inside behind the leaders, eased off the rail on the far turn and came three wide into the lane, steered out further in upper
stretch, rallied four deep in the final sixteenth and drove past. TALKLESSWORKMORE raced up close outside the top pair, challenged three deep on the far
turn, took a narrow lead with a sixteenth remaining but got outkicked by the winner. FORE FLAG pressed the pace from outside, moved up to duel for
command at the midway point, vied between rivals into the drive, gained the lead in upper stretch, overtaken at the sixteenth pole and fought gamely to the
wire. HOT LEGS ROMOLO took the early lead and moved inside, set the pace under pressure, dueled into and around the far turn, vied with a pair of rivals
into the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, fought on to deep stretch and yielded late. LIMITED HEATWAVE got crowded between rivals soon
after the start, became rank into the first turn, was still a bit rank at the five-eighths pole, angled to the inside for the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and
kept on to improve position. MOGOLLON RIM broke a bit slow from inside, steered off the rail to the two path, raced in range to the second bend, remained
two wide into the lane and could not rally. BLUE STAR went three to four wide around the clubhouse turn, two then three wide on the second bend and
never threatened. TUCKER'S TRIBUTE got shuffled between rivals early, angled four wide leaving the far turn, lacked room behind rivals at the eighth pole
and could no trally. DARK MARCUS forced to take up early, went five then four wide on the first turn, crept closer from outside up the backstretch, came five
wide into the stretch and weakened. ATTENZIONE was off a step slow, checked behind a rival on the first turn, went two wide into the lane and was not a
factor. AGRIGENTO pulled in the early stages on the inside, hugged the rail into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA broke well, pressed the pace from outside then three deep between, suffered a mild shuffle early on the turn, took aim three wide into the
stretch, drew alongside the runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and got up. LIBERALISM broke a bit slow then lost path at the start, angled to the outside
and went up press four deep, took over early on the turn, cleared and angled to the two path, led into deep stretch and could not fend off the winner. RED
PANTY NIGHT coaxed between to take the front, set the pace under pressure early, dueled into the turn, lost command early around the bend, lost touch
with the leader nearing the quarter pole, chased two wide into the drive and held the show. WILD ARCH showed brief speed then chased past the
nine-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside, tipped out in the stretch, went between rivals and kept on while unable to get by RED PANTY NIGHT for third.
DORITA'S HAPPY chased between then had her path taken by WILD ARCH at the five-eighths pole, chased two wide into the bend, remained off the rail to
the stretch and could not rally. ROSES R BLUE pressed the pace between rivals then from inside, got put in tight on the turn, stayed along the rail to the
stretch and weakened. BACK ON THE STREET raced greenly along the inside then had to steady near the nine-sixteenths pole, taken out into the clear on
the backstretch, went three to four wide around the bend and could not rally. SHOUT IT OUT chased three deep early then had hear path taken at the
five-eighths, continued three deep into the turn, raced three to four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ARMAGNAC set the pace on the inside, met the bid from HIGH CONNECTION leaving the backstretch, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole, then drew off
and widened under right-handed urging. HIGH CONNECTION stumbled slightly leaving the gate, bumped with outside rival while three deep entering the
first turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside ARMAGNAC at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the winner past the
five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and stayed on for the place. FAST DRAW MUNNINGS ran up on heels entering the first turn and had to
steady, rated on the inside after, steered out leaving the far turn and came three wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and lacked a bid.
CLAMPETT chased between into the first turn then was taken back off the pace, traveled two wide through the far turn and lacked further response.
FOWLER BLUE bumped four deep into the first turn, chased three then four wide on the second bend and weakened. DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL went two
wide into the first turn, angled out then had to steady off heels around the bend, trailed three then two wide on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
NEWPARK (IRE) bobbled to the front at the start, became rank over the dirt crossing, cleared around the turn, challenged gain by DONCIC in the final
furlong and held gamely to the wire. DONCIC chased off the rail then pressed between, lost touch with the leader on the turn but continued to track that rival
in the two path to the stretch, bid alongside with a furlong remaining and lacked the needed late kick to get by. EXPLOSIVE stalked the pace from inside,
saved ground into the lane, was poised to make a run but was boxed in through the lane and could never get out to a clear path and finished willingly for
third. COMMANDER KHAI raised his head and broke a few lengths slow, moved closer but lost his path at the nine-sixteenths pole and had to pause, went
two wide into the turn then steered to the rail, angled out at the top of the stretch and needed to find more in the deep stretch. CODE DUELLO was off slow
from inside, chased two wide into the turn between runners, swung out leaving the bend but failed to threaten. SCRATCHY APACHE came away a bit slow,
went up to press outside then three deep into the turn, lost ground around the bend, got floated five wide leaving the turn and weakened. BRIX tracked
outside a rival, three then two wide on the turn and weakened. KING APOLLO tracked wide up the backstretch then steered to the four path, went four deep
into the turn, angled to the three path around the bend and failed to respond in the drive.

Footnotes
ELM DRIVE broke out and bumped UNSOLVED MYSTERY then sped to the front, set the pace off the rail, angled in for the turn, roused with a quarter mile
remaining, kicked clear in upper stretch, widened to the sixteenth pole and held safely in the end. KIRSTENBOSCH broke slow from outside, trailed four
wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend, steered out in the lane and rallied belatedly to earn the place and close the gap on the
winner. EMPIRE GAL stumbled leaving the gate, took hold and was guided to the outside, closed in and raced outside the top pair on the turn but faltered in
the final furlong. UNSOLVED MYSTERY got bumped by the winner leaving the gate, raced up close to the outside, chased three then two wide around the
turn and weakened down the lane. CLASSICAL ROMANCE stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out with a sixteenth to go and
failed to find the needed response.

Footnotes
LANSDOWNE (GB) broke well, showed early speed then ceded the lead and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out
and bid between foes at the eight pole, fought with ADMIRAL HALSEY late and dug in for the victory. ADMIRAL HALSEY stumbled leaving the gate, settled
in mid-pack outside a rival, advanced three wide around the turn, bid three deep upper and took over at the eighth pole, fought with the winner in deep
stretch and was edged in the final moments. DANIEL'S MAGIC traveled in mid-pack along the inside, waited for room around the turn, found a clear path in
upper stretch then tipped out and split foes late to gain the show. KAZUHIKO (AUS) settled inside, tipped out and tried to go between rivals but lacked room
near the quarter pole, came back inside entering the stretch, tipped out in the lane and got outkicked for the show honors. PRAY FOR ME RAY was off slow
to begin, trailed up the backstretch off the rail, went three then four wide around the turn and rallied belatedly. CONCH DADDY vied for the lead between
rivals then dueled inside TWOKIDSFROMDABRONX, inched ahead and held a short lead into the turn, cleared with a quarter mile left to run, lost command
at the eighth pole and flattened late. VANCOUGAR sat off the pace, went two wide into the turn, swung five wide leaving the bend and got bumped entering
the stretch and could not rally. NATIONAL ROAD stalked off the rail, angled four wide and bumped rival entering the stretch and also lacked a rally.
HOODLUM was off slow to begin, saved ground around the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. FIRST CLASS DAD was off a bit slow to
begin, raced in range off the rail, went two to three wide around the bend, angled to the inside in the lane and was not persevered with.
TWOKIDSFROMDABRONX vied for the lead three deep early then outside CONCH DADDY, pressed that rival into the turn, lost touch near the quarter pole
and faded.

Footnotes
NEVER SWAY got crowded and steadied soon after the start, raced near the back outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, eased out and came three to
four wide into the stretch, steered out further in the drive, closed fast and swooped by the top pair late. BLAZING BARDOT vied three deep between rivals
early then inched ahead to take control up the backstretch, kicked clear and angled in on the turn, challenged from outside in the furlong grounds, resisted
into the final sixteenth and was run down by the winner. MISS BAYLEE vied between for command, got shuffled back a bit entering the turn, remained in
range and took aim two wide at the leader into the stretch, bid from outside with a furlong left to run but lacked the final kick. BELLEO'S MUSIC chased
along the rail into the turn, lacked room and checked around the bend, altered outside in upper stretch and put in a late run for a minor award. GOOD BOO
JOO was off a bit slow and brushed inner rival, chased off the rail then tugged the rider closer, urged two wide into the stretch and needed to find more late.
DREAMER GIRL brushed leaving the gate, chased four then three wide on the turn and flattened out. QUICK TAKE tracked five wide into the turn, driven
four wide into the lane and failed to rally. NO PEOPLE hit the gate and came away slow, traveled along the rail into the turn, angled out and entered the lane
four wide, drifted inward in the lane and failed to menace. SHEILA'S CHARLIE stumbled leaving the gate, pressed the pace from inside, got shuffled early
on the turn, lost ground around the bend and came up empty. LYINATTHEBAR vied for the lead three deep, chased the leader three deep early on the turn,
dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
PALEO'S PRINCESS attended the pace four deep up the backstretch, bid three deep on the turn, took over past the eighth pole and inched ahead late. M
IS FOR MAGIC was off a bit slow then went up to vie for command, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, lost command past the eighth pole and stayed on
gamely from inside to the wire. GYPSY LYNN broke slow and bumped leaving the gate, chased two wide then three deep into the stretch and bested the
rest. GRANDIOSELY was off slow to begin, swung five to six wide leaving the bend and kept on to round out the superfecta. TWIRLING GRACE stalked
inside, coaxed midway around the turn but faltered in the late stages. KITTEN CALLS was off slow at the start, drifted in and steadied when almost
contacting rival early, saved ground to the stretch and improved placings. BABY KRISTEN chased widest up the backstretch, went four to five wide on the
turn and weakened. PHOENIX TEARS vied for command between rivals, could not keep pace around the bend, chased between foes into the drive and
weakened. SWEETHEART settled off the pace and moved inside, angled out and came three wide into the lane, drifted out and lost her path behind a rival
in the lane and was not persevered with. TOPOLINA bumped leaving the gate, vied for command three deep, pressed the leader from outside on the turn
and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
DEFUNDED raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, applied pressured midway up the backstretch, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, took
over with a quarter mile left to run, then cleared and drew away in the late stages. TRIPLE TAP broke out and bumped, stalked three wide early, coaxed
three to four wide on the far turn, could not threaten the winner in the furlong grounds but finished well to prove second best. LOUD MOUTH set the pace on
the inside, got pressured near the four furlong mark, headed by rival midway on the far turn, lost command and chased the leader leaving the far turn and
flattened to third. BOLD ENDEAVOR got bumped from inside at the start, chased in the two path then moved inside, saved ground into the lane and lacked
further response. WICKED TRICK broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, advanced outside rivals around the far turn and failed to make an impact.
DARK VADER got pinballed leaving the gate, went three wide around the first turn, exited the far turn two wide and could not rally. SURFING STAR brushed
leaving the gate, chased three deep then four wide on the first turn, remained off the rail to the second bend, angled down to the two path and had little left
for the drive.

gained the place. CHERUBIC FACTOR stalked off the rail, bid three deep at the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch, lost command past the eight
pole and got outfinished for second. HALFBARBERBINGIE broke slow and lost his path leaving the gate, angled to the inside, gained on the far turn while
angling out, entered the stretch four wide, steered out further in the lane and finished with a mild late rally. KANT BEAT THE ROCK sped to the front and
angled to the rail, dueled to the far turn, vied with rivals into the lane, fought to midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. GOLDINI tucked inside early,
got bumped from outside entering the far turn, waited for room around the bend, raced in traffic near the eighth pole and was never able to rally. HOOP
DREAM traveled in mid-pack from the two path, shifted in and bumped rival entering the far turn, was along three wide into the drive and flattened. MY
SUMMER DREAM vied between into the first turn then stalked the top pair leaving the clubhouse turn, waited for room on the far turn then weakened down
the lane. ROSENQUIST vied three deep into the first turn, dueled outside a rival to the far turn, vied between foes entering the stretch and folded.
