Footnotes
ANNIE'S CHIEF was off a step slowly and lacked speed to the turn, gained ground on the inside on the turn, continued that advance along the rail in upper
stretch, overtook the runner-up nearing the sixteenth pole and edged clear in the end. OMAHA RUTSCH tracked the moderate early fractions from a ground
saving path, angled two to three wide for the drive, took a narrow edge into the final furlong but was overtaken nearing the sixteenth marker by the winner
and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest. STING LIKE A BEE won the break and set moderate fractions while being prompted through the turn, came
under pressure nearing the furlong grounds and gave way in the late going. DREW BIG kept close attendance to the early pace, advanced on the
pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, lost position in upper stretch and was empty for the drive. SLIGHT APPROVAL chased the pace to the turn, lost
position nearing the quarter pole and was not a threat. AFRICAN PRINCE broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn,
came under a ride nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late bid.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO PRETTY was unhurried in the opening stages, made a middle move along the backstretch run, came three wide nearing the quarter marker,
overtook the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker and held in the final stages over the oncoming runner-up. REV REE was three wide while just off of the
early pace on the first turn, was steered four wide along the second turn, closed well in upper stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but was
best of the rest. BANDEENA had her head turned at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled along the inside through the early stages, continued to save
ground into the far turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the final furlong but found her best stride late and was up just in time to get the nod for third.
PROOF OF JAZZ was away in good order and set the pace to the second turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished in the
end, just being edged for the show. MAGICAL THOUGHT saved ground while traveling just off of the pace in midpack, advanced on the second turn but
could not go on with that bid and lacked a late response. STATEFOREST stalked the early pace while two wide, maintained that path into the second turn,
lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
CONNIE'S PROMISE was away in good order and was sent to the front leaving the break, set moderate fractions while on a clear lead through the second
turn, repelled a bid nearing the quarter marker and extended the lead in upper stretch, again felt pressure in the final sixteenth but held determinedly to
prevail. ARISTEIA was three wide while traveling in the second flight on the first turn, advanced on the CONNIE'S PROMISE approaching the quarter pole,
was repelled in that effort and lost ground in upper stretch, came on again in the final sixteenth and could not reel in the winner but held for second.
CYCLONE SLEW saved ground on the first turn while in midpack, lost position along the backstretch run and into the second turn, lacked room leaving the
second turn, finished well in the final furlong and could not reel in the winner but just missed for second and was clear for the show. FRONT OF LINE (GB)
took up in tight quarters leaving the break, was unhurried while saving ground early on, made a five wide bid along the second turn and could not make an
impact on the top three but showed good late interest. DARK INTENT stumbled at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the pace while three wide on
the first turn, advanced on the second turn while four wide and offered a mild rally in the stretch run. FUNKY GREY crowded ROSARITA CARMELITA at the
start, was prominent in the early going, stalked the pace from a two wide path into the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. ROSARITA CARMELITA was bothered by FUNKY GREY at the start and was away slowly, recovered to settle two wide off of the pace and lacked
a late response. UNBRIDLE THE WILD was up close to the pace on the first turn while four then three wide, lost ground along the backstretch run, was
shuffled leaving the three furlong marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
ZERO BUCKS GIVEN broke sharply and cleared the field to set the early pace, showed good speed through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch,
felt late pressure from the runner-up, was all out in the final stages and held on to prevail. PAPPY BOYINGTON was hard to load, hopped at the start and
was off slowly, recovered nicely to track the pace from the inside to the turn, advanced in upper stretch, continued to gain on ZERO BUCKS GIVEN in the
final sixteenth and just missed in the end for the win, while well clear of the rest. THAT'S BIND BABE was off a step slowly but recovered well to chase the
solid pace, was three deep on the turn, was outkicked in the drive but kept on to secure the show. SONORA SERMON tracked the early pace, made a slight
advance on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CASH LIMIT saved ground while
chasing the pace and did not offer a late rally. GOVERNOR ARTHUR chased the pace four wide through the turn and gave way in the stretch run. HARDY
CHISEL lacked early speed, was two to three wide on the turn, swung widest into the drive and did not threaten. BERNIE'S BIG BOY chased the solid pace
from the second flight while five wide on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LEXINGTON HUMOR tracked the quick early pace, shifted to the inside approaching the turn, was roused midway through the turn and took command into
the stretch, extended the lead inside of the furlong grounds and was ridden out in the end in an impressive debut. GOVERNOR SPECIAL was forwardly
placed early on while three wide, gave ground to the winner in upper stretch, was no match for that rival in the final stages but was best of the rest.
GRANDMA SHARK chased the fast pace from the inside, was outkicked in upper stretch but was clear for third in the end. MARTINI MISCHIEF broke
alertly and was sent to the front, showed good early speed to the turn, was overtaken by the winner midway through the turn and weakened in the late
stages. R SILVER FLASH was away a bit slowly, chased the early pace, improved while three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch. ROSABELLA
chased the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker while two wide and lacked a late response. PIAZZETTA was away in good order,
bucked twice soon after the break and was hard to place, lost position on the run to the turn, came three to four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LA VIKINA was prominent in the early going while stalking the pace, prompted the fractions into the second turn, advanced in upper stretch to confront LA
REINE'S LEGACY nearing the furlong marker, battled with that game rival and dug in in the final stages to prevail. LA REINE'S LEGACY was away alertly
and was sent to set the pace, was prompted to the second turn by the winner while setting moderate fractions, was confronted by LA VIKINA nearing the
furlong grounds, battled through the lane with that foe and was gamely bested in the end, while well clear of the rest. MERCY MERCY hopped at the start
and was of a bit slowly, saved all of the ground while settling off of the pace, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive but held for third over an oncoming
rival. GEA was unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the second turn, was steered four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the
stretch run, came on in the final furlong and just missed for third. LOTSABLING settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced along the
second turn but did not go on with that bid and lacked a late rally, while just missing for third. SHEZARUNAWAY settled off of the pace while two wide, lost
position along the second turn and did not offer a late response. SHEZAGHOST stalked the early pace while three wide, lost position along the backstretch
run and into the second turn and was empty for the drive. MISTY CAT settled three wide off of the early pace, advanced while three wide entering the
second turn but could not go on with that bid and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
BIG BENO was away a bit slowly, lacked speed to the turn, was steered outside of rivals to be four then five wide nearing the quarter marker, circled six
wide into the stretch, closed with a rush in upper stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker and drew away in the end in a good debut. SPEED
GRAZY chased the early pace, was three wide along the turn, was outkicked by the winner in the drive but made up ground in the end to be clear for
second. KERRY GOLD chased the pace from a ground saving position, was outkicked in the stretch run but was up for third in the final strides. MIKE DAD
was climbing a bit in the early stages while close up, was two to three wide at the head of the lane while still within aim, was overtaken by the winner nearing
the furlong marker and faltered in the final stages, just missing for third. BLUE SILVER broke alertly and was engaged soon after the break by SHE THINKS
IM CUTE and dueled with that foe through quick opening fractions, maintained that contested pace through the turn, was caught by the winner nearing the
eighth pole and weakened in the late going. THUNDER OF ZION was away slowly, lacked speed to the turn, improved position in upper stretch but was not
a factor. SHE THINKS IM CUTE engaged with BLUE SILVER soon after the start and dueled for pace duties with that rival, kept up that pace duel through
the turn, was overhauled by the winner approaching the furlong grounds and tired in the late stages. MY LITTLE TAYLOR tracked the fast early pace, was
three wide on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
ICONIC SKY was sent leaving the break and established a clear early lead, set fast fractions through the turn, was kept to task through the lane and was
clear in the end. ROSE MADDOX chased the fractions outside of rivals, advanced in upper stretch, continued that run through the drive and could not reel in
the winner in the end but was clear for second. IRISH WAHINE chased the fast pace from midpack while three wide, gained ground in upper stretch but was
outkicked in the final stages and was clear for third. AMAAZA hit the gate leaving the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed while trailing through
the turn, was not a threat to the top three in the end but showed good late interest. CODE RIBBON took back leaving the break, chased the fast pace from a
two wide path through the turn and faltered in the drive. DULCE EMMA was bit rank in the early stages while chasing the pace, saved ground on the turn,
made an inside bid in upper stretch but could not go on with that run and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
I'M DR. O tracked the fast early pace to the turn, advanced two wide approaching the quarter marker, continued that gain in upper stretch, caught the
pacesetter nearing the sixteenth marker and drew clear in the end. CARDIFF CRACK tracked the early pace to the turn, lost ground along the turn while two
wide, re-rallied in the drive, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but edged clear in the end for second. SECOND NATURE was hustled to the front
leaving the break, set fast fractions while on a clear lead through the turn, came back to the field a bit nearing the eighth pole, was caught nearing the
sixteenth marker and held safely for the show in the end. UNION GIG was a bit slow into stride early on, chased the fast pace along the turn while two wide,
gained ground in upper stretch and continued that rally through the final furlong. ALWAYS LITT was bumped at the start and recovered nicely to be
prominent in the early going, lost ground on the turn while on the inside and faltered in the stretch run. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE was forwardly placed
early on while three wide, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. HAVAKASH READY had an awkward beginning and was away slowly,
was void of early speed and was not a threat. SMILING AT VAL broke out at the start and bumped ALWAYS LITT, chased the fast pace from a three wide
path through the turn and was not a factor. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT lacked early speed, was outrun along the turn, stopped leaving the bend, was eased
through the stretch and walked off under his own power.
