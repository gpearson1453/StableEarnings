Footnotes
KAITLYN'S COURT was unhurried early on, made a steady advance from the inside towards the far turn, experienced traffic, waited briefly near the quarter
pole, moved up along the rail through the upper stretch and proved best late to get up under all out pressure. CUSTOM MADE settled off the early pace,
made a wide bid through the lane and finished gamely to the wire. MY AVANI tracked Shooting Stick in the early stages, raced near the inside and
weakened a bit in the drive. JUST A WIN stalked the top pair early on, challenged through the far turn and tired while racing four wide. SHOOTING STICK
was quick to begin to set the early pace and gave way the final quarter of a mile. GERRIE LOU was slow early, raced five wide through the upper stretch
and never threatened.

Footnotes
GOROSTIETA'S LOVE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to prevail under all out pressure.
MARVINS GOLD settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced five deep through the upper stretch and finished willingly to the
wire. GENUINE KITTEN settled off the pace, moved up four wide through the upper lane, shifted in and finished willingly to the wire. BLAZE OF GRAY was
unhurried early, moved up six to seven wide through the stretch and improved position. CHARLIE'S STAR dwelt at the start, lost a considerable amount of
ground, moved up five wide through the far turn, angled in through the upper lane and had not enough after the troubling start. ORPHAN CREEK stalked the
pace and weakened along the inside. I'M A FLASHY KID settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced near the inside into the lane and had no late rally.
MORO PHAROAH was slow early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. T G'S NELSON showed good speed from the
inside and gave way. MARLIESRAJUNCAJUN showed good early foot and tired readily.

Footnotes
AHIMAAZ vied for the early lead from the inside, drifted through the lane and was clear late under all out pressure. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS was hustled
along, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and improved position in the drive. CHEATIN CHARLIE was hustled along, raced five to six wide through
the upper stretch and made a good belated rally. SPRY CHARLIE stalked the pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in late and
weakened. BIG TIME BANDIT raced three deep around the turn and had no response. BULLETSREVENGE was coaxed from the inside and weakened in
the drive. VALIANT CHARGE dueled early on from the outside and tired.
