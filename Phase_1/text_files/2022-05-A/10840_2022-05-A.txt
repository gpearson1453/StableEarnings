Footnotes
HURRICANE FLORENCE was off a step behind the field and dropped back early, rallied inside the leaders in early backstretch to quickly seize command
and drew off in hand as much best. JUST LUCK bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the leaders three wide but could not go with the winner.
SCARLETT O'HANNA bumped with a rival at the start, rallied four wide going to the far turn then could not threaten the top pair in the lane. YOUNG'UN
forced the pace outside RUN BRINLEE RUN early and weakened. JUST SEND HER was not a factor. RUN BRINLEE RUN made the early lead racing out
from the rail and weakened.

under mild urging. DABBLIN CHANNEL saved ground in reach of the leaders to the backstretch, moved out to bid three wide in the far turn and get nearest
the winner but could not cut the margin in the lane. WINGS UP moved out on the far turn rally four wide but could not reach the top pair in the lane.
KAMIKAZE JUDGE stalked the leaders three wide and weakened. ON THE BRIDGE saved ground and was always back. ALL SHACKED UP moved off to

Footnotes
SCOOTER'S BOY saved ground at the back of the field to the far turn, moved up through that bend and continued in the lane to split foes through a narrow
opening midstretch and forged to the front late. PODEROSO EQUS saved ground in good position throughout, angled three wide in the far turn and rallied
outside rivals in the lane but came up shot in the drive. FORT KNOX was on the pace inside MACHO MADNESS to the far turn, edged clear into the lane
and dug in when challenged but could not contain the top pair late. AMERICAN CAMP stalked the pace in good position three to four wide but lacked the
needed closing run. LOOKING FOR BULL was in reach while three wide but lacked a solid closing bid. MACHO MADNESS forced the pace outside FORT
KNOX to the far turn and weakened. GONE PREACHIN was not a factor two and three wide.

Footnotes
REMARKABLE CHARM was angled out in the first turn while near the back, moved up going to the far turn, continued four wide to rally into the lane and
went clear under steady handling. LIL MISS DE BUY stalked the pace from along the inside and rallied clear for her position while no match for the winner.
PURPLE SCOOTER moved to a clear early lead along the inside, made the pace to upper stretch and came up empty while just saving third late.
AMOREENA STAR stalked the leader three wide to bid in the far turn but was lacked the needed late run. FIVE B C moved up three wide while not a threat
late. PORSUMSUGARONME saved ground midpack, angled out in the lane but did not threaten. ATOKA GIRL was not a factor. OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL
followed the early pace three wide and tired.
