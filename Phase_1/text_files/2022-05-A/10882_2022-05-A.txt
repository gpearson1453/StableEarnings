Footnotes
SOUPER COHIBA was reserved early, eased out on the turn and came six wide into the lane and closed full of run to get up in time under a drive.
EMICRACK (CHI) set the early pace on the inside and was well handled, turned back the bid from HALF LIT leaving the turn and shook clear by the furlong
marker but was denied late to just miss. HALF LIT stalked the pacesetter from the inside to two wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn to go on even
terms and maybe put a head in front but flattened out in the drive. BOKERMIN tracked the pace and was two to three wide on the turn, tipped out four wide
for the drive and had no kick. QIAN B C was allowed to settle while three wide on the turn and had no rally. IVY'S STAR was reserved early and was roused
while four wide leaving the three eighths peg and had no response. GOLDMINE CAT was settled on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
ADORA dueled for the early lead three wide and made a bid leaving the turn and was given one pop left handed with the riding crop nearing the furlong
marker and responded well to draw off in the furlong grounds while being ridden out to prove much the best. DELILAH'S REVENGE was settled and
advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and continued to run on, drifted in leaving the furlong marker and was up for the place award
while racing green through the lane. CAHIRA'S BLESSING tracked the early pace on the inside and tipped out three wide for the drive, drifted in leaving the
furlong marker and was outfinished for the place award while racing greenly. GILA dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. CELTIC
REVIVAL chased the pace four wide and weakened. FAST'N SEXY was off very slowly and broke outwardly, came widest into the drive and was not a
threat. LADY GABRIELLE failed to menace while on the inside. ALBERTA BE MINE was off very slowly, not a factor.

Footnotes
BANFF broke in a tangle and off four lengths last, made a four wide run on the turn, continued that run to close well on the outside to get up late under a
drive. LIONESQUE was well placed early on the inside, made a two wide bid to take over leaving the turn, drew clear by the furlong marker but it proved to
be not enough, caught late, second best. ACTION POINT threw head at the start, then was rated along the inside on the turn, angled off the inside in the
drive and finished willingly but needed more. SILVER SIGNATURE was reserved early, swung out five wide for the drive and had a belated rally.
MOBILIZER was settled early between horses, then shuffled back to trail on the turn, lacked a rally. SPIGETINMTZABALLS set the pace while clear on the
inside and faltered in the drive. ZIJJ RUNNER chased the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SPANISH BALLERINA set the early pace while on the inside and clear, then was roused left handed by the furlong marker three times and responded well,
remained clear to then wire while under a strong hand ride late. GOLDEN VISION was rated between horses on the turn, came four wide into the lane and
finished well. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE tracked the pace and was two to three wide on the turn but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. BILLYJANE
was settled early and raced between horses on the turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. AMALFI SKY steadied slightly nearing the five
eighths marker, then raced on the inside and was blocked by the quarter pole, found room on the inside in the lane but had no kick. IMAGERY hit the gate
at the start and was off slowly, then checked nearing the five eighths marker, shifted to the outside and was four wide entering the turn, then raced three to
four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and had no rally. MADEMOISELLE NOVA stalked the early pace and was on the inside on the turn
and weakened. HELLO FRIENDS was off a step slow, then made a four wide run on the turn and then was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY pressed the early pace three wide, then made a two wide bid while in hand on the turn, took over leaving the turn and shook clear, then
was sent down in the furlong grounds and held on gamely to prove best. ORBALINE was rated early and was between rivals on the turn, came three wide
into the lane and closed well to just miss. PLUIE D'AVRIL was rated along the inside, boxed and awaited room by the quarter pole, tipped out two wide for
the drive, found traffic nearing the furlong marker, angled in to the inside in the furlong grounds and finished willingly but needed more. D'S SOUL chased
the pace and was three wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and faded. FINDING PERFECTION set a pressured pace on the inside and
weakened in the lane. The jockey on number one FINDING PERFECTION claimed foul against the number three PLUIE D'AVRIL for alleged interference in
the furlong grounds, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the race was left as is.

NIAGARA SKYLINE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and drifted in to the inside while
clear, then remained clear to prove best under a drive. SPANISH PRINCE was rated along the inside, awaited room on the turn and swung out three wide
leaving the turn, finished willingly and was bumped nearing the sixteenth marker while gaining the place award. DIXIE'S FLATTER chased the early pace
and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, then drifted in and bumped a rival in the furlong grounds, needed more late while besting the rest.
DOMINANT DESTROYER pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command then faded and shifted out in the furlong
grounds, weakened. TARANTO TITAN was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and had a belated rally. SILVER SMOKE was bumped at

GRANDSON dawdled along on the inside early while clear and being well handled, was sent down leaving the turn and responded well to draw out to prove
much the best. DAY TRIPPER tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out, second best. MR. DE stalked the early pace
and was two wide on the turn, shifted out four wide by the three sixteenths and had no kick. MIDNIGHT ARKLE chased the pace three wide and then shifted
in by the three sixteenths and had no rally. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was off very slow, spotting the field seven lengths, rushed up to make contact with the
field, then was roused by the five sixteenths and weakened.

BIZYMALINE was three wide into the first turn, rated along three wide, made a three wide move on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn, then slowly wore
down the front runner to edge clear late under a drive. SUPER LEGGERA pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear by the
quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the drive and kept on but could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. ADMONISH was reserved early and
was two to three wide, came four wide into the drive and offered no late kick while besting the rest. ERASMO'S GIRL chased the pace on the inside and
came three wide into the drive and had no rally. ALLURING MEG chased the early pace in between rivals and weakened. MUMBLEBEE set a slow pace on
the inside and was headed around the five sixteenths and gave way. DICTATE hopped at the start and raced on the inside and tired.
