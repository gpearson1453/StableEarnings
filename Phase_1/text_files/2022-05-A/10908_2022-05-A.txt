FACTOR THIS IN settled off the pace three wide, bid into the stretch and wore down the pacesetters late following a long drive. BIG CITY RALPH stalked
the pacesetter outside, led into the stretch and held on gamely losing the head bob. AMERICAN ROMA hustled to a clear lead inside, was collared near the
quarter pole and weakened.. DUBROVSKY broke sluggishly, raced wide early, angled inside on the final turn and flattened out. KINGS HIGHWAY saved
ground off the leaders and was finished after half a mile. DEFIBRILLATOR dropped far behind and lost contact with his field and was eased late.

PRIVATE NETWORK hustled to the front, repelled a challenge after the half and edged away through the stretch in a moderate drive. MOUNTAIN TREE
stalked the winner throughout, bid after the half then proved, no match in the stretch. SOCIAL EQUALITY lacked speed saving ground, was blocked and
steadied at the top of the stretch and rallied mildly. JARLIAN raced wide throughout and finished well while no threat. ILOVECHARLYBROWN settled inside,
moved closer before the half then faltered. MONGOLIAN HERO trailed to the stretch then passed a fading opponent. DOUGIE raced just off the pace inside
and faltered after five furlongs.

PUMPERNICKEL broke slowest, pounced on the leaders with a five wide move on the final turn then quickly drew away under a brisk hand ride. J D'S
VISTA outrun early, moved very wide to the front on the final turn but was no match for the winner. MISQUILLO trailed for half a mile, angled out in the
stretch and closed well. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE well placed outside the dueling leaders, bid before the half, moved inside and weakened. EMBRACE THE
WHINNY dueled between rivals then inside and faltered on the final turn. ONE WILD WOMAN vied three wide between rivals before half a mile and gave
way. SHARON'S LAW led narrowly inside, was shuffled back into the far turn and outrun thereafter. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE dropped back outside and was
always outrun.

inside, dueled to midstretch and was just up for the place in a sharp effort. ROMANTIC COMEDY bid to a narrow lead midway on the turn, dueled three
wide and came up empty. MEMENTO MI dropped back inside then offered some late energy. SMARTY PANTS SANDY moved closer four wide on the turn
then flattened out. SONOMA COUNTY dropped back after the start and was never in contention. SUPER DUPER FLY saved ground behind the leaders
and began fading on the turn.

KITH raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then wore down that rival in the final sixteenth. INDOCTRINATE controlled the pace, remained well clear to
the final sixteenth, shortened stride and was nailed. KODAPENDENT far behind early, advanced inside to the stretch, angled out in the lane and closed
well. WILL TAKE CONTROL stalked the pacesetters three wide then flattened out in the stretch. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then passed
stopping rivals. TWO PRINCES was fanned wide on the first turn and never in contention. AUSTIN WHYLIE saved ground well behind and was never a
factor. SCOOP DAWG raced close up inside for half a mile then bore out faltering.
