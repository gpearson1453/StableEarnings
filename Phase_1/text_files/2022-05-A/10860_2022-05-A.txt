YAYASGOTMOREGAME stalked the leaders three wide in good position, moved to challenge through the far turn and drew off in the lane under steady
handling. MY BOY GUS was on the pace about the two path inside HALO JAX then could not go with the winner in the lane. LEMONS IS GONE moved
outside in the first turn to follow the pace four wide and rallied to gain the show while no threat to the top pair. HALO JAX prompted the pace outside MY
BOY GUS to the far turn and weakened. BOLD IMAGE saved ground and tired. UNSOLVED was always back while wide.

SIDE STREET DAVE gained a short lead inside MY TRUE REWARD in the first turn, continued on the front and held safe in the lane under steady
handling. MY TRUE REWARD prompted the pace outside the winner and could not get to that one late. TAP ATTACK hesitated at the break to come away
last, moved up three wide in the far turn but could not close on the top pair in the lane. BUD MINISTER lunged at the break, stalked the pace three to four
wide and had no rally. PREFERRED PROSPECT followed the pace two to three wide and weakened. JIMMIE T saved ground and tired. CREASY was
always back three wide.

Footnotes
MOST AMUSING moved to the front racing about three path, remained out from the rail to hit the lane in the four path and drew off under mild
encouragement. BREAKIN DAYLIGHT staked the pace three wide, moved up in the far turn and gained clear for the place. GEE WHIZ WHO was along the
inside and lacked a final closing bid while gaining the show late. RANDOM AFFAIR tracked the winner four wide and weakened in the drive. THORNISH
was not a threat along the inside. THEGREATGENERATION was not a threat. BLUE TWISTED STEEL was always back four wide.
