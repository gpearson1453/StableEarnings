Footnotes
MAXWELL ESQUIRE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, began to angle out inside the five-sixteenths to
swing three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to take narrow command over a pair a furlong out, dug in under a drive tussling with
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS to the finish and gamely repelled that foe on the wire. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS got bumped at the start by NUCLEAR OPTION, who
broke inwards, and came under coaxing to establish the front and show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the
corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong out, fought on to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed on the line. FAUCI coaxed
from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. DURESS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up no response. NUCLEAR OPTION broke in at the start bumping ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS, chased just
off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
CUCINA broke in at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

KEY POINT brushed at the start by A LONGLONGTIMEAGO, who broke outwards, chased four to five paths off the inside from just off the pace down the
backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command at the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive to prevail. WIN FOR GOLD coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, took over the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared at the
three-sixteenths, kept on to safely preserve the place honors. DR. BLUTE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. KID D'ORO five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. MONTEBELLO six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
COLORMEPAZZI hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing near the
five-sixteenths and was displaced from the front at that station, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. A LONGLONGTIMEAGO broke out at the
start brushing KEY POINT, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact.

three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the leader through to inside the sixteenth marker, switched leads
greenly in the final steps to the wire and lugged in losing the place honors in the final strides. ROYAL DANCER showed the way in hand along the inside

threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. CAPE COD CAUSEWAY three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DUCKPHAT chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far

wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SWEET MAEVE chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. UNKOALAFIED chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired. FROSTY INVASION five then four wide in pursuit in close aim of the leader, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung six wide into upper stretch and folded. PAVE MY WAY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. EMPIRE LILY four to five wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under
