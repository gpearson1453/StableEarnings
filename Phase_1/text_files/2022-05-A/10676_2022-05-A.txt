along the two path around the turn, was collared at the furlong marker, battled and then was no match late. WINNING WITHHONOUR Bobbled at the start,
tracked three from the rail into the turn, four wide of it and finished with interest. STONE HEART Broke a step slow, trailed along the three path on the turn,
angled out and failed to gain. SMOKIN' ALONE Broke a step slow, well placed along the two around the bend and weakened.
