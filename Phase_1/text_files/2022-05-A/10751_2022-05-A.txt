MIDNIGHT FLYER got away well, while saving ground just off the rail, and put some daylight between himself and the field to win convincingly. KIMBELL'S
STRATEGY showed no early foot while trailing the field early and angled out at the quarter pole to close willingly but was second best. SARATOGA KAREN
was mid pack early, making a mild middle move on the turn, but failed to sustain the bid down the lane. CASTING PEARLS stalked the pace early on, along
the inside rail and faded in the stretch run. VENUS ISLAND chased the pace early going two wide, and dropped back at the half.

DEL MOON dueled for the lead along the rail all the way through the turn, then drew clear of his rival to win handily. SCREENPLAY dueled for the lead, two
wide, putting in a game effort but gave way grudgingly in late stretch. COUNTRY BRAVE showed not early foot, racing along the rail, gave a mild rally at the
three eights pole to get up for show. BOLD MOON stalked the pace down the back stretch and only offered an even effort in the stretch drive. STORM
THREAT was near the front going three wide and faded down the lane. TWIST OF FATE had no early speed, three wide and showed little.

Footnotes
PICK UP THE FONE was in a steady drive while four wide, gained the lead entering the stretch then drew clear under confident handling. LADY AVE
chased the leader while three wide, rallied on the turn then drifted out slightly in the stretch and held for the place winnings. MY GOLDEN BLING tracked the
pace from the inside into the turn to bid mildly five wide in the stretch but was no factor. FIRE OF GOLD raced from the inside, then bid three wide in the
stretch but was no menace. JUS MY IMAGINATION set the pace while in the two path, cleared the turn then gave way in late stretch. DOHA was unhurried
early then bid five wide in the stretch and was never a factor. SHACKLELACKALACKA raced while two wide and failed to menace.
