Footnotes
AWESOME RHYTHM forwardly placed behind the dueling pair, took aim two to three wide into the stretch, rallied from outside and got up three deep on the
line. SAI CON (FR) dueled for command from inside into and around the turn, held a short lead over QUINTECENTS into deep stretch and got nailed on the
line from the late run by the winner. QUINTECENTS away quickly in the beginning, dueled for command from outside, fought gamely through the drive and
finished a game third between rivals in the final strides. CURLY ESA broke in and bumped rival then steadied off heels soon after the start, angled to the rail
on the turn, tipped back out entering the stretch and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. CRYPTO MUNNY broke a bit slow and got bumped between
rivals at the start, steered down to the inside near the back, saved ground to the stretch and improved position in the lane. TAKE ACTION brushed the gate
and lost his path at the start, settled on the inside early on, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. ARREST stalked between then outside a rival,
rounded the turn two then three wide and weakened. RING GENERAL reared up in the gate, dropped his head as the gates opened and veer and came
away very slow, trailed up the backstretch, split foes midway around the turn and failed to make an impact. CARSON'S LEGACY took bumps from both
sides at the start, sat off the pace outside a rival, went two wide around the bend, raced greenly in upper stretch and lacked late response. KID STOLE A
KISS traveled near the back off the rail, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SILENT DECLARATION stalked
outside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, lost ground three then four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
EXULTATION got bumped between rivals at the start, had to steady at the seven-sixteenths pole, swung out leaving the turn, drifted in and bumped rival at
the sixteenth pole and got up at the wire. FENESTRA broke in and brushed foe leaving the gate, set the pace in the two path leaving the backstretch,
angled to the rail on the turn, led clear into the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. I'M CORFU broke in and bumped rival, raced up close to the inside
of the pacesetter, chased that rival while saving ground around the bend, tipped two wide in the drive, finished willingly and earned the show honors.
BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) raced off the pace, crept closer then had to steady behind a rival at the half-mile pole, rounded the turn four wide, rallied
between rivals in the stretch, got bumped at the sixteenth pole and missed the show. SEE THROUGH IT forwardly placed five deep early, bid outside the
leader three then two wide on the turn but failed to find the needed late kick in deep stretch. CRASH CORRIGAN settled off the pace, went five wide around
the turn, drifted inward in the stretch and could not rally. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL got brushed leaving the gate, stalked in range from off the rail, came three
wide into the stretch and flattened. COASTAL JAZZ broke head-high leaving the gate, was hard to manage early and checked along the way, continued to
be rank up the backstretch, trailed three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH raced up close four deep early, chased two wide
around the bend and weakened. HALF RIGHT forwardly placed between foes early, got put in a bit tight past the nine-sixteenths pole and lost a bit of
ground, chased two wide into the turn, a bit off the rail into the lane and also weakened.

Footnotes
MACHTENHAIRONFIRE bumped leaving the gate, sped clear up the backstretch, kicked clear around the turn, opened up with three-sixteenths remaining
and was kept to task to hold safely. HARDDIANE stalked outside a rivals up the backstretch, coaxed three to four wide leaving the turn, could not threaten
the winner but finished willingly to secure the place. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ got forced in then bumped back at the start, raced off the pace, took the turn
four then three wide, moved out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally but could not get by HARDDIANE for the place. TEQUILA TIGRE broke slow and
shifted in leaving the gate, moved up to race in range, angled in on the turn and cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a bid in the late stages. ARDIS
broke well then rated outside the leader, chased three then two wide around the turn and faded. DADDY'SFAVORITESON stumbled leaving the gate and
got forced in by CURLIN TO BILLIONS, lagged behind and was taken out wide, went five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend
and was not a factor. BELLE MY BELLE took a bump leaving the gate, chased along the inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.
CURLIN TO BILLIONS broke in, lacked early speed, trailed three wide into the stretch, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
ISLAND OF LOVE (IRE) stalked the speed three wide early, bid outside the top pair around the far turn, vied three deep into the stretch, cleared
approaching the eighth pole and drew away. STERLING CREST (IRE) ceded the early lead and rated early on the inside, pulled along the rail at the
three-quarter pole then went up to take command into the backstretch, lost the lead at the five-eighths pole and continued to apply pressure from inside,
dueled into and around the far turn taking a narrow lead, vied with rivals in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on
to secure second. BABY STEPS sped clear quickly and steered into the two path, lost command into the backstretch before taking back the advantage at
the five-eighths pole, dueled outside STERLING CREST (IRE) into and around the far turn, vied between rivals into the stretch, fought back in upper stretch
then flattened to third in deep stretch. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) was off slow to begin, pulled the rider along and ran up on heels prior to the first turn, raced
between rivals then moved inside, tipped two wide leaving the far turn, moved out further in the drive but lacked a late bid. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) was off a bit
slow and rank early, traveled along the inside then moved off the rail on the backstretch, went three to four wide around the second end, steered out in the
lane and could not rally. DELMONA (IRE) was off slow and stumbled slightly, raced three deep into the first turn, moved closer around the far turn and
ranged up four deep leaving the bend but weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT JOY got bumped in the hindquarters leaving the gate, moved into range then pulled the rider to a forward position, bid outside the leader around
the turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, battled in the final furlong and dug in late to hold. JAMMINJL tracked off the rail then got crowded briefly at the
five-eighths pole, went between rivals at the quarter pole while two wide, rallied through the lane, bid between the top pair late and got up for the place.
BUSY PAYNTER set the pace two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend while taking pressure from outside, lost the lead to FLAT OUT JOY
in upper stretch but fought back gamely through the final furlong and got edged for the place at the wire. RIGHTEOUSLY raced up close on the inside,
hugged the rail into the lane and finished evenly. CHOLLIMA broke well then stalked outside, took the turn four then three wide and flattened out. TAKE A
LEAP got pinched between runners and clipped heels in the beginning, went two then three wide on the turn and was ridden out to the wire. TIME FOR
EBBY broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, sat off the pace early on, raced along the rail then angled out into the stretch and failed to menace.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT TIME FOR EBBY SHIFTED OUT AT THE START AND PUSHED TAKE A LEAP INTO THE
HINDQUARTERS OF FLAT OUT JOY CAUSING TAKE A LEAP TO CLIP HEELS. SINCE TIME FOR EBBY FINISHED LAST THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

Footnotes
BALLET DANCING raced along the inside then went between rivals on the backstretch, swung five wide leaving the far turn, closed well through the lane
and inhaled the top pair in deep stretch. LOOKINTOGETEVEN unhurried in the beginning, went three deep into the far turn, advanced while angling out
around the bend, came five wide into the stretch, took over in upper stretch, fought with CARROLL GIRL to the inside but could not fend off the late kick
from the BALLET DANCING in deep stretch. CARROLL GIRL raced in range on the inside, waited for room on the far turn, tipped two wide and bid between
rivals at the top of the stretch, fought from inside in the final furlong but got outkicked by the top pair. VIVANDO broke well then settled off the pace inside,
raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, continued inside to the stretch, wanted to make a run but lacked room behind rivals in the stretch, never gained clear
sailing but finished willingly for a minor award. ADELIE (IRE) stalked in the two path outside a rival, came four wide into the drive, got impeded behind
injured rival and checked hard and could not regain mometum. TALENTED LADY traveled along the inside near the back, saved ground to the stretch,
tipped off the rail and never threatened. RED TIARA sped to the front and angled to the inside, led with a pair of rivals to the outside into the first turn,
showed the way up the backstretch, got pressured around the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. SNARK broke out and was quickly
corrected, showed early speed three deep into the clubhouse turn, dropped to a stalking position and raced outside rivals in the middle stages, launched a
bid from outside at the quarter pole, had to steady at the eighth pole and weakened. TIZ A MACHO GIRL was off slow to begin, settled at the back, swung
five to six wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace. CHLOE'S GIRL displayed early speed between rivals into the first turn then was closest in pursuit
to the outside of the pacesetter, dropped back between rivals on the far turn and tired down the lane. SPEEDCUBER tracked in the two path early, angled
out and closed in on the far turn, bid four deep in to the stretch, suffered an injury near the eighth pole and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SHADOW SPHINX settled inside well off the pace, crept closer up the backstretch, went between rivals at the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch, drew
alongside the leaders past the eighth pole, cleared briefly with a sixteenth remaining and held well. CARMELITA'S MAN tracked three wide out of range,
raced in the four path into the stretch, rallied five wide and lacked the final kick to get by the winner. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR unhurried early on, went three
wide into the first turn, raced outside a rival up the backstretch, gained ground while angling out and entered the lane five wide, summoned a mild rally and
gained the show. AVENUE off slow to begin, traveled in mid-pack, coaxed three wide on the second bend, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch, then
moved to a clear path and kept on for minor award. DANCE SOME MO pulled early first time crossing the finish line, stalked three deep, driven four wide
into the stretch and needed to find more in the final sixteenth. LUVLUV broke slow and got pinched back in the beginning, steered down to the, tipped out
exiting the far turn and kept on to improved position. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR stalked the top pair in the early stages, took aim three wide leaving the far
turn, drew alongside with a furlong remaining but flattened in deep stretch. PRINCE MAIOR pressed the pace from outside, took over at the five-sixteenths
pole, challenged with a furlong remaining and folded in the late stages. CAISSON tracked between rivals around the first turn, moved inside leaving the
backstretch, tipped two wide on the far turn while waiting for room and never found a clear path in the stretch. ONCOMING bumped between rivals at the
start and clipped heels shortly after then came out, trailed to the far turn, swung widest into the lane and flattened. BIG TALKER broke a step slow, stalked
from inside, cut the corner into the lane, raced in traffic then angled inward in the drive and could not rally. NERVES OF STEEL sped to the front from
inside, set the pace under pressure, lost command with five-sixteenths remaining and retreated.
