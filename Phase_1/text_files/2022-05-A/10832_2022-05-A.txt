room just past the quarter pole, angled out five wide and had no final winning bid. ROYAL CITY REIGN vied for the early lead from the inside and tired. MI

SOUPER FLASHY pressed the early pace and edged clear in the drive under steady handling. FOREST B set all the pace from the inside but was no match
for the winner in the drive. THATSITTHATSALL stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and had not enough in the stretch run for the
top pair. SILENT GHOST broke in, hit the gate at the break, stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had
no late rally. J M R GEMMA broke to the outside, bumped with rival, settled off the early going, raced two to three wide and had no response. SMART BIRD
broke to the outside, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and never threatened. SNEAKY REBEL was bumped, squeezed back at the break,
raced towards the back early after the troubling start, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRUSH showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to prevail under all out pressure. KERICS BEAUTY was bumped at the
break, settled to the back of the pack early on, made an advance through the far turn, moved up widest through the lane and got up for the place position
late. HENRY'S GAMBLE was bumped at the break, settled to the middle of the pack early, moved up six to seven wide through the upper stretch and kept
on to the wire. PRACTICAL GIZMO settled off the early pace, raced five wide never the three sixteenths pole, moved up between rivals and gained ground
late. ALPHA MIA stalked the pace and weakened while racing four wide. ALLPAIDUP dropped back early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had not
enough in the drive. POLAR APPEAL was forwardly placed to lay up close early and tired in the drive while racing three wide. JOLENE JOLENE was
unhurried early, raced three to two wide in the stretch run and had no response. GORMLEY GIRL was bumped at the break, raced near the inside at the
quarter pole and never threatened. LOADED QUESTION was off slowly, settled off the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch,
was blocked near the sixteenth pole and never threatened.
