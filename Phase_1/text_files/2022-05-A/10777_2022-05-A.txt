Footnotes
HELLUVA LIFE was off a step slow, settled off the early pace, made a steady advance towards the far turn, moved up four to five wide through the upper
stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling. TENOR showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, dug in inside the eighth
pole but couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best. ISTAN WARRIOR was unhurried early, moved up five wide through the upper lane and had
not enough for the top pair in the drive. DALLAS GOLD stalked the pace, was ridden along near the three eighths pole and weakened through the stretch
drive. GEMINATOR failed to sustain a bid.

UNBURNT was well rated running along the inside saving ground, then angle out in the stretch drive, finishing with courage by wearing down the leader.
OPTIONALITY assumed command racing along the rail, fought gamely down the lane, just missing at the wire. FASHION RAGE was unhurried early, made
a mild rally in the turn going four wide, to get up for show. SIMPLE PLEASURE raced four wide down the backstretch, then angled in mid stretch with an
even effort. LASTCHANCEFORLOVE pressed the pace going two wide down the back side, then dropped back at the quarter pole, tired.

rallied at the three eights pole to gain command briefly in late stretch, only to get edged at the wire. RUSSET MOON jumped to the lead, dueling for a bit on
the turn and gave way down the lane, holding on to show. TENQUE was near the back racing on the rail and never fired. NOW WE GOT A SHOW stalked
the pace going three wide and faded at the three eights pole.

Footnotes
TIZ LIFE showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside and held gamely in the drive to be clear under a steady hand ride. CLOSE TO
MIDNIGHT tracked the early leader down the backstretch, raced two to three wide and couldn't cut into the leaders margin through the stretch run to finish
second best. SILVER GALAXY was slow early on, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and moved
up. MAU MAU settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT stalked the pace, raced four wide
near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. TALE TWISTER failed to sustain a bid while racing from the inside.

came on again to grab the win at the wire. K C TIZ MORO dueled for the lead through the turn, headed the eventual winner in the stretch and was overtaken
at the wire, for a game second. WITT'S TAQUITO showed no early speed, traveling along the rail, made a mild bid and got up for show. AFFLUENT
GENTLEMAN was in contention early, dueling for the lead, four wide and faded at the quarter pole. SUNDAY BLING was near the leaders early, going three
wide and dropped back at the three eights pole.

Footnotes
PREFERITO DA BARBI showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. LAB RAT stalked the pace from
the outside, moved up two to three wide through the upper stretch, challenged the leader nearing the eighth pole but couldn't get by in a game effort.
PAPAWS BOY stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive for the top pair. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY settled off
the early going, raced five wide near the quarter pole and moved up late. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE broke sharply to the outside, checked in the early
stages, raced rank early, checked near the half mile pole and had no final bid after experiencing a troubled trip. GUARDSMAN PASS was unhurried early,
raced just off the inside around the far turn angled to be six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. QUIET PRAYER was bumped at the
break, settled to the middle of the pack early, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
HAMAZING WISDOM chased the pace along the inside rail under wraps, angled out sharply at the eight pole due to a traffic jam and closed furiously to get
up for the win. D TOWN BABY showed no early foot, then circled the field at the half mile pole, assumed the lead mid stretch, only to get caught at the wire.
GORDON ANTHONY was well placed early going three wide, offered a mild bid and held on for third. KING JINGALING made the lead racing along the rail
and faded at the eighth pole. DELIRIUM pressed the pace traveling two wide, and only offered an even effort. REALLY SLOW was racing near the back of
the field, three wide and showed little. THE INFLUENCER was mid field, going three wide and dropped back in the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAMI'S BOY showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced well clear through the upper lane, drifted wide through the stretch and held a clear
margin under steady handling. GHOSTER stalked the pace, raced three to four wide through the upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the drive.
CLAIMJUMPER stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide through the upper lane and raced along for third in the drive. FIRST BUMP RIDGE was
slow early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up. SILVER AND GOLD settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter
pole, raced wide through the lane and had no response. TEXAN BOY hopped at the break, stalked the pace and tired while racing along the inside.
BODYMOOR HEATH pressed the pace from the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
BIG ONE was forwardly placed early, going three wide, made a bid in the stretch drive, closing fast and running down the leaders for the win. SILVER LUKE
SILVER stalked the pace along the inside, lost his path at the eight pole and was steadied, angled out with a hard drive to get second. COWBOY RIDGE
pressed the pace early, dueled for the lead around the turn and faltered late, holding on for show. SUPREME CAPO made the lead, then dueled around the
turn, but gave way in late stretch. KING KONGO was mid pack going two wide with a mild rally. IMA BIG BOPPER was mid field racing five wide and lacked
a late response in the stretch drive. JOHN DOUGH was near the back, traveling three wide with an even effort. FANDO showed no early speed, five wide
and failed to menace. FEARLESS PRINCE was mid field going two wide and had no rally. PHARME'S PHAITH had no speed, got steadied at the three
quarter pole and showed little. PAPA MOLLY was well placed early, three wide, dropped back and was tired. The trainer of SILVER LUKE SILVER claimed
foul on the one horse, BIG ONE, for interference in mid stretch. The claim of foul was not allowed.
