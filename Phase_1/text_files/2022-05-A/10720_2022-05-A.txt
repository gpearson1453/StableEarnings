TEMPORA dueled along the rail throughout and dug in gamely to last. I SAID HEY pressed the pace three wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole,
dueled to the wire but was denied. BULLET ON TAP bumped with OXOMOC soon after the start, stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out near the
sixteenth pole and rallied under hand urging. GLEAMING BRUTALITY dueled between the top two finishers to midstretch and tired. SEMIRAMIS broke two
lengths slowly, raced two wide and never threatened. OXOMOC bumped with BULLET ON TAP after the start, raced two wide and lacked a rally. LOLA
LOCA trailed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
AWESOME STRONG found himself boxed in midway on the turn, moved off the inside to split the leaders approaching the quarter-pole, took over and went
clear into the stretch, and widened under a mild drive on his left lead. DON'T ANSWER advanced a bit in the two-path approaching the stretch, rallied along
the rail and was up for the place. CAPTAIN CREED raced three to four wide around the turn, finished evenly outside rivals and was edged for second
money. NICO'S HAVING FUN vied outside CAJUN HOPE to midway on the turn, and faded. SIR OUTLAW failed to menace three to four wide. CAJUN
HOPE got the best of NICO'S HAVING FUN on the turn, could not handle AWESOME STRONG entering the lane, and faltered. NAPO trailed inside.

Footnotes
FROLIC MAN stalked the pace from the rail, came through inside to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, quickly cleared, raced a bit off the rail in the lane
and held well clear under moderate urging. PROUD CONTENDER saved ground off the pace and ran on while hugging the rail in the lane. TUWAIM had
early speed outside, dropped back four wide around the turn and churned on through the lane to gain the show. HIGH PRESS stalked the pace two and
three wide, reached near even terms at the quarter pole and tired in the lane. I'LL FINISH set the pace in the two path and wilted in the lane. FAST N
STEADY played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BRITTIZ prompted UP HER SLEEVE from outside to the far turn, challenged a quarter-mile out, edged away with 70 yards remaining, then held off
STRONG EMBRACE to the wire. STRONG EMBRACE was three wide early before moving in, cut the corner into the lane, moved back out to the
three-path with aim outside the leaders, and was gaining gradually at the finish. FISH MOONEY raced three to four wide on the turns, and rallied on the far
outside to get up for the show. UP HER SLEEVE set the pace inside, responded when hooked by BRITTIZ after six furlongs, dueled through upper stretch,
then gave way. LILY'S LEAD saved ground much of the way, and lacked the needed response. PAINTBRUSH became rank between horses and steadied
into the first turn, had to be taken out four wide, then stayed in range to the top of the stretch before coming up empty. CHALLENGE PRINCESS showed
little inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SARAWAT settled off the duel in the clear in the two path, tipped three wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up and clear late. ON JET HEIR
dueled outside of DIRT ROAD DOLLARS to midstretch, stuck on the left lead through the lane, put that foe away near the sixteenth pole but could offer little
resistance to the winner late. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS dueled along the rail to midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. BOURBON OVER ICE
went evenly while racing three wide. UNIFIED CONQUEST was devoid of speed, saved ground throughout and rallied belatedly. KUHL STAR failed to
menace while racing four wide.

Footnotes
CONUNDRUM QUEEN moved inside soon after the start, hugged the rail to the stretch, bid through the furlong grounds and prevailed to the wire in an
all-out drive. FEETS OF FEATHER got bumped and squeezed a bit between horses at the start, lagged near the back for six furlongs, came three rallying
into the stretch, and just missed outside rivals. ROSA STAR chased after CENTSLESS DRAMA for six furlongs, had aim in the three-path after
straightening away for the drive, and ran on with good courage to narrowly miss between the top two. LADY JAE bumped with FEETS OF FEATHER at the
start, went along at the back for six furlongs, rallied through upper stretch in the two-path, then was stalled in heavy traffic a furlong out. CENTSLESS
DRAMA set the pace in the two-path to the stretch, and faded in the final stages. RIVETING SPIRIT was no factor in the second flight throughout. DIVINE
EXCHANGE bumped with FEETS OF FEATHER at the start, moved up mildly three then four wide on the far turn, but could not sustain the rally.
CAPSTONE GIRL stayed in range two to three wide for six furlongs, and tired. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MR MATUSCHEK settled off the pace while racing two and three wide between foes, knifed between foes leaving the eighth pole, closed through tight
quarters and was up in deep stretch. TIMMY M. raced off the early pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid outside of foes in upper
stretch and was narrowly outkicked. DILIGENT tossed his head at the start, aced closest to the runaway pacesetter two wide, took a narrow lead in upper
stretch, edged away leaving the eighth pole and led to deep stretch. GO MIKE sprinted clear inside, led to upper stretch and weakened. KOBLA MAS
bumped with AMERICAN NINJA at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened. AMERICAN NINJA was bumped at the start, had
some speed inside, steadied along inside for six furlongs, angled out nearing the lane and lacked the needed rally. DUROCHER was outrun while racing
four wide.

Footnotes
STRIKE HARD was slow into stride, advanced around the turn two then three wide, rallied on his left lead through midstretch and wore down AMERICAN
PRINCE from outside. AMERICAN PRINCE pressed SUPER CURIOSO from outside, took over approaching the five-sixteenths pole and edged away,
could not handle the winner through deep stretch but was much best of the others. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) set the early pace inside, relinquished the lead
to AMERICAN PRINCE on the turn, and ran on to salvage the show. BRASSTOWN pursued the leaders to the turn, and tired after six furlongs while shifting
out four wide. ORDER AND LAW was never prominent. DREAM MAKER raced four to five wide, had the rider drop the crop on the turn, and dropped far
back.

Footnotes
PANTHER ISLAND settled off the early pace outside, raced three wide around the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch, idled on the left lead in upper
stretch, switched over near the eighth pole, kicked in widest and won going away. AWESOME CRUSADER stalked the duel three wide, bid four wide
between foes near the sixteenth pole, had the rider lose the whip in deep stretch and stayed on willingly to outfinish several foes for the place.
NEPOMUCENO dueled inside of ADIOS GARY while racing in the two path, battled on to deep stretch and just missed second. STERLING HARMONY
saved ground off the pace and rallied belated along the rail. ADIOS GARY dueled outside in the three path to deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor
awards. MAJOR KING failed to menace while racing three wide. LUCKY NINETEEN was in range inside and came up empty in the lane. SIR BITESALOT
was off slow and trailed inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
