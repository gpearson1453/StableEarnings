Footnotes
PEPPER SPRAY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin to the lane and held off the closing TWO GUNS to prevail. TWO GUNS
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, rallied through the drive and just missed. DIAMOND RIM was off slow, pulled to vie and gave way
through the final furlong. CREATIVE ONE broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing five-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. VELVET
GHOST was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after the opening quarter.

Footnotes
DODROPIN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away in the drive.
KID CAT was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good energy.
WAR MAIDEN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, rider lost whip in mid-stretch and gave way late. TIZ TENACIOUS chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the
turn and gradually gave way. RUN FOR BELLE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. THE RIDER OF KID CAT LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST DODROPIN CONCERNING THE START AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LA CASTIGLIONE stalked the pace of LOOPY while racing four-wide throughout, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the final yards.
LOOPY sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control through mid-stretch but
could not resist the winner late. LADY COMMISSIONER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished
evenly. ZEYARAAT raced off the pacesetters early, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. YES PLEASE was forwardly placed from the inside
throughout and gave way in the drive. OPERATIC lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. MS SALLY was
void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SUGARY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and
did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
RED HURRICANE was away in good order to press the pace of POVERTY BAY while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
five-sixteenths marker, quickly opened a clear lead and was ridden out to be kept to task. TIME TO MEDDLE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. PICK A LANE FRANK raced off the pacesetters early, angled
out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. UNTOLD STORY lagged early, saved ground through the turn and finished with late interest.
POVERTY BAY broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. THIRSTY KISS was void of early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NOTACRY vied for the lead from the inside for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
I WILL YEAH (IRE) tracked the pace of N. K. ROCKET MAN from the inside, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and wore down that
rival in the closing yards to be going away late. N. K. ROCKET MAN sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in
control through mid-stretch and yielded to the winner late. NO SLO MO reared at the start, lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and
finished with good late energy. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and
finished with a belated bid. BUDDY NINER settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed rally. CAPTAIN RED chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. BALI STAR settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
weakened.
