best. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE pressured the pace dueling three deep through the turn, overpowered from the outside into upper stretch would stay after
prevailing late abreast foe in a place duel. CANELITA pressed the pace dueling between horses through the turn being overwhelmed from the outside in
upper stretch continuing on to battle for place on the inside in a game try. SILVER PACKAGE slow early lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the
six path. SHESAROCKSTARTOO pressed the pace dueling on the inside on the turn wearing out in upper stretch. FRANKIE'S GIFT was always outrun.
