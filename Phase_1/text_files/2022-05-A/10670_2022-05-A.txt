Footnotes
ELUSIVE FREUD away in good order, relinquished the advantage in the turn, three wide into the lane, steered in, rebid late inside the leader, good
determination late to gain the nod at the wire. FREER broke back, used early to steadily move up and vie three wide into the turn, two path exiting when still
clear, drifted slightly in the run to the wire, faltered late to be nipped at the wire. TENTH OF GOLD in mid pack early, came four wide out of the turn when
beginning to move, finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the top two. LAKE TAHOE within striking outside, moved closer four wide into the lane,
flattened out in the final furlong. CONFESS with the early pace after breaking with the leaders, fell back off the issue through the turn, went evenly through
the lane. CASTLEBERRY last away, void of speed in racing back, four wide exiting the turn. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR forwardly placed early, steadied in
tight quarters after a furlong, fell back, four wide turning for home, failed to mound a response. THE Z MAN lacked speed, raced in the two path through the
turn, lacked a closing punch. WORTHTHEMONEY broke well, prompted the issue up front off the inside, shuffled back in some traffic entering the turn,
continued to fade through the stretch. GLASSATO trailed while racing three wide.

Footnotes
CHAKRA broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, shrugged off a foe into the lane, clear again nearing the furlong grounds, held
the runner up comfortably safe late under steady handling. INVALUABLE pressed the pace up the backstretch three wide, fell back off the winner turning
into the lane, getting back to that one from the outside late. SUMMER STORM stalked the pace early while firmly in hand behind the first flight three wide,
moved four wide early in the turn, challenged on the outside entering the stretch, flattened out in the run to the wire to finish up best of the rest. WAY TOO
SMARTE void of speed toward the inside early, angled out steadily to be four wide exiting the turn, failed to make up any ground on the top two the final
furlong. LOVELY LADY LEXI pressed the winner from the outside and between foes for over three furlongs, gave way late in the turn. MY BOSS LADY off a
step slow, moved closer while four wide late in the turn, tired through the lane. BIG BASE in mid pack while along the inside, saved ground to no avail in
lacking a closing response. FLASHY BIZ failed to menace while racing in the two path. DIVA DE KELA fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
COST A FORTUNE away best of all, clear before a quarter off the inside, remained in the two path turn and into the lane, maintained a daylight advantage
to the wire under firm handling. CANADA'S CUSTOMS forwardly placed off the inside, moved closest to the winner in the three path turning for home,
chased that rival past the furlong marker when making little if any further progress, second best. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE chased the winner up the
backstretch and into the turn, also could do little with that foe through the lane nor match the runner up, saved the show. CAMARADERIE went one paced
while racing toward the inside, two path into the lane, lacked a closing punch. CURBS AND CONES lacked speed after breaking a step slow, improved into
the lane, never dangerous. MY FRIEND MR. JIM remained back in failing to threaten. DARE ME off a step slow, was finished after a half. SLUSHY began a
steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
HOME RUN TRICK broke out but alertly, dueled early inside, larger lead into the far turn, responded when confronted soon after, held the runner up at bay
through the stretch run. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY four wide into the first turn, in the second flight the middle half, four wide once again early in the far turn,
closer to the winner late in that bend could not overtake that foe in the drive despite brisk handling, clearly second best. SIGNOFTHECROSS broke sharp,
allowed the two leaders to go into the first turn, remained in the second flight inside the runner up backstretchh, bit closer far turn between horses, dropped
inside late in the final bend, no match top two in the drive, well clear of the others. QUARTERBACK DAK hesitated at the start, lacked speed inside, steered
out to be four wide exiting the final turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late response. ALL THE DIAMONDS dueled early outside the winner, continued
to put pressure on that one the middle half, gave way from between horses in the second turn. PINSON fell back after the start and was never involved.
MOST SANDISFACTORY tired while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
ARI OAKLEY away in good order, dueled off the inside in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, clear soon after, maintained a comfortable advantage
through the stretch under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. INSIGNIA off a step slow, saved ground when outrun through the turn, improved into the
lane, shifted out a bit and was closing ground on the winner late, far clear of the others. PROUD FOOT back off the pace, dropped inside when advancing
turn, chased the winner upper stretch, had little for that rival to the wire, no match runner up, saved the show late. CHURCH SERVICE one paced while
racing outside, four wide out of the turn, gaining for the show late. CALL KRYSTAL off a step slow, void of speed, improved into the lane, no real threat the
final furlong. SAMMIES SAMURAI within striking distance up the backstretch outside, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. REPASADO traffic a
furlong in, raced in mid pack off the inside into the turn, had little left for the stretch run. CHARTREUSE forwardly placed early, gave way. ADRIA broke
alertly, dueled the opening quarter inside the winner, fell back off that one early turn, moved out then stopped in the drive to trail home.

Footnotes
BLOW SUM SMOKE broke on top, raced with the pace three wide, shook off the other speed when straightened for home to be clear, enough left late to
withstand the runner up. WAR MUSIC forwardly placed outside, moved closer four wide through the turn, fell back off the winner into the stretch, roused,
coming again late. BOOTLEGGING GIRL within striking distance just off the inside, in traffic through the turn, came three wide into the lane, no late gain on
the top two when drifting in. COURTNEY FAY in mid pack while along the inside, raced in the two path through the turn while also in some traffic, went
evenly through the lane as well. HALF SCOUT void of speed, three wide into the turn, two path into the lane, improved position steadily with some belated
interest. DERONDA in the second flight while racing three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. EARLY DISMISSAL broke well, with the pace between
rivals weakened through the stretch. STORMY SERMON went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. SOBER SUNDAY off a bit slow,
remained always back. MY LITTLE TETON hesitated at the break, four out to five wide turn, failed to muster a rally. CULEBRA also hesitated at the start to
spot the field a couple of lengths, was never involved. MO STYLISH flashed brief early speed along the inside, stopped after a half.

Footnotes
PINKY TOE took command after the start to narrowly show the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, disposed of the other
speed when straightened for home, held the runner up safe under intermittent urging. HYPERSPORT broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight
while three wide, asked along late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker then was slowly getting to that one late. COM' ON SWEET LUV
broke back, three wide into the turn, swung out four to five wide into the lane, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. SHARED FUTURE void of
speed while just off the inside, remained in the two path turn, improved position with some mild, belated interest. OFF RAMP dueled up front while racing in
the two path, first to blink, caved in drive. HARTLEY in the second flight while along the rail and inside the runner up, moved off the rail midway on the turn,
backed up through the lane. CUPID'S MUSIC last away, raced in mid pack early off the inside, dropped to the rail early in the turn, also threw it into reverse
for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CADDO RIVER closest to the leader while three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, engaged
that one from the outside midway on the final turn, clear into the lane, increased that advantage under only token encouragement the final furlong to win
ridden out. OLLIEMYBOY bumped early by a rank SANTOS DUMONT, patiently handled, between foes far turn, closer in the two path into the lane, proved
no match for the winner, clearly second best. SANTOS DUMONT bumped at the start lightly with OLLIEMYBOY, bumped that rival again when getting out
when rank into the first turn, steadied briefly late in the first turn, trailed, moved out four wide turning for home, along for the show while not a threat to the
top two. THOMAS SHELBY clear before a quarter after angling toward the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner
when confronted by that one in the second turn, began to steadily weaken in upper stretch, caught late for the show. SILVER PROSPECTOR carried out
four wide into the first turn, remained outside, three wide when within striking distance second turn, lacked a closing response. BACKGROUND was finished
after a half.

Footnotes
ROCK CITY ROCKET broke alertly, raced with the pace while between foes up the backstretch, dueled off the inside through the turn, took over into the
lane, soon clear, enough left to hold off a couple of rivals late. AFRICAN WARRIOR broke back, outrun for three furlongs, moved closer while angling out
three to four wide, five wide into the lane, gaining late. TALE OF TRUTH hesitated to be off slowly, moved up steadily soon after, steadied slightly late
backstretch, two path through most of the turn, asked along into the lane, also closed some ground to finish up with energy. DOC IRWIN void of speed just
off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn and into the lane, improved position. BRASKA void of speed off the inside, also raced the two path
through the bend, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position. OBVIOUSLY TOO settled off the pace well wide, came five wide into the lane, lacked a
closing kick the final furlong. BUDDY REAUX settled in mid pack off the in side, three wide through the turn, continued one paced through the lane.
KILGORE away well, narrowly set the pace inside, dueled through the turn, weakened when headed by the winner turning for home. MAX BET off step
slow, in the main group while racing outside, five to six wide turn, tired through the stretch. VISION OF ELIAS forwardly placed while racing three wide and
between horses, gave way in the drive. DEPART fell back to trail soon after the start, showed little.
