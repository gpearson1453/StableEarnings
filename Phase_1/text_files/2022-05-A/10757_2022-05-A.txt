Footnotes
RISKY SITUATION settled off the pace and the inside, advanced into contention three wide far turn, dueled into the lane when holding a narrow advantage,
but that foe away past the furlong marker and edged clear under steady handling. BACKGATE RED closest to the early leader, continued to chase in the
run up the backstretch, moved to challenge inside the winner and between foes late in the final turn, dueled closest to the inside into the lane, proved no
match late, clearly second best. DUDLEY lacked speed, advanced with some mild interest three wide through the second turn, continued with modest
energy through the stretch to be along for the show, not a threat to the top pair. YOUNG O' DAINE broke in good order, keen early when sprinting out to a
large early lead, extended that advantage a bit the middle half, offered little resistance to the top two late in the final turn, continued to weaken through the
lane. UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. ACCEL JOE void of speed, came in the two path for the drive,
displayed a moderate amount of late interest to improve position. MORNING DRIVE lacked early foot, failed to menace while off the inside. RIANTE SKY off
a step slow, remained always back, three wide into the lane, jogged in without any pressure. MR. WULLY BULLY in the second flight for a half, stopped
through the lane, jogged in.

Footnotes
KNIEVEL off the pace toward the inside early, tapped the brakes in some traffic onto the backstretch, began to advance late backstretch, rallied four wide
into the lane, collared the leader nearing midstretch, continued willingly to win going away. FAY DAN moved up to vie for the lead three wide, took command
far turn, clear, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. FIRST RATE in the second flight while saving ground early, worked
way out to be three wide turning for home, slowly getting to the runner up late. CHASE TRACKER off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack, worked
way to rail midway on the second turn, moved back out around a tiring rival soon after, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response.
HELIOCHROME vied up front off the inside, gave way from between rivals into the far turn. BACKGATE BELLE fell back to trail after the start, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LUCKS BIG BOY broke on top, set the pace along the inside, stopped in the second turn while
continuing inside. BUMPER POOL off a step slow, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
LOYAL TO THE GAME broke alertly, dueled up front while off the inside, disposed of the other speed by midway on the turn, maintained a comfortable
advantage through the lane, geared down late to win ridden out. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO back off the early pace and the inside, came four wide out of the
turn when commencing his rally, continued willingly to the finish to be up in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. ARISTOCAT closest top the dueling
leaders while in the three path, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one to the wire, caught late for the place. MOUNTAIN
PINE off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack along the inside, steered around a tiring rival turning for home, continued evenly through the lane.
GOBLIN off a step slow, raced back, mild interest through the lane to improve position, not dangerous. BON DEUX away in good order, dueled up front
while closest to the rail and inside the winner, first to blink early in the turn. JOAN'S JUNIOR settled in the second flight, came up empty for the drive.
SHUWA FUNGA P off a step slow, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
MO VODKA broke inwardly but alertly, pressed the issue up front in the three path, dueled into the far turn, shook clear soon after, maintained daylight
through the lane while being kept to task. JACKS SPRING BREAK off step slow, moved out and raced five wide into the first turn, four wide onto the
backstretch, remained outside and was four wide through the second turn set down for the drive, long drive for the place, proved determined for that
position, not a serious threat to the winner. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY behind the dueling leaders, advanced on the winner three wide late in the final turn, chased
that foe past the furlong marker, proved no match in the run to the wire, outkicked late for the place, narrowly gained the nod to hold the show. CYBER
MONDAY moved up inside, set the early pace, dueled into the final turn, lost contact with the winner late in that bend, proved stubborn for the second
position. FETCHS BRAHM lacked early foot, encountered some traffic into the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, came three wide for the drive,
improved position slightly while not a serious threat. TRAFFIC CONTROL broke back, was rank and then steadied in the first turn in some traffic, raced in
mid pack, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. ORBITAL STARR raced in mid pack and off the inside, also came up empty for the drive.
SERBIAN SAILOR forwardly placed along the inside, began a steady retreat while continuing to save ground. JUSTDENNIS in tight, steadied at the start
when the winner broke in, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FIVE QUEENS outrun early, moved out three wide late in the turn, roused for the drive, finished with good late energy to be up in time. FULLY AWARE vied
early between foes, dueled turn, headed into the lane, came back to regain the advantage past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner
while holding sway for the place. MARY ALICE settled in mid pack toward the rail early, two to three path turn, rallied and closed some ground late, not
enough for the place. DENALI ROCKET with the pace along the inside, fell back just before a quarter, saved ground through the turn, went evenly through
the stretch. HONEY PARADE with the early pace outside,, dueled through the turn off the inside, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, faltered. LADY
GUSTO off a step slow, trailed, came four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing response while remaining well out in the strip. COUNTRY DREAMIN off a
step slow, remained back while racing four wide.

PLANE TALK broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, extended advantage when straightened for home, drifted out slightly, held the runner up safe late
while kept to pressure. AMERICAIN JOEY behind the winner while toward the rail, steered out to be in the two path turning for home, roused, shifted out a
bit further, steadily getting to that same rival late while outside the winner and while being floated out by that one. DIXIE STREET forwardly placed early,
shuffled back from between horses into the turn, two path into the stretch, chased the top two past the furlong marker, to threat to that pair late, clear of the
others. NEWS BOX back off the pace while four wide backstretch, continued outside, carried out to be six wide into the lane, displayed some mild interest to
improve position slightly while remaining far out in the strip. SACRED OATH last to leave, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. PULL MY CHAIN broke out, dueled up front outside the winner for three furlongs and began to falter, got out exiting the turn, continued
to tire through the lane. TOUGH COMPANY forwardly placed early, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
MEAN JAKEY dueled for a half while off the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, held a daylight advantage to the wire while being kept to task.
GENERAL STRIKE dueled up front while along the rail inside the winner for a half, proved no match for the winner through the lane, determinedly held the
place. CHASING RAINBOWS broke in to bother inner rivals, was straightened, chased the dueling leaders in the three path, made a bid for the place past
the furlong marker, outfinished for that position, remained clear of the others. CRONUS lacked speed, dropped to the inside midway on the turn, went
evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. LEAD ACTOR bothered at the break to be off slowly, trailed for a half, came 5w into the lane, passed
tiring rivals down the middle of the strip. SIMPSON BAY lacked speed, in the two path into the lane, made little impact to the wire. BIGTIME TEGRIDY
hopped at the break to be away a step slow, four wide trip through the turn, tired in the drive. HUMERO D'ORO bothered at the start to be off slow, moved
up to race in mid pack early, began to fade before four furlongs.

RIVERBOAT GAMBLER off the early pace and the inside, advanced steadily into contention three wide, challenged on the outside entering the stretch,
shook clear, kept to pressure with a steady right handed crop. TIME HEIST broke alertly, set the early pace, continued to narrowly showed the way into the
lane, proved no match for the winner to the wire, remained clear for the place. MR. DOUGIE FRESH also away well, dueled up front in the two path outside
the runner up, fell back off that one into the lane, managed to save the show. PRAETORIAN forwardly placed behind the dueling leaders, in some traffic to
lack clear room into the stretch, challenged for the show a furlong out, outfinished for that position. FREDONIAN broke in mid pack, raced four wide through
the turn, lacked a closing kick while in some traffic inside the furlong grounds. KEVIN WITTE broke awkwardly, moved up a bit late in the turn, steered out
three wide into the lane, finished up evenly. SEEK N JUSTICE remained back in failing to threaten. RUBIGINOUS off a step slow, never a factor. MINE MY

Footnotes
IMA BLING CAT off the early pace well off the inside, four to five wide through the turn, set down for the drive, finished full of run down the middle of the
strip to win going away. TOPF ROAD RULES behind the pace toward the inside, three wide and in some traffic turning for home, finished willingly to be up
for the place while between rivals at the wire. MACHO ROCCO closest to the leader, got out into the stretch to be well off the inside, put a head in front past
the furlong marker, could not contain the top two. NAVY SEAL within striking distance well wide, slight bother, five wide into the turn, continued four wide
through the rest of the bend, mild interest to improve position slightly in the drive, lacked winning kick. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE broke sharp, clear early the
showed the way into and through the turn, lost the advantage approaching the furlong marker and faltered when headed. CITRUS BAY last away, trailed
early, dropped to the inside to save all the ground through the turn, improved stretch. PEACE DOG lacked speed outside, bothered slightly by a rival
attempting to pull up early in the turn while five wide, four wide into the lane, improved position. CAPTAIN DON forwardly placed, in some traffic into the
turn, proceeded in the two path through the bend then tired in the drive. KINFOLK void of speed outside, four out to five wide turn, had little left for the drive.
SMARTY GRIMES never menaced while racing four wide through much of the turn. DATA STORM in the second flight early inside, checked up five furlongs
out, fell back and did not recover. MALINTENT forwardly placed outside, rank while attempting to pull up into the turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
SOUIXPER CHARGER forwardly placed four wide through the first turn, closer onto the backstretch to vie three wide into the far turn, floated out four wide
into the lane, shook clear under firm handling to the wire. BANDIT POINT settled off the pace toward the inside, remained unhurried early backstretch,
asked along far turn to move closer, two path into the lane, split foes past the furlong marker, could do little with the winner late, edged clear for the runner
up spot.. MAN IN THE CAN bumped early first turn, prominent while three wide first under restraint in the first turn, remained forwardly placed up the
backstretch, chased the lead group through the second turn, four wide into the lane, slowly gaining for the place late. TWISTED DIXIE checked up inside of
considerable traffic into the first turn, main body the middle half, asked along to be three wide and between foes into the lane, displayed a continued mild
amount of interest to improve slightly. MORE THAN BLESSED bumped just after the start, bothered again into the first turn, settled the middle half towards
the back, three to four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to improve position. PROMISING SHOES broke back, continued to lag for six furlongs, two path
second turn, found best stride too late while improving position. TEMPT FATE came in, bumped foe early, set or forced pace, narrow advantage midway on
the second turn, got out carrying the winner out into the lane, began to weaken when headed by that rival soon after. K J'S NOBILITY broke back, pushed
out six wide into the first turn, continued outside and went one paced in an even effort. DINNER AT CRUMPIES forward past the wire the first time, steadied
in tight seven furlongs out, moved up between foes, vied between foes up the backstretch, began to weaken in the final turn. IMPLICATOR broke back,
lacked speed well off the inside, passed some tiring rivals while never a threat. BIG SUCCESS mid pack while racing off the inside, roused for the drive, had
little left. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN last away, remained always back in failing to threaten. BELLAMYS ROAN checked up in tight quarters early in the first
turn, began to fade after a half. MRS. BEANS in the main body in considerable traffic first turn, pulled up before a half, vanned off.

PARKING forwardly placed well wide, four wide through the turn, advanced late in the bend, took over in upper stretch, led late, nailed in the waning strides.
KEWPIE DOLL chased the early leader, moved up to join that one to duel in the turn, weakened in the final furlong while managing to save the show. NISI
PRIUS fell back to trail, came four wide out of the turn, staged a belated rally well out in the strip to improve position. KASSERINE PASS lacked early foot
off the inside, came three wide for the drive, improved slightly while never a serious threat. CHERISHED in mid pack for a half out in the strip, came up
empty for the drive. NORTHERN DIAMOND settled off the pace and the inside, asked into the turn, failed to respond. NIC AND ZOE forwardly placed along
the inside, backed up through the stretch. PARKIN IN THE REAR broke sharp, cleared to the inside, set the pace for a half, gave way when headed. FINAL
