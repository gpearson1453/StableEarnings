Footnotes
MIA AT MIDNIGHT rated in the two path around the first turn, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, headed rival into the far turn and took over
past the three-eighths pole, disposed of PRECIOUS INSIGHT with a quarter mile remaining and stayed clear to the wire. ST HELENA broke well then took a
stalking position on the inside, tipped two wide and went between rivals at the quarter pole, chased the winner through the drive, could not make any
headway late but bested the rest. A THOUSAND DREAMS stumbled slightly leaving the gate, tracked two wide early, asked two then three wide on the far
turn and finished evenly in the final furlong. HERE COMES RALPHIE went two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, settled at the back, entered the
far turn two wide then angled out and went three to four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. PRECIOUS INSIGHT sped to the front from outside, cleared
and angled in early, got pressure through the middle stages, lost command past the three-eighths pole, lost touch with the winner at the quarter pole and
folded in the lane. FLAG SALUTE was a bit rank leaving the gate then lost his path briefly early, went up outside the top pair on the backstretch, lost ground
while off the rail through the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MISTER BOLD away quickly to begin, stalked the leader up the backstretch, closed in around the turn, drew alongside past the quarter pole, took over
entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire. CHARGE CASH showed speed from inside and set the pace with a comfortable
lead up the backstretch, held a diminishing advantage approaching the quarter pole, relinquished command into the stretch and stayed on for the place
honors. SILKEN PRINCE broke slow to begin, sat off the pace, got brushed by HEARFULLOFSTARS early on the turn, entered the lane two wide and got to
within striking distance but lacked late punch in the final sixteenth. HEARTFULLOFSTARS broke a step slow, chased inside into the turn, drifted out and
brushed rival early on the bend then drifted a bit further, drifted to the inside in the lane and failed to menace. SLAM DUNK SERMON settled off the pace,
navigated the turn four wide and failed to rally. THIRSTY ALWAYS tracked off the rail, three wide through the turn and weakened. THE BEAT broke out a bit
but was quickly corrected, trailed well off the rail leaving the backstretch, entered the turn in the four path then angled in and raced two wide into the lane
and was never a factor.

LADY T away quickest from outside, angled in and rated in the two path, bid leaving the backstretch, took over past the three-eighths pole, cleared with a
quarter mile left to run, roused in upper stretch, widened through the lane and coasted in hand late. ANGEL NADESHIKO broke a step slow, went four deep
into the first turn, tracked out of range up the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and bested the rest. L BEE steered to the inside while trailing
early, tipped two wide and went between rivals leaving the far turn and was along for the show. SPRING SPINNING chased LADY T from inside into the first
turn then cleared that rival around the bend, got pressured into the far turn, lost command past the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with the winner
approaching the quarter pole and faded down the lane. BEIGNET broke a step slow, went three deep into the first turn then raced between rivals, trailed two
wide into the stretch and came up empty. BANJO QUEEN stumbled leaving the gate, stalked two wide then moved inside, raced two wide leaving the
backstretch, pulled up early on the far turn and walked into the van under her own power.

Footnotes
JETOVATOR broke a step slow in the beginning, went up to sit behind the dueling pair up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the drive, bid three deep
at the furlong marker, took over in midstretch and held gamely over HARBORED MEMORIES in the late stages. HARBORED MEMORIES tracked three
wide through the turn, rallied four deep past the eighth pole, challenged JETOVATOR through the final sixteenth and got denied. ARKAAN chased early
then went up to duel for command from inside, battled through the turn, fought into the final sixteenth, faltered late and saved the show. RED FLAG broke
slow, lagged behind early and drifted crossing the dirt, steered back to the inside, went two wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and summoned a
mild rally close the gap late. COTOPAXI (IRE) stumbled a bit to the front leaving the gate then dueled with ARKAAN up the backstretch, held a short lead
through the turn, clung to slim lead with a furlong remaining, overtaken shortly after passing the eighth pole and flattened late.

Footnotes
LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN took control quickly, set the pace under pressure from outside, dueled along the rail through the turn, inched ahead with a furlong to
go, then disposed of DISCO BALL in midstretch and held gamely over the late rally from the runner-up. RIFEY broke slow in the beginning, trailed four wide
into the turn, angled down the rail around the bend, closed through the lane, steered outside the top pair in deep stretch, surged late but ran out of time.
DISCO BALL prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, headed the leader and dueled around the turn, kept the pressure on to the eighth pole,
lost touch midstretch and faltered late. CALIFORNIA STREET was off slow to begin, went four then five wide around the turn and could not rally.
MORAWETH broke slow and inward, hustled up to a forward position, traveled along the inside then eased off the rail and went three wide into the lane and
flattened out. EL DIABLO ROJO rated behind the top pair from off the rail early, traveled three then four wide around the turn, got crowded at the eighth pole
and was not persevered with after.

Footnotes
MASHHAD FLATS set the pace on the inside under pressure to the stretch, battled head-to-head with CAJUN TREASURE down the lane and gamely
prevailed. CAJUN TREASURE pressed from outside to the stretch, dueled through the lane and got the best of the bob at the wire. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE
dropped back early, traveled two wide to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, lacked the needed late kick to threaten the top pair but finished a clear third.
MIKE OPERATOR stumbled sharply at the start, chased three deep on the turns, four wide into the stretch and weakened. UNBROKEN STAR was off a bit
slow, chased four wide around the first turn, prominent while outside the top trio up the backstretch, remained four deep into the far turn, lost ground through
that bend, entered the lane five wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
SPECIAL RIDE veered out and bumped ROMAN CENTURIAN, sped to the front and took control from inside, led clear into the stretch, met the bid from
ROMAN CENTURIAN with a furlong remaining and held gamely to the wire. ROMAN CENTURIAN got pinballed between rivals and forced to check leaving
the gate, settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane, bid outside entering the furlong grounds but could not get by.
AMERICAN ADMIRAL chased three wide around the first turn, entered the lane four wide and was along for the show. STREET RUCKUS went four then
three wide around the first turn, stalked outside the top pair up the backstretch, driven three wide into the lane and weakened. IMPOSSIBLE TASK pressed
from outside then chased up the backstretch, urged along two wide on the second bend and weakened. BACK RING LUCK got bumped hard from inside at
the start, drifted six wide around the first turn, remained wide at the back of the pack, rounded the far turn five wide and had little left for the drive. THE
STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START AND DISQUALIFIED SPECIAL RIDE FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR VEERING OUT AND CAUSING ROMAN
CENTURIAN TO CHECK SHARPLY, COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING. THE STEWARDS ALSO RULED THAT ALTHOUGH BACK
RING LUCK WAS BUMPED LEAVING THE GATE, HE WAS NOT COST THE CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
BOLDEN brushed the gate and broke inward to bump a rival, stalked three wide outside a rival into the turn, bid outside the leader past the quarter pole,
took over exiting the bend, cleared at the top of the stretch and drew off. STIR THE POT got brushed from inside leaving the gate, sped clear and showed
the way up the backstretch, challenged past the quarter pole, overtaken entering the stretch, tipped off the rail past the eighth pole and held the place.
SQUALOTORO broke a bit slow and brushed leaving the gate, trailed early on, went two wide into the turn, angled out went exited the bend four to five
wide, steered widest in the drive and summoned a mild rally for the show. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER tracked three deep between rivals into the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SHADY EMPIRE settled early from outside, went four deep into the turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and
weakened. SCARY FAST SMILE chased between into the turn, altered to the three path at the five-sixteenths pole and could not rally. RAGING WATERS
got pinballed leaving the gate and had to steady, went three to four wide around the turn and failed to make an impact. BIG HAND came away well, dropped
back early then advanced up the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped two wide in the drive and failed to menace. SAWASDEE broke out and brushed
rival, closest in pursuit early on, asked two wide around the turn, failed to respond and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
RIJEKA (IRE) chased four wide into the stretch for the first time then moved inside racing near the back, urged along through the far turn, bid between in
upper stretch, took over midstretch and outkicked FLY THE SKY in the final sixteenth. FLY THE SKY broke a bit slow, pulled crossing the dirt and first time
through the stretch, settled in the two path, crept closer on the final bend while angling five wide, bid six deep in upper stretch and took a short lead with a
furlong to go, was overtaken by the winner in midstretch and fought gamely to the wire. BEE CATCHER stalked outside a rival, asked three wide into the
stretch, bid five deep in the drive, got crowded in the furlong grounds and kept on to share the show honors. LIBERAL (IRE) went three then four wide early
before being steered to the inside trailing the field, angled out and came six wide into the stretch, bid seven deep with a furlong to go, lacked the needed late
punch and dead-heated for third. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE tracked along the inside, angled three wide late on the final turn, got brushed from outside in
upper stretch, bid four deep between rivals at the eighth pole but faltered in the late stages. NILES CHANNEL stalked two wide then came out a bit into the
stretch for the first turn, moved up to duel from outside on the backstretch, battled around the final turn and into the stretch, lost command with a furlong to
go and weakened in deep stretch. SNIPER KITTEN away quickly and crossed over to the inside, dueled inside NILES CHANNEL up the backstretch,
through the far turn and into the stretch, then gave way in the lane.
