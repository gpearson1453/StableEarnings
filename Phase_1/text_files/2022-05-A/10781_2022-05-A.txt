place spot. ON THE COME UP was bumped at the start, vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in two wide through the stretch run and got the
nod for third at the wire. THERE ARE NO WORDS vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in along the rail in the stretch and just missed for the
