Footnotes
MOMMA CARRIE set a pressured pace on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and drew clear, then was kept to right handed crop urging to prove
best while still clear. CAPTIVATING ART was well placed on the inside, tipped out three wide for aim on the winner and finished willingly but failed to gain
while being clearly second best. LA PRINCESSA POLLY was reserved early eased out leaving the quarter pole and then angled out six wide by the three
sixteenth and finished well on the outside for the show award. TAPITURE WAY was bumped at the start, then advanced two wide on the turn, angled out by
the furlong marker but needed more, missed show award. READY TO RUMBLE was reserved early while four wide, then remained outside on the turn and
came five into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. DISTORTED SUCCESS tracked the early pace three wide and made a mild four wide bid by the quarter
pole and came up empty in the drive. MS. P'S BELLA was settled while three wide on the turn and dropped back. MIDNIGHT MEADOW was hustled early
four to three wide to press the early pace, then raced two to three wide on the turn and tired. REGAL BILLEE was on the inside and was thru early.

Footnotes
STOP THE HUMBUG was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced nicely on the inside on the far turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim,
closed well to get up time to prove best under a drive. LIARS CLUB was sent to the lead and crossed over to the inside to set the pace while clear,
remained clear by the furlong marker and dug in gamely in the furlong grounds but it proved to be not enough, caught late. HELL BENT was settled back
early and then closed well up the inside but too late. TRINITY GOLD was reserved early while three wide, advanced four to five wide on the far turn, came
five wide into the lane and rallied but needed more. INFAMOUS COVERT was five wide into the first turn, then settled four wide on the backstretch, made a
four wide bid on the far turn and weakened in the drive. SUMMER SHANDEE was bumped at the start, tracked the early pace three to two wide, made a
two wide bid on the far turn and tired. KOSMONAVT was reserved early, then shifted to the outside and made a little run four wide by the quarter pole and
then had no late rally. INCENDIO was reserved early and was four wide on the backstretch and had no response. PUGIN was settled between horses and
tired. DAWSON SILVER chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

REAL MONEY stalked the early pace from the inside, shifted out to make a two wide bid leaving the three eighths, took over leaving the turn and then was
kept to pressure to maintain a safe margin to the wire to prove best. DOWNY BOY was bumped at the start, settled early and advanced two wide on the
turn, angled out leaving the turn and rallied well to get the place award at the wire. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS chased the pace and made a three wide bid on
the turn to loom boldly, but hung in the drive and lost the place award at the wire. NEVAEH'S DREAM set the early pace on the inside and was headed on
the turn and dueled for the lead to the quarter pole and weakened. FORESTER'S TURN was bumped at the start, then settled early and was three wide by
the quarter pole and had no rally. SO SUAVE (IRE) was settled early on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
EPHRATA (GB) was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move on the turn, was clear leaving the turn and moved towards the inside and drew off in
the drive to prove much the best, ridden out. BERAVINA was bumped at the start, dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid to shake clear on the
turn, then was headed by the winner and proved to be no match for the that rival while clearly second best. AIOLI was reserved early, was three to four wide
on the turn and then angled in by the furlong marker and finished willingly to gain the show award late. GALILEI chased the pace and was on the inside on
the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and was empty, missed show award. FIANNAS SONG was settled early and on the inside on the turn and then
passed the tiring rivals. BROKEN PROPOSAL was settled back early then found best stride late on the inside while being no factor. MYSTICAL JOURNEY
chased the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and weakened. EVERYDAY MAGIC dueled for the early
lead on the inside and folded. BESSIE was bumped at the start, then checked while in tight nearing the six furlong marker then was no threat. AUTUMN
STROLL broke in at the start bumping a rival, then checked early and had no response.

PIONEER'S EDGE was settled early while three wide, made a three to four wide move on the turn to vie for command leaving the turn, then slowly edged
away to prove best after a long drive. CURLIN CANDY dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear mid way on the turn,
then vied for command on the inside leaving the turn and kept on gamely to hold the place award. LADY BREW tracked the early pace and made a three
wide bid on the turn, vied for command between rivals leaving the turn and fought gamely but flattened out late. SISTER SEAGULL was reserved and
advanced on the inside on the turn, eased out leaving the quarter pole and then angled out for racing room and rallied late. MENAGERIE was settled back
early, made a mild run four wide by the quarter pole and then finished evenly late. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL was a little tough to handle early, tracked the pace on
the inside and weakened. TARA LUNA was allowed to settle on the inside and dropped back. SOME LIKE IT HOT was settled back early while four wide,
moved to the inside on the turn and swung out four wide for the drive and had no response. ISLAND BELLE dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered.

Footnotes
LOAD ABROAD stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, gained a short lead nearing the furlong marker and slowly edged
away to prove best under a drive. FORMENTOR dueled for the early lead three wide, made a two wide bid by the quarter pole, then fought gamely to the
wire but could not go with the winner late, second best. STOLE THE RING was well placed throughout, three wide by the quarter pole, shifted out four wide
leaving the turn but needed more, held show award. SURFEIT chased the early pace, then was under a drive on the turn and on the inside by the quarter
pole, shifted out three wide int he lane and had no kick. CLOUD RUNNER dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. ROOKIE COURT
was settled early while two wide and lacked a rally. SEEDS OF GRANDEUR hit the gate at the start, was outrun early, saved ground on the turn, swung out
four wide for the drive and found best stride late. PICTUREDAY JESSICA was settled four wide on the turn and came six wide into the drive and was not a
threat. IVICTORY was reserved early on the inside and was not a factor.
