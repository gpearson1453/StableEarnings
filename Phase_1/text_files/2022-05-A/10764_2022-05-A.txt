Footnotes
FROM ABOVE Broke well and set off to the lead, dueled outside of rival into the far turn, drifted slightly outwards on bend, straightened out well and ran
down rival to win in final yards. L BAR D CLASSIC TRIP Away sharply and led from the rail, joined and dueled inside heading into the far turn, led into
straight, couldn't hold rival at bay. WANNA BE FIERCE Broke quickly and stalked outside of dueling leaders into the far turn, continued his pursuit from the
quarter pole home and faltered late. BIGGER THAN YOU Tracked outside runners down the backstretch, carried out by errant foe as they rounded the turn
inside the quarter pole, failed to menace from that point. WILD MONKEY Dwelt early and ended up trailing for backside run, drifted from two path towards
outer rail heading into the turn and then ran up on the heels of a drifting rival, switched inside for stretch run, gained on preceding rival and advanced past
late well off winning pace. CARTEL ATTITUDE Stalked along the rail into the turn when he started to drift off his line and nearly clipped heels with a rival in
front of him, lost all chance at that point and was taken care of by rider from there.

Footnotes
FLYCATCHER Tucked in early to save ground while stalking leaders, moved up inside to challenge for lead approaching quarter pole, battled inside of
rivals, took clear initiative down lane and prevailed. DENALI SUCCESS Tracked in the second flight early on, advanced with eventual winner up the two
path approaching the far turn, chased the final quarter-mile but never mustered enough to do more than second. CLEVER EMMA Sent to lead early on rail,
drifted very wide on the turn and ended up in the six path up the backstretch, dueled inside of rival from that point, joined by two others inside into the far
turn, outrun down the stretch and was no match. CONFIDENTIALLY WHO Taken ahold and trailed throughout, commenced rally at three-sixteenths pole
and split runners to advance, flew home late under heavy urging but ran out of time to gain more positions. MADI'S THUNDERBIRD Sat back in early
stages, mild gains along rail heading past quarter pole but idled when speed backed into face, passed tiring late. MEMO FIRM NOCTURNO Dueled outside
of rival for lead from the outset, carried wide to the backstretch by drifting rival outside, was four wide into the far turn, failed to respond to urging and faded.
FRED No early foot and found himself in the rear opening stages, called upon for more run with over a quarter-mile to go, never fired.

TIGER BY HIS TAIL Challenged for lead outside of rival, took charge around three-eights marker, led field into far turn and began to stride away from rivals
at eight-pole, confidently and handily ridden to the wire. MORE HONOR Sent to duel inside of rival early on, conceded lead to eventual winner on
backstretch, called upon for gain at quarter pole while inside of two other rivals, took second heading into the stretch and maintained position for remainder
of run, never matching the winner. FIGHT ME Stalked leaders three deep on first turn, tried to advance heading to far turn at quarter pole while leader pulled
clear, three wide into turn, no match for winner. SPEEDING STYLE Stalked between rival and the rail early, switched out to be between horses as the field
approached the far turn, showed minor gains in position rounding turn, outfinished down the lane. SWITCH BACK Tracked third flight in early stages,
between rivals in the four path down the backstretch, waited for action until eighth pole, bested rest. GOLDEN TIGER Settled in rear soon after break, asked
for run three-sixteenths pole, evenly through lane. BRICKHOUSE Inside of horses throughout, prompted quarter pole, no menace. DELICIOUS Unhurried
throughout, dwelt from first call home.
