Footnotes
AIR FORCE WOMAN was away alertly and was sent to the front, showed good early speed while setting fast fractions through the turn, opened a clear lead
nearing the furlong marker, responded to firm urging in the final sixteenth and held safely to prevail. PHANTOM INDIAN tracked the quick pace three deep
on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, continued that run through the final sixteenth and could not reel in the winner in the end but held for second. GET'EM
TIGER contested the fast early pace, gave ground to the winner on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but was clear for the show. TORREY'S GIRL
saved ground while tracking the quick early pace, gained ground in upper stretch and was outclosed in the late stages. EXQUISITE LEGACY tracked the
pace, was two wide between foes on the turn and did not have a final kick in the drive. BENGAL TIGER was a bit slow in the early stages, chased the pace
from an inside path, improved in the stretch but lacked the needed late response. SUGAR CRUSH chased the quick pace to the turn, was steered two to
three wide approaching the top of the lane and did not offer a late bid.

BOWLMAGEDDON tracked the pace two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, came within aim leaving the furlong marker, made a late push
under steady urging and gamely prevailed in a blanket finish. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was shuffled in tight quarters just after the break, chased the pace to
the turn, was steered three wide through the bend, swung widest into the drive, rallied in the final furlong and just missed for the win, while getting the nod
for the place. QUICK TIME (GB) chased the pace from an inside path, advanced on the turn, was in tight along the rail nearing the furlong marker, took a
slight edge into the final stages and was tagged for the win and place, while just holding for the show. AFTER SUNDOWN was away alertly, ceded the early
lead and pressed the pace through the turn, advanced on the pacesetter leaving the turn, vied for the lead leaving the furlong marker and was edged out in
the final stages in a blanket finish. ROCK N ROLL SONG was hustled to the front in the early going, set the pace while being pressed through the turn, was
caught nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished.

ROYAL 'N RANDO settled off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, swung four wide for the drive, closed fast in the final furlong and was
up in the final strides to prevail. HIGHLAND GHOST kept close attendance to the pace through the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter along the
second turn, was on even terms with that rival into upper stretch, took a narrow edge into the late stages, was all out under firm encouragement in the final
sixteenth and was nailed on the line by the winner, while besting the rest. WORSE READ SANCHEZ hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off
of the pace, was roused along the second turn, tipped out to the three path for the drive, improved in the final furlong and was outfinished by the top pair
late, while clear for third. COWBOY CHARLIE broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run while in a good
rhythm, came under pressure from HIGHLAND GHOST leaving the second turn, ceded the lead to that foe leaving the furlong marker and gave way in the
end. NORTHVALE ROAD was a bit keen in the early going and was forwardly placed early on, lost position along the backstretch run, dropped back on the
second turn and tired in the late stages. PER RULING #9 FROM THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD, WORSE READ SANCHEZ WAS
DISQUALIFIED DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
YES YOUR GRAZE broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was three wide while clearing the field into the turn, shifted to the two path nearing the
quarter marker, extended the lead in upper stretch and was clear in the end. MISTICAL SURPRISE saved ground while just off of the early pace, advanced
on the turn, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch but kept on to hold safely for second. ROSARITA CARMELITA chased the early pace, gained
ground three wide on the turn, was outfinished in the stretch run and was just edged out in the final stages for the place. CYCLONE SLEW lacked early
speed while outside of rivals, swung four wide into the drive and did not have a late kick. TIME TO SMILE pressed the early pace to the turn, took up sharply
in a tight spot leaving the three-eighths marker, dropped back along the turn and did not mount a late response. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING TIME TO SMILE ON THE TURN AND RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT TIME TO SMILE CAUSED HER OWN
ISSUES IN THE INCIDENT AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER.

Footnotes
PREMIUM FOREST was content to settle in the early going, maintained a two wide path into the second turn, was roused into the stretch run, advanced
leaving the furlong marker, found an opening nearing the sixteenth marker and made a late surge to prevail in the final strides. BRONZE WARRIOR stalked
the early pace two wide, closed on the pacesetter leaving the second turn, headed UNTHROTTLED inside of the furlong marker, dueled with that rival to the
wire and was nailed in the final jumps by the fast closing winner, while just getting the nod for second. UNTHROTTLED was away alertly and was sent to
the front, set solid fractions through the backstretch run while well handled, was confronted by the runner-up leaving the furlong grounds, dueled with that
foe to the wire and was just nipped in the final strides for the win and was edged for the place. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) settled three wide off of the early pace,
shifted to the two path on the second turn, gained ground in the drive but was outfinished in the end by the top three. SACRED RIDER settled just off of the
early pace, saved ground into the second turn while improving position, lacked room along the rail through the stretch run and did not have a late response.
ALVAARO was three wide while forwardly placed on the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the
late stages. ON RAGLAN ROAD was three then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace from the second flight, lost position three wide on the second
turn and did not mount a late rally. COOLCROSS was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a late bid.

Footnotes
HANDSOME GARY was sent to the front, took a contested lead into the turn, extended the margin nearing the quarter marker, was clear approaching the
furlong grounds, was confronted by the runner-up nearing the sixteenth marker and determinedly held that rival at bay in the final stages to prevail. PRINCE
DE PRINCE settled just off of the pace while in the midflight, mounted a four then five wide bid into the drive, closed well through the stretch, came within
aim of the winner in the final sixteenth but could not get by that determined foe and was denied the win while well clear of the rest. MCGEORGE settled off
of the early pace, was roused two wide into the stretch, gained ground leaving the furlong marker and was outkicked in the final stages while securing the
show in the end. AUSTRIAN NAVY was sent leaving the start and kept close attendance to the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and
was outfinished in the final sixteenth. WHOA BUDDY was away alertly, chased the early pace, lost ground while two wide on the turn and tired in the final
stages. EMERALD MAGIC was squeezed at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, was three wide through the turn and did not offer a late rally.
DUB TOWN lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not have a late response.

Footnotes
ELLAMIRA was allowed to settle in the early going, was roused three wide leaving the three furlong marker, circled the field five wide into the stretch, came
within aim approaching the furlong grounds, struck the front nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. VINCERO GRANDE settled just off of
the early pace, was steered three then four wide into the drive, loomed in upper stretch, could not hold off the winner in the final sixteenth but was best of
the rest. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL was forwardly placed early on while saving ground, lost position leaving the quarter pole and into upper stretch, was
outfinished in the final stages but held on for the show. VAPING ANGEL settled off of the pace while two to three wide, gained ground in upper stretch,
continued that run in the drive, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just missed for third. EXACTLY WENDY settled off of the pace, saved ground
through the backstretch run and into the second turn, advanced in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. IRISH WAHINE stalked the pace from
a two wide path through the half-mile marker, made a steady advance on the pacesetter leaving the quarter pole, took a narrow lead into the final furlong but
did not go on with that bid and faltered in the late going. SEN SEN was off a step slowly then was hustled to the front, set reasonable fractions while on a
clear lead through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final stages.
