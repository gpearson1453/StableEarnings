was collared by the winner late on the far turn and fought on to hold the place. ESPECIALLEA was in range inside, went two wide around the far turn, tipped
three wide in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) raced off the pace three wide, came six wide into the lane and
improved position. UNCLE FUN saved ground and failed to menace. SPINNING KITTEN was in range three wide and tired in the lane. PAPA HONOR
saved ground off the pace, advanced outside down the backstretch, made good progress four wide around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

THE DISTRACTOR saved ground reserved behind the early leaders, found an ample seam between STARLITE WALKER and SMILING TEUFLES turning
for home, and pulled clear late under a mild drive. STARLITE WALKER set the pace inside, could not hold off the winner leaving the furlong grounds, and
remained well clear of the others. SMILING TEUFLES prompted STARLITE WALKER from outside to the stretch, and had no rally. VINNY DREAM was no
factor inside. LITTLE DEMON tired after a half-mile three wide. LUCA DREW THE ACE was in a bit tight between VINNY DREAM and LUCA DREW THE
ACE approaching the turn, and had nothing left in the stretch.

NIXANEFF set a clear pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear under a drive. INTERESTING GEM chased the winner two wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and held second. TIZMET raced off the early pace three wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. RAIN OF
BLESSING was never a threat while racing four wide. OUR TEN ANGELS chased the pace from the rail and tired in the lane. JUANITA R trailed two wide.

THEREARENORULES stalked the early leaders three wide, rallied to the lead in midstretch and drove clear. MISS SUGAR HILL (GB) ranged up four wide
to loom a threat near the quarter-pole, could not kick on with the top one and settled for second best. PERFECTIBLE LADY advanced to contention after a
half-mile, bid outside TANK TOP after six furlongs, fought for command through upper stretch, but was outfinished. WANDERING prompted the early pace
two wide, and was finished before reaching the stretch. CASTLE BORN saved ground to the far turn, and had no response. TANK TOP set the pace inside
to upper stretch, and weakened. STARSHIP BABE was never prominent. LET FREEDOM REIN broke outward spotting the field a couple lengths, and
dropped far back after six furlongs. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF MISS SUGAR HILL WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TAPSASIONAL set the pace along the rail, was headed midway around the far turn, fought back inside, dueled to the wire and prevailed. CHUCKY pressed
the winner two wide, took the lead midway around the far turn, dueled outside of that foe to the wire and just missed. YOU'RE KILLIN ME settled off the
pace inside, went four wide around the far turn and finished evenly to gain the show. MR RUM RUNNER tracked the top two wide while racing two and
three wide and weakened a bit the lane. ROAN MOUNTAIN was outrun inside. BRACCIO DI FERRO raced four to five wide and never threatened.
AMPERSAND was getting out around the first turn, rushed up outside down the backstretch, bid nearing the half-mile pole, got out again around the far turn
and retreated.

Footnotes
WINKIWINKI set the pace along the rail, turned back bids nearing the lane, edged ahead in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and widened.
STELLAR RIDE pressed the pace two wide between foes, could not quite match strides with the winner in the lane but kept on to hold second. KAEKO
lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn and finished well outside to gain the show. KARLA SOFIA steadied at the start, tracked the pace from
the rail and weakened in the final furlong. DIGNIFIED saved ground and failed to menace. JUMEIRAH stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, drifted out nearing the lane and retreated. DIVINE CONNECTION played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
GRAND AVE GIRL took command at once, rated along inside through an easy pace, and widened through the stretch under a mild drive. BALLYMORE
STAR (IRE) prompted the pace throughout in the two-path, and just saved the place between horses. STARSHIP NTERPRISE saved ground on the turns,
remained on the rail for the drive and lacked a solid closing response. KEY BISCAYNE hopped at the start and was slowest away, steadied along the inside
entering the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and had some late interest. UNA LUNA was three wide early and in range, but had no rally. DANCE
WARRIOR steadied between horses entering the far turn, and made no impact. LUCKY PERIDOT made no impact. FLYING BLACK steadied into the first
turn at the back, and remained outrun. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
