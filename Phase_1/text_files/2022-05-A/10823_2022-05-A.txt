Footnotes
PRETTY PRINCESS trailed two wide early, angled three wide near the quarter pole, shifted six wide in upper stretch, kicked in and was up and clear late.
FILLMORE EAST chased the pace in the five path, angled into the two path near the quarter pole, rallied between foes and gained the place in the final
strides. WOW TAPIT set the pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. RED WIND tracked the pace four wide and was one-paced in the lane. ISLAND
MAGIC pressed the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the land and weakened. MOTHERWELL failed to menace while racing two wide. HENNI
PENNY saved ground off the pace, checked near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. JULIE BIRD (IRE) was fractious in the gate and popped the
gate open, raced three wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
STARSHIP ABRAHAM stalked the pace two wide, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. STAT set the pace along the rail, led to the
sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead and was no match late. ANTHRACITE settled off the pace while racing two wide around the turns and ran on
for the show. LEOPARDI was up close inside while tugging early, remained in range inside to upper stretch and faded. BLUTO'S CANDY broke a bit
awkwardly, raced three to four wide and never threatened. SHA TIN was bumped at the start, saved ground and made little impact. ENGINE'S READY was
reluctant to load, broke outwardly and slowly, showed some early speed three wide and faded after a half. PIEER ROR broke a bit slowly and bumped SHA
TIN at the start, rushed up four wide and retreated three wide around the far turn. HUNTER trailed inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
EMMA AND I raced in closest attendance to QUEEEN DOMINA for a half-mile, ranged up to challenge outside that rival on the far turn, battled through a
long drive with pressure from both flanks and gamely prevailed. PERFECT KIMBERLY S saved ground unhurried early, swung widest for the drive and
finished with good courage to narrowly miss. MONGOLIAN MISSION advanced after six furlongs outside the leaders in the four-path, had aim through the
lane but came up just a bit short between the top two. LA RUSIA hugged the rail throughout, slipped through to loom a threat inside the leaders turning for
home, but did not have enough. QUEEN DOMINA got clear early through easy fractions while in the two-path, lost the advantage to EMMA AND I after six
furlongs, and faded. TEGLA moved up at the back of a bunched group four wide after six furlongs, but gave way into the stretch.

FREEDOM SPEAKS stalked the pace three wide, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. PARCHITA vied inside of AUNTIE MIMI to
upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on to last for the place. ROCKETS SISTER was off slowly, raced three to four wide around the turn,
made progress in upper stretch then flattened out. GUNESH stumbled at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. TAG HER failed to menace while
racing four wide. JESSICA BLAH BLAH broke slowly, raced three wide and made little impact. AUNTIE MIMI set the pace two wide and retreated through
the lane. CURLIN'S DOVE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
QUITE READY battled for the lead outside FROSTY BREEZE and ASTRAL RIDE to the stretch, and edged away through the final furlong all out. ETERNAL
FLAME was outsprinted early, swung five wide turning for home, and rallied on the far outside to get second. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH sat off the
three-way pace dispute on the turn while in the clear, came four wide into the lane and did enough to get third late. ASTRAL RIDE vied for the lead between
horses from the start, and weakened leaving the furlong grounds. TRAPPE THE WIND saved ground outsprinted early, took closer order into upper stretch,
then lacked a clear path and could not be fully set down. FROSTY BREEZE argued the pace inside rivals to midstretch, and weakened. REDJACK never
reached contention. CONSTITUTIONALSONG raced three wide on the turn, and tired. FUTURISTIC trailed throughout while getting out steadily around the
turn.
