ASHLEYS CUPCAKE prompted the pace three wide into the turn, gained a narrow lead, set the balance of the pace under pressure and held well under
right handed urging. WWINSPIRED battled for the lead along the inside and just missed in a game effort. DOUBLE EDGED with the second flight two wide,
finished with good courage four wide. CITY SIGNS never far back, closed a gap late five wide. COWCHI contested the lead two wide into the stretch and
was outfinished in the final stages. REYS PINA COLADA close up along the inside into the stretch, had her heels clipped inside the furlong marker while
fading. LUCKY PENNY ROSE trailed into the stretch, drifted in shortly after being struck with a right handed whip clipping heels with REYS PINA COLADA
past the furlong marker and stumbled.
