Footnotes
RENDLAKE was urged to stay close outside PRETTY LADY TOO after the break, took over on the bend then steadily opened up under steady urging in the
lane. PRETTY LADY TOO was hustled to the early lead, showed the way along the rail, was no match for RENDLAKE when set down for the drive but held
onto second under late urging. APPLE VALLEY raced closest to the top pair, stayed widest through the bend, lacked a significant stretch bid but was clearly
best of the others. RULER DAENERYS failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. CYBERTAP chased from just outside RULER DAENERYS and came up
empty for the drive.

Footnotes
TORIN advanced just outside UPBEAT MELODY to share the lead nearing the turn, was roused leaving that bend and shook off the latter in the waning
yards. UPBEAT MELODY soon had a clear lead, was challenged from outside after a furlong and a half, all out through the stretch, did not have enough left
but was clearly second best. READY REDDING void of speed, was just off the inside on the turn, floated out some for the drive and caught BEE HAPPY
ATTACK for third deep stretch. BEE HAPPY ATTACK raced closest to the top pair from the early going, saved ground on the bend, had no stretch rally and
gradually wore down in the late going. JOHNNY LONGBOAT broke with the pack but quickly dropped back, saved ground and was never a factor. BUBBA
CABALLO chased from outside, lost ground widest through the turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE broke outward, was hustled clear and steadily angled in, challenged from both sides on the turn, moved clear under urging and maintained
control under steady handling. DUSTY MILLER raced in the second flight just outside HALO COUTURE, loomed a threat outside ALMAFUERTE on the
bend, had every chance in the lane, lacked the needed late kick but was clearly second best. HALO COUTURE pressed from inside, wore down the final
furlong but lasted for third. HOLD THE SPENDING in contention toward the outside, came into the lane four wide and had no late bid. BOWS N LACE was
not a factor in a wide trip. RUBY ROUND HERE was a contender just off the inside through the early going but gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
KHOZIE'S GHOST was encouraged to gain the early lead then allowed to relax, drew away when urged in the lane and kept to task until the final fifty yards.
SUPERTRIX settled well back early, picked up her pace from inside on the bend and took over second inside the last furlong. RONAN soon trailed from
inside, swung out some for a clear path entering the stretch and made up minor ground on SUPERTRIX as she drew away for third in the late going.
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE pressed KHOZIE'S GHOST from just outside, floated out some into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S CITY rated off the early speed, was roused three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, gradually lugged in as she took over in the
lane, was straightened nearing the final sixteenth and kept to task to the wire. GO MADI GO was slow into a good stride, picked up her pace under urging
while widest on the bend, was six wide into the lane, made a very strong move, closed well and caught TENSE for second. TENSE broke alertly, soon had a
clear lead, floated out some entering the stretch, could not stay with GHAALEB'S CITY and slowly wore down in the waning yards. DOLLY'S LINE chased
from midpack, progressed four wide on the turn, moved outside GHAALEB'S CITY for the stretch run and was closing the gap on TENSE the last sixteenth.
MOON PIES IMAGE advanced from inside on the turn, came off the rail some for the drive and lacked a significant bid. MISS KITTY PIE hesitated at the
break, saved ground and failed to menace. SHINE DOWN also chased from midpack, yielded two wide on the bend and failed to have a serious stretch bid.
MISS WINDY SLEW prompted the pace outside TENSE but flattened out for the drive. MEDIA PRINCESS was urged along early from between horses but
never a contender.

Footnotes
LINDALOUIMAGE moved to the inside early on, picked up her pace when asked on the bend, took the lead under urging upper stretch and held sway while
kept to task. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE prominent from the beginning, went for the lead outside SHEZ RECKLESS after three furlongs, was carried out by
the latter into the lane, battled for second and edged ahead of SHEZ RECKLESS in the waning yards. SHEZ RECKLESS soon had a clear lead, was
challenged approaching the final quarter mile, drifted out as she was urged for more entering the stretch, fought to hold onto second but had to settle for
third. GHAALEB'S RANGER was angled to the outside after a furlong and hustled along, came into the lane from path three, moved to contention upper
stretch but could not sustain her bid the last eighth. DIAMOND GUCCI failed to be a factor.

TIZ APPROVED in hand early outside GIRLOLAMO'GLORY, moved clear when allowed into the bend, took the rail, was put to urging upper stretch,
steadily drew off and was kept to task to the wire. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with TIZ APPROVED entering the
turn, angled outside the latter, closed the gap on the leader midway on the bend, came into the lane from path three and maintained second under steady
handling. FRONTANA raced in contention from outside, angled in some with two furlongs to go then could only move clear for third late. MARCO'S DREAM
chased from off the inside, moved to the rail and contention on the bend but leveled off the final eighth. TALE OF THE NILE angled out through the turn,
came widest into the stretch then had no late bid. MEMORY BANK moved to the inside early on, was hustled along but always outrun.
