GOD'S PICK was forwardly placed soon after the start, took over the lead from WORTHTHEMONEY nearing the quarter pole and widened to a
commanding lead under a mild drive. WORTHTHEMONEY grabbed the lead after opening strides, got collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole but
stayed on with response and cleared second best. LONESTAR CHROME raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, hustled up along the
inside down the lane and gained show. BENTLEY raced in the back, urged two wide around the turn and failed to threaten. HELLO HEARTBREAKER
chased the top pair around the turn then gave way.

NO ONE CARES took over the lead mid-way through the backstretch, raced two wide and held firm around the turn, continued to show the way by a clear
advantage a furlong out then held late over fast gaining ZENCHUA SKY. ZENCHUA SKY was well placed tracking up close in early stages, launched a two
to three wide bid for the lead around the turn, stayed game in pursuit of NO ONE CARES into the lane, gained fast in final stages and just missed. DIXIE
TRIXIE vied for the lead in opening stages, continued in range along the rail around the turn and stayed on for a share. GREAT MILLS ROAD raced off the
top trio into the turn, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and failed to rally. QUEEN OF THE SHIP stumbled at the start and lost ground,
raced in the back and never got going.

TAKE ME AS I AM moved up to challenge LONG MONDAY for the lead soon after the start, matched strides up the backstretch and battled for command
around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane and held clear under steady urging. LONG MONDAY grabbed the lead out of the gate and took on the
challenge from TAKE ME AS I AM entering the first turn, dueled for command up the backstretch and around the far turn, could not maintain equal terms at
the head of the lane but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. FETCHING FURY was allowed to settle of the pace in early stages, was
ridden along two wide around the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and churned on for a share. GOODNIGHTSUGAR tracked the early pace, saved
ground around the turn and had no response when called upon. BIND ME UP was well placed stalking the embattled duo up the backstretch, came up
empty late on the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.

KIDO'S SLING SHOT broke sharp and sprinted to a clear lead, continued to dictate terms by a clear margin around the turn, came two wide into the upper
stretch, widened advantage without asking and finished clear. PRAIRIE WOLF took a solid bump at the start, was well placed tracking the early leader,
launched a two to three wide bid mid-way around the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch and finished clearly second best. WAKE UP ANGEL was
forwardly placed soon after the start, chased inside around the turn, tipped out three wide for the drive and raced along for a share. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW
chased the top trio into the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten. VAUDEVILLE MEWS took a solid bump at the start, raced off
the early pace, came three to four wide into the lane and offered no late bid. MALIBU BAY BREEZE got bumped between foes at the start, was void of
speed and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
ADRIA sped to the lead at the start, held clear still unleashed mid-way around the turn, roused for more turning for home, responded willingly and drew off.
CALL KRYSTAL raced in range in the opening quarter, chased two to three wide around the turn, sustained a bid for the clear winner and finished second
best. ROME'S BURNING was forwardly placed soon after the start, tracked along the inside into the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and prevailed for a
share. KEEN CONTENDER lacked speed and raced in the back, came three wide into the upper stretch and improved position. DIAL IT UP A NOTCH
raced up close just off the leader, continued in striking range around the turn then tired in the drive. DREAM PIRE stumbled at the start and dropped back to
last, raced off the early pace and failed to move into close contention. ANIME DAY raced off the pace, urged four wide around the turn and never
threatened. RAINBOWS ARE FREE saved ground around the turn and had no late response. NIFTY DAZE weakened after the opening stages, chased
three wide around the turn and had no late response. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND TIMED
