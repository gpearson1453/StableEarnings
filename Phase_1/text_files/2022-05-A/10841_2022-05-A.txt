Footnotes
STEIN'S GIRL settled three wide on the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker,
advanced in upper stretch to take a short lead into the final furlong and edged clear in the late stages. SHANGHAI MIST broke alertly and was sent to set
the pace, was engaged by CLIFFSOFTHUNDER leaving the first turn, ceded the lead to that rival nearing the half-mile marker, improved position to vie for
the lead nearing the eighth pole but could not match strides with the winner in the end, while holding safely for place. SASSY EINSTEIN was away a bit
slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, was roused on the second turn while three wide and made a sustained rally through the stretch to secure the
show. HARBOR ABBEY settled off of the early pace, saved ground to the second turn, advanced in upper stretch to come within aim but flattened out in that
effort in the final furlong. CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) kept close attendance to the early pace, edged to a narrow lead leaving the half-mile marker, drew
clear nearing the quarter marker, was put to firm urging while under pressure approaching the furlong grounds, was caught inside of the final furlong and
weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE TRACK showed good early speed while in hand and took command of the early pace, drew clear while setting fast fractions through the
turn, felt mild late pressure in the final stages but held safely in a drive. CALIFORNIA COOL tracked the quick pace from a two wide path through the turn,
put mild pressure on the winner in the final sixteenth but was outkicked in the end and was clear of the rest for second. CROWN KITTEN chased the early
pace, was two wide through the turn and showed good late interest to rally for third. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP chased the quick pace three wide outside of
rivals on the turn and finished evenly in the drive. EYE ON TIGER lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. TONI TWO
POCKET was hustled leaving the break and showed early speed while disputing the pace, lost position along the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HOLY GHOST was unhurried in the early stages while saving ground, was roused two wide nearing the top of the stretch, split foes while gaining ground
nearing the furlong marker, caught LOOKIN FOR REVENGE in the final stages and made a late surge to prevail. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was sent after a
good beginning and set the modest fractions, turned away a bid from BABY FRANKIE nearing the quarter pole and extended the lead into upper stretch,
was caught by HOLY GHOST inside of the sixteenth marker and could not hold that rival off in the end, while besting the rest. ARCH PRINCE settled two
wide just off of the early pace while in the second flight, gained ground three wide along the second turn, made a four wide bid into the drive and was
outfinished in the end by the top pair while holding safely for show. MAGIC TIGER bobbled a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, was rank and hard to
place on the first turn while just off of the pace, advanced along the inside on the second turn but could not go on with that bid and weakened in the drive.
BABY FRANKIE was forwardly placed early on, attended to the pace through the half-mile marker, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, lost
position in upper stretch and gave way in the late going.

EAST RAND saved ground while settling off of the early pace, was roused three then four wide nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch,
caught BIGFOOT CITY leaving the sixteenth marker and made a late push to prevail in the end. BIGFOOT CITY was away in good order and was sent to
the front, set solid fractions through the second turn while on a clear lead, maintained that advantage into upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging
nearing the sixteenth marker and was caught by the winner in the final stages, while besting the rest. AMERICA GREAT stalked the solid early pace while
saving ground, advanced leaving the second turn, continued that advance through the stretch run, took up just before the sixteenth marker when BIGFOOT
CITY drifted out and was outkicked in the final stages, while holding safely for third. DEALERS HAND was unhurried early on, trailed through the
backstretch run, saved ground through the far turn, advanced in upper stretch and was outclosed in the final stages while challenging for the show.
VANTAGE POINT settled just off of the early pace while two wide in the second flight, gained ground three wide on the second turn but could not sustain
that bid and weakened in the stretch run. SKY DINSKI settled off of the early pace while saving ground, was steered three wide leaving the three furlong
marker and did not mount a late bid in the stretch. DESERT DUDE was forwardly placed early on while stalking the solid fractions, lost ground nearing the
quarter marker and faded in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING BIGFOOT CITY AND AMERICA
GREAT NEARING THE SIXTEENTH MARKER AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT BIGFOOT CITY DRIFTED OUT A PATH CAUSING
AMERICA GREAT TO TAKE UP AND DISQUALIFIED BIGFOOT CITY FROM SECOND TO THIRD.

Footnotes
ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT was unhurried early on, trailed into the second turn, lacked room nearing the three-sixteenths marker and angled out for the drive,
closed fast through the final furlong and reeled in HYPERSONIC in the final sixteenth to prevail. HYPERSONIC was hustled leaving the break and took
command of the early fractions while on a clear lead, set a quick pace into the second turn, was well clear at the head of the lane, was all out in the final
sixteenth and was reeled in by the winner and just held on for the place in a close finish for the minor awards. COOLCROSS settled off of the early pace
while saving all of the ground, steadied briefly in tight quarters leaving the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch and continued that rally in the final
stages to just miss for the place and get up for the show. HYDROGEN settled off of the pace while two wide on the first turn, kept that position through the
second turn, gained ground in upper stretch and closed willingly in the late stages to just miss for the show. UNPOSSIBLE was three wide on the first turn
while just off of the pace, maintained the three wide path through the backstretch run and into the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. KING EDDIE
settled in the early stages while two wide, was asked for run four wide on the second turn and lacked a late response. GOING AWAY PARTY saved ground
while tracking the pace, lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded through the stretch run. DARK PRINCE tracked the quick early pace from the
second flight, maintained position into the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave out in the final stages.

SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) was three wide while stalking the early pace, took back along the backstretch run, was roused three then four wide at the top of
the lane, made a strong rally through the stretch, headed CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS in the final strides and got by that rival to prevail in the end.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS stalked the moderate fractions from a two wide path to the second turn, gave a bit of ground to LEMON ZINGER at the top of the
stretch, closed on that rival through the final furlong, was able to inch to a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth marker but was tagged on the line by the
winner, while holding for the place. LEMON ZINGER broke alertly and was sent to set the fractions, set a moderate pace while being prompted into the
second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, came under late pressure from the winner and was caught in the final strides, while just being edged for the
place. J T'S CREDITCARD was a bit keen to go on while stalking the pace on the first turn, maintained position while two wide through the second turn,
could not match strides in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages. SENOR DEL CAMPO was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved
position on the second turn while two wide but could not go on with that bid and flattened out in the final furlong. OASIS saved ground while forwardly placed
early on, lost ground along the second turn and gave way in the drive. TOM'S BIRTHDAY was a bit rank and hard to place on the first turn, slipped inside to
save ground through the second turn and lacked a late response. TEXAS LONHRO settled off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, was
eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN chased the early pace from the midflight to the turn, was roused nearing the quarter marker, mounted a four then five wide bid into
the stretch, closed well through the final furlong, reeled in the pacesetter inside of the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. GOING TO SHABOOMS
was sent leaving the break and took command of the pace into the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter pole, extended the lead in upper stretch, was clear
nearing the sixteenth marker but could not hold off the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN lunged at the start and was
away a step slowly, chased the solid pace from the inside through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages, while just
getting up to earn the nod for third. SWANEE chased the solid early pace, gained ground four wide on the turn but did not go on with that run in the stretch
and flattened out in the late stages, while just missing for third. DR WYSONG chased the pace from the inside and made a belated rally in the drive.
PERSUASIVE LIPS was away alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the pace three wide through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and faded through
the final furlong. ALESHA was away slowly from the gate and lacked early speed to the turn, made a steady gain through the stretch but was not a threat.

Footnotes
TURA LURA tracked the early pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was roused two then three wide into the drive, closed on the
leading pair in the final furlong and made a late push to get by the runner-up to prevail. NENE ROMANO was hustled leaving the break and contested the
early pace, took back and tracked CLEAR WIN through the turn and into upper stretch, overtook that rival approaching the sixteenth marker, drifted in a bit
inside of the sixteenth pole and was caught and outfinished in the end by the winner, while clear of the rest for second. DANCE LADY lacked early speed,
saved ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, shifted out for the final sixteenth and secured the show in the final strides. CLEAR WIN contested
the early pace then took command into the turn, set solid fractions through the quarter marker and into upper stretch, was caught nearing the sixteenth
marker and weakened in the final stages. BREAKFAST BALL chased the pace two then three wide along the turn, gained ground in upper stretch but could
not muster the necessary late response. MAGGIE FITZGERALD chased the pace to the turn, lost ground three wide on the turn and lacked a late response
in the stretch. P T RANGER was away in good order, took back to track the pace to the turn, lost position along the turn and was three to four wide nearing
the top of the lane, was erratic and hard to place in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.
