R H SMOAKEM showed the way in hand from inside, was let out some on the turn, roused leaving the bend then maintained control under steady urging in
the lane. RIPE ATTACK commenced his bid three wide on the turn, angled in some with two furlongs to go, had every chance in the stretch, leveled off the
last eighth but lasted for the place. BEL BIMBO pressed R H SMOAKEM from just outside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, swung outside
RIPE ATTACK after that one passed near the quarter mile marker and found best stride too late deep stretch. ABSTRACT PAYNTER lost ground racing
widest throughout but also showed a willingness to run late.

Footnotes
FIXICO was jostled shortly after the break and checked, settled inside, swung out into the bend, came widest for the stretch run, was all out and got up in
time. CROWNED LEADER without early speed from outside, was three then four wide taking the turn, rallied in the stretch, vied for the lead briefly between
rivals in the waning yards but was outfinished in a game effort. RAHFEE TOWN angled in trying to keep a clear path leaving the chute, jostled briefly with
FIXICO, quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside KAY'S GRAY, edged ahead into the lane, gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure and did not
have enough left nearing the wire. W W RUSSIAN GOLD moved to the inside early, angled out two wide to pass GREENSPAN leaving the turn, moved
back to the rail upper stretch, gained a striking position in a narrow path but leveled off in the waning yards. KAY'S GRAY displayed early speed just off or
along the rail but gradually wore down between rivals for the drive. STOSH chased from inside, swung out behind CROWNED LEADER for the stretch run
and had no late bid. GREENSPAN prominent early, gave way from along the rail on the bend.

Footnotes
MISS LEARJET vied for the lead outside horses from the beginning, was two wide on the bend, battled outside ARCH FLYER in the lane, bumped and
brushed with the latter several times inside the last furlong and edged ahead in time. ARCH FLYER contested the pace just off the inside, angled in some
nearing the three-furlong marker, fought gamely through the stretch, exchanging bumps and brushes with MISS LEARJET the final eighth but had to settle
for second. MIZ CLIPPER fractious in her stall, broke through her gate before the start, was reloaded, raced in contention once the race began, was
between rivals on the turn and rallied belatedly outside MISS LEARJET deep stretch. HOLD THE SPENDING was prominent in the second flight outside
rivals, came four wide into the stretch then could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. KIANA'S LOVE shuffled back at the start, was moved to
the inside, advanced along the rail, was checked when her path narrowed nearing the three-furlong marker, stayed along the rail and was closing the gap
deep stretch. TEMPLUNA chased from inside, angled out widest at the top of the lane and found best stride too late. The rider of KIANA'S LOVE lodged an
objection alleging interference from ARCH FLYER and MISS LEARJET into the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that foul claim.

ROAD GAME stalked the pace for more than a half mile, took over three wide when let out on the second bend then steadily opened up under a drive
through the stretch. ZARMAE shared the lead in hand from inside, did not stay with ROAD GAME nearing the end of six furlongs, angled outside the latter
upper stretch and proved clearly second best. LEMON BLITZ without early speed, though hustled along from outside, angled inside on the second turn,
picked up his pace, took over third upper stretch then could only hold his position late. CAMPAIGN SPY displayed early speed just outside ZARMAE but
began to wear down before finishing six furlongs. JOEY B chased from just inside LEMON BLITZ on the backstretch, closed the gap from path four on the
second bend, fanned out further for the stretch run and leveled off. TOCCETIVE JAC was soon well back and failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
CACHACO was encouraged to the early lead then allowed to relax, asked again leaving the bend and drew away from the rest in the stretch while kept to
task to the final yards. CLEVER BOY chased from outside, was three to five wide taking the turn, rallied in the lane to gain second inside the final furlong
then could only pull away for the place deep stretch. LEE LA DEW without early speed from outside, angled in some to be two wide on the bend, was swung
widest for the drive and got up for third nearing the wire. COPPER CROSSING broke inward, jostled briefly with GOLD INCENSE, raced in contention from
inside but weakened the last eighth. BOLD ATTACK prominent from the beginning, was just off the inside on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run
and also flattened out inside the final furlong. CARSON RULES jostled and forced inward just after the break, was steadied from between rivals while
behind traffic shortly after that, saved ground taking the bend and lacked a significant stretch response. GOLD INCENSE was jostled, forced inward and
squeezed between rivals shortly after the start, raced in midpack early, progressed two wide on the turn, fanned out to path four entering the stretch and
yielded the last furlong. EUGENE chased from inside, angled out for a clear path on the turn, came into the lane behind CLEVER BOY and had little to offer.
MACHO CLASSIC was an early factor from outside but gave way four wide on the bend.

Footnotes
GONEGHOST was bumped at the start, then checked behind traffic, recovered quickly, advanced four wide under urging on the bend, moved clear upper
stretch then steadily drew away under while kept to a drive to the wire. PEACOCK MAN vied for the lead between rivals from the beginning, gained the rail
early in the turn, was crowded briefly nearing the furlong marker, angled out some inside the last eighth and moved clear for second. VIRGA was steadied
behind CITY POSITION after the break, advanced from outside to share the lead, was three wide taking the bend, angled in some upper stretch, coming
very close to PEACOCK MAN, was altered out quickly and slowly yielded inside the final furlong. STUMP broke outward, bumping with GONEGHOST, was
boxed in behind the leaders on the backstretch, angled out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, passed tired ones the last eighth and was closing in
for third late. DRAW THE LINE fractious behind the gate, broke inward once the race began, displayed early speed along the rail but yielded with three
furlongs to go. CITY POSITION disputed the pace between horses, was two wide taking the bend, retreated a bit into the lane, was checked behind VIRGA
upper stretch and continued to fade. There was a stewards' inquiry into CITY POSITION'S loss of action upper stretch. After their review, VIRGA was
disqualified for impeding CITY POSITION and placed sixth.

Footnotes
HIDDEN FIGURE was kept close three wide, put to urging on the turn, took the lead leaving the bend, moved clear upper stretch, lugged in some under
right-handed pressure, continued to widen command then drifted out when switched to left-handed urging in the waning yards. LADY MAGNA shared the
lead from inside, did not stay with HIDDEN FIGURE leaving the turn, angled outside the latter inside the final furlong, began to wear down but lasted for the
place. MY WIFE IS BOSS somewhat awkward at the break, picked up her pace from outside on the bend, came five wide into the stretch and battled for
third in the lane. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN in contention early from outside, was four wide taking the turn, fought for third when straightened in the stretch, was
steadied when LADY MAGNA took her path inside the last eighth and altered in with a sixteenth left. LILLET without early speed, was two wide on the turn,
fanned out behind GHAALEB'S SICILIAN into the lane, angled in for a clear path nearing the furlong marker then was taken in check to avoid the latter the
last seventy yards. REJOICE AN BE GLAD chased from inside, lost her path to SKYVALUE into the turn, waited for a clear path along the rail, altered out
upper stretch and made up minor ground the final eighth. SKYVALUE between rivals early, took the rail into the bend ad had little to offer the last quarter
mile. TRYST CAT displayed early speed between rivals but gave way the final two furlongs. There was a stewards' inquiry into the last furlong of the race
and the rider of GHAALEB'S SICILIAN lodged an objection claiming interference from LADY MAGNA nearing the sixteenth marker. After their review, the
stewards disqualified LADY MAGNA and placed her fifth for coming out and initiating a chain reaction of interference deep stretch.
