LUCY TREASURE vied outside for the early lead, secured a rail position through the turn and held under a late drive. FIRST PRINCE allowed to settle just
off the pacesetters, drove four wide into the lane, closed gradually and missed. BURNING LOVE last away, moved up alongside the leader and lacked a
closing response. CAPITAL CALL chased outside, drove four to five wide leaving the final turn and lacked a rally. FIRST BASE showed some early speed
and failed to threaten. STRONG AND FREE lacked the speed required inside, clipped heels with CAPITAL CALL approaching the turn and finished up
early. BRING HOME STANLEY raced in close quarters entering the opening turn and gave way.

closest pursuit while three wide and finished second best. MOON AMOUR stumbled leaving the gate, was outsprinted to the turn and finished evenly.
DIPLOMATICA fanned four wide in the first turn, chased into the lane but failed to threaten in the drive. STOLEN JEWEL chased three wide leaving the
backstretch and flattened out. CORDILLERA broke outward and lacked a bid. MUSICAL RELOAD steadied in the turn and offered little. VIVIEN'S CHARM
showed little.

EH was quickest to the turn, rallied inside of PHANTOM MAC and was out finished. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER showed early speed inside, lodged a rail
bid then steadied into the stretch and missed. BUCK WEST in tight then was bumped, lost path into the stretch and finished evenly. SNAP COUNT raced
wide leaving the backstretch, raced four wide leaving the final turn and lacked the close needed. COZY BEAR taken up to avoid a lugging in DARK STORM
COMING and failed to threaten. ANKARA offered little. DOC COPE squeezed out early and never reached contention. DARK STORM COMING lugged in
hard in the backstretch, was outsprinted to the turn and dropped back gradually from the rail. MAJOR SHEPARD was in tight then hit the rail and lacked a
bid. JOCKEY OBJECTION and TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider and trainer of ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER against the rider of
