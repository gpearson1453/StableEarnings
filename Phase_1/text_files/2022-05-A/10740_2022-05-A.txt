Footnotes
UPPERCLASSMAN showed the most early speed to gain the inside, made all the running and held safe in the lane under steady handling. MATRICULATE
saved ground in behind the pace to move up going to the far turn, angled through the lane and slowly closed. SWINGIN' SAM chased the winner three to
four wide and lacked a final closing bid. GONE PREACHIN dropped back early and made a mild rally three and four wide. HARDWORKCLEANLIVIN was
five and six wide through the first turn, remained outside and tired. MASTERPIECE DAY followed the pace three wide and gave way. JACK WITH SEVEN
threw his head at the break, rushed up going to the first turn but soon gave way and was pulled up on the far turn then walked off under his own power.

BEHOLD DE FLAME was packed wide by rivals in the turn to come five wide into the lane, rallied down the outside and was in time. WOKE UP WILD
contested the lead inside rivals to gain the clear advantage into the lane then could not contain the winner's late run. SHADY'S TURN drifted out in the turn
to pack rivals wide, rallied back from five wide into the lane and gained the show. GOT KRAMER was packed out in the turn between rivals, continued
evenly but was outfinished for position late. CANTWAITTOGRADUATE was caught six wide into the turn, tucked in behind the leaders but lacked the
needed late rally. POVERTY FLATS failed to threaten three wide. CALEBS TIGER got out in the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
YOUNG PHILLIP trailed early while taken outside, rallied wide through the far turn to fan seven wide into the lane and went clear under steady handling.
THEBOYFROMJERSEY moved up outside to bid four and five wide in the far turn and move clear into the lane but could not handle the winner's late run.
HERBIE settled back off the pace three or four wide and made a mild rally into the lane. DANZ A REBEL moved up six wide into the lane and could not hold
position late. OUTRUN THE POSSE moved inside going to the far turn and could not threaten while improving position. BEAU GOSSE saved ground in
reach of the pace and weakened. TICK TACK MO followed the early leader three to four wide and weakened. PIERPONT showed the most early speed to
gain the inside, made the pace to the far turn and tired. DARE FELIX suffered an injury into the far turn, pulled up and was vanned off.
