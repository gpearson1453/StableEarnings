JEWEL OF DENIAL fanned three wide into the first turn, gained the advantage at the head of the lane and held under a drive. WICKED WIZZY raced from
the back of the pack, circled the field and closed the gap on the leader, missed. BEAUTIFUL CALL stalked the pacesetter and lacked a response under
steady urging. HIGH KELLY BABE sat in striking range from the three path and was done early. GHOSTLY RUNNER flashed early speed inside and gave
way in the stretch.

KENTUCKY LEGEND broke inward leaving the gate, set the pace from the two path and drew clear when given cue. STREAKIN AGAIN stalked the pace
while three wide, dropped back in the turn, bid steadily along the rail but was no match for the winner. RUN ROSSCO RUN moved up closer to press the
pace, but was unable to move on with rival and flattened out. BRADYDABOSS broke alertly and lacked a rally. JAKE THE RAKE hurried leaving, chased
the leaders through the turn, and evened out. SECRET TRAILS was not a factor.

NEVVARE broke in hitting the gate, trailed the field leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly outside into the lane and won driving. PAULIE WALNUTS
unhurried early, took closer order leaving the final turn, and was outkicked. CHARMING VINTAGE stalked four wide, chased leader through the turn and
finished evenly. EXHI KID reserved off the pacesetters early, chased and passed tiring rival late. FAST EH quickly went to the front to show the way and
wilted in the stretch. PULL THE PIN lacked a bid.

rivals and was edged out. INTENT TO STRIKE vied four wide in the backstretch and was out kicked late stretch. ITS ALL ON SLEW rallied mildly late. NO
MORE GAMES circled from the back of the pack and finished well. EVER TRUE sprinted to the front, took pressure leaving the backstretch, was under
