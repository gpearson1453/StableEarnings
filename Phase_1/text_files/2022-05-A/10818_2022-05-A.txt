wire. BACKYARD HEN no speed to far turn, rallied with a quick turn of foot outside past the quarter pole but flattened out while no match for the winner
gamely holding the place spot. TIZ PENNEY raced evenly to far turn, moved up late for show spot in the lane just missing the runner up spot. SMART
