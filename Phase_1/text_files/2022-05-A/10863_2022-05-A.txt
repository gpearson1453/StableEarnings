Footnotes
SHEZA RAJUN CAJUN set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane, repulsed a bid from the runner-up in midstretch and widened under
a drive. BET ON DRAMA stalked the winner two wide, bid in upper stretch but was turned back leaving the eighth pole and lasted for the place. FEARLESS
GIRL raced off the pace two wide, angled in in upper stretch and rallied along the rail for the show. RIDE LITTLE GIRL checked soon after the start,
advanced four wide around the turn and went evenly outside in the lane. RIDE ON BEAUTY tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.
SAY NO MORE was outrun inside. IRISH ADVENTURE saved ground and made little impact.

Footnotes
VINNIE VAN GO pursued UNPUBLISHED from outside, reached the front in midstretch, battled inside EARTH through the late stages and prevailed in a
head bob. EARTH chased outside the leaders three to four wide, reached even terms for the lead in deep stretch but lost the bob. UNCAPTURED KING
saved ground outsprinted early, swung five wide off the turn and rallied mildly. UNPUBLISHED set the pace slightly off the rail, and weakened past the
eighth-pole. JETTIN OUT came four wide into the stretch, and could not make an impression. ASK FOR BODE was no factor inside. LIVING VICARIOUSLY
stumbled badly and unseated the rider at the start, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE
THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FULMINATE sped to the front, set a clear pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. TREVESS stalked the winner three wide, could not seriously
threaten that foe but finished willingly to be a clear second. LUCKY LATKES raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide turning for home and ran on to
gain the show. WAR STAR tracked the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. AUNT NADINE saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper
stretch and was one-paced through the lane. MUDSLIDE WICKED failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SIDNEY SUE trailed in the two and
three paths. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH THE RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC HEART bumped lightly with KODIAK MAMBA at the start, advanced four then three wide around the far turn, challenged outside TINKER
TAILER into the stretch, wrested command a sixteenth out and drove clear. TINKER TAILER sped clear from ASTRAL WEEKS after a quarter-mile, rated
along near the inside, dug in when confronted by AUTHENTIC HEART into the lane, and yielded late and while clearly second best. DANLEY broke a step
slow and was outrun to the first turn three wide, moved out a bit further improving position after six furlongs, but lacked a solid late kick staying on his left
lead. GLORY AND VICTORY was outrun early, cut the corner making up some ground into the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. KODIAK MAMBA
(IRE) bumped lightly with AUTHENTIC HEART at the start, stayed in range for a half-mile, then faded. ASTRAL WEEKS vied outside AUTHENTIC HEART
before backing off after a quarter-mile, chased alone in second up the backstretch, and was finished after six furlongs. IRISH KING steadied at the back
while along the inside midway on the far turn, and had nothing after that.

SNACKSTER stalked the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole and drew off while drifting out under right-handed urging. CHUTZPAH lacked
speed while racing two wide and ran on near the rail in the lane to gain the place. EVERTHREE tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. FUTURE
FLAY chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. KENYA SUN failed to menace while racing four wide. KARATBARS set the pace along the rail,
offered little resistance the winner in upper stretch, was eased late and was vanned off. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
I'M ALREADY TAKEN was outrun two wide to the stretch, settled suddenly leaving the furlong grounds and was up in time outside rivals. ADIOS BABY
stayed in range three wide to the stretch, had a late bid between horses and narrowly missed. SHEZA SPITFIRE vied outside MUY CHISTOSA, got the best
of that dispute and moved clear into the final furlong, then was overtaken from outside by the top two near the finish. MUY CHISTOSA set a pressured pace
while hounded by SHEZA SPITFIRE, could not match strides past the eighth-pole and gave way. RITABOOK stayed close early, then faded inside
approaching the stretch. SPEIGHTFUL SIS was off a step slow, raced four wide into the turn, and tired in the stretch. RUN LULU RUN broke slowly and was
always outrun. CHAPARRAL PASS broke slowly and was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
TAPIT BRIO saved ground behind the leaders for six furlongs, shifted out three wide at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly and collared R ADMIRAL
from outside 70 yards out. R ADMIRAL established an even pace inside, rebuffed a bid from SOUTHERN BREEZE approaching the stretch, moved clear
again through the furlong grounds but could not withstand the winner late. SOUTHERN BREEZE prompted the pace outside R ADMIRAL, challenged on the
far turn, but flattened out in the lane. STREET GLIDE saved ground on the turns, and finished evenly to pick up the last major share. DIAL HIM UP bumped
with BIG BOY TIZZY after the start, lagged well back to the stretch, and passed tired horses. MY BROTHER MIKE was never prominent. TRAVEL GUIDE
was no factor. OVER CALENDARED stayed in range early, and retreated on the far turn. T VILLE checked at the start, and was always outrun. SUNSPOT
was finished early three wide. BIG BOY TIZZY bumped with DIAL HIM UP after the start, and was outrun. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
DEL REY DOLLY raced well back three wide, angled further out in upper stretch, closed outside, was forced exceptionally wide late by CHASING JOY but
preserved and took over late. CHASING JOY pressed the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch, got out badly through the lane and led until the final
strides. UNBRIDLED GLITTER saved ground off the pace and rallied along the rail to gain the show late. HANNITA'S EMPIRE bumped with LITTLE
BELITA at the start, chased the pace four wide and had a mild stretch rally. CHICA BOOM tried to duck into gap at the start, raced well back inside, tipped
two wide near the three-eighths marker and stayed on without threatening. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally.
LARA'S LADY set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. LITTLE BELITA was bumped at the start and a never a threat while racing five wide.

CLASSICSTATEOFMIND broke sharply and quickly took a clear lead inside, responded when set down in the stretch and remained in command.
CAPTURE THE TIME chased after the winner throughout while two wide, could not pose a serious threat but remained clear of the rest. NO NAY
FRANKLIN (IRE) raced evenly inside, and stayed clear for the show. ALWAYS GAMBLING hopped at the start spotting the field a couple lengths, trailed to
the stretch and gained mildly late. LAST LEAF was no menace two to three wide. KING OF TRUTH was never in the hunt. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
NINJA ABARRIO set the pace along the rail, turned back a bid from the runner-up leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. UNCAPTURED
FAITH prompted the winner two wide, bid near the quarter pole but was turned back soon after and was clearly second best. IRISH SAMURAI bumped at
the start, chased the pace three wide, lacked the needed rally but held well clear of the rest. MUDSHAFT raced two wide and never threatened. THE
JOKES ON ME was off slow, steadied early, made good progress five wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty.
MANGORITA was bumped between foes at the start, raced four wide and made little impact. SHOW ME LOVE chased the pace four wide and retreated
through the lane. REAL GOOD VYBZ was bumped at the start, raced three wide and was through after a half. MILENITA had brief speed inside.
