SMART TRIAL broke alertly and controlled the pace, repelled a challenge approaching the stretch, moved clear again under a left handed whip and lasted.
MINISTRY OF ART broke a step slowly then moved up inside, faded on the turn despite urging, came again, angled out in the stretch but was too late.
RECKLESSNESS dropped back early, raced wide throughout was put to a drive but could only made a gradual gain. IRISH TUFF settled outside, moved
after the winner on the turn then weakened in the lane. POWERFUL MAN lacked speed inside, moved out in the stretch and lacked a rally.

WAY TOO SMARTE trailed to the stretch, angled out advancing and rallied past the trio of pacesetters with a strong late bid. LIPLINER quickly sprinted
clear, vied through the turn, moved clear in midstretch but could not hold off the winner while finishing willingly. LET'S SKEDADDLE was outrun early in the
two path, was carried out and fanned extremely wide into the lane, was straightened and closed strongly too late. OFF RAMP prompted the pace three
wide, dueled on the turn, continued gamely but was outfinished in the late stages. CHROME ATTACK forced the pace outside, vied between rivals on the
turn and tired. DREAM MUSIC saved ground off the pace, swung wide into the stretch and flattened out. The race was hand timed due to a timer
malfunction.

TALE OF THE NILE settled well behind, advanced inside on the turn, swung out very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and wore down the leader in
the final sixteenth. SIRCORRI dueled along the rail with a pair of challengers, shook loose in the stretch then weakened slightly in the late stages. OUR
THOMAS dropped back after the start then closed with good energy too late. LONG STATION lacked speed chasing wide then passed fading rivals through
the stretch. W W KAN DO prompted the pace three wide then came up empty in the stretch. POWER CRY was reserved behind the dueling leaders but
lacked a rally when asked. WILLOW RIDGE alternated for the advantage between rivals then gave way through the stretch.

STACK SHACK well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid three under a rating hold on the turn, took over wide in the lane and drew off under steady
handling. APRIL'S GEM was far behind in the opening half mile, angled out in the stretch and closed strongly while no threat to the winner. SUNDAY
SCHEMING lacked speed, advanced wide on the turn, moved extremely wide into the stretch and continued willingly. RANK AND FILE saved ground off the
pace and flattened out through the stretch. HONEY MUG engaged in a heated duel outside, led briefly midway on the turn then faded in the stretch. BLUES
MARY dueled along the inside to midway on the turn and gave way readily. PRINCESS CORA was injured during the gate load and was ordered scratched

moderate pressure. SMUGGLER'S GHOST outrun early, advanced very wide on the turn and through the stretch rallying. TWIRLING ROSES prompted the
winner inside briefly, lost position into the far turn, bid inside to the stretch and closed well angling out. HATCHET CREEK broke alertly, engaged the winner
on the turn, angled inside the winner in midstretch and flattened out. NYOMAN moved up in tight between rivals into the far turn and finished willingly. THE

OEUVRE stalked the pace outside, bid easily to the front at the top of the stretch, repelled inside rival and pulled away handily while never put to the whip.
STORMY EMPIRE lacked speed, began advancing on the turn and was just up for the place. LONG TALL WOMAN quickly took control inside, resisted
when challenged near the quarter pole, continued gamely but weakened in the final furlong. QUILTING PARTY saved ground off the pace, faded on the turn
and lacked a rally. SHE'S A BIG STAR lagged far behind then caught a fading opponent late. I DON'T KNOW MARGO flashed speed in the two path and
was finished by the three eighths pole.

BIG IF TRUE set an uncontested pace in hand, widened when ready on the final turn, maintained a safe margin and prevailed under mild urging. ERIN'S
ENTHUSIASM stalked the pacesetter three wide, bid on the final turn but proved no match for the winner while second best. MAYSTART raced close up
under a rating hold, bid inside on the final turn then weakened in the stretch. WILDWOOD MAGGIE trailed early saving ground then passed rivals without
menacing. KIMBERLY FRANCES saved ground within striking range and lacked a rally. SEAWARD chased outside off the leaders and was finished by the
far turn. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE was reserved well behind and always outrun. SUMMER BELLE dropped back outside after an alert start and gave way
losing contact with her field.
