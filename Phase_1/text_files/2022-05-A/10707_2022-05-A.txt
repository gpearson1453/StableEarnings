BAYTOWN JAKESTER set a pressured pace, drew clear toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to late stretch.
BELMULLET gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in through the final furlong and took second later yards. BALTIMORE BUD chased outside,
rounded the turn five wide and came along for third the final strides. ABHAR drifted outward across the path of POLITICAL DECISION approaching the
three eighths pole while giving close early chase, but dropped back into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. The latter was pinched back at the heels
of Abhar nearing the three eighths pole, quickly recovered stride and rounded the turn about the four path, angled widest into the stretch and finished well.
ABOUT TO RAGE chased, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Abhar, lodged
by the rider of Political Decision, and disqualified the former to fifth place for shutting off the latter nearing the three eighths pole.

the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. MISSIONSNINETYNINE had a brief early lead inside then stalked, challenged nearing the three
eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths and had to settle for second best. PLAYBOY ROY lunged from the gate then saved ground, bid
toward the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and raced evenly to late stretch. BOP MARLEY settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. MOUNTAIN TIME raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn.

HUMPTY GRUMPTY rounded the first turn in the five path then stalked leaving the turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, drew to even terms midway on the far
turn, drifted toward the head of the lane but recovered the edge mid-stretch and dug in all out to hold on. PENGUIN PARADE bobbled at the break then
saved ground and raced boxed in past the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the four
path into the stretch, dug in for second later yards and was a game late threat. STORMIN ROCKET stalked the early pace two deep, took the lead between
horses past the half mile pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn, gave up the advantage mid-stretch then flattened later yards. MASTER THIS
settled off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, altered course
in the upper stretch and finished evenly. STRONG LIL KOKORO drifted into the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn, angled in at the eighth pole then flattened later yards. BRIGHT DAWN saved early ground then eased
outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and showed little more. CROSSTHEBAY
rounded the first turn in the four path, took a brief lead into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but gave way on the far turn. CATFISH
set the early pace inside, was caught entering the backstretch, gave chase from that point but weakened past the five sixteenths pole.

WIZARD OF ODDS was hustled early on to press the pace, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and took over the final
yards. FIT BUT FAT contested the pace from the start and took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in through the
stretch but was caught in the final yards. NAUTICAL WARRIOR chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. SHACKLED
pressured the pace through most of the backstretch but dropped back approaching the quarter pole, ran in the three path of the turn and flattened stride.
CATONSVILLE engaged in close early chase, ran in the four path of the turn and showed little more. OWEN'S WAY was never a factor.
