Footnotes
DISTORTED SECRETS prompted the early pace off the inside, shook clear of the other speed midway on the final turn, remained clear past the furlong
marker, drifted out late under a left handed crop, enough left to last. BURROW DOWN in a bit tight along the rail first turn, fell back, advanced toward the
inside second bend, moved out for the drive, closed the gap on the winner late while being floated out by that at the wire. QUALITY CHROME in the second
flight while between horses onto the backstretch, moved closer in the three path far turn, roused entering the stretch, failed to sustain that advance through
the stretch. AUTOSTRADA five wide when within striking distance into the first turn, raced three wide through the second turn when going one paced,
continued evenly through the stretch. MISS WOW WOW lagged well back while saving ground, moved out three wide when making a mild advance late in
the final turn, continued to improve position a bit while never a serious threat. MAKEMEBELIEVE last to leave, in the second flight while three wide through
the first turn, continued back, lacked response in the drive. PURRFECT MISTRESS broke on top, set the early pace off the inside, dueled inside the winner
the middle half, gave way in the final turn. CADILLAC LADY fractious prior to the start, raced forwardly early, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
VIOLENT PASS broke alertly, showed the way from the start, continued to set the pace into the lane, held sway to the wire being kept to task.
UNEMBELLISHED forwardly placed outside the winner, moved closest to that one for the drive, proved no match late, second best. MY LITTLE TIPSY
chased the winner from the outside, continued to pressure that one through the turn, fell back off that same rival when straightened for home, drifted in to
float the runner up toward the rail, remained clear of the others. FUNANDFUNNY in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground into the
stretch, steered out midway down the stretch, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. DOC IRWIN void of speed inside, moved out a bit then back to the
inside turning for home, slight improvement through the stretch while not posing a serious threat. BRODY BOUCHER void of speed while racing three wide,
continued in the three path turn, also bettered his position through the stretch while not proving dangerous. BOLD MINISTER in mid pack while racing
outside, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing punch. HARD TO PARK off a step slow, raced four wide through the turn, passed some tiring rivals
while never a threat. BRASKA also away slowly, made little impact while racing in the two path. THE HEAT IS ON fell back after the start, raced off the
inside, four to five wide exiting the turn, widest drive, no closing response. MAJOR CHANCE tired while saving ground through most of the turn. DANCING
COSSACK in mid pack while between foes, gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
HAPPYMAC broke on top, stalked the two leaders from the three path, ranged up to challenge late in the turn, clear into the lane, extended that advantage
under token pressure to win ridden out. ESPIONAGE back off the pace while racing outside, moved closer four wide late in the turn, proved no match
through the lane, remained clear for the place. CHARLIECANDO broke back, lacked speed while saving ground into the turn, steered out three wide for the
drive, late interest to be clear for the show and while getting to the runner up. MARVIN a bit restless in the gate prior to the break, away well, dueled up front
along the inside, was beginning to tire late in the turn when in tight and steadily along the rail, continued to give way. TIZ MCNAMARA bobbled at the start
to be off a length slow, raced back and off the inside, came four wide for the drive, lacked a serious closing kick. THE FEATURE dueled up front in the two
path, gave way when headed by the winner between foes turning for home. THE ROCK SAYS in the second flight early toward the inside, angled out to be
four wide for the drive, faded. WIPE THE SLATE fell back to trail after the start, showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
DECISION MAKER outrun for six furlongs, angled out sharply to be six wide turning for home, challenged the leader on the outside late, fully extended to
prove narrowly best. KERSHAW back off the pace and the inside, ranged up four wide to challenge turning for home, put a head in front nearing the furlong
marker, led late, proved stubborn in the final strides to narrowly miss. TRUCULENT prompted the issue while off the inside early, fell back off the dueling
leaders the middle half mile, came three wide for the drive, bid past the furlong marker between rivals, lacked a late punch in finishing up best of the rest.
MARKET ANALYSIS stumbled at the start, recovered to race within striking distance firmly in hand, came four wide into the stretch, lacked a significant
closing response while remaining out in the strip. BOURBON FRONTIER broke in sharply forcing his rider to take up, rank then was used to make the front
before a quarter while four wide, dueled the middle half then weakened through the stretch. ROAMING UNION broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the
inside the middle half, gave way in the drive.

WARNING LABEL allowed the pace to go early, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, long duel to the wire, proved narrowly best in game
fashion. AUX ARCS dueled early, chased the other speed into the turn, advanced to rebid while between foes turning for home, dueled inside the winner
past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. HIGHTAIL COWBOY bumped with LOU'S ARROW just after the start, settled in the run up the
backstretch in the second flight, came four wide into the stretch, staged a modest rally to be clear for the show, no match for the top two. LOU'S ARROW
bumped just after the break, raced mid pack well out in the strip, came five to six wide out of the turn, went evenly the final furlong. POINT BLANK in the
main body well off the early pace, saved some ground turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. BOTANY behind the pace, three wide into the
lane, had little left for the stretch run. OTHER TIMES broke in pushing FULL BUCK MOON into the gap, void of speed, improved position without posing a
threat. HOWL YEAH saved ground to no avail. UNCLE O. G. balked at loading, three out to four wide late in the turn, tired from early efforts. MAMMOTH
SPRING broke sharp, dueled early outside the runner up, shook well clear before a quarter, stopped. FULL BUCK MOON pushed into gap at the start,
remained always back. TAYLOR TOWN off a step slow, was finished early.

DEFLATER lurked inside behind the dueling leaders, moved out and ranged up to challenge three wide and outside that pair entering the stretch, extended
drive to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. CHARCO dueled up front for a half in the two path, put that rival away just as the winner was
challenging entering the stretch, raced on equal terms with that one past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly. LONG TERM THINKING mid pack
while racing off the inside, crept a bit closer turning for home, dropped inside past the furlong marker, late bid inside the top two along the rail, not enough in
the final strides. YOU VEE CEE in the second flight outside, came three to four wide out of the turn, went flat through the stretch. SEICHE broke back,
lagged well back for a half, swung four wide when continuing to trail into the lane, improved position down the middle of the strip with some belated interest.
STORMIN HONGKONG lacked speed came three wide and between horses into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. CAVE RUN fell back, three out to four
wide late in the turn, also remained back. BEAR ALLEY off a step slow, finished early while saving ground. OVERTAXED dueled for a half along the inside,
stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
DR JACK behind the pace while saving ground through the first turn, moved closer up the rail late backstretch, traffic far turn, split foes with a quarter
remaining, challenged inside the furlong marker, wore that rival down under steady handling. MANHATTAN UP prompted the pace off the inside, advanced
and took over to be clear midway on the final turn, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner then
could not keep pace late, held sway for the place. ARRIVAL void of speed, tucked inside first turn, continued to save ground through the second turn, closed
some group up the rail to be getting to the winner late. WARTIME HERO in the second flight early while off the inside, raced three wide and within striking
distance through the second turn, came up empty for the drive. ENGLANDER broke on top, showed the way through the first turn in the two path, continued
just off the inside up the backstretch and into the far turn, headed by the winner soon after, moved inside continued to tire through the lane. RESTORING
HOPE in tight, checked up into the first turn, moved out to be three wide onto the backstretch, four wide second turn, came empty. A. K. SAFARI bumped
between foes entering the first turn, raced in mid pack and in the two path, had little for the drive. SOUTHERNER five wide into the first turn, moved to be
four wide onto the backstretch, four to three wide in the second turn, also tired in the lane. SAQEEL off strides into the first turn three wide, continued back,
four wide second, no response stretch. GALACTIC EMPIRE four wide into the first turn, four wide again when giving way in the second turn, trailed home.

apply pressure up the backstretch, challenged between horses through the final turn, flattened out in the drive. V. I. P. WHO void of speed, saved ground
through the second turn, continued up the rail through the lane, gaining for the show spot late. LUCK OF THE DRAW forwardly placed while four wide

Footnotes
HEART RHYTHM off a step slow, remained back while four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane, shifted out a bit further past the furlong marker, closed
with good energy to be up in time. JALEN JOURNEY lacked speed, raced three out to four wide through the turn, angled in when straightened for home,
inside bid, outfinished in the late going by the winner, held sway for the place. MACRON off a step slow, trailed early in lacking any early speed, tipped out
to be four wide into the lane, angled in slight, showed some belated interest to be in time for the show. ROYAL DAAHER vied up front while racing three
wide, dueled through the turn off the inside, weakened when headed by the winner with a sixteenth remaining. SEVEN NATION ARMY set or forced the
pace along the inside until a furlong remained then also faltered in the late going. LYKAN remained back in failing to threaten. LONG WEEKEND forwardly
placed and four wide into the turn, steadily faded. HOME BASE briefly raced in a forward position while in the two path, shuffled back in some traffic into the
turn, finished before a half.

Footnotes
ORIGINAL INTENT settled off the pace along the inside up the backstretch the first time, continued unhurried into the second turn between foes, worked
way outside, advanced on the leader into the far turn, clear, responded when challenged from the inside turning for home, headed a furlong out, dueled to
the wire, proved best under brisk handling in determined fashion. VENTURE FORTH never far back while along the inside, lightly rated for over a mile, crept
a bit closer into the final turn, challenged inside the winner turning for home, gained the advantage, overtaken in the late going to be outfinished. INDIAN
GULCH devoid of any speed for over a mile, moved closer into the final turn, advanced four wide midway on that bend, came three wide and closest to the
top into the stretch, drifted, no late gain. SOUTHERN RAGS moved out soon after the start in lacking speed, four wide into the first turn, five wide into the
stretch the first time, five wide second turn, remained outside and came five wide into the stretch when improving position, no threat to the top three. MEGA
MAX void of speed outside, continued well out in the strip, steadily improved position the final half mile while remaining out in the strip, also did not pose a
serious threat. SOMETHING NATURAL forwardly placed in the second flight for a mile while saving ground, continued one paced into the final turn, had little
left for the drive. FLATOUT WINNER last away, lagged well back for ten furlongs, four wide through the final turn, improved position while not threatening.
HARDLY A SECRET in mid pack from the start, staged a mild middle move to improve position, evenly through the lane in flattening out. STOCK DEAL
broke back, remained void of speed, made little impact. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN within striking distance in the second flight, tired after ten furlongs.
LEADER OF MEN dueled early, fell back, chased middle part, rebid, regained, faltered. CASHANOVA in the second group off the inside, moved a bit closer
onto the backstretch the second time, nothing left for the stretch run. COAL TRUTH sprinted clear soon after the start, dueled, stopped. CALIFORNIA
SWING finished early, stopped, eased final turn, vanned off.
