Footnotes
EARNEST stalked the pace two wide in the early stages, was roused leaving the three furlong marker and made a three wide bid into the drive, vied for the
lead leaving the furlong grounds and dug in to edge clear in the end. MAXINAMILLION was forwardly placed early on, prompted the moderate pace through
the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took a narrow advantage into upper stretch, was confronted by the winner
nearing the furlong marker, could not hold off that bid and was outfinished while besting the rest. BROKEN FINGER saved all of the ground while settling off
of the pace, advanced in upper stretch but could not go on with that bid and flattened out in the late stages while clear for third. AIGLE hesitated at the start
and spotted the field leaving the break, settled three wide off of the early pace, came four wide on the far turn and lacked a late bid. INVERTIGO was away
slowly, settled two wide in the early going, was steered three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late response. BETITO was away alertly and set
moderate early fractions while prompted, was confronted by MAXINAMILLION along the second turn, could not hold off that foe's bid nearing the quarter
marker, lost position in upper stretch and faded late.

Footnotes
UNION WAVE tracked the solid early pace, advanced on the pacesetter along the far turn, overtook MEDAL ICE in upper stretch, took a clear lead into the
final furlong and pulled away late as much the best. NICKEL NICKEL NINE bobbled a bit at the start and was away a step slowly, saved ground on the first
turn while off of the pace, was roused three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in the drive by the UNION WAVE but kept on in the end to be best
of the rest. TALISKER BAY settled at the rear early on while two wide, went widest along the second turn to be five deep nearing the quarter marker, lacked
a late rally but passed tiring foes in the drive to secure third. KOKO'S MOM settled just off of the rail while never far back early on, gained a bit of ground on
the second turn while along the inside, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. MEDAL ICE was sent along the inside into the first
turn and set solid early fractions, was clear into the second turn, was overhauled by the winner in upper stretch and faded in the late going. ONE BROAD
STREET settled just off of the early pace, was three wide on the first turn then four wide into the backstretch run, lost position while four wide on the second
turn and gave out in the drive.

Footnotes
WHISTLER'S STYLE settled just off of the early pace while three wide, gained ground while two wide on the far turn, continued to advance in upper stretch,
split foes leaving the furlong marker and kicked clear in the final stages. HOLY ZAGS stalked the early pace, was four wide along the first turn, gained
ground along the second turn while three wide, matched strides with the winner in upper stretch but was outkicked in the late going and just was up in time
to get the nod for the place. WARRIOR'S MOON engaged with PERFECTLY JULIE soon after the break and dueled with that rival through moderate early
fractions, took a narrow edge into the final furlong, was outfinished in the late stages and was just edged for second while well clear of the rest for third.
PERFECTLY JULIE was away alertly and was sent to the front, contested the pace with WARRIOR'S MOON to the second turn, lost position in upper
stretch and gave way in the late stages. GARDEES WORLD was fractious in the gate, settled off of the pace while two wide and did not mount a late rally.
TYCHE AWAITS YOU was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the second turn and lacked a late response.

CAROLYN'S WAY chased the early pace from the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, closed well in the final furlong under firm encouragement and just got
up in the final strides to prevail. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST was away alertly and ceded the early lead, tracked FIRST TIME PLAYER to the turn, advanced on
that rival nearing the top of the lane, drew off in upper stretch, felt pressure from the winner in the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win, while
besting the rest. GETAWAY CHARM was off slowly and lacked early speed to the turn, was three wide while trailing nearing the quarter marker, was no
match for the top pair in the final furlong but rallied to be clear for third. ENGEE OMBEE was away a step slowly, advanced three wide between runners on
the turn and was outkicked in the drive. SUPER ANNIE chased the pace two wide to the turn, was in tight while between rivals nearing the quarter marker,
lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a late response. ROSEBUD RYDE was crowded at the start and was off slowly, recovered to chase the pace
four wide on the turn and tired in the drive. FIRST TIME PLAYER was hard sent leaving the break and took the early lead into the turn, was overtaken by
BEAUTYINTHEBEAST midway through the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded through the final stages.

Footnotes
EXCEED SPEED LIMIT chased the early pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead nearing the furlong grounds,
edged clear nearing the sixteenth pole, was challenged in the final strides by the runner-up and held on to prevail. SQUARE DEAL chased the early pace,
gained ground along the inside on the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out leaving the furlong marker, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and
just missed for the win, while besting the rest. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER settled off of the early pace, was steered three then four wide into the drive, could not
reel in the top pair in the late going but made a good late rally for show. R M C HOOK'EM engaged with LOVE MY JIMMY after the break and contested the
decent pace with that rival, continued that duel into upper stretch, could not hold off the winner leaving the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late
stages. COPPER HALO was void of early speed, saved ground while trailing through the turn and lacked a late response. LOVE MY JIMMY was sent after
a good beginning, contested the decent pace with R M C HOOK'EM through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and faded in the drive.

SIMPLY PERFECT tracked the solid early pace through the turn, was roused leaving the bend, closed on the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker,
overhauled GEMMA ROYAL leaving the eighth pole and pulled away in the end as much the best. PULPIT SINGER settled off the early pace, advanced two
wide in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final stages but rallied in the end to secure second in a close finish for the minor awards.
CLOCHARD STREET settled off of the solid early pace, gained ground three wide into the drive, was outkicked in the late stages and just held for third.
OYSTER SHOOTER broke out and was off slowly, lacked early speed while three wide on the turn, rallied in the drive and just missed for third. SLEW OF
FASHION was void of early speed while saving ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch but could not go on with that bid and finished evenly in
the drive, while just missing for third. GEMMA ROYAL broke alertly and was hard sent to set the pace, drew to a clear lead along the turn while setting
reasonably quick fractions, was collared by the winner nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. MERGIE TROID was squeezed at the start
and was away slowly, lacked early speed while trailing, was steered four wide into the drive, dove to the inside for the late stages and did not mount a late
rally.

RICH WARRIOR settled just off of the early pace while two wide on the first turn, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, made a quick move to
overtake the leading pair into the stretch, drew away in the final stages and was geared down at the wire. LOVE OF THE SPORT saved ground while
settling off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, continued that bid two wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner in the drive
but made a steady gain in the end to best the rest. PIVOTAL FEVER was away alertly and was sent to the front, set solid early fractions through the
half-mile marker, was engaged by RIVIERA CHAMP into the second turn, battled with that one to the quarter marker, was quickly passed by the winner in
upper stretch and gave way in the drive while clear for third. RIVIERA CHAMP was prominent early on, was just off of the pace while four wide on the first
turn, advanced on the pacesetter to press the solid fractions into the far turn, was overhauled by the winner in upper stretch and gave way in the end.
LOVER BOY TOM was bumped at the start and away slowly, was unhurried while trailing through the backstretch run, improved position on the second turn
but did not mount a bid in the drive. JUST A COMMAND settled three wide off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, dropped back while
three wide path along the second turn and lacked a late response. NATIONWIDE PRIDE settled four wide just off of the early pace, gained ground along the
backstretch run, retreated along the far turn and gave out in the late stages.

Footnotes
BOURBONWITHATWIST was up close in the early stages, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted AMANOFMYSTATURE in upper
stretch, could not completely shake free from that stubborn rival until the final sixteenth and drew clear in the end. REFI NOW was crowded at the start and
off a bit slowly, recovered to chase the pace three wide through the turn, was outkicked by the winner in the stretch run but kept on to secure the place.
AMANOFMYSTATURE was away alertly and was sent to the front, set contested fractions through the turn, was confronted by the winner at the top of the
lane, battled against that foe's bid through the stretch but relented in the end, and was just edged out for second. TIME IS GONE chased the pace outside
of rivals and finished evenly in the drive. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE was pinballed at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, chased from the rear
through the turn and did not mount a late rally. FULL OF LIFE was hustled leaving the break, contested the early pace to the turn, lost position while two
wide nearing the quarter marker and faded through the drive.

Footnotes
CITY GLITTER chased the early pace to the turn, improved position two wide nearing the quarter pole, continued that bid in upper stretch, closed fast in the
final furlong, confronted the runner-up nearing the sixteenth marker, battled against that game rival and dug in to prevail. MINER'S MELODY tracked the
early pace to the turn, improved position while two wide nearing the quarter marker, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch and edged to a clear lead
leaving the furlong grounds, was confronted by the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, gamely battled against that bid but was bested in the end, while well
clear of the rest for second. RIVIERA SUNRISE chased the pace from the midflight, tipped out two wide for the drive, was no match for the top pair in the
end but made a good late rally to get the nod for show. DUBLIN BLUE ECHO was away in good order and was hustled to the front, cleared the field into the
turn, set the pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages, while just being edged for third. HILLSDALE
NATION lacked early speed, was taken outside of rivals to go three to four wide into the stretch run and did not offer a late response. SLUMBERING
BEAUTY was away slowly, was a bit green in the run into the turn, improved position on the turn while three wide but could not go on with that run and
weakened in the drive. DONA FLAMA was shuffled back soon after the break, was angled to the rail for the run along the turn and did not mount a late bid in
the stretch. LUCKY LARA pulled on the rider in the opening stages, was rank into the turn and faded in the late going.
