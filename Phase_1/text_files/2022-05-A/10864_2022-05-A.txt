BETTER TONE unhurried early while settling at the back of the field entering the backstretch, commenced his bid with a strong four wide move through the
final turn, collared the pacesetter entering the lane and quickly drew clear to prove best. Y VEE R away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ATREE OF LIFE in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, kicked
clear of his pace rival leaving the turn, but was no match when tackled by BETTER TONE entering the lane, but battled gamely through the stretch to hold
the place. DR. BENNY stalked the leaders three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail from between rivals through the final turn,
and continued on willingly two out from the rail in deep stretch to just miss the place. A TREE OF LIFE broke sharply and pressed the pace two wide into the
backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of Y VEE R through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, and
faded in the stretch drive. SHOWMAN away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but came up empty in the lane.

THE KAT'S BACK stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, advanced smartly from along the inside midway down the
backside, tipped off the rail shortly after entering the final turn to collar the pacesetter, got the better of that rival entering the lane, and drew clear late to
prove best. VALERIE VALESKI away alertly and raced to an uncontested lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside while
maintaining her advantage entering the final turn, was tackled by THE KAT'S BACK leaving the turn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the
lane, but kept on well to prove clearly second best. RACINO broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. BAKFIRE BABY away well
and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing along the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive. GIFTED
GREY unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, was always well back, and failed to make an impact.

HEIDI broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail into the backstretch, raced comfortably while holding the narrowest of advantages in the run
down the backside and through the final turn, began to shake clear of her pace rival entering the lane, and inched clear late to prove best. BAYAKOAS
IMAGE away alertly and pressed the pacesetter into the backstretch while well in hand, continued to battle for the lead two wide through the final turn, was
unable to match strides with her pace rival in the drive, but proved easily second best in a solid effort. CHA CHING settled at the back of a compact field
while racing just out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from
along the rail in the drive to nip her stablemate for the show in the final strides. SOLARITY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from
the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, was unable to close the gap on the leaders through the turn, and was outfinished late while

LAUGH WITH ME tracked the dueling leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch while under snug restraint, rallied from along the rail entering the
final turn while awaiting room, slipped through at the rail entering the lane to tackle the pacesetter and quickly went by in mid stretch to prove best. YOU
DON'T OWN ME away well and dueled for the lead from between rivals entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide entering the final
turn, and finished determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. DAKATI broke sharply and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, drifted off the rail entering
the lane, and closed two wide in the drive and just failed to hold the place. TEXAS KID was bumped slightly at the start, and raced into a tracking trip from
between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, shifted four wide for the drive and finished evenly. MUSTACHIO
away alertly and was fanned four wide entering the first turn, before dropping into a tracking trip entering the backstretch, continued with a wide trip in the
run to the final turn, and failed to respond when called upon. THE CHANCES R pressed the leaders while racing three wide entering the backstretch,
continued to force the issue two out from the rail in the run to the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on his pace rivals entering the turn, and weakened over
the final furlong.

Footnotes
LITTLE GROOT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and held off the closers late while never seriously threatened. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled off the early pace while saving ground along the
inside entering the backstretch, steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the final turn, rallied smartly from along the inside, through the
turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. WISE MARKET broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in he drive and garnered a
share. TIZ MEOW away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
finished four wide in the drive. ACE DEUCE settled well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
three wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while finding his best stride late. SIR BARCLAY settled off the early pacesetter while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, dropped to the rail approaching the final turn, while impeding the progress of ALWAY'S A KNIGHT,
raced three wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. TRUPON ONLINE unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

STEAL HOME tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly one out from the
rail in the drive. BABY GRAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run to the final
turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off the late surge of BODEGA in the final strides. BODEGA stalked the early pace while
saving ground along the inside entering he backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped off the rail in mid stretch and
finished with a rush to be up in the closing strides to prevail. YOUNG VIGILANTE was slow into stride and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied three wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. DON WITH THE WIND
broke sharply and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and
into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, but battled willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. PAY MY
WAY away well, and dropped into a stalking trip two out from the rail entering he backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond
when called upon. BAKLANE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position into the final turn, but lacked
the needed closing response when called upon.

Footnotes
AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, quickly inhaled the pacesetter midway
through the final turn and opened a clear advantage, was collared by THE ALL BUTTON entering the lane, and while no match for that rival, battled on
gamely through the lane to hold the place. SWORD FIGHTER settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, angled three wide midway through the turn, and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share. APPELLANT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced three wide in the run down the backside, rallied five wide through
the final turn, and finished four out from the rail in the drive while unable to muster up a late bid. REPRIMAND away well and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive. EUROPEAN
settled well off the early leader while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide into the final turn, was fanned four or five
wide leaving the turn, and lacked the needed closing response while finishing four wide in the drive. THE ALL BUTTON broke sharply and was taken in
hand to settle off the early pacesetter while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, commenced his bid three wide through the final turn,
collared the leader entering the stretch and quickly drew clear as much the best. IT'S IN COMMAND rushed up from the outside to open a clear advantage
from along the rail entering the backstretch, maintained a clear, uncontested lead in the run to the final turn, was quickly inhaled midway through the turn,
and stopped badly while not being persevered with in the late stages.
