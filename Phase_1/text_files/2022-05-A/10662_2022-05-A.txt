SINGANDCRYINDUBAI was on the pace inside OPTIMAL early, edged clear in the far turn and held safe through the lane under steady handling.
FULKERSON saved ground off the early pace, rallied through the far turn and angled into the lane but could not get to the winner. JIMBO'S BIZ stalked the
leaders three or four wide and lacked a final closing run. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER trailed early and moved up three wide while not a threat. OPTIMAL
contested the lead outside the winner to late backstretch and weakened. ALL FOR TRUTH saved ground and weakened. COAST GUARDSMAN missed
the break and tired racing three wide.

WYOMING CONQUEST tracked the early leaders inside to rally up the rail in the lane and prevail. PREACHER dueled inside rivals while out from the rail
and could not last. GETALOADOFTHIS dueled four wide outside rivals through the turn and could not hold position. SOUTHERN MOJO was within reach
four wide and lacked a solid closing bid. COLLEGE PARTY was three wide in the tightly bunched field but lacked a final closing run. PIONEER PRIDE
dueled from between foes and dropped out nearing the lane.

could not close the gap in the lane. UNTAMED MONEY moved up while angling five wide into the lane but could not threaten late. HOLIDAY CHIMES
lacked a rally three wide. TANGO CINCO was just off the leaders along the inside and weakened. JOEL'S GIRL fanned six wide into the lane and never
threatened.

Footnotes
TRACK SMART showed the most speed to cross over and gain inside position going to the first turn, made all the running and drew off in the lane under
urging. FRENCH ROSE followed the pace three wide, angled in going to the far turn and continued on to gain the place in the drive. JOPLIN lunged at the
break to get away last, stalked four wide and could not produce the needed late run. DONNAS FINAL WORD tracked the pace outside the winner to upper
stretch and weakened. STAR IN THE SKY angled out going up the backstretch but lacked a solid rally. MEAN ERIKA was not a factor. SUCH GREAT
HEIGHTS was with the lead group four wide and weakened.
