Footnotes
MUCHO SUNSHINE pressed then chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the three then four path, floated five wide into the stretch, gained
to take the lead coming to the furlong marker and held sway under strong urging. THE BIG GREY broke a step slow, dropped well behind the rest of the
field, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and finished fast but was too late while up for the place. SCOTTY
settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, dropped from the two path to the rail around the turn, gained under a drive in upper stretch,
loomed a threat into the final furlong and finished willingly but lost the place while clear for the show. IT'S MANDATORY settled on the outside, was urged
four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into upper stretch, reached a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed
response. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path through the turn, gained into upper stretch, pursued the leader
into the final furlong and weakened. DEVIOUS MO showed good speed, moved clear with six furlongs to run, remained clear in the two path through the
turn, shortened stride under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead approaching the furlong marker and tired. EYE OF THE GUNFIGHTER RACED WITH

VIRGINIA JOY (GER) brushed at the start by LOVELY LUCKY, who broke out a step, showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits over a
boggy course, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and went clear under a drive, then got geared down inside the
final sixteenth to the finish, the outcome in no doubt. LUCK MONEY tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along clear for the place honors. LOVELY LUCKY broke out a step at the start brushing
VIRGINIA JOY, tracked along the inside through the first turn before tipping to the two path into the backstretch and advancing to latch on the leader to the
outside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off nearing the quarter pole and went two to three wide at that station, then tired in the
stretch. SISTER OTOOLE just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the compact field, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, took the
inside route into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
GINA ROMANTICA broke in at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path around the turn, was carried out into upper stretch,
dueled outside of the runner-up while rubbing saddles and narrowly won the head-bob on the wire to prevail. SWEET SURPRISE bumped with a rival at the
start, went to the front and showed the way down the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the three path, floated five wide into upper stretch, dueled
gamely inside of the winner to the wire and was denied in a head-bobbing finish. TAP THE FAITH broke out significantly at the start, settled on the outside,
was roused in the five path around the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch, pursued the top two to the wire and lacked the needed kick while well clear
for third. WATERS OF MEROM bumped with a rival at the start, was well spotted just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the
three-eighths and came up empty.

Footnotes
EFFICIENCY was asked leaving the gate, went to the front then moved in late in the chute, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path
around the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, shook clear under the crop into the stretch, came out around the three-sixteenths then was
corrected by the rider, drew off under a drive into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and was placed under a
hand-ride to the wire while much the best. STRAPPED bumped soundly with a foe after the start then was hustled, angled out outside the seven-eighths,
settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and safely secured the place while no threat to the winner. AL'S ROCKET chased the leading
duo on the outside then dropped back, went four wide on the turn, gained fast outside the three-eighths, advanced to make a bid before the five-sixteenths,
lost touch with the winner into upper stretch then drifted in and tired but was best of the rest. CHEEKY TICO was taken in hand early, moved up quickly
coming to the seven-eighths pole, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back under urging outside the
five-sixteenths and capitulated. CUGINE lost his footing slightly at the break but came out in front, was carried in early then dropped back around the
seven-eighths, went three wide around the turn, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. NEWS CARVER was hustled from the start then
bumped soundly with a foe, moved out while settling off the pace, angled in with five furlongs to run, saved ground on the turn and faltered. BALI RIDDIM
dropped back on the outside, fell well behind the rest of the field, went three then four wide around the turn and was no factor. BALI RIDDIM RACED FOR

of, tucked along the inside through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail.
DEMANDSRESPECT got bumped at the start by PRECURSORY, who broke inwards, chased three wide briefly until tipped to the five path as
JABBERWOCK tipped out off the inside, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for
home and offered up a mild bid. RUN UP THE SCORE coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. PRECURSORY broke in at the start bumping DEMANDSRESPECT, chased four then three

start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. DON'T OVERLOOK ME coaxed from the

through the turn, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired. JABBERWOCK coaxed from the gate, was along the inside when steadied as the leader
crossed to the two path, slipped on the slick surface and lost hind footing bobbling heavily while under a protective hold and conceded four lengths of
ground before tipping out to the four path with five and a half furlongs to run, tucked three wide through the turn and came under coaxing midway, swung
four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
L'IMPERATOR (FR) broke out then brushed the gate while last away, showed early speed from the outside, went around the opening bend in the two path,
moved to a solo lead entering the backstretch, showed the way while well rated, controlled the action along the inside around the far turn, was asked coming
to the quarter-pole, came outward while extending the advantage outside the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and proved much the best
under steady urging. SACRED LIFE (FR) brushed with a foe after the start, raced in the two path while between horses around the first turn, was rated off
the pace, went two then three wide while asked on the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch and finished with good courage for the place. GLYNN
COUNTY bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back between horses early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated outside on the backstretch,
moved closer with six furlongs to run, chased in the two path around the the far turn, drifted out in pursuit of the winner outside the furlong marker, drifted
out a bit more late and weakened then lost the place but was far clear for second. CITY MAN bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn,
was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the final turn and capitulated. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) bumped with an opponent at the
start, went three wide around the first turn, was reserved off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging, chased inside on the far turn and had nothing
left. KING CAUSE showed speed on the inside then was taken back just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole and faltered. STARTING OVER broke out and bumped with a rival, saved ground on the first turn, moved out
entering the backstretch, settled at the rear, was urged four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

CODY'S WISH showed speed then tracked the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader in the four path around the turn, took the advantage outside
the five-sixteenths, shook clear while dropping to the three path into the stretch, drew off while kept to the task until inside the furlong marker then was
eased up while much the best. SOUND MONEY was hustled to the front, vied in the three path while challenged by the winner on the turn, lost the
advantage before the five-sixteenths, moved out while falling behind the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. ZOOMER
broke in at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging in the two path early on the turn then moved to the four path and came up empty while
best of the rest. GREATEST HONOUR was carried in early, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three then four wide around the turn and was no
factor. INFORMATIVE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back five wide early on the turn, moved to four then three wide
later on that bend and faltered.
