the turn, stayed in the same path into the lane and gained place. TWIRLING CHIEF raced off the pace, picked up the tempo four wide late on the turn,
sustained a steady bid through the lane and prevailed for a share. ROCKYMOUNTAIN BREW saved ground around the turn, launched a bid along the
inside in the upper stretch and flattened in late stages. HOOKED ON DREAMS was forwardly placed chasing the eventual winner around the turn then
came up empty a furlong out. SWAMPDRAINER raced evenly near the back. LURCH raced in contention off the top pair into the turn and faded in the lane.
