Footnotes
COACH ADAMS stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied to a short lead, then dueled with JUPI'S LIGHTNING and edged away
late for the win. JUPI'S LIGHTNING dueled outside of POINTER for the lead, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely inside when headed by COACH ADAMS
and battled on bravely to the end. FRIENDLY FELLA tracked on the inside, advanced on the turn, came four wide into the lane, was outkicked by the top
pair and bested the others. POINTER dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. CURLIN'S THRILL raced off the pace,
moved up midway on the turn, four wide at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. LONG GRAY LINE raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the far
turn and failed to threaten. RUNABOUT raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. STAY HOME raced off the pace inside, gave way and was eased up
in deep stretch.
