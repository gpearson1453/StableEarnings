UNION STATION trailed early, advanced very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and was just up at the wire. DOUBLE BARREL MAN settled
outside, rallied to the front into the stretch, moved briefly clear but was nailed. YOUNG BULL dueled outside, led at the quarter pole and battled gamely to
the finish. DINAR dueled along the inside, faded into the stretch but continued well inside. GOTTA GO flashed speed along the rail then gave way readily.
GALAXY BUILDER saved ground off the leaders and was never in contention.

Footnotes
BRIMESTONE KID lacked speed inside, bid in the two path on the turn, moved up inside the pacesetter late and was up at the wire. KAHAAL moved clear
on the turn, drifted out through the stretch and was caught in the final yards. LITTLE PUCK broke alertly and led briefly, saved ground and continued
willingly to the finish. MY MAN LOUIE raced close up three wide and continued well while no threat. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS dropped back early then
closed the gap without menacing. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE moved extremely wide into the stretch while no factor. OLE STUD MUFFIN dropped far behind
then angled out with some late energy. AUTUMN'S SUPER CED lacked speed then passed rivals inside through the stretch. CHECKULATER chased wide
off the leaders and came up empty. CHAPEL OF DREAMS dropped far behind and was never in contention. TOO MUCH CROWN broke slowest and raced
far behind throughout. ST JOE flashed speed then gave way readily.

DRIED PEPPER controlled the pace, was collared nearing the quarter pole then held rival safe in a determined score. MUCH CLASS stalked the
pacesetter, bid on the final turn, reached even terms but could not get by the winner. GENTRIFIED lacked speed, made a menacing three wide bid on the
final turn and into the stretch then flattened out. KRAFTY BOY settled off the leaders, moved inside on the final turn then faltered. DREWCITABLE moved
closer between rivals before half a mile and gave way on the turn. DUSTY BOY dropped back early and raced far behind throughout.

WINNING ROMANCE sped to the front into the first turn, set comfortable fractions while in hand, repelled rivals from the final turn to the stretch and edged
away in a moderate drive. SHE'S GONE D'WILD settled inside, engaged the winner on the final turn, was repelled in the stretch but continued gamely for
the place. SNOWBALL raced between rivals early, bid three wide on the turn but flattened out through the lane while sharing the show award. NET A BEAR
raced wide throughout then offered some late energy to get up in time to dead heat for third. EILEEN ALEXANDRA dropped back early and was never in
contention. OFFSPRING prompted the winner outside in hand then was finished on the final turn.

PARTY OF FIFTEEN reserved off the dueling leaders, angled wide in the stretch and was up in time. RUNNER offered a middle move to the front midway
on the turn, led in the stretch then hung. COACH HUDSON dueled outside, lost the advantage on the turn then continued gamely. HOPE FOR CHANGE
settled inside off the pace and rallied mildly. SCHEMER trailed early and lacked a rally. MAJESTIC SOCIETY raced far behind throughout. MAN ABOVE
vied inside to the turn then gave way readily.
