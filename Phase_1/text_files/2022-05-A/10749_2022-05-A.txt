Footnotes
UTTERLY ENCHANTING prompted the pace outside LAMBEAU LADY, secured command mid way on the turn then eagerly pulled away through the
stretch under intermittent urging. DIAL EMMA REILLY lacked speed, circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path turning for home, remained outside
horses and passed tired ones. LAMBEAU LADY showed speed along the inner rail, failed to keep pace with the winner leaving the bend, angled out in
upper stretch and weakened. GOLDEN ACCOUNT stalked the pace for a half mile, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
SHE'SRUNNINGHAPPY , under a firm hold early on while prompting the pace inside a rival, took over with five eighths to go, handled some outside
pressure, spurted away into the lane then widened while ridden out. PLEASE MARRY ME drifted in a bit while going to the early lead leaving the chute, vied
outside the winner past the five eighths pole, forced the issue outside that one leaving the three eighths, failed to match strides entering the lane but gave
willing pursuit while holding down the place. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , forced in a bit exiting the chute, recovered and stalked the pace, angled four wide
approaching the stretch, failed to kick on from there and faded. HARPER'S DO saved ground off the pace, eased out near mid stretch but lacked a solid
finish. HUDSON CANYON broke outward, corrected and was taken to rate, moved up three to four wide nearing the turn, was fanned five wide pursuing into
the stretch and faded. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY broke on top despite a stumble, drifted in when reacting to PLEASE MARRY ME angling in leaving the chute,
steadied and dropped back between foes then lacked a response. PARTY MONSTER steadied briefly leaving the chute, was urged along off the rail and
gave way. An objection by the rider of BUFFUM'S BEAUTY against PLEASE MARRY ME for alleged interference leaving the chute was not allowed

eased out to the four path turning for home, challenged for the lead outside HUMMIN' THE FUNK in upper stretch, exchanged bumps with that one in mid
stretch, dueled the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. HUMMIN' THE FUNK , well placed in the two path inside horses on the turn, angled to the three path
entering the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch, bumped with the winner, dueled late and just missed in a game effort. SPECIAL FREEDOM , in the
two path between horses on the turn, moved to the inner rail in upper stretch and retreated. MARTHARITA , three wide chasing the pace for five furlongs,
gave way entering the stretch. DIXIELAND DANCER lightly bumped with the winner at the start, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in upper
stretch. FEEL THE GLORY , kept wide throughout, faltered on the turn.

Footnotes
ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) was hard sent from the gate and established command in the opening sixteenth, handled outside pressure from THE
WOLFMAN, was roused clear two wide into the lane, drifted in nearing the eighth pole, kept on tenaciously under strong handling and proved best.
BEVERLY PARK , off last when hopping in the air, regrouped and moved up steadily towards the rail nearing the half mile marker, took closer order saving
ground in upper stretch, eased out leaving mid stretch and gave game chase to the wire. THE WOLFMAN prompted the pace three wide outside the winner,
was under pressure into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. DAY THE MUSIC DIED stalked outside a rival, angled four to five wide into the lane
and came up empty. FINAL SAY , off the pace and off the inside, had a belated gain but failed to menace. MUTAKAAMIL settled off the pace, saved ground
most of the way and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
TEXAS BASIN , patiently rated along the inner rail, found room along the rail through the stretch, gained command in mid stretch and drew off under steady
handling. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , rated behind horses early, moved up six deep on the far turn, drifted in when taking the lead in upper stretch then
flattened out. REASSURED lacked speed, was outside horses on the backstretch, raced in the five path between horses on the far turn, was shuffled back
leaving the turn and failed to rally. BARDOLINO set a pressured pace inside horses, raced in the two path on the far turn and gave way turning for home.
DR. FERBER , four wide and rank the first turn, was well placed in the four path between horses mid way on the far turn, steadied in traffic approaching the
stretch and weakened. AMENDED , three wide the first turn, raced between horses the far turn and gave way. Objections by the riders of REASSURED and
DR. FERBER against PRINCE OF PORTLAND for alleged interference leaving the far turn were not allowed.

Footnotes
AXXERATOR stalked to the inside of a rival, eased out advancing past the five sixteenths, came about five wide for the drive, moved to command past the
three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling while dueling through the final furlong and got the bob. KNOWHOWIKNOW rushed clear early and set the
pace, was coaxed along three wide as the winner closed in entering the stretch, ceded the lead past the three sixteenths, battled back gamely through the
final eighth and just missed. NO MONEY DOWN broke alertly, stalked outside a rival, was ridden along chasing past the five sixteenths, remained in touch
nearing the eighth pole but came up empty. SCHOOLYARD BULLY , sluggish from the gate, saved ground while well back, angled out and offered a
belated kick. MONEY CODE saved ground around the turn, moved up a bit past the three sixteenths then failed to sustain. GUNHAND , well wide and
outside a rival into the turn, failed to respond.

well clear of the rest. GIO MARIA hopped at the break, edged up between runners soon after and stalked, was ridden along chasing into the lane and gave
way. SWEET ASHLEY , bumped at the break, raced well back, saved some ground into the lane, angled out then back in but lacked a rally. DATS A

ALOTTAHOPE saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, swung to the five path near the eighth pole, closed determinedly outside SEVEN ON THE
ROCKS and was up approaching the finish. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , outside foes down the backstretch, circled the turn four deep, gained the lead in
upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. ROYAL THUNDER prompted the pace two wide around the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch and gradually
weakened in the drive. FREE SQUARE , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. GALLANT GOLD , no factor,
drifted to the six path in upper stretch. ALL THREES , eased out entering the turn, was three wide leaving the turn and gave way.

ICE RAIN , four wide advancing past the three quarter pole, moved to a short lead outside foes mid way through the backstretch run, dueled outside
GREYLOVER from the three eighths pole and just got the better of that one after an extended drive. GREYLOVER , four wide early, moved up three wide to
bid between foes, dueled inside the winner leaving the three eighths marker and stayed on valiantly. I'M NOT SLOW sped clear early, set the pace towards
the inside, was overtaken mid way through the backstretch, stayed on to prompt, chased the leaders into the lane and kept on trying. PLONDER chased off
the rail and faded. NARMER lagged inside and lacked a bid. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
