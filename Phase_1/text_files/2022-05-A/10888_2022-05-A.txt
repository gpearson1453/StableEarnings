MORE GLORY was outrun early, swung four wide making up ground quickly past the midway point on the turn, swept past COUNTLESS DREAMS from
outside leaving the eighth-pole and was going away under confident handling. QUEEN CUPID saved ground early, moved out three wide at the top of the
stretch, could not match the winner's kick but finished willingly to go clear of the rest. COUNTLESS DREAMS tracked SOL HOPE alone in second, took
over with three-sixteenths remaining and edged clear, then yielded through deep stretch. KATNISS was no factor. SOL HOPE sped away early, then yielded
readily leaving the turn. PATH TO VICTORY was always outrun. FERMINA DAZA showed brief speed outside, and stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
QUEEN CAMILLA lagged far back to the turn, began to get rolling after six furlongs two wide, closed steadily to collar DREAM ADRIANNA from outside 70
yards out and was going away at the finish. DREAM ADRIANNA sped off early inside, remained well clear through midstretch, but was helpless to fend off
the winner late while best of the rest. BRASS BAND was ridden along through the turn two to three wide, but had no real response. SCIENCE FRICTION
chased after DREAM ADRIANNA from outside, could not make an impression under a drive on the turn, and tired in the stretch. DOMINANT JOY was
ridden along three to four wide on the turn, came up empty and dropped far back. MORE MUCHO was never involved toward the inside.

FAMOUS GENT settled off the pace in the two path, swung five wide in upper stretch, closed outside, was up leaving the sixteenth pole and powered clear.
RICHY raced in range three wide, moved to the front in midstretch but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. HOPE IN HIM set the pace in the
two path to midstretch and weakened. UNSOCIABLE tracked the pace from the rail, bid nearing the eighth pole, tipped out soon after when the pacesetter
angled in leaving that marker and flattened out. BEE BY THE SEA was devoid of speed in the two and three paths, shifted further out in upper stretch and
rallied belatedly. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT pressed the pace three wide and tired in the drive. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FRENCH FRANC (FR) followed behind the leaders inside for six furlongs, tipped out three wide into the stretch, rallied to overhaul the leaders from outside
leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. INES'S HATS prompted DOWNBURST from outside, challenged midway on the far turn, battled between
horses through midstretch and held for the place. DOWNBURST set the pace inside, responded when hooked after six furlongs, and yielded grudgingly
through the late stages. HARDSPUN WOMAN settled in midpack widest up the backstretch, came four wide off the far turn and lacked a solid response.
CUMULONIMBUS bumped with MISS KEEN at the start, stayed in range to the stretch three wide, and had no rally. LINN PIER worked over to the inside
on the first turn, continued to save ground and made no impact. UNCAPTURED GRACE went along in the middle of the group to the stretch, and made no
headway under pressure. TORA LORA LORA failed to menace two to three wide. AMBAR was outrun two wide. MISS KEEN stumbled after bumping with
MISS KEEN at the break, and raced far back. LIFENHOWULIVIT hit the right side of the gate at the start, and was never close. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
LUSITANO had his head turned at the start, steadily advanced inside of foes, vied inside down the backstretch, drew clear at the rail around the far turn and
widened under a steady drive. HERE COMES BULLET raced in range four wide, was no match for the winner but kept on to earn the place. MEADE raced
off the pace four wide and had a mild rally for the show. ONE EYED JACK disputed the pace between foes down the backstretch, stalked the winner two
wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. PLATO broke in a tangle, saved ground and never threatened. IL FARAONE was outrun inside. CHILL
HAZE led early and retreated three wide around the turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SUPERPOSITION advanced widest after a half-mile, took over outside FEDERAL EXCHANGE on the far turn and edged away, remained clear to deep
stretch, then veered out sharply several strides before the finish. OCTOBER TIME saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch,
could not reach SUPERPOSITION and was forced out by that rival nearing the wire. TAPATERM raced two to three wide in the second flight to the stretch,
and gained mildly on the far outside. DRUM AND DRUMMER tugged his way up to vie outside FEDERAL EXCHANGE up the backstretch, dropped off the
pace into the far turn, and had nothing further. FEDERAL EXCHANGE set the early pace inside, rebuffed a brief bid from DRUM AND DRUMMER after a
half-mile, could not stay with SUPERPOSITION on the far turn, and faded. BACH settled in midpack early, was asked on the far turn three to four wide, and
lacked the needed response. LINGUINI was never a factor. VOLTE FACE raced wide and was through early. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND
AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF OCTOBER TIME, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
UNO TIGER settled off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied outside of CUY
to deep stretch and drove clear late. CUY set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner leaving the quarter pole, fought on inside to deep stretch
and gave way grudgingly. KITTEN'S SPA saved ground well off the pace, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths marker and rallied for the show. RACE
CRAFT raced off the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the quarter pole and had a mild stretch rally. HEZA KITTEN trailed three wide around the first
turn, circled four wide around the far turn then flattened out in the lane. AMERICAN NINJA was up close inside, steadied near the three-quarters marker,
continued to chase inside and faded in the lane. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT stalked the pace two wide, bid midway around the far turn but came up empty
in the lane.

Footnotes
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN took a clear early lead slightly off the inside, rated along unbothered to the stretch, and remained well in command under steady
urging. YOLANDA'S PRIDE saved ground on the far turn, moved out for the drive and was along outside SIMPLY THE BEST to procure the place prize.
SIMPLY THE BEST chased outside the winner from the outset, stayed on her left lead through the lane and weakened. BRODY'S HONOR was four wide
on the first turn at the back, moved in a couple paths to the far turn, and passed only tired horses. BRAVO ZULU was three wide and in range early, but
lacked the needed closing bid. KATIESDREAMGIRL saved ground early, took the far turn in the three-path, and could not gain. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE
broke slowly and was never a factor. PROMISE ME was finished early three wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
