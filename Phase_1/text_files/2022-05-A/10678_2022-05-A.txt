FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY set the pace racing with a clear lead, drifted well off the inside turning for home, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside of
MACLEAN'S LEGACY and determinedly held off that rival. MACLEAN'S LEGACY stalked the pace, chased the winner on the turn, bid entering the stretch,
rallied outside, dug in gamely but could not go by. THE METHOD stalked two wide, advanced two wide on the turn, closed in deep stretch and got up for
third. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, continued on the rail in the stretch run, had the rider ease up in the final strides and
lost third. FIELD OFFICER raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to respond. HACHACHA was outrun.
