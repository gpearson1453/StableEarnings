determinedly. BENBANG showed good speed outside, dueled with GOLDEN BELL on the turn, briefly put a head in front at the eighth pole, then dug in
gamely outside and came up second best. LANFRANKOPHILE chased on the inside, raced two wide on the turn, gained mildly inside in the stretch and got
third. LEVIOSA bobbled a bit at the break, stalked outside, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and was outkicked for third. DAZZY bobbled a
bit at the break, trailed the field, raced inside on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GRANT raced three wide early, stalked the leader, tracked that rival on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, came wide into the stretch, rallied
outside of OBSTINATE, took over and pulled away. OBSTINATE set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn racing off the inside,
dug in gamely when challenged, yielded and then stayed on well to save the place. MARICOPA raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, angled
out at the eighth pole and finished evenly. CANOOCHEE raced off the pace inside and had no rally. NOT A TRACE tracked on the inside, then chased and
faded. BIG BASE raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. LIAM'S LADY reared up and broke in the air, was left a few
lengths behind the field, then outrun.

Footnotes
STYNER pressed the pace in the early stages, then vied outside, dueled with MIDNIGHT CHROME on the far turn, led into the lane, responded and drew
clear under urging. MIDNIGHT CHROME set the early pace, then vied inside of STYNER, dueled with that rival on the far turn, dug in gamely in the lane but
second best. STEFANO tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied mildly on the rail and held on for third. BOLD PAYNTER raced three
wide off the pace, was bumped by an injured rival midway on the far turn, then closed mildly outside in the stretch. AWESOME LAUNCH raced off the pace
inside, continued inside in the stretch and lacked a rally. ORBERT stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn and gave way. HANDY raced off the
pace between rivals, was trailing the field on the far turn, then was steadied and forced wide to avoid an injured rival. SHALDAG was in tight and checked
entering the first turn, then stalked three wide, was three wide on the far turn, then took a bad step and stumbled losing the rider, vanned off. After a
Stewards Inquiry into the incident on the far turn, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
ROYAL URN settled off the pace, moved up on the turn, made a strong four wide run into contention at the quarter pole, rallied to the front, then dueled in
the two path outside of NO CENTS and prevailed over that rival. NO CENTS pulled in the early stages racing close up on the rail, continued with a tight trip
on the rail, came through inside to challenge midway on the turn, dueled into the stretch, then dug in gamely on the rail in the final furlong and battled
ROYAL URN to the finish. PICKIN' TIME chased close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled past the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper
stretch, then dug in and held on for the show spot. AMATTEROFTIME raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane, closed well late outside and
just missed for third. SPEAKING chased the pace, raced three wide on the turn, swung wide at the top of the stretch and weakened. GOLDEN BROWN
raced off the pace, two wide, advanced on the turn, went five wide at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. IRISH MEADOW was outrun early and
closed belatedly inside. OPTIC WAY chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and tired. OUR MAN LUKE raced three wide off the pace and
failed to threaten. PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL away alertly, set the pace, dueled between rivals on the turn and gave way.
