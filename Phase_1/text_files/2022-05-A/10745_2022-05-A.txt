FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply, and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, and held sway while being kept to task late to prove best. HARVEST DAY tracked the leader through the first turn
while racing one out from the rail, continued to force the issue in the run down the backside, continued to chase two wide through the final turn, and finished
willingly one out from the drive in the lane to prove second best. AIRAFFAIR aa stalked the pacesetter from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied
from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in deep stretch to prove best of the rest. STAY ALL NIGHT hopped slightly at
the start, and settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn,
and finished evenly from along the inside in the drive. ATOMIC HAZE away well, but lacked the early pace to contend entering the first turn while settling off
the pacesetters, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four wide in the drive. ACCEPT NO
OTHER unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, and trailed throughout.

while commencing her bid entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY

and into the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. KICK UP THE DUST away alertly and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort. WE B

MISS THE HYPE steadied along the inside while in tight quarters approaching the first turn, held a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the backside,
split rivals to gain a tracking trip entering the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove
second best. BELCARRA PARK away well, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, raced on an uncontested lead in the run down
the backstretch, opened a clear lead approaching the final turn, and widened her advantage through the late stage while under confident handling.
CATTITUDE tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing head strung, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with interest from
along the inside in the drive to garner a share. QUALITY COMMAND broke sharply, but bobbled slightly in the opening strides but recovered quickly and
gained a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to lose position approaching the final turn, and had little to offer late. SAVER THE
KISS settled off the early pace while racing at the back of the field entering the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, but needed
more late when called upon. DRILL BABY DRILL away alertly and tracked the pacesetter two out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued three
wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, rallied smartly through the final turn, but was outfinished late.

HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position in the run down the
backside, but began to weaken entering the final turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong. DON'T TESS ME unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, was always well back, and failed to make an impact. OSTRACIZE was off a step slow, and raced into a stalking trip while racing three out from the rail
in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid in the lane while finishing two out from the rail.
JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, drifted off the rail entering the lane while bumping with KANDY KATIIE, and was outfinished in deep stretch while holding on for a share. KANDY
KATIE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, was
bumped by JERSEY LILLIE soon after entering the lane, and finished determinedly three wide in the drive to prove best. WANDALITA stalked the leader
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in
the drive in a solid effort.

REGAL RIOT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of THREE DAY
BENDER in the run down the backside, shook off that rival and quickly opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and widened his margin late while
under mild urging. WISELY PLAYED unhurried early, while settling at the back of the field entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside
entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for the place late. GREYTOGO away well and tracked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but hung in the late stages and was unable to
hold the place. MT SEYMOUR broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, continued three wide into the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. THREE DAY BENDER rushed up two wide entering the first turn to press the leader
into the backstretch, forced the issue in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

BLUEGRASS ANGUS broke sharply, and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, took the narrowest of advantages into the final
turn, quickly opened a clear lead through the turn, but was all out to fend off FORT LANGLEY in the closing strides. FORT LANGLEY settled off the early
pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed with a rush one out from the
rail in deep stretch to just miss. BILLS SMOKN BULLET away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage while saving ground at the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, while unable to match strides with BLUEGRASS ANGUS, but fought on gamely from along the
rail in the drive to garner a share. YOU DON'T OWN ME tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled well off the battling leaders while racing one out from
the rail in the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. QUAGMIRE away well and
tracked the leaders into the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the rail through the final turn, but was outfinished over the final
furlong. NOT YET was pinched back soon after the start and trailed the field into the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but failed to make
a late impact. RACING RIVER stalked the leaders two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, continued two wide into the final turn, but
weakened over the final furlong.

DONE THAT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied four wide from the back of the pack entering he final turn, and finished five wide in the drive
while unable to threaten. COUNTESS CAT away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the
rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, held the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and just failed to last. SNOWSHOES settled
well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make her
presence felt. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS broke sharply and dueled for the lead between rival in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two
wide through the final turn, but was outfinished in deep stretch. HEART OF TEXAS away well and pressed the pace two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn while continuing to force the issue, took the lead in mid stretch and inched clear while drifting in late.
WALKINTHEWALK tracked the dueling leader while saving ground along the inside in the run down the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail through the
final turn while awaiting room, and finished three wide in the drive while eventually finding room late. CERTIFIABLE settled off the early pace while racing
three wide entering the backside, continued three wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.
