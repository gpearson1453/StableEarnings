LITTLE BIRD FLASH unhurried early, closed willingly in the four path on the far turn and through the stretch, made the lead late and drew clear under a
hand ride. ORBIT BOUND sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. AFERDITA broke slowly,
moved up three wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then faded. LEWD bore out at the start then failed to menace. VAVITE chased
the pace along the inside and gave way in the stretch. EMILY LANE chased the early pace two wide and was through after a half.

RELISH THE RIDE allowed to settle, rallied determinedly in the five path under left handed urging through the stretch and was along in time. COWTOWN
BOSS broke in front, set the early pace under pressure two wide, drew clear on the turn, maintained the advantage until deep stretch then couldn't handle
the winner. TIDE RISING with the second flight three wide, rallied belatedly. HAPPY TAKEOVER had good position, moved up entering the stretch then
came up empty. THE GOSPEL OF MARK had his heels clipped a few strides out of the gate, swung wide and was no threat. POWERFUL PHIL broke
outward bumping repeatedly with HITE a few strides out of the gate, prompted the pace along the rail into the turn then gave way. HITE was bumped
repeatedly and forced outward clipping heels with THE GOSPEL OF MARK a few strides out of the gate, pulled up and was walked off.

CADILLAC RIDE away alertly, dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, shook clear and finished full of run under strong handling to win going away.
CATMAN JACK allowed to settle, closed willingly in the six path through the stretch and finished clear for second. RED HOT POWER battled with the
winner while along the rail into the turn, shifted out past the quarter pole then faded in the four path. WHO CAN WIN stalked the early pace three wide and
failed to respond. VOLUME LEADER failed to menace. SWEET JILL'S JACK saved ground and was no threat.

got up in the final strides. FASHION FRAME angled soon after the start, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted to the five path and just missed
hanging on. LILAC LACE with the second flight inside, swung wide and was steadily gaining ground late in the middle of the racetrack. LUMINAIRE failed to
menace. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY contested the lead along the inside until deep stretch then weakened. COOL IRIS was through after a half.

Footnotes
DEW IT WITH STYLE sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, shook clear in upper stretch under right handed urging and maintained her
advantage under brisk handling. TV TIZ GORGEOUS chased the winner, drew closer two wide nearing the top of the stretch then finished second best. I'M
JAC'D allowed to settle, improved position two wide through the turn then leveled off. ANIMO STAR found her best stride late. LEONA'S PROMISE passed
tiring rivals. SASSY POWER with the second flight inside, had no rally. SAYHELLOTHENGOODBY had brief speed. CHILLVILLE with the second flight four
wide, was through after a half. HOLLY'S PERFECTION had speed into the turn then gave way. TRACY TARA SCARLET was never close.
