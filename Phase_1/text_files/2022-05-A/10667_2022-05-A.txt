Footnotes
GOLIATH RIDGE stalked the pace, moved up between rivals through the far turn, raced two deep and drove clear late. SPORT COAT was off slowly,
moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to get up for the place position. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS raced in tight, checked in the early
stages, settled to the middle of the pack, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had final winning bid. WITT AMERICA stalked the pace, raced two
to three wide and had not enough. STONEMEISTER pressed the early leader down the backstretch and gave way. REGAL PRIZE was allowed to settle off
the early pace raced six to seven wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. VALDINA DREAMS set all the pace and gave way.
