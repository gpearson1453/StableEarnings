furlong marker and then kicked clear to prove best under right handed crop urging. YANKEE EMPIRE dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid to take
command by the quarter pole, then could not go with the winner in the final furlong while staying on for the place award. ZILLION was allowed to settle early
and was on the inside on the turn, came two wide into the drive and finished willingly to get up for the show award. SPOOKY ONE chased the pace three
wide, came four wide into the drive and was between horses by the furlong marker and finished evenly to just missed the show award. SCARY LARRY was
allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane while making a bid but flattened out late. PEACE ATTARDI dueled for the lead on the inside and
faltered.

MIZZEN MONEY dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the furlong marker and kicked clear to prove best under a drive. KHAKI JACK
dueled for the lead three wide with the winner, proved to be no match late for that rival while clearly second best'. PASSWORD PROTECTED tracked the
early pace from the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive and lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. DREAMERS REWARD
was reserved while four wide early, shifted to the inside on the turn and had no rally. CHAIN REACTION was settled while four to five wide and weakened.
MY MAN GEORGIO had no speed and was never a factor.
