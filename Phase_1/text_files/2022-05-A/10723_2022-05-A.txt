Footnotes
BIG TALL DAWG stalked the pace down the backstretch under snug rating, moved up in the three path leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch
and drew off under steady handling. PASCAL CHANT hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and prompted the pace in a game effort.
GREAT GO GO set a pressured pace in the two path between horses and gave way in mid stretch. EXTRA MEDIUM lacked speed, raced in the two path
on the turn, angled out in the drive, raced between horses late and passed tired ones. HERE WEGO , five deep on the turn, chased the pace and
weakened. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY , along the inner rail around the turn, was outrun. OUR HOISTED MAST , in the four path between horses around the
turn while chasing the pace and gave way. FORT FORTITUDE reared at the break, was outrun and swung to the five path leaving the turn.

Footnotes
AFTERMATH had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled off of a contested pace while saving ground, sat patiently heading to the half mile marker,
responded when given his cue and advanced to the inside of a rival mid way on the final turn, eased out three to four wide soon after and rolled by the
duelers past the three sixteenths, widened as much the best and was only under minimal hand encouragement. SMOOZER , with the pace between runners
around the first turn, emerged with a short lead and dropped in duel inside of KAZU past the three quarter pole, sparred with that one to the head of the
lane, drifted briefly past the three sixteenths and stayed on willingly though no match for the winner. SUPER NECESSARY , well placed three wide stalking
the duel, was under pressure pursuing the leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit into the lane and churned on between runners to get the place.
PLAYING GOLD , four wide early, gave chase off the rail around the second turn, angled in and came up empty. KAZU , three deep vying outside foes
around the first turn, battled outside SMOOZER from the five eighths, held a short lead past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded.
BRETTMEISTER broke outward and bumped with ROLL ME OVER, straightened then chased four to five wide, moved up a bit nearing the far turn, failed to
sustain leaving the five sixteenths and weakened. SHANGHAI CANDY broke slowly, raced off the pace, was asked three wide into the far turn, failed to
seriously respond and gave way. ROLL ME OVER , bumped at the break, vied inside foes around the first turn, failed to go on with the leaders leaving the
five eighths, faltered and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HE'S ORIENTATE showed speed outside horses down the backstretch, opened up on the turn then increased his advantage through the stretch while
ridden out. HIGH PRINT saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. RAD PAISLEY , bumped by SMITTEN
ENOUGH leaving the starting gate, steadied in tight quarters behind IS'S SIZZLING TIME leaving the backstretch, eased out to the three path leaving teh
turn and lacked the necessary late rally. HEARTNESS , in the two path between horses on the turn, remained between rivals in the stretch and offered a
mild response. IT'S SIZZLING TIME showed early speed well off the inner rail, drifted in in front of rivals leaving the backstretch, chased the winner and
weakened. MONSTER MASON , shuffled back entering the turn, was not a factor. WORLD OF FOOLS was no factor. BOURBON AND ICE , three wide on
the turn, drifted to the eight path in upper stretch. SCOTTY BROWN , four to five wide on the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch, gave way and
was eased late. SMITTEN ENOUGH bumped RAD PAISLEY when bearing in at the break, steadied in close quarters leaving the backstretch and gave way
turning for home.

Footnotes
RED MESA was sent from the gate then rated when clear, set the pace two wide into the lane, opened up after being roused in upper stretch then
maintained a comfortable advantage while solidly hand ridden through the final furlong. DIVINE PROPORTION broke a step slow then settled off the pace,
crept up while saving some ground past the three eighths, eased out to move between runners, had to wait near the quarter pole, shifted out four wide and
gave game pursuit to the wire. SCORCHED BY FIRE stalked to the inside of a rival and faded. NOT TELLING lost ground three to four wide and came up
empty. BOSS IS A PAL stalked off the rail, was ridden chasing three to four wide into the lane and faltered through the final sixteenth.
DONTFORGETTOBLINK , off the pace, angled five wide into the lane but failed to rally.

Footnotes
MATTITUDE sped clear early, dictated the pace off the rail, was put some rousing soon into the lane, opened up and proved clearly best while mildly hand
ridden. JADES GELLY , off the pace and outside a rival early on, shifted out to be about five wide in upper stretch and finished with good energy.
RESPONSE TIME , towards the inside most of the way, finished evenly. PROPER ATTIRE rushed up outside rivals and was the closest pursuer into the
turn, chased three to four wide, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. OLIVE KAT ran up on heels entering the turn and checked sharply and briefly
had her rider lose the left iron, recovered to pursue, angled out and came up empty. BUFF MY BOOTS , hustled from the gate, chased three wide into the
turn, was pulled up nearing the five sixteenths then vanned off.

NOTION OF CURLY advanced along the inner rail to take the lead leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn while being chased by SILVER'S
GIRL, drew away through the stretch and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. POLISH COOKIE saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail
through the stretch and rallied. SILVER'S GIRL , outside the winner while chasing that one to the stretch, weakened. LOOKING FOR WATER lacked speed,
raced between horses late and passed a tired rival. SPUNKY ZOEY , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. BESSIE BLUE was outrun.

Footnotes
FRAUDULENT CHARGE prompted the pace two wide and between rivals, put a head in front after a half mile, shook clear into the lane, widened a bit under
a strong drive in mid stretch then was fully extended to hold sway. HALO CITY , sluggish from the gate, settled off the pace while saving ground, made a
sharp run towards the rail mid turn, eased out the altered five wide into the lane, straightened and finished well to gain. JUROR NUMBER FOUR rated just
off the leaders while saving ground, eased out three to four wide for the drive, loomed near mid stretch then flattened out. CHAMPAGNE TOAST dropped
back a bit after the break, edged up three wide leaving the far turn, chased but lacked a solid finish. DECOUPAGE set a pressured pace towards the rail,
ceded to the winner after a half mile, stayed on under asking to upper stretch then faded. AWARD WANTED , four wide outside rivals nearing the turn, was
under pressure three wide pursuing past the five sixteenths and gave way. BEHIND THE COUCH , under a snug hold early while about two to three wide,
steadied off heels near the three eighths, wandered outward a bit and faded. DULCE KIARA prompted the pace three wide between runners, rated back out
of a close spot near three eighths, dropped back and was eased late.

Footnotes
PATRIA accelerated to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and was kept to her business in the drive. M'LADY THATCHER , fractious in the
starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch, came out and bumped ALWAYSINMOTION in upper stretch and
rallied between horses. QUEEN OF MINE , three deep chasing the winner around the turn, continued willingly in the drive. ALWAYSINMOTION , wide
around the turn, floated to the six path turning for home, was bumped in upper stretch and closed late outside horses. VINEGAR VEGGIES , three wide on
the turn, had a mild move to mid stretch and failed to sustain her bid. PRACTICAL KITTY was not a factor. GHOSTLY NIGHT started sluggishly, was not a
factor, and swung to the six path turning for home. BEARGREASE bumped with VIVI MY LOVE leaving the starting gate, chased the pace outside the
winner around the turn and gave way. VIVI MY LOVE bumped with BEARGREASE at the start, raced along the inner rail on the turn and gave way.
