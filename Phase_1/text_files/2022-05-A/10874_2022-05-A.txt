PROVEN INNOCENT rated far back along the inside, produced a rail rally through upper stretch, gained an advantage jumping over the last fence, and
cleared. BICKLEY stalked closest to the leader, bid for the lead inside of that foe around the second turn, led soon after, cleared entering the lane, but was
caught at the last hurdle. CAUGHTMEONCAMERA (IRE) tracked the pace, but was outkicked by an inner rival in midstretch, then held show. AWAKENED
laid off the pace inside, rallied outside of rivals in the stretch, but missed reaching show. MONTMARTRE D'ANGE (FR) tracked from midpack, bid for the
lead three wide around the second turn, but tired. MACHENBANK (GER) trailed and never got involved. KING OF TSAVO (GB) raced off of the pace three
wide, tracked the leading trio entering the backstretch, but faltered. CAPTAIN MIDDLETON (IRE) made no impact. HURTGEN FOREST set the pace, but
weakened between early in the backstretch, wilted approaching the final turn, and left course around that bend, and walked off.

with ease as the rider celebrated his victory. PISTOL WHIPPED (IRE) set the pace, but proved no match for an outer foe approacing the final turn, gqve way
to that rival, and kept on through the lane to regain place. AMSCHEL (GB) saved ground off of the pace, but no avail. MOSCATO (GB) tracked from
midpack two wide, but never theatened. BRIANBAKESCOOKIES never got involved. HISTORIC HEART (IRE) tracked three to four wide, but tired, and was
eased through the lane, then walked off. IRANISTAN had trouble jumping an early hurdle, was outrun thereafter, and left the course in the lane before
walking off.

DOWN ROYAL stalked along the inside, bid for the lead inside of a pair of rivals around the second turn, led from an outer pressing rival down the
backstretch, and edged clear through the lane. BURN THE EVIDENCE (GB) vied while staying wide, vied three to two wide down the backstretch, but failed
to keep pace in upper stretch, and was best. KICKING MYSELF (IRE) trailed, improved into the final turn, but failed to threaten the top pair. EVE'S CITY
never got involved. CUP OF AIKEN vied along inside the through the frontstretch for the first time, but weakened down the backstretch, was eased through
the final turn, and walked off.
