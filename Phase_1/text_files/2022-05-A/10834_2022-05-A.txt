SHEZA FINE JUSTICE inside duel early, edged back while in a bit in tight on the turn, re-rallied up rail and prevailed while all out to the wire in a game
effort. NORTHERN JOURNEY good break outside, dueled to turn, cleared stretch but outgamed to the wire. CHECK OUT LINE between horses early
backside, raced evenly with no late kick. CHLOES ANGEL awkward start, rushed up close to turn, angled out, weakened. BLANCONIA raced evenly from
off rail with nothing left in the drive. SONGSTOPSHELF lunged at the start, never menaced thereafter. Race was hand timed due to technical issues with
the timing system.

Footnotes
SPRINKLEHEAD just off pace to the half, dueled into the stretch under vigorous urging to prevail on the wire gamely. AMBASSADOR MIKE inside speed,
dueled winner throughout, stayed gamely to wire to just miss. SCAT SHACK unhurried to far turn, floated wide for the drive, up for third. POUR ME A
DOUBLE raced evenly throughout with dead aim but flattened out late. LITTLE RED RIFLE no speed from inside to far turn, lacked the late response in
stretch. HE REIGNS raced evenly off inside throughout with nothing left in the drive. NASHCHETTA within striking distance to far turn, came up empty in
stretch. DO YOUR BEST never a real menace throughout. LUTE'S ANGEL had the gate doors malfunction and was declared a nonstarter. JOE BRRRR
broke sharp but through early and dropped back. After a stewards inquiry following the race involving the start of LUTE'S ANGEL it was determined that
only one side of the gate opened thus declaring him a non-starter after an unfair beginning.
