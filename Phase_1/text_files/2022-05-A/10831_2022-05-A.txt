rush four wide in the six path and got up for second. GLENNWOOD never far back, finished with good courage in outside in the seven path. WICKED
WARRIOR close up, dropped back on the turn, dropped to the rail then came on again late. SHADOW TRACER sped to the lead along the rail before a
quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch, edged clear then weakened late. AYE AYE SIR was a sharp early threat four wide then through after a half.

Footnotes
TRULY INCLUSIVE never far back, closed rapidly three wide, made the lead before the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. TALE OF
THE LYON chased the pace and finished second best. LAYITONTHICK unhurried early, found her best stride late. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT allowed to
settle, swung wide and closed a gap through deep stretch. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ had a mild later rally. MARGARITA CINCO failed to menace. HITCH CITY
sped clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail into the stretch then weakened. LADY FORTUNE well placed, failed to respond. DANZA MAGIC
was no factor. MACHEN REIGNS was outrun. MISS ELLIE settled mid pack and dropped back in the stretch.
