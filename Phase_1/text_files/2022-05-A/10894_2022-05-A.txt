OH MY ACHING ARCH tracked the early leader down the backstretch, moved up two to three wide through the upper stretch, challenged the leader through
the upper lane and finished well to draw clear late under steady handling. MUFFIN NUTS stalked the top pair early on, moved up while racing near the
inside through the stretch run and got up for the place position late. CHARLI MICHAEL showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside, resisted
nearing the eighth pole but couldn't sustain his bid to the wire. BASSETT settled off the early pace, raced near the inside at the the quarter pole through the
stretch and had no late rally. CH BERN was allowed to settle off the early going, raced three to four wide in the lane and had no response. VISION OF
ANGELS dropped to the back of the pack early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.

Footnotes
WHITAKER was bumped at the break, set the early pace, dug in late and held gamely to prevail under all out pressure. HUDSON'S TURN stalked the pace,
moved up three to four wide through the upper stretch and finished second best. CANTILLATE settled off the early pace, made a good four wide bid through
the far turn and kept on to the wire. GUITARTUITION PLZZ settled to the middle of the pack, raced near the rail and had not enough in the drive. C. F.
CONGRESS pressed the pace and weakened while racing four wide. MIDNIGHT OIL stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and had
no response. UNIFIED ASSETS stalked th pace and tired while racing near the inside. WORDS OF WISDOM was unhurried early on, raced six to seven
wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. GOLDEN PEGASUS was slow early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a
factor. CAIRO SKY was bumped at the break and never threatened. PUBLIC RECORD settled off the early going and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VALE MALE was forwardly placed to lay up close early, took a narrow lead through the far turn, raced two to three wide in the drive and held gamely to
prevail under all out pressure. Jockey of Cute Dindero Queen claimed objection against the winner for interference through the upper stretch and stewards
ruled no change. An additional stewards inquiry was filed for the break and stewards ruled Bett the Limit refused at the break and no action was taken.
CUTE DINERO QUEEN showed good early speed from the inside and finished second best. ISN'T IT TIME stalked the pace, raced three wide through the
far turn and kept on to the wire. BOSTON MILLIE settled off the early pace, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the
drive. EAGLEOVERTHEMOON ducked in at the break, lost a considerable amount of ground, was coaxed along to catch up and had no late rally. DON'T
LOOK ETHEL settled off the early pace, raced four wide and never was a factor. ROSE OF CIMARRON failed to sustain a bid. BETT THE LIMIT refused to
break.
