Footnotes
ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried early, moved up along the outside on the turn, came six-wide into the stretch, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and quickly
drew clear. ALPINE HYPNOSIS vied for the lead while racing three-wide, responded to pressure and held on gamely during the drive to earn the place.
MILEYS BLUECAT dropped back shortly after the start to angle to the inside, moved up to join the leaders nearing the backstretch, dueled for the lead from
that point into the stretch and held on well in a good effort. PARTY FOR ONE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, angled out to be five-wide
entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. HULA KING vied for the lead from between horses to the stretch and weakened. POPPY'S C
NOTE dropped back early, saved ground and failed to seriously threaten.

Footnotes
FOSTER BOI prompted FAMOUS ROCK STAR from along the inside, responded when asked and edged clear late. FAMOUS ROCK STAR saved ground
setting the pressured pace, couldn't quite stay with the winner late but held on gamely during the drive. STEPHEN JAMES was bumped at the start by
WEAR THE CROWN, then was unhurried, rallied four-wide the final quarter and finished full of run. WEAR THE CROWN broke in to bump with STEPHEN
JAMES, then was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but went evenly late. NATIONHEART saved ground chasing the pace but lacked a rally. TAPIT
AT MIDNIGHT was bumped at the start when WEAR THE CROWN came in and PROUD LION came out, dropped well back, came six-wide into the stretch
but failed to menace. PROUD LION broke out, then was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch, angled in and failed to be a serious factor. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING PROUD LION BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE
ORDER OF FINISH.
