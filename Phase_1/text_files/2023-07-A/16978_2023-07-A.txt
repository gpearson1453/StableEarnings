BOITANO stalked the leaders entering the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch, pulled his way
into a tracking trip approaching the final turn, rallied smartly from along the rail through the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, and inched clear from a
stubborn BAKKEN OVERDRIVE late to prevail. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from the inside of STORMY BLUE through the second turn and in the run down the backside, shook clear of his pace rival entering the final
turn to open a clear advantage, was collared by BOITANO leaving the turn, and was unable to fend off that foe late following a stretch long battle. WISELY
PLAYED unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to
garner a share. PRINCE CAIRO away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. STORMY
BLUE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backside, was unable to keep tabs on the pacesetter entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

LOLA M away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of MISS THE HYPE in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of that rival entering the lane, and drew clear late as much the best. MISS THE HYPE
away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pacesetter two wide in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, but finished willingly three wide in the drive to hold the
place. QUALITY COMMAND broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained her
position while racing two wide in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly two wide in the drive.
INDYGOGOLD unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the back of pack in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the
final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive. ICE BREAKER stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the
rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon late while finishing three wide in the drive. ARTISTIC JEWLER steadied off
heels entering the stretch the first time, before racing into a stalking trip at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid
when called upon. Following the running of this race, there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of ARTISTIC JEWELER lodged a claim of foul against the
rider of QUALITY COMMAND for alleged interference leaving the first turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish.

ROAD CLOSURE was off a step slow, and settled off the contested early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the first turn, raced into a stalking
trip entering the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn and quickly assumed command entering the final turn, and was never
seriously threatened late. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the
run down the backstretch while racing out from the rail, was quickly overtaken from along the rail by ROAD CLOSURE entering the final turn, raced two wide
through the turn, and finished evenly in the drive to prove clearly second best. HE'S A SAINT broke sharply and chased the pacesetter three wide into the
first turn, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, but needed more when called upon while finishing
three wide in the drive. MAGIC ROAD trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied with interest from along the rail entering the
final turn, but flattened out in the lane.

WE B THREE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, turned back a bid from RUN LOLA RUN through the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. RUN LOLA RUN broke
sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, began to advance midway down the backstretch to take up
the chase two wide entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the pacesetter entering the lane, but closed determinedly through the lane to prove
clearly second best. SOLARITY trailed the field into the stretch the first time, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three
wide in the drive to garner a share. BAYAKOAS IMAGE clipped heels entering the first turn, almost unseating her rider, recovered to take a stalking trip from
along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished four
wide in the drive while unable to seriously threaten. SHAMRA away alertly and tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the
rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, but was outfinished over the final furlong. REA MEA hopped at the start while tossing her head
to get away awkwardly, rushed up three wide entering the first turn to take a tracking trip into the lane the first time, chased the pacesetter two wide in the
run to the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into an incident entering the first turn.
After review there was no change to the original order of finish.

EDDIE WHO chased the pacesetter into the first turn while drifting out slightly, but forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, took a narrow
advantage into the final turn, and held the closers safely at bay late. ACCORDINGLY settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to finish on even terms
with SHARPZAN. SHARPZAN settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering
the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing three out from the rail in the drive to finish on even terms with ACCORDINGLY. BACK SHACK
broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished in
deep stretch while racing one out from the rail. BAK TO LIBERTY away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon while finishing four wide in the drive. KLIMTOGLORY
unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. ROCKCLIFFE was fractious prior to the start, and hopped to get away a step
slow, rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace at the rail in the run down the backstretch, struggled to
keep pace with EDDIE WHO entering he final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
