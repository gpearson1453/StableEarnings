Footnotes
LUVAHAPPYENDING was allowed to settle, swung out 4-wide to launch her bid nearing the quarter pole, took the lead approaching the eighth pole and
proved best under strong handling. PERCY'S SIS broke in to bump with HASTA LUEGO, then vied for the lead from between horses, responded during the
drive and held on gamely for the place. FLYING SYLVIA was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly on along the inside on the turn, steadied
nearing the quarter pole lacking room, angled in entering the stretch and then had to angle out nearing the eighth pole when in tight and finished strongly
when clear. BABY MARTINI was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. PISTA GIRL disputed the pace to the stretch
while racing three-wide and weakened. HASTA LUEGO was bumped at the start, then dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
FANNY BAY ALI dropped back early, began moving forward nearing the turn while four-wide, continued four-wide on the turn, split rivals entering the stretch
and was all out to prevail narrowly. STAY SASSY was never far back while racing along the outside, came five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to
just miss. CHAMP OF PAGNE was close up early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. AVANTI LEAH was unhurried early, came
four-wide into the stretch and rallied late. SHE HAD A SECRET dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and improved her position. ENGLISH
MEADOW was allowed to settle, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. PLATINUM PHANTOM saved ground and failed to menace.
DRAGON WORKS was bumped at the start by MY PERFECT TOWN, then raced in the middle of the field and lacked a rally. SENSIBLE LUTE saved
ground setting the pace to near the stretch and weakened. SECRET HOTTIE was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide and tired. MY PERFECT
TOWN broke in and bumped, then was prominently placed early racing along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
SLICE OF PIE disputed the pace while racing three-wide, gained the lead nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. SEVEN SISTERS vied for the
lead from between horses to the stretch, was no match for the winner but continued on well for the place. MO CONNELLY saved ground while being
allowed to settle in stride, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI was unhurried early,
came two-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. WILLING TO BURN settled in the middle of the field, angled to the inside for the drive but lacked a
rally. WARREN'S MEMORABLE dropped back early, came five-wide into stretch and improved his position. LAFONDA raced three-wide and failed to
threaten. RED NOVA gave way after showing brief speed along the inside.

Footnotes
PESO was forwardly paced while racing four-wide, responded when asked and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. MISTER MAFIOSO set the
pace into the stretch, was unable to deny the winner but continued on gamely for the place. SARGENT KLINE saved ground while being allowed to settle,
angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished fast. NAPOLEONIC CODE dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled further out for the
drive and gained his best stride too late. GOLD RUSH JUNIOR prompted the issue to the stretch and weakened. WITHEE was prominently placed while
racing three-wide and lacked a rally. PERFECT ONE was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. AGRIGENTO was close up
early racing along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
IN THE RED vied for the lead from along the inside, opened clear nearing the three-eighths pole and maintained a safe advantage. HOLLYWOOD
MISTRESS prompted the issue while racing three-wide, was unable to stay with the winner, but earned the place in a steady effort. KERRALIA saved
ground while being unhurried and finished in a mild rally. SHESAHEATWAVE was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and then
went evenly late. EMERALD SEA vied for the early lead from between horses and weakened. RED PANTY NIGHT was fractious in the gate, then broke in
to brush with OREO'S DREAM, then dropped well back, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. OREO'S DREAM was brushed at the start,
then was forwardly placed for three furlongs while racing four-wide and gave way.
