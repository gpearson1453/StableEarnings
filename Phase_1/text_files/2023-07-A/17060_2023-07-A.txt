Footnotes
GIACOMETTI sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. FLOAT
AWAY stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match
strides with that one and held the place safe. CITY TRIPPER well placed, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and weakened the final furlong, holding the show. ASPLUNDER unhurried, looped up four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
flattened out. ARGYLL mid pack, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, moved up, then could not
sustain the bid and flattened out. CESAR was no factor. KRUSIN ROCKET hard to rate early, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn and faded in
the stretch.

Footnotes
DANEFIELD tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path gaining a short lead, then drew off and was kept to
the task. BEAR CREEK unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then angled
out four wide, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT mid pack and inside, saved ground on the two
path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, weakened late and held a share. NOTACATBUTACARD mid pack, moved up two and three
wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. HARD COUNT vied for the early lead on the inside, held position saving ground through
the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened. HEY PADRE unhurried, gained position three and four wide through the turn, then had
no stretch rally. LIFE MISSION set the pace off the rail and faded into the stretch.

up for the show. GOOD ON YA well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained, then flattened out

Footnotes
RED PIXIE allowed to settle, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off
late. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match late, while
clearly best of the rest. TWISTED TREASURE unhurried, angled out and looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and
closed well for the show. WINDY CITY GIRL well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then could not match strides with that one, weakened and held a share. RED VENUS mid pack, looped up four and five wide through the second
turn, fanned widest into the lane and flattened out. NO SNIVELING passed tiring rivals. ROLLING MO well placed, held position three wide through the turn,
then faded into the stretch. TREASURE THE STORM well placed and between, faded through the second turn.
