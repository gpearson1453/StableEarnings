Footnotes
STORM BRAVE pulled while up close around the five path into the backstretch, advanced to take command while confidently handled in the three path
midway around the far turn, opened up while tipping slightly inwards into the lane, was much the best and driven out. HOLIDAY FANTASY settled in range
around the two path, lost ground and was under a ride going into the far turn, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, and kept on between
foes to place. CHACHARERO rated along the rail, was in tight between foes early around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran
on for show. NETWORKING bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, received right handed urging from the three path rounding the
far turn, went back out to the four path entering the lane, but finished evenly. DONTONIO bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path,
circled inner foes in the four path around the far turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, but flattened late. ADIOS YOUR HONOR set the pace in the
two path, but was overtaken while along the inside midway around the far turn, and faded in the stretch. GALACTIC JACK prompted the pace in the three
path but gaveway early around the far turn.

Footnotes
LET THEM WATCH set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. ALE'S GIFT prompted the winner in the three path, was no match for that foe
but held well enough to preserve the place. LLAMARADA stumbled at the start, trailed inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole, lugged in through the
stretch and gained the show. FIELDS OF GREEN had her head turned at the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. SINGING SANDRA
chased the pace inside, steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker and had little response. FLUFFY raced off the pace outside, angled to the rail near the
five-sixteenths pole, had the rider drop the whip in midstretch and never threatened. BEDROCK BIRDIE had only brief speed three wide.

AWESOME FLAY set the pace inside before tipping out to the two path early around the turn, angled out to the four path while being challenged by an outer
foe turning into the lane, dug in to hold the lead but drifted out and bumped an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and held on to split the win in a photo.
BIRD WILDCAT stalked in the four path, ranged up outside of an inner trio from the five path rounding the turn and bid into the stretch, ran on to sustain that
bid but got bumped by an inner foe passing the eighth pole, but continued to battle and was up to split the win in a photo. SHASTREE pressed in the two
path, angled out to the center while under a drive into the final furlong, and was along for show. FIRST TEAM prompted the pace in the three path, was
ridden into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. SUPER SPREADER always trailed. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AWESOME FLAY WAS

Footnotes
CHARLESTON WAY tracked the pace in the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole and drove clear. MO
RISSA was strung out at least five wide around the first turn, moved up late on that bend, angled into the two path down the backstretch, took the lead near
the five-sixteenths pole, was collared by the winner not long after, fought on inside of that foe past the sixteenth pole and settled for second best late.
KITTENZEN settled off the pace in the three path, moved up five wide around the far turn, rallied through the lane and was up for the show late.
SEEKINGBYTHESTORM raced in range two wide and was one-paced through the lane. FORTUNATA set the pace along the rail, was collared near the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened. YANKEE STORM broke a bit awkwardly, raced two wide and never threatened. ACTING failed to menace while racing
four and five wide. ESKIMO STREET played no factor while racing three wide. MOON DREAMING broke inwardly and slowly, raced two wide and made
little impact. HOW BOUT DAT clipped heels midway around the first turn and played no further factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
ESCAPE ROOM set the pace in the three path, was roused midway around the turn, opened up from the five path into the lane, drifted out slightly through
the final furlong, and was driven out. ROSCOE VILLAGE hit the gate and broke inwards, rated in the two path, was cued along the rail midway around the
turn, tipped back out to the two path into the stretch, and ran on for place. CASUALLY broke in and bumped an inner foe, raced up close in the four path,
received right handed urging while floating out to the eight path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. MY SWEETHEART DANI prompted the early
pace between foes in the three path, swung out to the five path into the stretch, but flattened. LITTLE CARLEY stalked in the five path, but lost ground early
around the turn, and made no impact. SMILING ELLIE broke in at the start, tracked along the inside but weakened down the lane. CHURCH GIRL was
bumped by an outer foe at the start and always trailed from the five to two paths.

late on the turn through upper stretch, had a clear path at the rail through most of the stretch and was second best. THE RED MAN pressed the winner two
wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and held third. EXALTED CHARM chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. ASSERT DOMINANCE

Footnotes
BARBARA pressed the pace in the four path, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and held safe late. HAY HAY PAULA
broke a step slowly, raced off the pace five wide and finished well. DRINKS ON ME pressed the pace between foes in the three path, took the lead midway
around the turn, angled in in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. SOLAIR popped the gate open prior to the stat, raced off the pace
inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished evenly. ISLAND MAGIC failed to menace while racing two wide. LEXINATOR chased the pace
three and four wide and lacked a rally. OAXACA set the pace in the two path and tired in the drive.
