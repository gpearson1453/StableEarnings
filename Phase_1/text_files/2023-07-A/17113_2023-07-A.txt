Footnotes
JUJU ON DA BEAT gave chase and raced two deep on the turn, dug in under steady stretch handling, took the lead in later yards and was drawing away
toward the wire. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL set a pressured pace from the half mile pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily encouraged through the
lane, but gave up the lead while flattening stride in later yards. VIESTE gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out entering
the stretch, angled to the rail leaving the eighth pole, altered course from tight quarters at the rail in later yards and held on for third. JUNIPER GRACE gave
chase, rounded the turn at the rail, was shut off on the heels of Vieste past the eighth pole, recovered stride from that point but was shut off again by that
one in later yards and flattened stride. PRETTY CASTLE gave chase from well back, improved at the rail on the turn, eased outward through the stretch and
finished evenly. MIRACLE SONDE became fractious and flipped in the paddock, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the five path of the turn then
flattened in the lane. JUST ASK ME pressured the pace through the backstretch then weakened in the four path of the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim
of foul against the rider of Vieste for interference leaving the eighth pole and again in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Juniper Grace, and as a result, the
former was disqualified to fourth place.

Footnotes
HOVEL angled in and saved ground racing well back from early contention, edged closer through the backstretch, started a bid nearing the quarter pole and
improved at the rail on the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and held on while drifting steadily to the outside through the lane. LADY
WHISTLEDOWN saved ground on the first turn and settled off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the four path approaching the head
of the lane and was outfinished while being carried outward through the lane. JACCACI settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
three eighths pole and dueled at even terms midway on the far turn, but was shut off at the heels of Hovel mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth.
CURLIN'S DOVE moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at even terms midway on the far
turn then flattened the final sixteenth. PRETTY SPECTACULAR raced in the three and four paths on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn. BESTLA rated close early, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn.

NOW HOOK'EM angled in and rated the pace, contested the advantage near the rail on the turn and was steadily handled in the lane. TWO ROOM
SCHOOL chased through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage in the three path on the turn, finished well, but settled for second.
FOREVER TAKES TIME chased and raced two deep on the turn, dueled through the stretch and just held the nod for third. REATA'S CASTLE gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path, dug in leaving the turn and just missed the nod for third. BEAR'S ESTATE chased inside,
checked in tight at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride past the quarter, raced off the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane.
CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE steadied in tight on the chute then saved ground. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Now
Hook'em for alleged interference in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Bear's Estate.

Footnotes
DANCER'S MELODY stalked the early leader two deep, took over past the half mile pole and rated the pace, raced clear approaching the three eighths
pole, came under pressure into the far turn and held well under steady handling. VOLNAY was strung six wide into the first turn and left the turn outside,
started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead off the rail on the far turn but couldn't improve in the lane and had to settle for
second best. TEQUILA FOG rated off the pace inside on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and improved off the rail on the far turn,
dueled to take third mid-stretch and held on. FLOATING BY saved ground racing well off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
improved in the three path of the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and just missed third. HIDDEN IDENTITY raced boxed at the rail on the first turn, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole and came between horses at the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened toward mid-stretch.
SHERIFF'S KID raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. MYGIDGETMARIE set the early pace inside, was
met past the half mile pole and gave chase through the backstretch, but weakened at the rail on the far turn. GOLDEN SWEETS rated close in the three
path the first turn, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole but weakened nearing the far turn. SOMMER VELVET was strung five wide into the
first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened through the far turn.
