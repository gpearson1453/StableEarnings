KING ZION was sent to the front to set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead while kept to task. CHERRY ORCHARD got away well,
pressed the pace along the inside, fell back on the turn, angled out, bid, came up empty and was no match for the winner. JACKPOT BOY was allowed to
settle and trailed the field, offered a mild bid inside and was along for show while no threat to the top two. ONE ACE pressed the pace while racing three
across, swung wide leaving the second turn, stopped and was not urged through the stretch.

AQUACAT broke out, settled off the pace, rallied three wide on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead while under urging and held safely.
LITTLE STEVEN bumped at the start, moved up to vie two across into the backstretch, fell back on the turn, continued willingly to the wire, narrowed the
gap and finished second best. ELECTRIC CHARGE bumped and was squeezed at the start to be away slowly, was unhurried early and trailed the field,
went widest in the drive and finished well to earn show. MINING CAMP was away alertly, set a pressured pace to the second turn, fell back, weakened in
the drive and faded. MARE'S GUNNER veered out and bumped at the start, saved ground while never far back, lacked a stretch response and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
KENNESAW raced mid pack, closed steadily and wore down his rival to get up at the wire. GREELEYS ICE vied three across, drew off into the turn, held a
clear lead and was caught at the wire. AZRAEL vied inside, was crowded and steadied entering the turn, dropped back, continued willingly to the wire and
earned show in a good effort. MEDAL OF FACT vied between horses, was crowded and steadied entering the turn, fell back and closed to narrow the gap.
STAR OF KODIAK was last away, lacked early speed, went widest in the drive and lacked the needed late response. DRAGON DREW was taken back
from between horses early, bid inside, altered course mid stretch and failed to menace. The rider of MEDAL OF FACT lodged an objection against the rider
of GREELEYS ICE for alleged interference entering the turn. No change was made.

BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER raced close to the pace along the inside, fell back, came again off the rail and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides.
BORN AGAIN GEORGE pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch, was carried out in tight quarters, led late and was
caught. WILDWOOD SECRET set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, drifted out, yielded grudgingly and settled for show.
NYOMAN stalked the pace, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and was outfinished in a good effort. IDEA
MAN raced in the back, got through along the rail on the turn, angled out for the drive and finished well. KING TITO broke a step slowly, went widest in the
drive and closed well. GOOD ONE raced mid pack in a steady effort and failed to menace. TRIPLE CHROME raced in the back, lacked a rally and did not
threaten.

MEATLOAF'S CHANCE set the pace, drew off for a clear lead and just lasted. STORM'S REFLECTION was never far off the pace, closed steadily, was
gaining late and just missed. BRODY'S FLY settled off the pace, bid inside leaving the turn, awaited room and came up empty when clear. LAWMAKER
was unprepared at the start to be off slowly, fell far back and improved position in a steady effort. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was through after a half and
stopped.
