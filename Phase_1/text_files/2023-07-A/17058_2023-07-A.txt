down the backstretch and faded. WELL RESTED dropped far behind and was never in contention. BIONIC KAT forced the pace three wide between rivals
early and stopped. TREASURE SEEKER raced far back throughout. THRU NOVAS EYES broke sluggishly and trailed losing contact with her field.

FINE WHINING stumbled badly at the start, rallied on the turn then wore down the leader in the final sixteenth. TWIST HER forced the pace outside, took
over at the five sixteenths pole, bid clear but was nailed. TEMPEST RISING far behind inside early then finished willingly to gain the show. STASSI steered
three wide on the turn, loomed a threat then flattened out. ANGEL OF HARLEM prompted the pace along the inside and faded before half a mile.
GRYPHON'S WINGS trailed for half a mile then passed rivals without menacing. IMAGINE RITA hustled to the front in the two path for half a mile and gave
way. K C MO broke sluggishly and raced far behind throughout. MISS HOPPERTUNITY was reserved close up inside then began retreating on the turn.
