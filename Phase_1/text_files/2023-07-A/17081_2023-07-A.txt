Footnotes
RIVER IN EGYPT pursued from midpack along the inside, surpassed an inner stopping rival turning for home, then sustained a rail rally to bid inside of the
leader entering the final sixteenth before drawing clear. PAID IN FULL stalked outside of the clear leader, assumed command from that faltering foe passing
the three furlong pole, but tired leaving the furlong grounds, was caught by a rail bidder at the sixteenth pole and saved place from an outer rival at the wire.
LEVY laid off of the pace two wide to three wide, improved to gain place approaching the quarter pole, then ran on in pursuit of the clear leader through the
lane along with an inner counterpart, but was outmoved by that bidding foe at the sixteenth pole, rebid for place approaching the wire but came up short.
OUT OF ALCATRAZ exchanged contact with an inner rival soon after the start, trailed early on, improved in the four to five path while between horses
turning for home, gained a minor placing in upper stretch and leveled off. ROUNDER lacked speed in the four to five path, gained while floated to the six
path turning for home, but failed to reach contention. BEOCCA laid off of the pace along the inside, then two to three wide and between horses around the
far turn but made little impact. RONITHELIMODRIVER failed to factor from the five to four path. SOFT PANTS traded a brush with an inner rival early on,
stalked along the inside, but was shuffled behind a weakening rival at the five sixteenths pole, readily stopped and was eased through the lane.
DREAMFACTOR set a clear pace, but was overhauled at the three furlong pole, wilted and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SINNER'S SIN broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, sparred for the lead via a narrow margin from an inner rival into the turn, inched clear of that
one at the quarter pole as an outer BADGEBALL pursued, then kicked away from that drifting foe at the furlong grounds. BADGEBALL tracked inside of
rivals while a path off of the inside, tipped to the three path to take aim outside of the leader at the quarter pole, but drifted outwardly while hanging on his
left lead entering the final furlong, failed to keep with the leader in the process and held place thereafter. LUPO'S LEGACY broke outwardly and created
contact with an outer rival at the start, chased in the four path, yet kept on to duel for show with an inner foe in the late stages and narrowly prevailed. DR.
PERRY was bumped between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, improved between horses to reach show at the furlong grounds, but
was outfinished by an outer rival late. ISOCLINE vied inside of the eventual winner and weakened at the quarter pole. WESTERN GHENT chased in the
three path and between horses before faded at the five sixteenths pole. GETTIN PAID took contact from rivals on both sides and bobbled between horses at
the start, then failed to menace from the three path.

Footnotes
DEBOISBLANC bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed outside of the pace setter into the turn, bid at the three furlong pole sparking a duel, forged
a vey narrow margin passing the quarter pole, clung to that advantage through the stretch-long battle and prevailed. GYPSY TALES broke well and crossed
over to set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge from DEBOISBLANC at the three furlong pole, sparred while getting headed at the quarter
pole, yet gamely sustained the war via while battling neck and neck through the final furlong but narrowly missed. ZADORSKY bumped with an inner rival at
the start, stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them nearing the lane and held show thereafter.
FOOLISH FRONT FIFI tracked from the two path early on, chased under urging in the four path around the turn and ran on mildly. JOKE MASTER saved
ground off of the pace but to no avail. CAIRO STREET lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. SALTWATER TAFFY brushed with an outer rival
while put to a bit of crowded quarters by an inner foe at the star, trailed in the two path around the turn, shifted out to the five path nearing the furlong
grounds and moved up. DESERT RHAPSODY took light contact from an inner rival at the start and made little impact from the three path. ALAMO broke a
step slow, raced off of the pace two wide and tired.

Footnotes
DONYA KNOW IT stalked three wide, bid two wide and outside of her stablemate into the turn, gained an advantage turning for home and kicked clear at
the quarter pole. STANLEY MARKET vied along the inside, but eased back while put to tight rail quarters by his outer counterpart passing the five furlong
pole, chased along the inside around the turn, shifted out to the three path entering the lane and ran on to gain place at the wire. VIOLENT POINT vied for
the lead outside of a rival early on, shifted in and put that foe to crowded quarters passing the five furlong pole before inching a clear margin shortly after,
embraced an outer challenge from her stablemate entering the turn, gave way to that one at the quarter pole and was caught by an outer rival in the closing
stages. OWEN'S PLEASURE laid off of the pace two wide, failed to keep pace with the leaders while entering the lane in the four path and between horses,
then faded. ABITIBI tracked four to three wide but faded once floated to the five path entering the lane.

Footnotes
BLING stalked outside of the pace setter, bid entering the far turn, gained an advantage at the quarter pole before inching clear entering the lane and held
sway from a pair of pursuers through the final furlong. SAND AND SEA tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, took aim on the clearing leader
from the three path entering the lane, chased well along with an outer foe while sparring for place through the final furlong then edged that position in the
closing stages and failed to reel in the leader. HAY STACK settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the three path to launch a rally turning for
home, fanned to the five path while taking aim entering the lane, but only managed to duel for place with an inner rival while chasing the clear leader
through the final furlong and yielded late. KLIMT'S MUSE trailed along the inside, advanced while shifting to the four path entering the lane, tipped out to the
six path in upper stretch and ran on for a minor share. LUCY'S CAKES FLY tracked three wide, prompted into the far turn, bid turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with the leader while floating to the four path entering the lane and yielded between horses in upper stretch. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH cleared
and crossed over around the first turn, met the eventual winner's challenge into the far turn and gave way at the quarter pole. LA TOURISTA made little
impact while hung in the five path. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS pursued from midpack four wide, was urged along while applying mild pressure around the far
turn, but tired once floated to the five path entering the lane. PUFFIN tracked along the inside, but only managed to chase around the far turn before fading.
SHEWILLGHOSTU laid off of the pace in the three to four path while between horses and failed to factor.

HERE U COME AGAIN prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led at the quarter pole, drew off entering the lane and held sway from a pursuing
foe with good energy. HOT BEACH received firm contact from an inner rival and transferred it to an outer foe at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside,
took aim on the clearing leader from the three path in upper stretch and chased that foe home well to prove second best. PINOTSLILGIRL broke outwardly
and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace inside of the eventual winner into the turn, got headed by that one at the quarter pole, gave way in upper
stretch and remained well clear of fourth. MIDNIGHT ANGEL chased three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading trio turning for home and held
fourth thereafter. SWEET MIMI pursued from midpack in the four path but failed to menace. TEARDROP TIARA took contact from an inner rival at the start
and was outsprinted early on, trailed in the two path, improved inside of rivals while picking up stride in upper stretch and stayed on with late interest.
INTEGRATED DESIGN tracked two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain position at the three furlong pole and faded. SOCIAL AFFAIR was
outrun in the three path. INCREDIBLY CHICKI lacked speed along the inside, vacated the rail nearing the lane and tired.

ENDPOINT settled off of the pace in the three path, launched a rally into the far turn, took aim on the new leader nearing the lane, chased that one through
upper stretch, yet sustained a bid to drive past at the sixteenth pole. GRAND ASPEN tracked three wide, bid two wide into the far turn, led turning for home,
inched clear of an outer pursuer in upper stretch but was collared by that one at the sixteenth pole. ST. JOHN'S settled far back along the inside, swung five
wide entering the lane, rallied on his left lead to gain show at the sixteenth pole, but was caught by an outer rival to dead-heat for that position at the wire.
ATHENS MOON trailed along the inside, swung from the four path to the seven path while gaining entering the lane, rallied to bid for show in the final
sixteenth, dueled for that position through the late stages and dead-heated at the wire. TIMETOMAKEMISCHIEF laid off of the pace in the three to two path,
then in the four path around the far turn, gained show entering the lane but yielded to a pair of outer foes in the final furlong. DECANTED pursued from
midpack two to three wide, but brush and pushed his hind quarters out from underneath him while getting outkicked entering the lane and chased thereafter.
PEEK tracked two wide before tucking to the inside around the first turn, but was shuffled back behind the tiring early pace-setter at the quarter pole,
surpassed that one from between horses entering the lane, but lacked a bid. AUGUSTUS BLUE lacked speed along the inside, then two wide and between
horses around the far turn, shifted out entering the lane and failed to menace. TESTIMONY TIME tracked along the inside, tap on the brakes briefly passing
the thirteen sixteenths pole, awaited racing room while blocked behind foes around the far turn, shuffled to be towards the rear nearing the lane, then split
foes and moved up. POGOERIACH stalked in two path, then between horses down the backstretch, but failed to sustain forward position nearing the far
turn and faded after exchanging contact with an outer rival entering the lane. TIZ WICKED STRONG lacked speed in the four path, then faded in the five
path around the far turn. ALOHA MAKUAKANE tugged clear into the first turn, met an outer challenge around the far turn and caved nearing the lane.

PADMA settled off of the pace two wide, gained along with an inner rival to achieve minor placings entering the lane, tipped outwardly in pursuit of the clear
leader in upper stretch, rallied to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, sparred through the late stages and forged an advantage at the wire. YES DAY laid off of
the pace along the inside, rallied along the fence to bid inside of the clear leader at the sixteenth pole, led soon after, but was caught at the wire by an outer
bidder. MISS ARLINGTON set the pace between a pair of pressers, cleared them at the five sixteenths pole, but was swallowed by a rival on either side in
the final sixteenth. JOKES ON BLUE was slow early and trailed into the turn, improved turning for home then stayed on for a minor share. CHECK ENGINE
LIGHT vied along the inside but gave way at the five sixteenths pole. TWO MINUTE DRILL broke outwardly, prompted the pace three wide, but faded
turning for home. RED HOT JEANIE lacked speed while hung in the five path and tired. GARDEN BELLE chased in the four path, weakened between
horses around the bend and was eased through the lane.

approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, shook free of that one entering the lane and held from an outer bidder late. SPUNS SON broke a beat slow, settled far
back in the two path, swung from the four path to the six path while gaining nearing the lane, sustained a rally to range up to the leader in the final sixteenth,
but was kept at bay late. CENTAURO set the pace along the inside early on, but was headed by a pair of outer rivals leaving the five furlong pole, stalked
around the far turn, then chased through the lane. MIDNIGHT CHANNEL stalked two wide, chased among foes around the far turn and ran on evenly. BON

horses in the final furlong. POST TENEBRAS LUX lacked speed in the four to five path, but was jostled between horses while outkicked entering the lane
