Footnotes
SHELBY SHORTSTOP dueled with SPECIAL DIVA from the outset while racing along the inside, came out during the drive to brush with that one a couple
times during the drive and was all out to prevail narrowly. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, SHELBY SHORTSTOP WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE DURING THE DRIVE. SPECIAL DIVA dueled for the lead from the outset from along the
outside, was brushed and forced out by SHELBY SHORTSTOP during the drive and finished strongly to just miss, then was awarded the win via
disqualification. FLY PARKER FLY was off a step slow, then dropped well back while saving ground and failed to threaten. SODA SPRINGS chased the top
two to the stretch and tired.

YOUNG LIFE LAURA set the pace while racing slightly removed from the rail, responded during the drive and increased her advantage. SCATALICIOUS
hopped at the start to get away behind her field, then was unhurried, moved up along the inside on the turn angled out to be four-wide at thje quarter pole
and finished well for second in a steady effort. MISS ACCELERATE disputed the issue while racing three-wide but lacked the needed late response.
TENNESSEE MOON prompted the pace from along the inside to the stretch and tired. SHESRSECRETWEAPON was close up early racing along the
inside and gave way.

NOMI LACKEE was allowed to settle in stride, angled out leaving the quarter pole, was five-wide entering the stretch, took the lead leaving the eighth pole
and gradually drew clear. CALIFORNIA HALO saved ground stalking MISCHIEF MAME, swung out to be three-wide entering the stretch, offered a bid
nearing the eighth pole but was unable to stay with the winner late while proving to be clearly second best. MISCHIEF MAME saved ground setting the pace
to the eighth pole and weakened when headed. DANCING TO GOLD saved ground while being reserved off the pace but failed to seriously threaten.
CHEATER'S WALTZ was off slow, then was unhurried, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to menace. PER THE HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND
WELFARE UNIT, MISCHIEF MAME HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSTITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SMILING THUNDER was unhurried early, moved up along the outside on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final
strides. CLASSIC LEAH disputed the issue while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and just failed to last in a game effort. BIG MAMA
THORNTON saved ground while being forwardly placed, slipped through entering the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. BIG FASHION prompted
the issue from between horses to the stretch but lacked a late response. BLOWING BAYOU dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed
to threaten. FEATHER INTHE WIND saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and tired.

Footnotes
LAGO DE ORO saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved closer on the turn, slipped through nearing the quarter pole, took the lead
entering the stretch and quickly drew clear. SUPER CLASSIC hopped in the air at the start, moved forward on the backstretch while racing five-wide, angled
in to be three-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer his bid, could not stay with the winner but was clearly second best. MOONLIGHTNWINE was unhurried
early, moved up along the inside on the turn, steadied briefly nearing the quarter pole lacking room, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
in a mild rally. NATION OF FAITH dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and improved his position. WINTER SOLDIER saved ground while
being reserved off the pace, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths and went evenly. TAP THE BANK saved ground chasing the pace and weakened.
RAMPATIOUS saved ground setting the pace, drifted out nearing the quarter pole and tired. C JAXON was prominently placed early while racing three-wide
and gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
DIRT ROAD RED vied for the lead from along the inside, responded when asked and drew clear late. GOLD CRUSHER was off a step slow, then moved up
five-wide on the turn to be forwardly placed, continued wide into the stretch and finished strongly. COASTAL JAZZ vied for the lead while racing two-wide
and continued on well during the drive to earn the show. HOLIDAY HUSTLE was allowed to settle in stride, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole when
CODY'S CHOICE came in, angled out for room and was gaining slightly late. EXECUTIVE CHEF was reserved off the early pace, checked nearing the
five-sixteenths pole in traffic and finished willingly when clear. COBRA JET prompted the early pace while racing four-wide and tired. CODY'S CHOICE
disputed the early issue while racing three-wide, came in nearing the five-sixteenths pole causing interference and gave way thereafter. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN
THE ORDER OF FINISH.

ROUSING RUBBLE vied with DUSALUT for the lead, shook that one off leaving the quarter pole to open a clear lead and maintained a safe advantage.
SPIRE was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out five-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished fast. THIRSTY KISS
was off a step slow, then dropped back while saving ground, swung out to be six-wide entering the stretch and finished strongly. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was
allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. GOLD RUSH CANDY was bumped at the start by DUSALUT, then was
forwardly placed while saving ground, slipped through to offer a bid from along the inside nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out late. DUSALUT
broke in to bump GOLD RUSH CANDY, then saved ground vying for the lead to the quarter pole and tired. NATIONHEART was allowed to settle while
racing three-wide but lacked a rally. MANAALABOUTDAMONEY was close up early racing along the inside, steadied in tight nearing the five-eighths,
continued for be forwardly placed for a half mile and gave way.
