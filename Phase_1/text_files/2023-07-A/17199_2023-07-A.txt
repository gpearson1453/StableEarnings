Footnotes
PARTY ON took command from the start, put away the early pace rival comfortably two furlongs from the wire and drew away convincingly for the victory
down the stretch. BEARING DOWN broke outwards at the start to trail in the early stages, figured things out at the quarter pole lengthening stride circling
runners three deep, shifted in to the two path mid stretch and closed strongly to get up besting the rest at the finish. VALYRIAN SKY veered out at the
break, prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, chased the winner on the turn, started to fade in mid stretch but held safely for the show award at
the end. JOHNNY GOLD tracked three wide on the front duo down the backside, made little movement to the top pair on the turn and was one paced down
the stretch for a minor share. IF YOU INSIST tracked in mid pack on the rail, was shuffled back on the fence losing ground to the winners throughout the
turn, in upper stretch was steadied briefly running on the rail and could not make any impact driving to the wire. FROST BITTEN stalked near the rear just
off the fence, was roused three eighths from home, offered a mild run until the quarter pole, drifted inwards at the top of the lane and weakened through the
stretch.

Footnotes
SOCIAL DRINKER was bumped outside at the break to trail on the rail in the early stages, smartly advanced on the fence three furlongs from the finish,
shifted three deep outside circling foes at the quarter marker and found her best stride late five wide while on the wrong lead to the wire for the win.
DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE had a good position all alone tracking the contesting leaders on the turn, started to reel in the dueling pair at the top of the lane
four deep, could not quicken enough in mid stretch to match strides with the fast closing winner in mid stretch and settled for second best on this day.
SMOKEN CHLOE prompted the pace outside in the beginning, forced the issue two deep running through the turn, was headed with runners on either side
in upper stretch battling for the front and stubbornly held for the show award in the end. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY set the fractions narrowly on the lead down
the back straight, continued to be hounded outside still dictating the pace on the turn, was collared outside by runners at the top of the lane and
determinedly finished to the wire holding for a minor share. CASTLETON broke out at the start, was bounced around between runners leaving the gate to be
near the back outside down the backstretch, started to pick up the bit with three sixteenths remaining and showed some late interest splitting tired horses in
the final sixteenth. MISS LINDYSUE was bumped inside on the break, travelled on the rail in mid field down the backstretch, was urged for more on the
fence with five sixteenths to go and made little impression running inside to the finish. HARD ROCK WARRIOR stalked near the rear two deep down the
backside, made little headway throughout the turn and could not reach contention five wide down the stretch. MUCHALINA settled in mid pack on the rail in
the early going, lost position to trail at the half, could not keep up with others losing contact on the turn, was eased crossing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
P. S. RISING STAR took command between runners down the backstretch, relinquished the front to the pressing inside rival three furlongs from the finish,
rebid three deep outside turning for home and wore down that rival to inch away in deep stretch. MENAGERIE pressed the pace inside in the early going,
took control narrowly three furlongs from home, was headed outside by the early pacesetter in upper stretch, battled to the wire but was outfinished late
nearing the wire. FOREVER DANISH was nestled on the rail behind the leaders on the first turn, settled inside midfield at the half, slipped up the fence into
the second turn to be within range of the leaders at the top of the lane and finished up evenly to hold for the show money. TAKE CHANCES broke out at the
start to stalk near last in the first turn, was on hold behind runners down the back straight, offered a good rail rally midpoint on the far turn and finished up
with intent for a small share in the end. ASHLEE'S RING tracked between horses watching the top three duel for the front entering the backside, was roused
for run three furlongs from the prize, was in the mix for a small share turning for home but levelled out in the final furlong. FRAULEIN VICTORIA was away a
step slow to begin to trail, travelled outside at the back with a half left to run and could not find more to be a factor in the stretch drive.
ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH stalked five wide on the first turn, settled near the rear three wide down the backstretch, was shuffled outside four deep into the
final turn and was not a presence in the stretch run. LEADING FORCE travelled seven wide near the front into the first turn, pressed three deep outside
runners with five eighths remaining, started to give way three wide at the three furlong marker and retreated two furlongs from home.

Footnotes
VERDEJO chased from outside mid-pack, moved up willingly four wide on the turn, struck the lead outside the furlong marker, drew clear under urging.
GIZMO'S B F F broke inwardly and a step slowly while lightly hit the gate, moved forward inside tracking to the turn, switched of the rail going two then three
wide on the turn swinging four deep into upper stretch, split rivals near the seventy yards marker to get up and secure place while no threat to the winner.
LOADED QUESTION bumped the outer rival at the start, settled at the back outside, went four then five wide on the turn, kicked on evenly in the stretch and
was outfinished for second. BILLYJANE moved forward under urging inside a rival but racing off the fence, dueled to the turn, began to edge away on that
bend and was clear past the quarter pole, overtaken in upper stretch and weakened late. ISHIYAYA was bumped at the start, chased from between runners,
was in a bit tight near the half, swung out six wide turning for home, passed tired rivals. TAKOTA broke outwardly, shifted to the rail heading up the
backstretch and advanced keenly inside but failed to go through along the rail inside the leader, raced in behind that one through the turn, lacked the
needed late kick. LOADED VIXEN got away well, had the early lead briefly, dueled briefly outside a foe three deep, began to drop back on the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
FINALIST was urged at the start, moved to the front racing well off the rail heading to the first turn, edged clear of the nearest pursuer to set the pace in
hand racing in the two path, was challenged turning for home, dueled from the three-sixteenths, came out and brushed that rival lightly in upper- and
mid-stretch then turned that one back and edged clear, held safe under steady handling. SAILOR'S PASSION raced in behind mid-pack moving out from
two to four wide through the first turn, stalked in behind up the backstretch, shifted nearer the rail and was put to urging by the three-eighths, angled out
leaving the far turn, continued to drift out in mid- to late-stretch but ran on with urging to secure place late. BET broke just a half-step slowly, settled off the
leader inside and in behind, took closer order heading into the far turn, moved out advancing two then three wide to engage that one by the top of the
stretch, dueled from the three-sixteenths, was brushed lightly in mid-stretch, was put away and had no extra. STOP THE HUMBUG got away well but raced
toward the back under a mild hold, saving ground near the inside, advanced on the leader into upper stretch but evened out thereafter. COLEYVILLE was
caught outside foes four wide through the first turn, continued to race off the pace outside up the backstretch, was forced out six wide by the end of the far
turn and under urging, continued to drift out in the stretch and ran on evenly. LION'S GOLDENHEART was forwardly-placed stalking from outside three wide
early, continued three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back and continued to weaken. FLAT OUT VIXEN raced three to four wide in the early going,
advanced outside foes near the half-mile marker to get within range of the leader, ridden along coming to the three-eighths, tired.

Footnotes
JILL prompted the pace on the rail in the early going, was then reined back with seven sixteenths to go shifted just outside off the fence, waited behind the
frontrunner on the turn looking for a path, found the seam on the rail turning for home, battled inside to the wire with a determined pacesetter but found a
little more late to inch away for the win nearing the wire. SPANISH BEAUTY broke out at the start but still dictated the pace down the backside, opened up
mildly on runners three furlongs from the finish, drifted out to the four path in upper stretch and stubbornly fought on while running to the wire on the wrong
lead to just get caught nearing the wire. QUIET MADDELENA tracked the top pair three deep with a half mile remaining, could not keep up to the leaders on
the turn inside, shifted just out in the two path for the stretch drive and re rallied between horses in the last sixteenth to get up and capture third. OLYMPIC
FENCER broke with the field, was unhurried outside down the backstretch to trail at the half, could not make up any ground on rivals through the turn,
angled out in the six path for the drive and showed good late energy passing runners late to get up for a minor role in the end. PERFECT PROVISION
stumbled on the break, recovered to be in mid field outside at the half mile marker, offered a brief run circling with five sixteenths to go, was in range angling
six wide for the drive but stalled in the final sixteenth. OLD SECRETS trailed the field on the rail four furlongs left to run, put in a mild turn of foot on the
fence three furlongs out, shifted just outside for the drive and was gaining on runners down the stretch but was not able to contend at the wire. GREEN
GABLES travelled in mid pack on the rail in the early going, shifted out four deep at the half, offered a bold move around horses running throughout the turn
to be a threat five wide at the top of the lane, drifted inwards at the furlong marker and stopped between foes in deep stretch.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY FIELDS trailed the field under a snug hold inside in the early stages, shifted three deep outside horses at the half mile marker unhurried in
last, made a strong move four wide with three eighths to go circling foes to take comand at the quarter pole, was kept to the task through the lane and held
safe at the wire. SILENT SKY took this field into the first turn travelling just off the fence, relinquished the front at the half, was then on hold on the fence
behind the pacesetter to be shuffled back some three furlongs from the prize, had nowhere to go at the quarter marker, angled out four deep at the top of
the lane for clear run to loom the only threat but chased the winner in vain to the finish. MARDENE was squeezed between runners soon after the start, had
a good spot content with tracking the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, was urged between foes to keep position seven sixteenths from the wire, bid
in the two path midway on the far turn for the lead, was steadied for a moment just inside the quarter pole and could not regroup enough in upper stretch
and was one paced to the finish. INDIANA ROAD broke outwards in a tangle to begin, could see the field entering the back straight, put in an early move
five furlongs from the finish to lead by the half on the rail, was clinging to the lead on the fence midway on the final turn, was collared by outside runners,
could not keep pace, had little left to give in upper stretch and faded. LIAM'S AWESOME was bothered between runners at the break, tracked on the rail in
the second flight early on, was floated out a touch into the first turn, travelled outside in mid pack three wide down the backstretch, was roused three deep
with horses on either side three furlongs from home, could not quicken with others and retreated in upper stretch. SENSATIONAL SARAH broke in at the
start, was headstrong on the rail into the first turn, continued to be rank just off the leader at the three quarters pole, fought the rider under restraint on the
fence down the backstretch behind the pacesetter, had no room to go when the field bunched up at the three eighths marker, was shuffled to last, angled
five wide for the drive but came up empty.

Footnotes
SECRET SUNSHINE broke sharp to have the early lead, had a good tracking position outside watching the top pair at the half, poked her neck in front
nearing the three eighths pole, briefly surrendered the lead midway on the turn inside, resurged on the fence at the quarter marker and won the stretch
battle to narrowly hold off the deep closer at the wire. FAVORITE CHANNEL travelled three wide in the middle of the field in the beginning, waited four deep
into the turn near the rear, rallied outside five wide circling runners midpoint on the turn, could the long sustained run in the six path turning for home and
closed in strongly in deep stretch to just getting the nod at the wire. SIXTOFIVE stalked in the middle of the pack four deep down the backstretch, followed
the path of the winner into the turn, loomed the threat three wide outside bidding for the lead two furlongs left, finished down the lane on the wrong lead
through the stretch battled for the front and just missed out on the win while losing the place share right at the finish line. WANNA PLAY had a good spot
mid pack on the rail down the backside, threaded her way through traffic three wide with five sixteenths remaining, angled six wide to be in the hunt at the
top of the lane and never gave up chasing determinedly to the wire gaining late. LOADED MISTRESS was last on the rail four furlongs from the finish, had
nowhere to run in a tightly bunched up pack at the seven sixteenths marker, had clear run inside three wide straightening out for the drive and found her
best stride late showing interest in deep stretch. SMART IRENE settled in midfield between foes two deep at the half, waited throughout the turn behind
runners, angled out widest in the seven path turning for home and when finally got clear showed late energy to finish up to the wire. PERFECTLY LEGAL
forced the issue in the beginning, then was taken back off the pace at the half, could not match strides with rivals on the turn and passed tired runners down
the stretch. BABA'S GIRL pressed on the rail down the back straight, could not find another gear to quicken with others on the fence through the turn, was
shuffled back and weakened on the inside in the final eighth. IT'S A BIG SONG was off slow to begin trailing the field exiting the chute, recovered to be with
the field down the backstretch, made an early move five deep at the nine sixteenths marker around the pack to have a narrow lead three wide with three
furlongs to go, was swallowed up by runners at the quarter pole and stopped down the stretch. NAVY BLUE ANGEL had a slim lead three wide between
rivals at the five eighths pole, could not hold position with runners on either side when an early outside flow started three furlongs from home, backed
through the field midpoint on the turn and was not a factor driving to the wire.
