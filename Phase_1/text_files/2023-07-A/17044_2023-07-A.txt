HIP HOP HOORAY chased along the rail early, angled out in the stretch then wore down the pacesetter in the final sixteenth. PEACH BE WITH Q quickly
moved clear, extended her lead on the turn then weakened in the final furlong. BET OF THE CENTURY raced off the pace between foes, was in tight briefly
at the three eighths pole and rallied inside. QUEEN LUCKY broke slowest and raced far behind then passed fading rivals. COLETTE'S SPIRIT saved
ground and lacked a response. DIVINE TWIST was hard used chasing the loose pacesetter and stopped through the stretch. LUCKY BREEZE raced three
wide off the pace to the far turn and gave way.

the pace four wide, moved even wider on the turn then flattened out. IN SPADES stumbled at the break, angled inside and lacked a solid rally.

WORD ON A WING toon control early, led easily, widened on the turn and maintained a big advantage while ridden out. DOCTOR DOOM chased inside,
faded on the turn then came again along the rail. HURRICANE HIGHWAY dropped far behind then offered some late energy to gain the show.
THISCATCANJUMP raced in closest pursuit of the winner and faded in the final furlong. CITY RAGE stumbled badly at the start, rushed up outside then
faltered. FAST BOB trailed for half a mile then narrowed the gap along the inside. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK raced wide off the leaders and gave way readily.

PRAETORIAN GUARD trailed well behind, began advancing on the turn, swung wide in the stretch and surged away. FINALLY CAPTURED dueled three
with a narrow lead, drifted in near midstretch and weakened slightly. MCCRAKENS GHOST dueled between rivals, faded on the turn, was in tight between
rivals at the eighth pole, altered course to his inside and closed well. CAPITAL CONQUEST forced the pace along the inside, drifted out in midstretch and
continued well. GAME SEVEN made a menacing four wide bid into the far turn then gave way. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the third
finisher against the second finisher for interference in the stretch, FINALLY CAPTURED was disqualified and placed third.
