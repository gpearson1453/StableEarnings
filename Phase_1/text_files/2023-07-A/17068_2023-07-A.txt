Footnotes
HAGLER settled back off the rail on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn, drifted into the stretch, dug in to get up the final yards and just lasted. RIDICULOUS steadied into the first turn but recovered stride through the turn,
gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in to take second the final yards and just missed the win. JAYJAYDEE
steadied into the first turn and settled off the early pace, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced in the four path on the far turn and finished well
while gaining on the top two. ANTIPOISON was bumped, nearly unseating his rider into the first turn but took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and rated
the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths but was caught weakening in late stretch. IMPROBABLE STORY rated close to the early pace
inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND took a brief lead into the first
turn, was caught and gave chase toward the nine sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. BUTTONED UP set the early pace inside but
suffered a fatal injury into the first turn and had to be euthanized on the track. The Stewards conducted an inquiry to review the incident into the first turn.

sixteenth pole but eased outside the winner and dueled ALDARIGHTTRICKS for second. The latter chased outside, raced close in the four path on the turn
but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. SCARE DEM chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well. UNCLE PRESS gave
chase, raced in the three path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. GAMBLING FEVER pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back off
the rail approaching the head of the lane and flattened stride. DOCTOR PARDO was sluggish getting into stride, moved to the outside to give chase and
rounded the turn in the two and three paths, but showed little more. GOLD FIBER gave chase then weakened in the five and six paths of the turn. IT'S
ONLY MONEY lunged at the break, gave chase through the backstretch then weakened in the four path on the turn.

STRYDA dueled for the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced clear at the quarter, rounded the turn near the rail and was steadily handled in the
stretch. KEEP ON SPURRIN chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and finished well while settling for second. CASTLE TOY was
bumped at the break then set a pressured early pace, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole but dropped back at the rail into the turn and flattened
stride in the lane. DIXIE YODELER veered outward and made contact with BLUE MOUNTAIN leaving the gate then gave distant chase, rounded the turn
about the three path, drifted into the stretch but finished evenly to pass rivals. The latter became edgy in the gate, was bumped outward and into Castle Toy
leaving the gate then gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn but showed little in the lane. DREAMY SONDE chased through the backstretch, rounded the
turn about the four path, drifted into the stretch and weakened. CHEROKEE CASTLE gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in
the lane. CHARITABLE ANY became edgy in the gate and stumbled at the break, gave chase outside but was never a factor.

then dug in determinedly through the lane and held on. LADRO DI FICHI saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved in
the five path of the far turn, finished well to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. BEST VIRGINIA stalked three wide the opening turn,
challenged leaving the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dug in a close factor through the upper stretch but flattened
the final sixteenth. MONOCACY settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran
evenly in the lane. MISS LAUREN raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail,

Footnotes
ROAD PARTY took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms at the rail on
the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game challenge of PENGUIN PARADE, who stalked two deep on the opening turn,
started a three wide bid at the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dug in gamely leaving the turn but reluctantly ceded
later yards. BOSS E BOOGS was bumped leaving the gate then rated close inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. CHANGE YOUR LUCK raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, gave chase
toward the three eighths pole but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. PAYMENGOLD ducked in and
made contact with Boss E Boggs leaving the gate then settled off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. SPANGLISH saved ground off
the pace, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
OCEAN STORM raced well off the pace in the five path on the opening turn, left the turn outside and bid approaching the three eighths pole, steadily
progressed at the rail on the far turn, took the nod entering the stretch, dueled clear past the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged to hold on. FELICIAS
CASTLE settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn five wide, dueled for second approaching mid-stretch
and finished well. HARPERSGONEFISHING rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and took a
brief lead three wide past the five sixteenths, raced briefly clear midway on the far turn but was met entering the stretch and flattened the final sixteenth.
DEVIL'S CANYON saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn, lugged inward through the
upper stretch and finished evenly. ROCKING TO HOME raced with the pace inside, dueled leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back at the rail midway
on the far turn and flattened in the lane. SWISS LEGACY raced with the pace two deep while between horses through the front stretch, took a slim lead
passing the nine sixteenths pole, dueled from the three eighths but dropped back at the quarter and weakened off the rail on the far turn. BOBBYS CASE
LOAD rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the seven path on the far turn and passed some rivals
outside. MISTER DEEKS stumbled and hit the gate at the break then never factored. ALLEGHENY HERO rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the five path of the far turn. DRUNK TEXT raced with the pace three wide on the front stretch then
stalked into the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, steadied between horses approaching the far turn then faded through the turn.
