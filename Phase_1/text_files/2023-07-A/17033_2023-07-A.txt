BOURBON BUNS was hung five wide into the clubhouse turn, allowed to settle, closed willingly three wide under right handed urging through the stretch
while in the five path, made the lead late and edged clear. ANNMARIA away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the far turn, gave up the
advantage, regained the leader in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner. HIGH FIRE slow early, found her best stride late in the two path. RIGHT
TRAPPE pressed the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then came up empty. SHE'S CRAFTY failed to
menace. INCESSANT stalked the pace from the four path into the far turn then faded. SIERRA DIAMOND settled inside off the pace and was through after
a half.

Footnotes
DEE'S KY WILDCAT allowed to settle, responded readily when set down, rallied inside rivals under left handed urging to make the lead near the furlong
marker and drew clear under brisk handling. MY TWO JAKES chased the pace through the turn, rallied two wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch,
drifted out to the middle of the racetrack despite right handed urging and couldn't handle the winner. ANGEL'S DESTINY stalked the early pace, loomed
boldly three wide into the stretch, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack and was outfinished. SHESANOTHERSONG broke in front, set the pace to
the top of the stretch then weakened. WICKED REESE well placed, failed to respond. RIVERANDFAIRMOUNT was fractious in the gate then no threat.
GOLD APPEAL threw her head as the gate opened, hit the gate and had brief speed. LISTEN LINDA LOU trailed.
