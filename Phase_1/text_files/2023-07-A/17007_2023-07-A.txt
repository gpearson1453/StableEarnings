Footnotes
EAGLE EXPRESS pressed the pace from the fence in the early going, settled just off the leader in the turn, cut the corner coming home and finished well up
the inside to be up in time. BLING MOUNTAIN prompted the pace from three wide through the turn, ground his way to take a brief lead inside the sixteenth
pole and was out-finished in the final strides. WINGS FOR ENO tracked the leaders through the turn, found his best stride in upper stretch and closed with a
belated rush to be gaining at the wire. GRAMI'S BOY set a pressured pace from the start, edged away to a clear lead in the turn, dug-in when challenged in
the stretch and weakened late in the drive. SWEET TAPIN MORO broke a step slow to be at the rear and went evenly as no threat. RUSH THE COLORS
chased from near the rear of the field, mounted a brief rally in the turn and flattened out.

Footnotes
TATANKA lead the way from the start and throughout the course and was clearly unchallenged till the end proving much the best and setting a new track
record. KAZAN (IRE) was rated in the middle of the pack along the inside throughout the first lap, then was steadily gaining ground on the far turn to gain
the place position in the upper stretch and held on well but could not catch the leader. VIOLIN MAKER was rated along outside of an inner rival throughout,
then rallied from the three path on the far turn to close well for the show prize in the end. MOOJAB JR settled along the inside in the early backstretch and
throughout until the final turn, then rallied in the late stretch to close well just missing the show prize. MIDAS CAT trailed behind the field throughout the first
lap and a half then made a mild bid on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. CATHOLIC GUILT followed the leader in second position throughout
the first two laps, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch then gave way for the place prize in the end. IMPLICATOR raced in third position
throughout the first mile then began to flatten out and had no final bid in the end.

Footnotes
CANDY TAP moved to the lead a few strides from the gate, set a well rated pace to the quarter pole, edged away from the field in upper stretch and drew
clear to the wire without being seriously threatened. MISS CARMEN stalked the pace from three wide, moved midway on the turn to challenge the
pacesetting winner, could not get by and finished willingly to stay clear in the place position. RECLAIMED taken back off the pace early to be at the rear,
steadily gained ground with a ground saving rail rally to be up for the show. KAYLEE'S SHADOW tracked the leaders from striking distance and failed to
mount a rally. MAMA'S NIGHT OUT slow early to trail into the turn, angled wide for the drive, continued to drift out in upper stretch and made a mild late
gain. GUITAR GROUPIE tracked the pace from four wide through the turn and faded in the stretch. TWITTER TRAFFIC prompted the pace for three-eights
and came up empty.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFULPATH dueled briefly at the start, then lead the way into the turn, was challenged again by the same rival leaving the bend, then kicked clear
and held on well down the lane to prevail in the end. SPECIAL NOTE pressed the pace from the two path into the turn, then inched closer to try and take the
lead from the pace setter heading in the home stretch but was outkicked and was no match in the end. TAPS MISTRESS was rated along the inside, then
came out four wide on the turn to rally in the stretch and was closing well in the end. MISS ROSE was moving up while three wide down the backstretch and
into the turn, then rallied in the late stretch but came up empty. DULCE AMANECER YG raced towards the back of the pack and between rivals down the
backstretch, then made a mild bid in the upper stretch from the four path and was no threat. RUNWAY HIT stalked the pace while three wide, was in a hard
drive throughout the turn then stopped in the stretch. CREAM PUFF REAPER chased the pace in the middle of the field down the backstretch, then faded
heading into the stretch and was no menace. COME ON SING trailed throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
ENGLANDER took command steps away from the gate, set a well rated, well measured pace to the far turn, edged away to a clear lead turning for home
and finished willingly under no serious threat in a well handled ride. GO SPEED RACER GO settled in hand at the back of the field for the first three
quarters, angled wide turning for home and closed with a rush to be up for the place. PARROT HEAD rated in mid-pack from two wide down the backside,
rallied four wide in the turn to threaten in upper stretch under a prolonged drive and kept on down the lane unable to close ground. SEDUCTIVE U S A
unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, closed the gap turning for home, waited behind horses in upper stretch and showed late interest when angled
into the clear. TRES SOLES saved ground while rated in mid-pack, lost position through the turn and failed to respond when called upon. WHISKEY NOT
WINE tracked the pace from three wide between horses to upper stretch and gradually faded in the lane. COLOSI slow early to trail in the first turn, made a
bold four wide move down the backside to be prominent in the final bend and flattened out in mid-stretch. BRUCELEA stalked the leader through the far turn
and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
LEPRECHAUN CHARM broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, dueled from the rail through the turn, cleared in upper stretch and drew off down the
lane decisively. SAN MATEO KAT settled early in mid-pack off the leaders, steadily made headway in the turn to close the gap, angled wide turning for
home and closed well to be second best. DAPHNE'S FIRE pressed the early pace dueling with the winner to midway on the turn and weakened down the
stretch while holding the show. MAYWON stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, ranged up to challenge in the turn and flattened out down
the stretch. JUSTCAUSEICAN slow early to trail and made a mild rally in the stretch passed tired rivals. AZUSA STREET well placed while saving ground
tracking the leaders and lacked a response when called upon. SASSY CHASSIE went evenly without threatening. COLLEAN'S LUCY chased from three
wide down the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
ACEHIGH ROYAL sped to the lead in a five way early duel on the lead, briefly surrendered the lead for a few jumps in the turn, responded gamely to re-take
the lead and drew clear down the lane. JAMES'S MOONSHINE tracked the leaders from the rail just behind the dueling leaders, waited on traffic midway
through the turn, angled into the clear in upper stretch and finished well. MORO OUTLAW pressed the pace from between horses down the backside,
dueled with the winner through the turn taking a brief lead, kept on gamely but was no match and weakened late. DOUBLE TRAP slow early to be at the
back of the field angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly. BOLD N WILD unhurried early to be well off the pace and improved position by passing
tiring rivals in the stretch. BIG TICKET chased from five wide early, was called upon into the turn and lacked a response. UNCORKED HUMOR pressed the
early pace from between horses and tired nearing the quarter pole. HARRY chased the pace from four wide while close up and gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
RIVERCREST GIRL unhurried in the early going, gradually gained ground down the backside to be in striking distance entering the far turn, swept up six
wide in the turn to take control at the top of the lane, opened a clear advantage and held the closer safe to the wire. TRUE BLUE SKY reserved well off the
early pace, saved ground while racing along the fence through the turn waiting for racing room, angled out to the seven path from the fence at the top of the
stretch and finished with a flurry to be gaining late. BASKET CASE stalked the pace from three wide in the second flight through the first turn, moved up to
challenge four wide in the final bend, loomed in upper stretch but finished evenly down the lane. AUTOSTRADA tracked the leaders from the rail while
dueling for position in the second flight, continued to chase down the backside and final turn and mounted a mild rally in the stretch. TAHITIAN BREEZE
slow early to be at the back of the field for three quarters and made a strong rally in the lane to be gaining late. NORA'S LEGACY dueled on the lead from
between horses to the top of the lane and weakened in the drive. CLAIRE JUNE sped to the lead in a three horse duel through the first turn, opened a clear
advantage briefly down the backside, responded when challenged in the final bend and gave way down the lane. PRINCESS VOODOO prominently placed
from between horses in the second flight through both turns and lacked a closing response. FAME STREET went evenly and never posed a threat. MORO
LINGERIE pressed the pace from three wide to the far turn and tired. M G BIG MARIA rated in mid-pack to the far turn and faded.
