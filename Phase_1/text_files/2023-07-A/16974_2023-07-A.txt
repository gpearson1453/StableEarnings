Footnotes
MON AMI FUZZIE forwardly placed between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up from path three on the bend, lost ground drifting out to path six
entering the lane, surged under urging the last furlong and caught TIZ APPROVED in the final strides. TIZ APPROVED broke on top, set a pressured pace
between rivals, moved clear and stayed just off the inside on the turn, floated out some into the stretch, steadily drifted out the last eighth and was
outfinished. ALPINE GHOST pressed TIZ APPROVED from just outside and lacked the needed stretch kick. LONESOME DREAM brushed with ORBITAL
STARR at the break, was hustled up to prompt the pace from inside, came off the rail some entering the lane and slowly yielded. ORBITAL STARR brushed
with LONESOME DREAM at the start, was without early speed, picked up his pace along the rail leaving the bend and rallied belatedly in the stretch.
IMPERIAL MOMENT stayed well off the inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT rated from outside, advanced from path three on the bend, moved clear under urging upper stretch, steadily opened up on the rest and was
kept to task to the wire. LIL BIT TIPSEY forwardly placed between horses on the backstretch, progressed four wide on the turn, took over second nearing
the last sixteenth, could not close the gap on the leader but pulled away for the place. ORNERY ANGEL broke a bit inward, moved to the outside midway on
the backstretch, was widest taking the bend, lacked a significant bid in the stretch but caught GHAALEB'S HONOR for third late. GHAALEB'S HONOR
crowded briefly at the break, soon vied for the early lead between rivals, stayed just off the rail through the turn and wore down for the stretch run. BIG
SALLY displayed early speed from inside but began to fade after three furlongs.

HIGHLY PERFECT rated on the front end between horses, was roused two wide leaving the bend, shook off RUN THE TABLE inside the last furlong and
was wrapped up as much the best in the waning yards. RUN THE TABLE disputed the pace from inside, was no match for HIGHLY PERFECT inside the
final eighth, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for the place. DIAMND CON SUERTE chased from outside, angled in nearing the bend,
progressed along the rail, angled out three wide upper stretch, lacked a serious bid but proved easily best of the others. RED ROIL pressed from outside,
did not keep up nearing the turn and gave way for the drive. FADE FROM BLACK hesitated at the break and was always outrun.

WILDWOOD BYE vied for the early lead between horses, edged ahead two wide under urging upper stretch and kept GHAALEB'S CITY at bay under
steady handling. GHAALEB'S CITY pressed from outside, was three wide taking the bend, loomed a serious threat with a furlong to go, lacked the needed
late kick but was clearly second best. BLAME TERI displayed early speed from inside but began to wear down for the drive. MARIA'S GIFT void of speed,
though urged along after the break, picked up her pace along the rail on the bend, angled out widest for the stretch run and failed to have a significant
response. TROUBLE FINDS ME raced in contention from outside for a half mile then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
LORD SHAFTESBURY broke alertly, soon shared the lead from outside, moved clear into the bend, angled in, was roused nearing the quarter pole, floated
out to path three entering the lane, was challenged from outside but dug in under steady handling and kept MY KINDA TETON at bay. MY KINDA TETON in
the second flight early toward the outside, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, fanned outside LORD SHAFTESBURY for the stretch run, threatened
with a furlong to go, leveled off in the late going but proved easily second best. UNCLE O. G. displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with LORD
SHAFTESBURY into the bend, came off the rail some, lost second leaving the turn then could only just hold onto third deep stretch. ALPHA LEA broke
outward, bumping CELIA'S CIRCLE, chased from between horses, advanced two wide on the turn, swung out to path five for the stretch run and improved
position some without threatening. LELAND JOHN raced in the second flight just off the inside, angled out some nearing the half mile marker, faded
between horses on the bend, came into the stretch from path sixth and lacked a significant response. WAVE THE GOLD progressed from inside on the turn,
swung out to path four for the stretch run and flattened. SPAN a step slow and awkward at the break, was never a factor in a very wide trip. CELIA'S
CIRCLE was reluctant to load, bumped at the start, soon trailed, five to seven wide through the bend and had no stretch bid. HEART OF JOSEPH void of
speed, though hustled along early, faded six wide on the turn.

Footnotes
ICY RIVER unruly in the gate, vied for the lead outside LICHITA from the beginning, started to gradually drift out as she moved clear upper stretch,
continued to drift the last eighth but managed to hold back I LUV THIS BAR. The latter, settled between rivals on the backstretch, commenced her bid after
a quarter mile, progressed two wide on the bend, fanned out to path four entering the lane, took over second, altered inside ICY RIVER just inside the
furlong marker then could only make up minor ground on the leader late. BETHY rated in the second flight from outside, came into contention three wide on
the turn, stayed outside I LUV THIS BAR for the stretch run, lacked the extra needed in the late going but was easily best of the rest. THINK BLUE also
unruly in the gate, advanced from inside on the backstretch, angled outside upper stretch and failed to have a significant bid. MISS WINDY SLEW broke
inward, bumping CARSON RESERVE, soon trailed, was in path three on the bend, moved to the rail upper stretch and improved her position some without
threatening. LICHITA shared the lead from inside for a half mile, came off the rail some entering the lane and gave way. CARSON RESERVE bumped at
the start, chased from just off the inside, angled out some for a clear path at the top of the stretch and had little to offer.

Footnotes
BACKSHOT was sent to share the early lead between horses, did not keep up from inside on the bend, rallied to gain a clear lead inside the final furlong
and held sway with little asking in the waning yards. TIZRIK was hustled along to vie for the lead between rivals, did not stay with RED LABEL on the turn,
came into the lane three wide, floated out some upper stretch, kept a straight path the final furlong and took over second seventy yards out. SCARLET CITY
prominent from inside on the backstretch, did not stay close on the bend, angled out to path six upper stretch and rallied belatedly the last eighth.
CHERNYAHOVSKIY settled at the back, was four wide on the turn, lost considerable ground fanning to path eight for the stretch run, surged inside the final
furlong but gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure the last sixteenth and narrowly missed third. RED LABEL vied for the early lead in tight quarters
between foes on the backstretch, moved clear and stayed just off the inside on the bend, drifted out some midstretch, was straightened but began to wear
down between horses in the late going. STORMIN EL PRADO was sent to contest the pace from outside on the backstretch, improved position four wide on
the turn, altered out some as TIZRIK came out upper stretch, began to flatten out and was altered in for a clear path in the waning yards. FAIRWAY LANE
chased from just off the inside, swung out behind to path six for the drive and could only make up minor ground late. TALE OF THE NILE chased from
between horses, came into the lane from path seven and gave way.
