Footnotes
NEXT REVOLT away quickly in the beginning then ceded command around the first turn, stalked from outside up the backstretch, drew alongside the leader
and took over at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared two wide into the lane, came out in upper stretch and drew off under hand urging. DEEP RIVER raced up
close three deep on the clubhouse turn then stalked off the rail, went four wide into the second bend, loomed three wide at the five-sixteenths pole but was
no match for the winner in the stretch run. ZIMBA WARRIOR tracked four then three wide early, made progress while going between rivals in the middle
stages, had to steady at the seven-sixteenths pole, was driven two then three wide into the lane and was along for the show. GRANADA FLAVOR stalked
two wide early, saved ground on the far turn, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and lacked a rally. SITTIN ON GO was keen early when trying to rate
along the rail into the first turn, went up to take the lead around the clubhouse turn before clearing, showed the way to the far turn, lost command
approaching the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the lane.

furlong, came out late and held the place. WHISKEY VISION broke inward, taken wide early trailing the field, came six wide into the, drifted in through the
stretch run and got up for the show honors. SIPPIN WHISKEY tracked well off the rail, rounded the bend five wide and go edged for third. DANZ TILL TEN
dueled outside a rival then three deep early, failed to keep up with the leader around the turn, chased three then four wide to the lane and weakened.
WILEY'S WONDER dueled inside DANZ TILL TEN then fought inside rivals to the turn, could not keep pace with BLUEGRASS RYDER around the bend

COALINGA HILLS fractious prior to the start, pressed three deep then chased the top quartet up the backstretch, loomed four wide into the lane, tried to
rallied in upper stretch but lacked an opening between the top pair, split foes with a furlong left to run and surged late to get by TROPICANA GIRL in the
final strides. TROPICANA GIRL vied for the lead from inside, chased the outside leaders around the bend, came back on with a furlong remaining, held a
short lead with a sixteenth to go and got outkicked by the winner. ANA LISA vied five then four deep to the turn, dueled four then three wide around the
bend, fought into the final furlong and got outkicked by inner rivals. BENGAL TIGER fractious in the gate, vied four then three deep to the turn, dueled three
then two wide around the bend, carried a short lead into the final furlong, was overtaken shortly after, got crowded a bit at the sixteenth pole but had already
started to flatten out. NIGHT PARTY fractious in the gate, vied for command between rivals to the turn, could not keep up with the leader and chased two
wide around the bend, then weakened in the drive. BLOSSOMING brushed the gate come away last, trailed four wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IT'S SAUL GOOD was off slow to begin, chased four wide into the lane and wore down CONQUEST CELSIUS in the final furlong to get up at the wire.
CONQUEST CELSIUS dueled from outside then cleared up the backstretch, led along the rail into the lane, remained unchallenged to midstretch, met the
bid from IT'S SAUL GOOD past the eighth pole, resisted into the closing moments and got nailed at the line. UNIFIED A. P. raced in range off the rail, came
three wide into the stretch, raced within striking distance into the final furlong but finished evenly late. FIAMINA sat off the pace, went three wide around the
turn, produced a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. SMOOVE OVER chased from off the pace, entered the stretch four to five wide and failed to
rally. LIGHTING AND REIGN broke a step slow, dropped back early, trailed wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. FIFTY
STARS chased off the rail early out of range, went two wide through the bend and lacked a rally. THE FENCE dueled from inside then ceded command at
the half-mile pole, chased the leader two wide into the lane and weakened. THIRSTY FOR LOVE chased from inside then dropped back around the turn
and came up empty.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BIT SASSY chased two wide early then moved inside to take over into the backstretch, showed the way two, three then four wide on the far turn,
remained clear into the final furlong, challenged in the final sixteenth and held well. ULTIMATE HY forwardly placed three wide early, stayed off the rail to
the far turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, rallied from the middle part of the track, closed in past the sixteenth pole but was not enough in the end.
ROSIE FORECAST bumped outer rival at the start, showed early speed to duel inside a rival around the first turn, chased SHE'S A BIT SASSY up the
backstretch, saved ground into the lane and lacked the needed late kick in the furlong grounds. I HAD THAT ONE TOO dropped back early, moved closer
outside a rival on the first turn, chased three then two wide on the far turn and kept on to round out the superfecta. MADIHA raced up close five wide early,
remained wide through the far turn, took aim five wide into the stretch and flattened in the furlong grounds. TIZZY TWISTER got bumped leaving the gate,
settled inside, coaxed around the far turn and weakened. BIG CLARE got crowded and had to steady between rivals four wide on the first turn, chased off
the pace four wide into the far turn, was along the six path into the lane and lacked a rally. RACE JUDICATA showed speed four then three wide around the
first turn, chased up the backstretch, rounded the far turn four then three wide and faded in the lane. EMERALD LAKE became rank early and lugged out
into the first turn, trailed on the inside into the far turn, two wide into the lane, had little left for the drive, eased in the furlong grounds and walked off.
