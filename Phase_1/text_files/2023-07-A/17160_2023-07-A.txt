NIGHT ESCORT Broke sluggishly, rushed out to contest the lead along the rail, shook loose a furlong out and under pressure proved best. MAGNIFICENT
CHROME Broke sluggishly, rated along the three path, gained four wide on the turn, chased and was getting to the winner. PREFERRED OUTCOME Close
up in hand along the two path, angled out and lacked a rally. HARRISON KNOWS Vied for the lead from between early, dueled the winner into the lane and
weakened. TUCKABUCKAWAY Lagged far back, four wide on the turn, was never in it. HEYITSNRICOPALAZO Forced the issue three across early and
was done on the turn.

DAREDEVIL BULL Set the pace along the rail while pressed early, took charge, showed the way, opened up and then was under wraps for the win. STAY
HOME MAMA Lagged back, gained along the three path on the last turn and rallied to best the rest. HONORABLE LILLY Forced the issue early, tracked
along the two path and finished with interest. DO WHAT IT TAKES In hand saving ground, asked into the lane and failed to fire. MISS PAB Unhurried along
the two path, took the rail on the last turn and failed to threaten. THE NEW MIAMI Four wide into the backstretch, took the rail on the last turn, was never a
factor. LADY TEUFLESBERG Well placed in hand along the three path and then was done midway on the last turn. CAPTIVATING CARA Four wide early,
two path on the last turn and tired. PAVE MY WAY Close up along the rail for a half mile, appeared in distress, pulled up and was veined off.

leaving the furlong marker and finished well. GONE OASIS Tracked along the three path, two path into the lane and weakened. SLY SLOANE Broke slow,
saved ground and finished with interest. PRETTY MISS PENNY Broke slow, saved ground throughout and made a mild bid. CANCELLEDCAPTIVITY Four
wide on the turn, was not a threat. PRINCESS RILEY Jostled at the start, lagged back, two path on the turn and finished inside. GIANT BOTTLE Five wide
on the turn and finished wide. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE Ducked out at the start, three path on the turn and tired. SHUL Close up four wide early and tired.
