CHAMPAGNE BLING was unhurried out of the gate and settled four to five wide off the pressured pace, swung six wide into the lane, responded willingly
when called upon, rallied along the outside and swept by mid-stretch. HAIL COLUMBIA vied two wide for the lead in early stages, battled on with CLASSY
AND FAST turning for home, roused for more at the head of the lane, shook free, led the way past the eighth pole then got overtaken by the winner. READY
TO GET LOUD was well placed tracking the embattled top flight in early stages, swung five wide into the lane, drifted in a few paths under left handed
pressure, steadily edged up closer and cleared a share. CLASSY AND FAST dueled inside for the early lead and continued to battle for command around
the turn, could not match strides with HAIL COLUMBIA past upper stretch and gave way. REMITTANCE SENT vied four deep in opening stages, fought
back around the turn then tired in the drive. S C ANGEL dueled in the top flight in opening stages, continued to match strides around the turn then retreated
in the lane.

Footnotes
COWBOY CASANOVA sprinted to the lead out of the gate, cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge
from SMART N INTUITIVE approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead then shook free entering the upper stretch, widened advantage under firm
handling and held clear under a driving finish. SMART N INTUITIVE was well placed tracking the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge
COWBOY CASANOVA midway around the turn, vied for the lead past the quarter pole, swung four to five wide entering the lane, could not maintain equal
terms with eventual winner but remained up close then the rider lost the whip approaching the final sixteenth, finished clearly second best. SNAP'N TAP
was off a step slow at the start, continued unhurried and remained in the back, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung five wide into stretch run and
gained a share. YEARS FLY BY tracked the top two leaders up the backstretch, roused for more around the turn, failed to respond and never threatened.

KILLIAN came away last at the start and remained reserved in the back, swung four wide into the lane, rallied gamely along the outside and surged to the
lead approaching the wire. NAVE sped to the lead at the start and held clear around the turn, came two wide into the lane, widened to a commanding
advantage a furlong out then got caught in deep stretch. NICE ONE JULIO raced three wide in the flight off the leader, hustled along to pick up the pace late
on the turn, responded evenly then found another gear in final stages and closed with good response. D D'S LEGACY raced in early contention, chased two
wide around the turn then flattened near mid-stretch. WICKED HOT FOOT hustled along in contention on the rail, sustained bid around the turn then
retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
ALL GOOD TIMES was allowed to settle three wide around the first turn, rated off top trio up the backstretch, edged closer entering the far turn, launched a
two wide bid approaching the eighth pole, took a slim lead and held firm under confident handling. UNDECODED was forwardly placed around the first turn
and stalked up the backstretch, remained in contention three wide around the far turn, given cue three to four wide in upper stretch, moved up into striking
distance but could not get to the winner. A GIRL LIKE ME was well reserved racing in the back, continued unhurried entering the far turn, swung five wide
into the lane, rallied along the outside and cleared show. DO YOU BILEVE stalked the leader through early stages, was ridden along two wide around the
far turn, raced up close a furlong out then gave way. XCARET sped to the lead heading into the first turn, set the pace and held firm around the final turn,
got collared by the winner in the final furlong and weakened. HOPING FOR A RING raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, given cue along
the rail at the head of the lane, briefly edged closer then retreated.

Footnotes
ZEN (IRE) rated not far out of range, moved up between foes near the quarter pole, hustled along three to four wide in the lane, steadily gained ground and
drew clear in the final sixteenth. SWEET HOLINESS tracked the top trio up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn, spun out wider for
the drive, sustained a steady bid and captured place. LORI'S EYES set the pace up the backstretch, repelled bids around the turn, saved ground entering
the lane, widened to a clear advantage, began to weaken in late stages and got overtaken in deep stretch. WUMPMUG was forwardly placed along the
outside in early stages, moved up into striking distance at the quarter pole, lost some ground turning for home, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave
way. REDNECKER hopped at the start and raced off the pace, swung four to five wide into the drive and lacked a needed rally. LITTLE MORE LOVE was
off a step slow at the start and remained reserved in the last flight, saved ground around the turn then tipped three wide for the drive and had no response.
SPITFIRE SUZIE raced up close along the inside, flattened mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
KYNLIE'S EMPIRE was unhurried around the first turn and continued in the last flight up the backstretch, loomed up three to four wide at the quarter pole,
took over a slim lead at the eighth pole and edged away. GIRL PRO stalked the top two leaders through middle stages, moved up two to three wide to
challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, vied three deep in upper stretch, could not match strides with eventual winner past the furlong marker but
sustained bid and cleared second best. WAR MUSIC was reserved and raced in the last flight, moved up closer along the rail late on the far turn, cut the
corner entering the lane, advanced into striking distance mid-stretch and ran on for a share. SIERRA SUMMER sped to the lead at the start and set the
pace up the backstretch, took on a pair of challengers near the quarter pole, fought back to the furlong marker then gave way. MY DAMS ATITUDE settled
off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the far turn, ran on three wide through the lane and needed more for late impact. LITTLE ROCKER was
forwardly placed up the backstretch, continued in contention around the far turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
NEW STRIPE sat back off the early pace, given cue five wide turning for home, took over a slim lead a furlong marker then drew off convincingly.
FASCINATED vied outside of ACE GILFORD for the early lead, shook free midway around the turn, held clear three then four wide into the lane then briefly
angled into the path of COCO BRAVADO, ran on and secured place. COCO BRAVADO tracked the pace into the turn, launched a bid near the quarter pole,
began moving up into closer contention entering the lane, lost path when FASCINATED angled in a path upper stretch, lost momentum then ran on for a
share. BARSTOW rated off the early leaders, launched a bid turning for home, raced in contention mid-stretch then flattened out. FLY FIRST CLASS
stalked the top two early leaders, hustled along around the turn then weakened in the lane. LIBERTARIAN raced off the pace and lacked a needed rally
when called upon. ACE GILFORD dueled inside of FASCINATED in early stages, could not match strides midway around the turn and tired in the drive.
SAILOR CHOW reared in the air at the start, lost the rider and walked off. AFTER AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START, STEWARDS RULED NO
