up in the stretch and drew off as an easy winner. PACIFIC VIEW was allowed to settle early, raced five wide through the second turn, drifted in late and
finished second best. WICKED SKY was unhurried early, saved ground through out and was along for third. LUTION pressed the early pace, was eased
back along the backstretch, raced four wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. J Z'S FINE WINE tracked the early pace, was eased back off the
pace, angled out to the seven path in the stretch and was empty late. HOLY STAR set a pressured pace from the inside and faded. VOSTRA was taken
back early, angled out eight wide out of the turn and offered no late rally. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
FIVE O' SOMEWHERE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, dueled with RAVIN'S TOWN to the wire and prevailed for the win.
RAVIN'S TOWN pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, dueled to late stretch and just missed. CHISPARRAJOS was unhurried early, raced
along the inside, angled out to the four path in early stretch and finished evenly late. CLASSIC RICHIE was allowed to settle early, raced three wide and
was empty late. STANCE raced in mid pack early from the inside and passed tired rivals. NATIONS DREAM broke slow, was outrun early while racing six
wide and finished belatedly. STROPE broke in at the start, was taken back and offered no rally.
