LETS RUN TWO was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. J M R GEMMA was in touch and had a mild gain
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. PENNIESFROMABOVE was away alertly, roused from the inside on
the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. J M R BOLD VISION settled off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no real
threat. LIME was off slow and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch faded.

and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE was up close early and had a good
position on the turn but weakened through the stretch. MS. P'S BELLA was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
JARA forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the four path through the stretch fought gamely for the win. GIMBALA set a pressured
pace, dueled on the turn and vied from the three path through the stretch but was outgunned. KHOZZY VALINTINE broke poorly, gained ground on the turn
and finished well. HASN'T HIT ME YET tracked the early leaders and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled
off. WEST PAW was off the pace and showed little while outrun. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON GIMBALA AGAINST JARA FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
MIMI'S HOLIDAY was hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SUPER COOL STORM
was up close but in tight on the turn and was up for place. JIMMY IS A BREEZE set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the five path
at the top of the stretch gave way. ASHWICKEN was in touch and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out.
TEQUILAS MELODY was in range and a factor from between foes on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. TANGERINE
TWIST showed speed from the inside but lost ground on the turn and was empty.
