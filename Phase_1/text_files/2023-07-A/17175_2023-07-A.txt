FANCY PAYNTER vied inside to the far turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. SPEND AGAIN was never far back, raced outside,
closed steadily and got up for place while no threat to the winner. RIGGED RIGHT stalked the pace, rallied on the turn to loom a threat, bid three wide,
lacked the needed late response and was caught for second. WHO'S BIG DADDY was unhurried early, trailed the field while racing far back, advanced on
the turn and offered a mild bid only. EASTER JIM swung out entering the first turn, saved ground to the second turn, angled out and lacked a stretch
response. MACER THE RACER vied two across to the far turn, tired and stopped.
