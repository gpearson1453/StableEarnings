much the best under a brisk hand ride. VALIANT THOR pressed the pace two wide and gamely gained second. UNCAPTURED PULSE was hustled to a
short lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, battled with the winner up the entire trip then was outfinished for second. T MONEY failed
to menace. CUGINE had brief speed. CANDY CRUSHEM trailed.

BACK TO OHIO chased the pace into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead two wide past the quarter pole, was carried out to the five path by the
leader, made the lead inside the furlong marker and drew clear under left handed urging. WINE ME UP BABY broke in front, set the pace along the inside,
drifted to the four path entering the stretch, dug in gamely but couldn't handle the winner. CANDLELIGHT HOURS stalked the pace three wide and finished
with good courage in the four path. AMADEVIL had good early speed two wide then along the inside but lacked the needed response. AUJARA was no
factor. LIONISTIC had brief speed.

prevailed under strong handling. BLUSHING BETTY forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch, loomed outside the
winner in deep stretch but was denied. PRINCESS HALIME saved ground early, altered course to the six path entering the stretch and finished with good
courage. RENO TOUCH chased the winner two then three wide and was outfinished. KINGSTON TIME stalked the pace three wide and failed to respond.
BLAZING ZENNA was hung four wide into the first turn, settled within range then weakened in the stretch. RIPLEY EFFECT trailed.

Footnotes
SILVER MATT delayed the start while reluctant to load, stalked the pace through the turn, swung wide, rallied determinedly in the six path under right
handed urging and got up in the final strides. THE EQUINEST close up from the start, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead, set the balance
of the pace and held gamely under strong handling to finish on even terms with SILVER MATT at the wire. BON DEUX dueled for the lead two wide into the
stretch then was outfinished. FAST CALL stumbled at the start and failed to menace. UNCAPTURED LYON contested the lead along the inside into the
stretch and weakened late. DOMI was outrun. DRINKSONTHEBEACH was no threat. KRAZY HAWK had speed through the turn then wilted.
