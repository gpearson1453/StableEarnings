under a stretch drive, pulled clear of the rest of the field and was able t take third. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN inched over to the rail and saved ground,
moved into contention by the quarter pole, had no late kick. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK raced three wide in the middle of the filed, raced on the outside,
launched a bid at the three eighths pole, finished flat. PROMISING SHOES was off of the pace and three wide, advanced at the half mile pole and drew in
between foes, launched a bid at he three eighths pole and hooked another rival leaving the turn, fell into a set of four at the quarter pole, but had no late

raced in two path and saved ground, gained ground and built momentum, found room on the raill and closed well. SUGAR MAMAS CAKERY was racing mi
pack in the five path, quickly improved position on the outside, was stalking the pace after the half mile pole, but had no late kick. SALOMEINTHEHOOP
