into the first turn, chased the early pace, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid from the rail down the lane, altered out near the sixteenth pole and
hung in the late stages. CROONER stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run.
DESERT HIGHWAY trailed the field early on, was on the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. SILVESTRE raced in the five path into the
first turn, was in the six path into the lane and never a threat. COLOR FIELD chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the
