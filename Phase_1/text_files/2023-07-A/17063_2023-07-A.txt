INDY AGAIN stumbled at the start, raced three wide early, settled off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch, took over
and pulled away under urging. SOCIAL LADY raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out, rallied late and got up for second at the
wire. DRY HUMOR stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, gained a short lead, was no match for the winner, dug in and
lost second at the finish. RITABOOK set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn and faded in the stretch. HAPPY
UNION raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and lacked a rally. FANCY WARRIOR tracked on the inside, then chased two wide, between
rivals on the far turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
R AVERIE LYNN away alertly, showed good speed on the inside to set the pace, dueled with AWESOME VIEW entering the stretch, responded, dug in
determinedly, turned away that rival and drew clear. AWESOME VIEW chased the pace, bid two wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely
outside of the winner and was no match in deep stretch. DECOUPAGE chased close up early on the inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. TRUE
ATKA raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and closed belatedly outside.
