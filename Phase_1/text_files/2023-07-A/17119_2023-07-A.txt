YOUR ANALYSIS pressed the pace racing close up outside, vied two wide at the half mile marker, dueled briefly, took charge on the far turn and pulled
away under urging. AGARRAMESIPUEDES was off slowly, raced off the pace inside, advanced three wide on the far turn, rallied outside into second, dug
in late to hold that position and drifted in a bit bumping CENTURION at the wire. CENTURION raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn,
rallied on the rail turning for home, continued willingly on the rail to the finish and was bumped at the wire. ANTONOV raced four wide early, then two wide
off the pace, came wide into the stretch and flattened out. OKLETSGO raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. WESTOVER
raced two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired. DREAMING OF SMARTY set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner into the far turn
and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of CENTURION against the second place finisher was dismissed.

Footnotes
SEBASTIAN RUN showed good speed on the inside, dueled with HORSEPOWER on the turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside of that rival
and edged away passing the sixteenth marker. HORSEPOWER was a bit reluctant to load, showed early speed racing two wide, dueled outside of the
winner on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and came up second best. BINGO WAS HIS NAME was reluctant to load, raced off the pace, came
three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and dug in to earn the show spot. GLACIAL POWER broke in the air and was off slowly, raced off the pace, came four
wide into the lane, rallied mildly and was outkicked for third. ZONA DE AMIGOS raced off the pace between rivals, then inside on the turn and failed to
threaten. AVES MAKIN' WAVES chased inside, chased on the turn and tired. WALKING TESTIMONY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and did
not factor. LAKE CHAPALA was off slowly, raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn and faded. BIGLY DEAL chased close up early while three
wide, chased on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ROAD TO STARDOM set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the stretch, drifted out nearing the eighth pole brushing FATIH, put away that rival,
edged clear and held well under urging to the finish. ROL AGAIN DANCER chased close up outside, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane,
angled in, rallied on the rail, made a bid at the sixteenth pole and could not gain late. FATIH pressed the pace racing close up outside, chased ROAD TO
STARDOM on the turn, made a bid outside of that rival in upper stretch, was brushed at the furlong pole, dug in, then weakened. LOOKIN' SUPER chased
on the inside, advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly. AWESOMEBROTHERBILL raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. HE'S PURE
TALENT raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. CANTANKEROUS CAT was checked at the start, raced off the pace inside
and did not factor. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of FATIH against ROAD TO STARDOM was dismissed.
