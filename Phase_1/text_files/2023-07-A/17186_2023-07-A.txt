quarter pole and dueled in the lane but could not get by the winner. THORN CROWN chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, raced into traffic and checked sharply nearing the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch. CHAPARRITA raced off the pace on the
