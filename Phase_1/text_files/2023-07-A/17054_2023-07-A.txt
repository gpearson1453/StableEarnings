BOY IS SHE A LADY Broke sluggishly, in hand early, gained inside on the turn, eased out and then quickly opened up a lengthy lead without asking to win
in handy fashion. MADDIE'S SURPRISE Vied for the lead along the rail, kicked clear briefly, was soon collared and then lasted for the place. SWEET
DESANTIS Took back at the start, lagged behind, gained along the rail on the turn and finished with interest inside. PAJAMA JAM Vied for the lead four
across early, five wide into the turn, four wide out of it and tired. VARSITY DOLL Vied for the lead from between early, four wide into the lane and tired.
JOURNEY OF FIVE Vied for the lead from between three deep early, four wide into the turn and tired.
