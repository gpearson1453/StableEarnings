Footnotes
MAKARA went to the front to set all the pace, held off all challengers and won going away late. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE tracked the leaders on the
backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter pole and took aim at the leader in early stretch but couldn't catch the
leader but was a clear second. SPARKLE IN THE SKY was rushed up to press the pace from the two path to the three furlong marker and faded.
ITHOUGHTIKNEW was off the pace for a quarter then retreated while racing wide through the turn. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA saved ground throughout to no
avail.

Footnotes
ACES OVER DEUCES was roused to a clear lead to set all the pace and just out lasted the late closing rival. MAYA D saved ground to mid turn then angled
out to three wide and found another gear and rallied to gain on the leader late but was not enough. I'M GONE was hustled along to be forwardly placed off
the leader on the inside through the turn but had no late kick. FLY FREE was off the pace through the turn but lacked a late response. KARMA DE VILLE
was off a step slow then moved up from three wide to the turn and stopped.

AUNT IRENE sprinted to a clear lead, drew away on the turn then drifted out in the stretch but kept on to prove best. LADY PHYLLIS was hustled along to
be off the pace but was no match for the winner. MY MEADOW chased the leaders from the inside while racing evenly. FLAN hopped leaving the gate, was
pinched back and steadied slightly, rushed up going three wide through the turn and tired. ATHENIAN PRINCESS remained back.

CELEE'S LAST TE went to an unchallenged lead, pulled away on the turn and was kept to task in the stretch. FLO TIME raced in the middle of the pack to
the half pole then moved up from three wide through the turn and was clearly second best. SUE ETTAS GHOST raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch and chased the leaders home. FLIPLIT trailed the field while saving ground and passed tiring rival in late stretch. ROCKIN MARIE broke well
and settled off the pace to the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly.

Footnotes
MY MAN BIGGIE had no early speed then steadily advanced through the turn and split horses at the eighth pole and drew clear. I'M A COOL CAT raced in
the middle of the pack on the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn, tipping out to four wide in upper to take a brief lead, fought gamely in
the stretch. BIG JACK prompted the pace to the quarter pole and engaged the leader but lacked the late kick and was out finished. GRIFTER raced near the
back to the turn then moved up on the turn and flattened out. GO LAKER GO sprinted to the lead to the quarter pole then was collared and gave way.
DANCING COSSACK was under wraps to the half pole then was taken back, eased and was distanced.

HEAR ME ROAR was off the pace through the turn then drove past the leader in the final sixteenth for the win. RETRO RITA was forwardly placed in the
three path through the turn, drifted out in the stretch but proved to be second best. LIL' MISS MISCHIEF sprinted to a clear lead to deep stretch, was
collared in the final sixteenth and tired. PRAIRIE FIREBALL had no early speed, made a rail bid through the stretch and proved best of the rest. ABUELA
CORI raced in the middle of the pack, was bumped by inside rival entering the stretch but was never a threat. YA THINK raced in the middle of the pack
while saving ground, floated out entering the stretch and bumped outside rival but was never a factor.

QUEENS RANSOM tracked the leaders around the turn then made a three wide bid in upper stretch, was gaining in the stretch drive and was just up in the
final jump. PRINCESS JAYLEEN shared the command to the turn then fell back on the turn, made a rebid in upper stretch and took the lead at the quarter
pole and drew clear but was nailed in the final jump. CAJUN TRINITY shared the command to mid turn then shook loose but was caught at the eighth pole
and tired. MANDONA failed to menace. MISS IZZY BEE saved ground but was always back.
