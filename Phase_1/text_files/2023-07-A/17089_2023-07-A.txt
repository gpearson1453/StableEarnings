WELCOMETOMYWORLD pressed the pace racing close up outside of ELIKA, bid two wide, dueled with that rival on the turn, took over entering the stretch,
edged clear and then pulled away in the final sixteenth. ELIKA was bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug
in gamely, then yielded in midstretch. LA DE PELUCHE was fractious loading, raced three wide early, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, lacked a
winning bid and closed the gap on the runner up late. DUSTED steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and failed to
threaten. NANASQUAN was bumped at the start, stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn and faded. HOLY SKULL was bumped at the start, tracked
on the inside, gave way on the far turn and stopped.

ARTIE'S ANGEL vied inside for the early lead, pulled and was steadied entering the clubhouse turn, then set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far
turn, inched away in upper stretch, dug in gamely inside in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed at the wire. THE PENINSULA raced two wide off the
pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, steadied at the top of the stretch, angled out, made a late run outside, closed willingly in deep stretch and just
missed. KING OF DREAMS stalked close up two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled, dug in gamely between rivals in the stretch drive and battled
on to the finish. BURNING MAN raced three wide off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn and rallied mildly. CATATUMBO vied two wide for the
lead, dueled between rivals on the far turn and weakened. CORKMAN checked leaving the chute, then raced off the pace inside, between rivals at the
quarter pole and lacked a rally. SMILE BRYAN trailed the field while saving ground and failed to threaten. ENFORCER was in tight on the rail and checked
sharply leaving the chute, then tracked close up on the inside and faded.

Footnotes
CRUPI steadied between rivals on the first turn, settled between foes, then moved to the inside, chased inside on the far turn, commenced a rail rally past
midstretch and was going best late for the win. LIFE ON THE NILE set the pace on the inside, was pressed along on the backside, dueled on the far turn,
edged away passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly late. OCCASIONAL MOON raced three wide, then four
wide on the clubhouse turn, pressed the pace on the backside, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with LIFE ON THE NILE, then weakened in the final
furlong. KAW LIGA raced three wide and steadied on the first turn, settled off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. SHERIFF RONNIE hopped
at the start, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the backside, chased on the far turn and tired. COWBOY JIM tracked on the inside, gave way and
jogged home.

Footnotes
TOOT YOUR HORN moved up three wide on the backside, made a strong bid midway on the turn, dueled with CARATS FOREVER passing the quarter
pole, took charge and drew off energetic handling. CARATS FOREVER set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled with the winner at the quarter
pole, was no match for that rival and clear for the place spot. TWYLA chased between rivals, was steadied at the four and a half furlong marker, chased on
the turn and bested the others. BABY CAKES chased on the inside, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. FOOLS COLLIDE
veered out sharply after the break, then was outrun. AURALIA stalked the pace, chased on the turn and gave way.
