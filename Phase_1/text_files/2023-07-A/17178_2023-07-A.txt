Footnotes
CHARLIES MEDAL stalked the pace from the two or three path into the far turn, bid in mid-turn, dueled with pacesetter to near the quarter pole, cleared into
the lane then was kept to the task to the end to hold. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR trailed early while off the inside, moved through the three path on the far
turn when being asked for more, bid four wide into the lane then cleared the others while slowly gaining on the top one and settled for second best. MR
CREED raced in the two path through the turns and into the lane and lacked a closing kick while saving the show spot. CONNECT ME chased the pace
from the three path through the far turn, was well placed into the lane, got a bit shuffled as others were under a drive then stayed on to regain fourth late.
VINTAGE VINYL saved ground into the lane and weakened late. VERSATILE was restrained into the first turn when moving to the back, continued to trail
down the backstretch and into the turn, came off the rail in mid-turn, swung into the lane five wide and lacked a response. FIRING RANGE was off to an
alert start, raced in the two path into the far turn, was challenged by the winner in mid-turn, stayed with that one to near the quarter pole and was empty
turning into the lane.

Footnotes
GIADA set the pace on a clear lead while in the two path, was patiently handled into the lane, asked after straightening in the lane, widened to the eighth
pole then was put under a drive approaching the sixteenth pole, jumped starting gate tracks with seventy yards to go and lasted. SUPER LUXE chased the
winner into the lane while in the three or four path, looked beaten outside the eighth pole then re-fired approaching the sixteenth pole and was closing in.
AUNT NELDA was in the three path through the turn and into the lane, lacked a closing kick and just lasted for the show spot. UNDOUBTEDLY dwelt at the
start and spotted the field some seven lengths, hustled to get in touch with the field although trailing, continued near the inside into the lane and was under a
drive to just miss the distant show spot.

Footnotes
SMOOTH JUSTICE stumbled at the start, raced in the three or four path through the turn, bid five wide nearing the quarter pole, straightened in the five path
into the lane then launched a long drive while drifting in a couple of paths to edge up late. VOODOO JUSTICE vied for the lead while along the inside
through the turn, inched away from dueling challenger into the lane, was joined by the winner near the eighth pole then gave ground grudgingly. BETCHA
chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid three wide and between rivals into the lane then finished evenly. SECOND EXCHANGE stepped
in at the start, raced in the four path through the turn, bid four wide in late turn, came into the lane from the five path then just missed the show spot.
NIGHTTIME JUSTICE saved ground through the turn when never far back, came off the inside and into the three path for the drive and finished evenly.
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY raced in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the three or four path and never was a
factor. ROYAL TO BE vied for the lead through the turn while two wide then gave way entering the lane. EXPRESS LADY raced in the three path through
the turn and tired. ELUSIVE JUSTICE bumped at the start and forced inward, raced the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
never factored. MI ESTRELLA was bothered at the start when losing her path and was always back.

Footnotes

STAR FOR CORA raced in the three path, angled five wide on the far turn and rallied through the stretch to just miss. NAUTICAL MILE was unrushed early,
rallied six wide on the far turn and just missed the place. GRACIE'S KITTEN pressed the pace early in the four path, took back, then bid between rivals at
the half and faltered late. MADRE DI GRANDEZZA was unrushed early, saved ground on the far turn and then had no late bid. STUPENDOUS stalked the
pace outside of the leader, then gave way in the stretch. BLUE BLUE BAYOU was off awkwardly, vied between foes, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole
and improved position late. LUNAR LACE saved ground, then faded in the stretch. SEVENTEENSEVITYSIX was clear early inside, then gave way in the
stretch. FLAT OUT FREDA saved ground, then faded. CLOVERTOWNE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace in the three path, then pulled up after
