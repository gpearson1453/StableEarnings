Footnotes
EILAT set a clear pace in the two path and widened handily. ACQUIRED TASTE raced off the pace five wide, lugged in in upper stretch and rallied in the
two path. BIOTECHNOLOGY chased the winner three wide, could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch and held well enough for the show.
UNCAPTURED SKEET hit the starting gate, saved ground in midpack and lacked the needed rally. MISS GOLDIE failed to menace while racing two wide.
LUMINANT played no factor while racing three wide. MYSTICAL LADY broke a bit awkwardly then was bumped at the start, raced in range three wide and
faded through the lane. SCHNOOKIE RYAN was outrun outside. RATIONAL KATE broke inwardly and bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and
faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
CINCO HARLEY broke out and bumped an outer foe, prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, sustained that bid while
going out to the six path into the stretch, stuck a head in front passing the eighth pole, and just held off an outer foe to win. PLAYING WITH FIRE tracked
along the rail early, was coaxed between foes in the two path midway around the turn, swung out to the eight path into the lane, rallied down the center, and
just missed. PARALEGAL dueled for the lead in the four path before taking a short advantage while tipping to the two path early into the turn, was
challenged by an outer rival approaching the quarter, dug in from the four path into the stretch, lost the lead passing the eighth pole, but fought on to show.
MANHATTAN BOY vied for the early lead in the two path, lost position along the rail rounding the turn, and finished evenly from the two path in the stretch.
CATCH A TIGER got bumped by an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path, floated out to the nine path into the lane, and flattened. NESSO'S
LASTHARRAH rated in the three path but made no impact. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE had a slow start and always trailed around the five path.

Footnotes
FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP set the pace inside of foes, was nudged along in the two path rounding the turn, opened from the three path into the lane, and was
much the best. DOC BALLARD stalked in the two path, was hand ridden from the rail rounding the turn, cued while tipping out to the four path into the
stretch and chased on for place. NO MORE DEBT brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased from the five path into the turn, advanced outside of foes
rounding the turn, but evened out in the stretch to show. ANTILLEAN got a bit fractious in the gate and had an awkward start, was prompted along in the
four path but flattened turning into the lane. MIRO brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path and made no impact while
angling to the six path in the stretch. WARP SPEED BEAST was up close in the three path early but backed up rounding the turn. BIG BALLOONS rated
along the inside, shifted out around the turn, but did not threaten. ALWAYS GOLDEN was up close early but quickly lost ground and never menaced from
the four to six paths.

Footnotes
MINXY set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. FOREVER UNCAPTURED stalked the pace three wide, bid
near five-sixteenths pole, could no keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to be a clear second. ANATOMY raced in range four wide, bid
outside of the top two nearing the five-sixteenths pole but could match strides in the lane while holding well clear of the rest. NOVELLIE chased the pace
from the rail and lacked a closing bid. GLAZED GINGER had only brief speed two wide. AWESOME VALENTINE played no factor while racing three and
four wide. WILDCAT LUNITA trailed while racing four and five wide.

Footnotes
ZARAK (CHI) dueled for the lead inside, was driven from the two path into the stretch, and held gamely. LITTLE JUANITO vied for the lead with the winner
in the two path, continued to battle with the winner from the three path into the stretch, and was repelled late to place. ROCKIN ROLLER rated in the five
path, was roused from the four path midway around the turn, pushed out to the seven path into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe and was in tight
passing the sixteenth pole, but ran on for show. HAPPY RUNNER stalked in the four path, floated out to the eight path into the lane, drifted in slightly
passing the eighth pole, and stayed on. VAMOS VIEJO raced off the pace in the six path, fanned out to the center entering the stretch, and was gaining
late. BARONE CESCO tracked in the two path, tipped out around the five path into the stretch, bumped with an outer foe passing the sixteenth pole, and
flattened. CAPTURE THE TIME hopped at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, floated out to the five path around the turn, faded in the stretch,
and bumped between foes passing the sixteenth pole. MARLEY LUCK brushed with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path early but was no factor
from the nine path down the lane. GRAND BEY got pinched at the start and bumped with an inner foe, was wellback in the two path early and did not
threaten. BLAKENSTEIN got bumped and squeezed at the start and always trailed.

Footnotes
RARE JEWEL settled off the pace outside, raced in the four path around the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, closed outside, swept to the front near
the sixteenth pole and drew clear. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR was reluctant to load, prompted the pace in the three path, bumped in upper stretch, took the
lead soon after, led to the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner late. FORT ATTITUDE stalked the pace from the rail, squeezed through a narrow
opening at the rail turning for home, bumped leaving the three-sixteenths pole, vied inside to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. BIG BUCKSALOT
failed to menace while racing two wide. SLOW DECISION went evenly while racing three wide. PACIFIC LEGEND lacked early speed, raced in the three
path around the turn, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. GUNMAN chased the pace four wide and faded through the stretch. GLORIOUS
BUSINESS set the pace in the two path, was bumped between foes in upper stretch, battled past the eighth pole then retreated. GRAND ROCK was
fractious in the gate, had his head turned at the start and trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
FOGGY NOTE rated in the four path, moved up inside of rivals from the two path rounding the turn, angled out to the five path into the stretch, took the lead
passing the eighth pole, and was driven clear. MARTINI'S AMICA brushed with an outer foe at the start, travelled in range around the two path, was ridden
around the turn, shifted out to the seven path into the lane, and rallied for place. ROMASHKA stalked in the three path, was cued midway around the turn,
tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. SOPHIA LAUREN bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path, tipped to
the rail turning into the lane, but made no impact. EXAGERADORA tracked in the five path but was no factor. KRAZYKATKOUSIN set the pace in the two
path, was cued right handed at the top of the lane, but gaveway passing the eighth pole. HUGE G got bumped on both sides at the start, raced off the pace
along the rail, was steadied into the turn, and did not threaten. OUR LA DOLCE VITA got bumped between foes at the start, trailed in the two path, clipped
heels and fell around the seven-sixteenths point, and walked off.
