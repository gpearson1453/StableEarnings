AWESOME ANNMARIE stalked in the four path, was roused midway around the turn, bid from the seven path into the stretch, and was driven past an inner
pair just before the sixteenth pole while drifting out late. DIVINE CONNECTION pressed in the three path, bid under a ride rounding the turn, stayed on and
took a narrow lead while in the five path into the lane, but was overtaken by an outer foe nearing the final sixteenth to place. ELUSIVE MOLLY was slow into
stride and trailed in the three path, was coaxed to advance between foes early around the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and finished
evenly for show. SOLID TUNE set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead at the top of the lane, and faded in the final furlong. DEL REY DOLLY chased
in the five path but was no threat from the seven path in the stretch. LA CHICA LATERAL rated inside but never menaced.

UNIFIED WEEKEND settled up close in the four path, took over the lead while in the three path early around the far turn, tipped back out to the four path
into the stretch, drifted out inside the final furlong, but held gamely. SHANKAR bumped with an inner foe after the start, rated in the four path, ranged up
nearing the quarter, and ran on from the six path in the stretch for place. ELUSIVE EMPIRE tracked from the two to three paths, was ridden between foes in
the two path rounding the far turn, shifted out to the four path into the stretch, and got up for show. CAPTAIN ANTHONY stalked in the five path, was driven
in the three path around the far turn, tipped out to the six path in upper stretch, but faded. LOOKINASSAH was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace in
the four path but made no impact from the seven path down the lane. RED'S REVENGE was unhurried in the two path early and never menaced. KEANU
bumped with an outer foe after the start, set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead along the inside rounding the far turn, and yielded into the lane.

Footnotes
THE SKIPPER TOO settled off the early pace while racing in the five path around the first turn, moved up outside down the backstretch, pressed the pace in
the three path from midway down the backstretch until taking the lead near the quarter pole, drove clear in upper stretch and held safe. STEAL SUNSHINE
stalked the pace in the two path, tipped out in upper stretch and finished well. CANDY TYCOON set the pace in the two path, gave way near the quarter
pole and stayed on well enough to save the show. CAJUN'S MAGIC raced in range three and four wide between foes, had aim in upper stretch but was
one-paced through the lane. NOBLE DRAMA trailed inside, went four wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. LAUGHING BOY failed to menace
while racing three wide. TICKING chased the pace four and five wide and lacked a closing bid.

FLAG WOMAN raced up close along the inside, waited patiently along the rail rounding the turn, was roused passing the quarter, ran on thru an opening
along the rail into the final furlong, and inched past an outer rival in the closing stages. GITANA broke in and bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked in the
five path, ranged up approaching the quarter, bid from the five path into the lane, took a narrow lead while drifting in passing the eighth pole, but was caught
by an inner foe late. ADIOS BABE bumped between foes at the start, rated in the three path, angled out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on for
show. FREE TO ROAM broke out and bumped an outer foe, prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden around the turn, but faded in the stretch.
MEETMEATTHEBEACH set the pace from the three path into the turn, was cued from the two path into the lane, but yielded in the final furlong. CLASSIC

WARRIOR'S PRIDE stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, took over in in upper stretch and drove clear under steady right-handed urging. UNCLE
B raced off the pace two and three wide then rallied between foes to gain the place late. COMPETITIVE SAINT was bumped at the start, raced far back
inside, swung out in upper stretch and rallied widest to gain the show late. WORA bumped at the start, advanced four wide around the turn and flattened out
a bit in the final furlong. XY SPEED saved ground and failed to menace. HOPE IN HIM set a fast pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch,
switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and tired. NO NAME DUDE played no factor while racing three wide. CLASSICSTATEOFMIND chased
the pace inside and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN laid in range around the two path, was coaxed early around the far turn, bid from the rail into the lane, took the lead while drifting out into
the final sixteenth, and held on. YOU TALKIN TO ME steadied and bumped an inner foe into the first turn, tracked in the four path, was driven from said
position into the stretch, ran on under heavy urging encouragement down the stretch, but had to steady late to place. VLADISLAV stalked in the three path,
bid into the far turn, took the lead midway around the far turn and stayed on from the two path into the lane, but was caught on both sides passing the
sixteenth pole to show. CASHIER CHECK had to steady and got bumped by an outer foe into the first turn, rated in the three path, was ridden between foes
in the four path rounding the far turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, and finished evenly. SURROGATE raced off the pace in the five path and made
no impact from the eight path in the stretch. UNO TIGER was bumped by an outer foe and had to check into the first turn, trailed in the two path early and
did not threaten. SWASHBUCKLE set the pace in the two path but gaveway along the inside rounding the far turn. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN
INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG
