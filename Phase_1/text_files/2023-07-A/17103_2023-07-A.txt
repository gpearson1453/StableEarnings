Footnotes
INSOUCIANT broke alertly and set the pace on the inside while in hand, drew out leaving the turn and drew off to prove much the best under a vigorous
hand ride. AMORICA was well placed on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out three wide leaving the turn for aim on the winner but proved to be
no match for that rivals, clearly second best. PRINCESS PEANUT was settled early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and advanced, came four
wide into the lane but lacked the needed bid, bested rest. NINETYNINECARATS prompted the pace three wide while being ridden along, then weakened in
the drive. JUNIPER JUICE was off slowly, two wide on the turn and was not a threat. LINE BY LINE was outrun early and three wide on the turn and had no
response.

handed with the crop, came two wide into the lane, angled in to the inside by the sixteenth marker and was gaining late. OROCOVIX was well rated early
two wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, loomed boldly leaving the turn, but hung in the stretch. MARCUS JUNIUS was off slowly, settled
three wide and advanced four wide by the quarter pole but was empty in the stretch. MAKOTO set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
BRING THE MAGIC was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out when straightened for aim on the leader, closed well to get
up and edged away late to prove best, driving. BESSIE BLUE was bumped at the start, guided to the inside settling in the back early, commenced a run on
the rail on the turn, then finished well up the inside and gained the place award late. JAYLEE was rated well along the inside, advanced on the turn and
tipped out three wide leaving the turn and took over nearing the furlong marker and shook clear, but was caught late and lost the place award on the wire.
WINE IN THE DARK bobbled at the start, then was sent up to set the pace on the inside while clear, then tried to get out entering the backstretch, was
corrected quickly and drew clear on the backstretch, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened the final furlong. PEACE FIRE was settled early, three
wide on the turn and had no rally. SEARCH was bumped at the start, settled back three wide and lacked a serious rally. PURRFECT DANI chased the pace
three to four wide and tired. SAVANNAH'S SUGAR stalked the pace three wide and tired. WICKED KITTEN was three wide into the first turn, chased the
pace four to five wide on the backstretch and stopped.

was given one reminder right handed to prove best, ridden out. CHEETARA (CHI) was settled early, two wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane,
moved in a path and finished willingly to gain the place award. SWEET GRACIE was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled out by the sixteenth

pace while four wide early, three wide entering the turn and was asked nearing the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane but came up empty in the
stretch. CLOUT CHASER was off a step slow, failed to menace. MS. BUCCHERO tracked the pace four wide, ridden along on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
PROWLING TIGER tracked the early pace, saved ground on the turn and awaited room, slipped through on the inside leaving the turn, then had a long
drive with TWIST 'N TWIRL and prevailed late to prove best, driving. TWIST 'N TWIRL set the pace on the inside, came two wide into the lane and had a
long drive with the winner and dug in gamely but missed. IN EFFECT was reserved early three wide, four wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the
lane and finished willingly to be up for the show award. BENNY HAVENS was settled early two to three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn but flattened
out. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE was void of early speed, swung out wide for the drive and had a belated rally. WRECKING BALL prompted the pace three
wide while hard held, was asked two wide nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the lane. BRIGHT EYED EAGLE (IRE) was settled back early and
failed to menace. GREYZER was reserved on the inside and had no response.

Footnotes
IDIOMATIC stumbled badly at the start, recovered and got into stride, advanced on the inside on the backstretch, made a four wide bid for command on the
turn, went on even terms and dueled on the outside of CLASSY EDITION, then had a long stretch drive and prevailed late to prove best under left handed
crop urging and strong handling. CLASSY EDITION was three wide into the first turn while setting the pace, then was pressured on the inside by BATTLE
BLING, shook off that rival and was clear entering the far turn, then was confronted by the winner to her outside on the turn, was ridden along to match that
bid and dueled for command to the wire gamely but missed. MORNING MATCHA was taken back and crossed over to the inside, advanced on the turn but
lacked a winning rally while clearly besting the rest. ROYAL TAKE CHARGE was three wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three to four wide and then
tired the final quarter of a mile. GAMESTONKS was four wide into the first turn, settled three to four wide and tired. BATTLE BLING stalked the early pace
and then went up to press the pace on the inside but stopped.

DIALHERUP pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear off the turn and kicked away to prove best, driving. MO
TRAFFIC was away alertly and soon clear, then set a pressured pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn but could not go with that rival in th
lane while being clearly second best. KILMALEY was off a step slow, tracked the pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and weakened. WRIGHT UP
FRONT was off slowly, chased the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive.
