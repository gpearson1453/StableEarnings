HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY rushed up to prompt the pace from the inside to the quarter pole and took over and pulled away in the stretch. SNICKEL TE tracked
the leaders through the turn then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole and was a clearly second best. TALLANDLONG went to the front under a
pressured pace to the quarter pole when she was collared and tired, but stayed on for the show. STARLIGHT TWIST trailed the field through the turn then
moved out four to five wide in upper stretch but was empty and improved her position. FETCHING FURY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BIGPARTY NOWHISKEY tracked the leaders from three wide then was asked at the quarter pole and engaged the leader, matched strides to deep stretch
and edged away for the win. GUTFIELD battled for the lead early with outside rival then shook loose nearing the half pole to take the lead to the top of the
stretch then was headed again and dueled down the stretch while fighting gamely but couldn't fend off the challenge and proved second best. PUT PUT
PUT broke well then was forwardly placed from four wide then fell back slightly going into the turn, made a rebid in mid turn and was along for the show.
OLD FASHION TIME raced near the back in the early stages the moved up from five wide at the three eighths pole and kept on to improve is position.
SILENCE'S NATION dueled for the lead early then pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened. CAN DANZER trailed the field while saving
ground through the turn but was not a threat. YOU'RE MY ROCK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early then dropped back on the turn but was
not a factor.

Footnotes
GRAN EDITION tracked the leaders around the first turn then moved between horses at the five furlong marker to take the lead, edged away on the final
turn and drew off in the stretch. THE GREATEST EAGLE saved ground down the backstretch then moved out to three wide on the final turn to make a late
run and just got up for the place. JUST CALL ME KEN raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from two wide around the final
turn but weakened in the stretch drive and couldn't hold the place. FORT KNOX was off the pace down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on
the final turn and tired in the stretch, fell after wire and was vanned off. UNBROKEN SONG shared the command to the five furlong marker then pressed the
pace to the three furlong marker and gave way. MORHAWK trailed the field to the top of the stretch but remained back. NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST shared
the command to the five furlong marker then retreated.

marker and engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and dueled to the wire but was outkicked and proved to be second best. TULSA TIME sprinted to
the lead to the three furlong marker then was collared and weakened. TIGER BY HIS TAIL trailed the field to mid stretch and passed tiring rival.
