the place. LORD OF LEGENDS rated inside, tracked the pace through the turn, bid outside of that one into the stretch, then weakened late and held the
show. LEAVEITALONELARRY broke sharply from the gate and was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and got up for a share. CAPTAIN MAD JACK unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had a
mild late gain. R BOY BODE mid pack, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and ran evenly. FARM STRONG

Footnotes
LIGHTNING ROUND well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the
furlong marker, then drove clear and held. LADY YELLEN broke a step slowly from the gate, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch, then lacked then needed late kick. HOT HEELS well placed and outside, gained position four wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the lane and flattened out. LEAD PERFORMER set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, held sway into the stretch, then
weakened late and held a share. SIGN AND SEAL unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. STELLARATOR mid pack and outside, looped four and five wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and
had no rally. LISA MARIE passed tiring rivals. BLUE NEITH stalked the pace on the outside and faded on the two path through the second turn. FAST
FASHION well placed and off the rail, faded through the second turn.
