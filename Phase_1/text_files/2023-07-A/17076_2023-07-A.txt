Footnotes
MONEY PIT never far back to the turn, steady run to leaders and pulled clear in the final seventy yards under good handling. ANDY WALKS WITH ME
sharp to the lead stayed to deep stretch, tried hard no match. MONKEY ZONE unhurried to far turn from outside throughout gamely in stretch.
GREENSFELDER inside first turn, no room backed up, split horses half, moved up. DOWN TO BIZZNESS no speed throughout, passed tired oned from the
turn. WHERE'S LUCKY broke awkwardly from the gate, settled well back and failed to menace throughout while widest into stretch. FRADY pressed leader
to the half with nothing left on the rail from the far turn and backed up in the stretch run. THISPOINTINTIME between horses to far turn with no late
response. BELL CURVE tried to keep for a half, gave way with little resistance and galloped past the wire and walked off..
