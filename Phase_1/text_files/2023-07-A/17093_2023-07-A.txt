Footnotes
FLAT OUT STORMIN was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, remained up close around the far turn, urged
along the rail entering the lane, reached equal terms with BAYLEYWICK at the eighth pole, edged away and held firm. BAYLEYWICK sped to the lead in
opening stages and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the far turn, took on the inside challenge of FLAT OUT STORMIN
approaching the eighth pole, lost the lead to eventual winner but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. MY HAPPINESS rated just off the leaders
in early stages, edged closer and raced in aim approaching the midway point on the far turn, given cue and hustled along three wide entering the lane, could
not move on with the top pair, kept on and cleared the rest. BUG A BOO was allowed to settle in the back through early stages, hustled along late on the far
turn and failed to respond. SASSY AIN'T I tracked the pace near the inside, flattened under pressure around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.
REBEL RISING rated in range up the backstretch, stayed on two wide around the far turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHARM sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, continued on top and set a soft pace through early stages,
came under pressure from ICE ORCHARD nearing the quarter pole, roused for more turning for home, responded, repelled bid, clerade command and kept
to task. ICE ORCHID secured inside position while forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, given cue to go after
COASTAL CHARM midway around the far turn, raced in aim near the quarter pole, remained in striking distance in upper stretch but could not reach the
eventual winner and had to settle for second best. BIG BAD DIVA was allowed to settle through early stages although never far back, picked up the pace
three wide entering the far turn, moved up in close contention near the quarter pole, flattened off the top pair entering the lane, ran on and cleared the rest.
BUTTERBEAN was unhurried through early stages and raced in the back, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. JUBELLA
raced three wide in range up- the backstretch, weakened entering the far turn and, saved ground entering the lane and had no late response.
MISSYINTOMISCHIEF tracked the pace three wide up the backstretch, was ridden along just off the inside around the far turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE was nicely rated sitting off the top two flights up the backstretch, let out a notch and quickly advanced four wide late on the turn, was set down
three wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer, took over a slim lead from STROBE at the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. STROBE tracked the top pair
along the outside, moved up midway around the turn and cleared the lead at the quarter pole, continued on top two to three wide into the lane then got
collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole. ALBIZU was unhurried and raced in the back, swing four wide into the lane, finished with response and cleared
a share. OUR LAST CHANCE pressed the pace up the backstretch, got collared by STROBE midway around the turn and gave way. DEAN'S LIST raced in
range along the inside off the top flight going by the half mile marker, tipped two wide and chased two wide around the turn then gave way. OIL MONEY set
a pressured pace and came up empty mid-way around the turn.

Footnotes
TX WOMEN FOR ARTS broke on top at the start then quickly came under pressure from KISS, vied along the inside into the turn, began to edge away from
rival while taking on the challenge of CROWN IMPERIAL midway near the five sixteenth pole, battled on gamely along the rail, got headed for the lead at
the eighth pole, dug back in, poked a head out in front and refused to be denied. CROWN IMPERIAL raced in contention just off the embattled top pair,
moved up to challenge TX WOMEN FOR THE ARTS midway around the turn, dueled outside of rival into the lane, put a head in front going by the eighth
pole, dug in heads apart in the final sixteenth and got denied in final strides. CALEBS LADY raced off the early pace, was ridden along into close contention
late on the turn, hustled along three to four wide into the lane, was no match for the clear top pair but stayed on and cleared a share.
STEALTHESPOTLIGHT raced in range up the backstretch, weakened midway around the turn, came three wide into the lane and had no late response.
KISS dueled with the winner running through the backstretch, could not match strides past the midway point around the turn, weakened and continued to
tire in the drive. POISED was off a step slow at the start, lacked speed and raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never threatened.
ANCHORS AND SPURS raced of the pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention.

YUUGIRI sped to the lead at the start, cleared and angled inside, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, given cue two wide turning
for home, had more left in reserve, turned back bids, widened advantage and kept to task. BLUEFIELD rated just off the early pace along the outside,
picked up the tempo four wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and nipped foe for place. MY FIRST PEARL was off slow at the start, trailed
the field, swung five wide into the lane, rallied and got nipped for place. FIRE ON TIME was off to a good start and angled inside, tracked the pace up the
backstretch, continued in contention around the turn, came two wide into the lane, remained a key contender a furlong out then came up empty in late
stages. ADALINE JULIA was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, chased two to three wide around the turn then weakened. SPANISH DELIGHT
tracked the leader in the opening quarter, hustled along two to three wide, raced up close around the turn then gave way. AQUILA MOON raced off the early
pace, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn and failed to threaten. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE raced off the pace, saved ground and failed to move
into contention.

Footnotes
BOLT FORTY FIVE sped to the lead at the start, set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, came two wide into the lane, widened
advantage and kept to task. ALVAARO tracked the pace setter up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid for command near the quarter pole, sustained
bid through the lane and finished second best. WESTONS WILDCAT was forwardly placed up the backstretch, chased two wide in contention around the
turn, continued with response in the lane and captured show. COSMO raced off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide around the turn, gained
position and got outnodded for show. GRAND DESIGN was forwardly placed along the inside, sustained bid to the eighth pole then came up empty.
KINGSWOOD raced in contention in opening stages, quickly dropped back nearing the half mile marker, retreated and jogged in. HI YAH came away a step
slow at the start, briefly rushed up into closer contention then dropped back.

response and got up for show. FRANKLYGREAT vied for the lead up the backstretch, cleared command around the turn, continued on top into the stretch

contention through the early going, sustained bid around the turn then faded in the lane. EYE OF THE PANTHOR raced off the pace along the outside and
never threatened. MACHO FORTY FIVE showed response in early stages then retreated. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET failed to move into contention. RAYS
