Footnotes
TIER ONE never far back, closed with a burst of speed along rail rail under right then left handed urging and got up in the final strides. K KID with the
second flight three wide, rallied determinedly in the five path and just missed. FAST AS FAST CAN B bumped at the start, set the pace in the three path,
shook clear on the turn then weakened in deep stretch. YOU'RE OUT bumped at the start and failed to menace. GOOD MUSIC was no threat.
CONSTITUTION COAL chased the early pace along the inside and was through after a half. SWING STATE passed tiring rivals. RAY'S EMPIRE was no
factor. MAN'S CHOICE was outrun. SOL DEL NORTE was through early. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, TIER ONE HAS
BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
