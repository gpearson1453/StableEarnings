Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE MOON in the main body up the backstretch outside, ranged up five wide to challenge five wide turning for home, put a head in front past
the furlong marker, drew clear under steady handling. LIGHTENING MO lacked early foot off the inside, three to four wide in the turn when still off the pace,
steered out widest approaching midstretch, closed with good resolve to be up for the place, not a real threat to the winner. PORTO DEL ACE forwardly
placed three wide up the backstretch, advanced, challenged four wide into the lane between foes and inside the winner, could not match strides with that
one the final furlong nor contain the runner up, proved game for the show. MISS ST. CLAIRE close from the start, chased the clear into and through the
turn, challenged three wide and between foes into the stretch, briefly gained the advantage in upper stretch, began to gradually weaken soon after,
outkicked late for the show while along the rail at the wire. STARSHIP NOLA last to leave, trailed for over a half, came five wide for the drive, displayed
some belated interest down the middle of the strip to improve position. SWEET ALEXIS pulled onto the main track inside, raced in traffic in mid pack through
the turn, lodged a brief and mild bid in the two path between horses when straightened for home then faltered. GRACE HAZEL in the second flight early, fell
back, lacked a closing kick. REMEMBERIN RONALD sprinted clear soon after the start to show the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace into and
through the turn along the inside, gave way when headed in upper stretch. YOCKEY BETTERFLY forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady
retreat before a half.

Footnotes
JOLLY TOMMY broke with the field, stalked the pace three wide up the backstretch, fell back off the two leaders early in the turn, asked along midway on
the bend, advanced and challenged outside the dueling duo into the lane, drove steadily clear under pressure. CRIMSON STORM away well, dueled up
front along the inside, continued to alternated up front into and through the turn, offered little resistance to the winner in upper stretch, drew well clear for the
second spot. FLASHY BOY GOES broke on top, set or forced the pace in the two path for five furlongs, weakened from between the top two upper stretch,
comfortably saved the show. QUARTER RAT went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. JAMAICAN ME fell back, moved off the inside, three
wide into the lane, failed to menace while picking off a couple of tiring rivals late. BAQUERO'S BIND in mid pack while racing between horses, lacked a
closing response through the stretch,. TIME TO MOVE void of speed, improved position along the inside turning for home, faltered the final furlong to lose
several spots. SIR POKERFACE last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE JEN outrun early while off the inside, asked along late backstretch, dropped to the rail when idling along second turn, slipped inside the leader to
challenge entering the straight, drove clear under firm handling. EMPTY NET dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a daylight advantage before a
half, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the final turn, allowed the winner the inside in upper stretch, proved no match for that one late, held
sway for the place. MEAN AMERICAN broke with leaders, settled off the pace, continued one paced in lacking a late kick, finished up best of the rest.
BEAUTIFUL ENDING lacked early foot, four wide into the stretch, improved position a bit with some mild, belated interest. ANN'S STORM last away, trailed
in lacking early foot, improved along the inside second turn, in a bit tight when straightened for home, went flat the final furlong. US SECOND CUTE PIE
lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally when called on. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN broke on top, dueled early outside the runner up, fell back off that one after
a half and continued to fade.

EASY CHANCE broke out, cleared to the inside, set all the pace, drew out through upper stretch under a steady hand ride, coasted home to win ridden out.
PALANTE broke back, void of speed, continued back while well out in the strip through the turn, came five wide for the drive, finished willingly down the
center of the strip to be far clear of the rest, no a serious threat to the winner. JACKIE MOON last away, settled off the pace and the inside, asked along
three to four wide turning for home, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. COUNT ON RAIN back off the pace and the rail, improved through
some traffic stretch, outkicked for the show spot while along the rail at the end. ST JOE void of speed, shuffled back to trail early in the turn, roused three
wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER chased the winner while off the inside for over a half, had
little left the final furlong to lose several positions,. ETBAUER'S SECRET settled off the pace, backed up through the lane. GEM OF CARLOS tired while
racing outside. SABERMAN forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded.

CHIEF CHARLIE closest to the leader off the inside, joined that one from the outside after a half, long, spirited duel to the wire, narrowly gained the nod at
the end. MI SOLUTION underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke on top, showed the way past the wire the first time, continued to set the pace onto
the backstretch, responded when confronted by the winner late backstretch, alternated up front inside that one to the wire, narrowly missed, held clear for
the place. GAMETIME GLADIATOR off the early pace off the inside, moved up to race in the second flight between horses into the far turn, chased the top
two into the straight, slowly closing the gap on that pair along the inside. OVERANALYTICAL within striking distance, fell back while four wide into the lane,
went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing punch. READY SHOES broke back, lacked speed, continued to lag into the far turn, improved position through
traffic down the stretch with some mild, belated interest. MAZING MARK last away, trailed early, improved turning for home then flattened out. PAYNT
BATTLE settled in mid pack, raced five wide out of the final turn, had little for the run to the wire. SCORING DRIVE raced in the second flight early, faded.

HOME VISIT broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, headed, vied three wide through the final turn, rebroke turning for home and drew strongly clear.
DRILLING REPORT in the second flight early along the inside, launched an early bid up the inside to wrest control just before a half, narrowly showed the
way through most of the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, remained clear for the second spot. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF in a bit tight at
the break, lacked speed, crept closer through the second turn, closest to the top two past the furlong marker, had little for that pair late, narrowly gained the
nod for the show. DREWHUSTLE pulled early when a bit slow to settle, raced on the outside through the second turn, mild late interest to miss the show.
BIND FAITH broke back, trailed most of the way in failing to respond. CALCULATED broke in, moved up to duel inside the winner, allowed the runner up the
inside late backstretch, vied between horses into the far turn, gave way in the drive.

home, took command, edged clear under steady handling. GIRL LIKES BLING in the second group while along the inside, cut the corner into the lane,
chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one in the run to the wire, held sway for the place. EMILY'S BULLET slipped a bit at the
start, raced back early while outside, improved a bit in the five path late in the turn, steered out a bit more for room approaching midstretch, finished willingly
to be closing the gap on the runner up. BOHEMIAN JIGGLES lacked speed toward the inside, two path into the lane, shifted out with a furlong to run,
improved position with some late interest. TAP GALORE veered in break, was straightened to race in the main group after moving out early, closer four wide
late in the turn, flattened out through the lane to finish up evenly. SARAH'S COURT broke with the field, mid pack and inside up the backstretch, shuffled
back then steadied along the rail into the turn, fell back,moved out, six wide into the lane, improved slightly. CUSTOM SUNSHINE broke with the leaders,
vied up front while between horses, continued to press the issue into the lane, weakened through the lane. CRUSIN LIKE A CAT broke back, lacked speed,
five wide into the stretch, lacked a serious closing response. HART'S PRETTY GIRL fell back to trail after the start, continued to lack speed, fanned seven
wide into the lane, also lacked a meaningful response. JAYDYN CAT moved up to set the pace and clear after the break, continued to show the way turn,

REGINALD AURELIUS with the pace while being asked to maintain inside position early, continued to narrowly show the way through the turn, shook clear
into lane, held. AWESOME CAJUN fell back off the early pace, moved off the inside, steered out wider to be five wide into the lane, finished willingly to earn
the place while well out in the strip, slowly getting to winner. MAGIC BIND last to leave, void of speed for three furlongs, fanned seven wide exiting the turn,
also showed some late mettle to be in time for the show. WILDCATS'S MEOW fell back after the start, raced inside of several rivals entering the stretch,
improved through traffic. MARVINS' WARRIOR with the early pace outside the winner, dueled with that one through the turn then weakened through the
stretch. ARKANSAS ZONG broke near the rear, continued back, was six wide and between horses into the lane while outside the runner up, finished up
evenly. FRIEND'S DO CARE forwardly placed early outside, four wide into the turn, weakened through the stretch. TYLER'S SENSATION prompted the
issue early out in the strip, shuffled back three wide early in the turn, continued to fade stretch. FLASH OF RAIN broke sharp, pressed early, angled in a bit
behind the dueling leaders midway on the turn, traffic late in the bend, gave way.
