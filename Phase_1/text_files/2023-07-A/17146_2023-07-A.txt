Footnotes
LET HIM BE pressed the pace, challenged for the lead into the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best. DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH set a
pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel and was outfinished in a long drive. MUSICS MY VICE raced mid pack along the inside, lacked a rally
and won the battle for show. TATAS JOE MARK raced mid pack, offered a mild bid only and was outfinished for third. MICKEYS TRAIL failed to contend
and showed little. NACHO GRANDE was away alertly, never far off the pace while racing towards the outside, fell back on the turn and was not urged
through the stretch. SPEED BUMP BOB failed to contend and showed little. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT,
DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

WESTLAND was void of early speed, rallied around the turn, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up late and drew clear. LUCKY AND DARING
bumped twice at the start, vied past the eighth pole, inched away, led to late stretch and was outclosed. BLAME THE TEQUILA pressed the pace,
challenged three across on the turn, leveled off and settled for show. BULLDACIOUS KROME dropped inside past the gap, rallied into the turn, angled out
for the drive, bid willingly, drifted in late and hung. DYNAMIC WOMAN raced close to the pace, bid and came up empty. ROCKETT'S RED CITY raced mid
pack between horses, lacked a stretch response and was outrun. SKYSPEIGHT broke out, bumped twice at the start, vied to the turn and gave way. GONE
KAT raced outside and had brief speed only. WHY FOR raced outside, had brief speed only and was outrun.

ZANARAZZI set the pace, responded to pressure, drew off for a clear lead and held safely. TURN ON ARCH pressed the pace along the inside, shifted out
into the turn, challenged two across, fell back and was no match late. IT'S SAUL RIGHT was never far off the pace, raced outside and was along for show in
a steady effort. LEMON DROP LADY bumped at the start, was never far back, raced inside and lacked a stretch response. SWEET TEMPEST broke out
and bumped at the start, was rated far back, taken outside and passed tiring rivals. CUZ I CAN DARLING pressed the pace, stopped into the turn and had
no further response. MOVING VIOLATION raced close to the pace towards the outside, stopped into the turn, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
MARK IT DOWN was sent to the front to set the pace, drew off leaving the turn and extended the lead while kept to task. MARTINI GIRL was away alertly,
stalked the pace while racing outside, lacked the needed late response and finished second best. ATTILA'S ACE stalked the pace while racing between
horses, bid inside on the turn, lacked a rally and was clearly best of the rest. SHAME ON WHISKEY hit the gate and was off slowly, was void of early speed,
raced wide early and improved position in a stead effort. KID CUSTER pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. STREET MARK came in
at the gap, stalked the pace along the inside, was steadied into the turn and stopped. RUNNING ROGUE broke in, failed to contend and showed little. EL
HUARACHE PRIETO raced mid pack in an even effort and was outrun. VIPER BREATH came in at the start, taken wide and showed little under mild
urging. STORM CENT was pushed in at the gap, checked along the inside, dropped back and failed to contend.

FIRST ZAP was unhurried early, rallied around the far turn, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. OCCURRENCE rallied
four wide into the second turn, assumed command, drew clear, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. WHAT A MEMORY broke in, vied two across to the
second turn, fell back, came again and earned show in a game effort. KATZIE BABY raced outside, rallied into the turn to challenge, fell back, tired and
gave way. SAL GAL saved ground mid pack, angled out on the turn and lacked a bid. MS JAZZ vied inside to the second turn, tired and stopped.
