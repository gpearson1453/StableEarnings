COO BIRD was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. GUNZIG STINGER was up close,
forced the pace on the turn and had the lead in mid stretch but failed to hold. ROYAL BIZ was away alertly and a factor on the turn but with a bid from the
three path in mid stretch was outfinished. FOREST SELECTION tracked the early leaders from the inside and had a good position on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch needed more. QUICK RELOAD was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
STRONG ATTITUDE was off the pace and showed little while outrun.

DOTTED LINE broke inward, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch held sway. BRADY O'BRADY was in tight early and saved
ground on the turn but with a bid in mid stretch was no match for the winner. BE THE CHANGE was in touch and roused on the turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. LOQUACIOUS checked early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was up for a
share. GLITTER MOUNTAIN set the pace but was headed on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. BEYOND
BORDERS was in range but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON BRADY
O'BRADY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START RESULTED IN DOTTED LINE BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOR FOURTH.

STRONG ENDING was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BIG TIME LOUIE was unhurried
early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for place. VINNIE VAN GO stalked the early leader, raced evenly
on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. SHAKOO MAKOO was off slow and had a clear lead on the turn but gave way.
VENOMOUS STATE was in mid pack and roused on the turn but had no response. LETTING LOOSE was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. SUMMER RETREAT was well back, trailed the field on the turn and failed to fire.

VETTORI KIN (BRZ) was in range, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. A I INITIATIVE showed no
speed, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. HALF LIT was away alertly, saved ground on the far
turn and finished well. UNILATERAL was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. WILLIAM
BOY was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was hustled
early but headed on the far turn and had nothing left. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but from the six path at the top
of the stretch was not a factor.

HEADING WEST was away alertly, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. PICK A PENNY was
in range, had a good position on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best while finishing on the rail. LOKI'S
LIGHTNING showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. HERMIONE
GRANGER was off slow and dueled from the inside on the turn but had nothing left. EYE GOT IT GOOD was up close early but chased on the turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty. LEA'S SUNSHINE was well back, showed little and was never in contention. SILENT WARNING was
off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was outrun.

Footnotes
NAVAL OFFICER set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was
unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. DRAGON'S KEY tracked the early leaders, raced
evenly on the turn and finished well. NO MORE was in touch, moved up on the turn and had a bid from the five path at the top of the stretch but was
outfinished. SANTIAGO SALSA had no speed and was roused on the turn but was no real threat. IRIE ISLAND MAN was in mid pack but chased on the
turn and was not a factor. C BY THE SEA was away alertly but lost ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. SALT
MINE TEDDY was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.
