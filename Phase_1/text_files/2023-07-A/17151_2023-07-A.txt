Footnotes
STORMANDY Vied for the lead along the two path, took charge on the last turn, responded, drifted out with a furlong to go and held sway. REMEMBER
NORMANDY In hand four wide, five wide into the lane and rallied wide. UNCLE TACO Hard to load in the gate, broke slow, angled to the rail, gained inside
into the lane, chased and finished with interest. MOBOT Lagged back, saved ground, gained inside, altered out at the sixteenths pole and finished well.
JACKSON BAY Close up five wide, four wide on the last turn tracking the winner and weakened. UNCLE MILTIE Vied for the lead along the three path after
a half, tracked on that path on the last turn and tired. BALI RIDDIM Lagged back, two path on the last turn and finished wide. NEWPORT MITTENS Broke
sluggishly, four wide into the backstretch and then saved ground on the last turn while trailing. THAT'S MY BUSINESS Forced the issue four wide early,
close up to the last turn, tired and then was eased over the wire.
