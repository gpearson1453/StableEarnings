Footnotes
ISLAND D'LITE broke alertly and immediately sprinted clear, set the pace near the inner rail and was kept under pressure in the drive. SIR SMOAK saved
ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. POLITICAL DECISION , outside the winner around the turn, chased that one
to upper stretch and faded. SUPERSTITIEUX , three deep on the turn, loomed at the head of the stretch and weakened. ON THE ENGINE , steadied when
shuffled back mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, remained inside in the stretch and was no threat. LITTLE BAY , two wide on the
turn, gave way.

Footnotes
AWESOME STRIKE steadied early, edged up then waited near the far turn, dropped in to quickly gain, angled out past the five sixteenths, forged five wide
outside foes and took command in mid stretch, kicked away and was kept to task. ELUSIVE , between foes early, was put to a ride while in the clear into the
far turn, angled out, circled four wide with chase into the lane, shifted out widert for the final furlong, kept on with good energy and nabbed the place at the
wire. HAY CHIEF , taken back to be well off the early pace, saved ground to the lane, eased out and split rivals in mid stretch then continued on willingly.
STELLAR LUTE , well placed stalking inside, eased out and edged up behind the duelers into the stretch, chased then flattened out late. GIANTSBANE
settled off the inside, gained four wide past the three eighths, bid three deep into the lane, vied past mid stretch then weakened. LONGWORTH lagged
back, circled the second turn and had a belated run. IMAGINE IT steadied early, edged up off the rail then was stalled behind a tiring rival near the three
eighths, dropped in but lacked a solid recovery. NORTH HIGHLAND , between rivals early, stalked the pace, bid to a short lead past the five sixteenths,
dueled into the lane then weakened in mid stretch. GETTIN'DOWNONIT was sent wide to clear, dropped in and set the pace, was collared past the three
eighths, vied inside foes into the lane then tired. SILK PRINCE , sent from the gate, rated off of the leader under the wire the first time, raced three deep into
the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
B WEST gained a two wide lead near the three eighths pole, opened up approaching the stretch and was under urging in the drive. STREET HUSTLE
stumbled badly at the break, advanced four deep on the turn then flattened out. SPONSORED , a forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn,
checked in tight quarters inside the five sixteenths pole and finished willingly. CARBONITE , steadied at the start, checked in close quarters near the five
eighth pole, raced in the three path around the turn and gave way. PHRA PHROM , no factor, drifted wide leaving the turn. MUNGO MAGIC showed speed
along the inner rail and faltered turning for home. An objection by the rider of SPONSORED against STREET HUSTLE for alleged interference near the
quarter pole was not allowed.

TWO BY TWO settled well back of the dueling leaders while saving ground, took closer order cutting the corner into the lane, angled out and edged up
behind foes, shifted out further and worked through between horses near the sixteenth pole, surged under solid hand asking when clear and just got up.
SUPER E settled far back while saving ground, continued inside and progressed past the three sixteenths, stayed towards the rail and forged clear in deep
stretch, kept on gamely but was nipped at the wire. BRILLIANT CHASE rated behind foes early, edged up between runners into the far turn, advanced three
wide into the lane, altered in for the final furlong and churned on. TRANSIT secured the inside into the first turn and raced closest to the embattled leaders,
gained under a ride and to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths, shifted out for the drive, had aim in mid stretch but one paced late. PAPAL LAW ,
away alertly, got into a duel to the inside of GUNSLINGER (IRE) passing the wire for the first time, carried that battle into the lane, wandered outward while
going head to head past mid stretch then faded late. GUNSLINGER (IRE) broke inward and tossed his a head a bit when corrected, engaged PAPAL LAW
from the outside early on, sparred past mid stretch then weakened late. DANCING TIL DUSK , three deep early while off the duel, gained four wide into the
stretch to loom, failed to sustain near mid stretch, drifted out and weakened. DOWN COLD , wide and under a ride into the far turn, faltered, was eased
through the final furlong then vanned off.

Footnotes
HAINT BLUE lacked speed, was three deep entering the turn, moved to the inner rail leaving the turn, raced in the two path in the stretch drive, closed
inside ITALIAN WAR CRY and was up approaching the finish. ITALIAN WAR CRY , two wide on the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch, opened up in
mid stretch and tired late. HOW SWEET SHE IS raced in the two path around the turn failed to menace and passed a tired horse late. KENTUCKY REIGN
set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead turning for home, weakened and shied from the rail near the sixteenth pole. LADY ENSIGN , three wide
stalking the pace around the turn, weakened. GOLDRUSH HOTTIE chased the pace, faltered and was eased. CONNIE'S DANCE , along the inner rail
down the backstretch, chased the pace to the turn, gave way and was eased.

CARMEL SUNRISE vied inside a rival early on, was deftly rated back off the lead and angled out to track, edged up into the far turn, went on the attack near
the five sixteenths, wrested command into the lane, spurted clear under a drive then held firm through the final furlong. TANKA TOUGH rated well back past
the three quarter pole, gained along the rail into the far turn, sustained past the five sixteenths, eased out with pursuit, raced on her left lead past the furlong
grounds but kept on willingly to the wire. NAMI had speed between foes into the first turn then rated back off the leaders, edged up just off the inside into the
far turn, angled three wide to have aim into the stretch then went evenly through the final sixteenth. KRONE broke a step slow, moved up between runners
past the half, angled out, circled four wide into the stretch, shifted back in and kept on with effort. FORGOTTEN GIFT , between foes early, dropped in to
save ground through the backstretch, checked when trying to advance into the far turn, recovered to save ground past the five sixteenths, swung out in
upper stretch and finished with interest. QUEEN OF THE DANCE lost ground four wide, edged up nearing the far turn, dropped in some to pursue, bumped
with a rival in mid stretch then flattened out. TIME GOES FAST , wide, was floated out around the far turn, remained wide for the drive and had a slight gain.
CATCH THE KITTEN rated two wide, moved up near the half mile pole, checked in tight soon after, checked again and bumped with a rival in mid stretch
then kept on trying while towards the inside the final seventy yards. NUWANDA vied outside a pair of runners before clearing, opened up past the three
quarter pole, set the pace towards the rail, was engaged near the five sixteenths and weakened past the three sixteenths. GINGER GIRL , four wide, was
not a factor. SMOKE N SIN was outrun. ALWAYS FORWARD , between runners, was taken up near the far turn.

INDIAN LAKE , urged soon after the break, prompted the pace outside PIR STOP MAN, engaged that one turning for home and gamely prevailed in an
extended drive. CYNERGY'S STAR stalked the pace around the turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch and rallied outside the winner.
PIT STOP MAN , sent leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail while setting a pressured pace, failed to match strides with the winner late but finished
gamely. STEINBECK , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. WHISKEY AND YOU ,
outrun, drifted to the five path turning for home.

Footnotes
SPYCRAFT , quickly to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure around the turn, responded when put to asking past the
quarter pole, opened up under a drive leaving mid stretch and held firm. HUNTER JOE rated off the inside, raced between foes nearing the lane, swung out
five wide and closed steadily to earn the place in the final yards. BY THE SEY SHORE rated off the pace while saving ground, worked outward to be about
four wide in upper stretch, closed to the inside of HUNTER JOE but was out kicked by that one for second. BOSS IS A PAL , well placed while saving
ground just off the leaders, failed to kick on under pressure in mid stretch and faded. SO STREET prompted the pace two to three wide outside the winner,
saw that one get away past the three sixteenths and faded. VALIANT VINNY broke in the air, regrouped and edged up four wide into the turn, circled
stalking the leaders into the stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch and faded. SEMPER FI hopped at the break, raced wide into the turn and failed to
respond.
