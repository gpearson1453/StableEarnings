BOTTLE OF SMOKE stalked wide, advanced four-wide to challenge final turn, dueled stretch, drew out from the sixteenth pole. ETU BABOU, well placed
outside, took over between horses mid final turn, dueled inside stretch, gave best, gradually gave way from mid stretch. MAYBE SOMETIME tracked leader
between horses, steadied into final turn, advanced outside for show. SIDE STREET DAVE, well placed inside, finished evenly. REALLY SLOW, back early,
advanced outside, lacked needed rally. DRUM AND BASS saved ground, faded. UNUSUAL ACCOUNT had speed outside, opened up out of first turn, took
inside, challenged into final turn, gave way mid turn.
