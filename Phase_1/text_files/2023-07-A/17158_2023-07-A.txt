Footnotes
ROSAS WAY saved ground into the stretch, altered course to the six path nearing the furlong marker, surged under strong handling and got up in the final
strides. AULD LANGE SYNE had speed from the start along the inside, dropped back before a half, came on again three wide through upper stretch to
make the lead late then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. NOBLE BEHAVIOR well placed, offered a mild bid four wide into the stretch then
leveled off. LEOMBRUNO set the pace around the clubhouse turn in the two path, dropped inside, was engaged before a half, battled until deep stretch then
was outfinished. LAST DROP OF WINE hopped hitting the gate at the start, rushed to contention, battled for the lead two wide into the stretch then
weakened late. GILES was no factor. ADANO no threat and returned bleeding from the nostrils. PERCENTAGE was through after a half.

Footnotes
EMPIRE'S FIRE bumped at the start, vied for the lead in the three path, split rivals two wide nearing the top of the stretch and shook clear late under left
then right handed urging. WOODLAND WALK pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no
match for the winner. SO DIALED IN stalked the pace three wide and went evenly. IT'S YOUR CALL bumped at the start then failed to menace. IRISH
UNITY set a pressured pace along the inside until the middle of the turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and faded late. OBIWAN bobbled at the
start and was no threat. CREDIT RIVER trailed.

Footnotes
MY TWO AUNT JOANS unhurried along the inside, angled out in upper stretch, closed fast five wide and was along in time. LED TASSO chased the pace
into the stretch, made the lead late two wide then couldn't handle the winner. ARMOR PIERCING slow early, found his best stride late four wide.
AWESOME ENOUGH sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. UNCLEJACKOMO had a mild
late rally two wide. MASTER chased the pace two wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ONEMORANDTHECHECK well placed, failed to
respond. STRONG AGAIN was through early.
