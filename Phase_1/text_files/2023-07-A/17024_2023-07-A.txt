step slow, trailed the field on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. LIL GREEN MACHINE stalked the early leaders and was
roused on the turn but needed more. ACE DESTROYER was away alertly and had a mild bid on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. ARTIE MY BOY tracked the leaders from the outside and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late

THY KINGDOM tracked the early leaders from the inside, had a slim lead on the far turn and was much the best. VICTORY MARCH stalked the early leader
and dueled on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. QUIET REBEL was unhurried early, roused on the far
turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. FOUR BOUNCE set a pressured pace and was a factor on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch faded. DYNAMIC MISSION was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT was in touch but
chased on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
PRIVATE LAKE was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. FOUR KNIGHTS set the pace
and had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS was in range and had a mild gain on
the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. THELONIOUS stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch had no kick. LOQUACIOUS was off the pace and gained ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch was no real threat. CALMING INFLUENCE was in touch but chased on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had no impact.
DOODLE DANDY was well back and showed nothing while outrun.

WILBERFORCE showed speed from the inside, had a clear lead on the turn and drifted through the stretch but held sway. EIN WAHRER SOLDAT was
hustled early, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well on the rail. STREET MAX had no speed, was hustled along on
the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. BREACH OF TRUST stalked the leader and was roused on the turn but had
nothing left. AMEN TO THAT was off the pace, showed little and was never a threat. GREY DECEPTION was well back and showed nothing while never in
contention.
