Footnotes
BAYOU MELODY Vied for the lead four wide early, took charge nearing the quarter pole, opened up some and under pressure proved best. UNICORN
SALLY In hand along the rail, responded inside and finished well. A DAB WILL DO Hard to load, broke slow, unhurried two path on the turn, angled out and
closed well. DOSAGE AND MIMOSAS Forced the issue five wide early, four wide on the turn, chased and weakened. INOUAINTALKINTOME Broke in the
air, well placed along the two path into the turn, four wide out of it and finished wide. CAT GLASSES KATHY Five wide into the turn, four wide around it and
tired. DRAW OFF Five wide early, four wide on the bend and tired. LOST ANCHOR Vied for the lead along the three path early, tracked inside into the lane
and tired.
