LICORICE away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, eased off the rail in the run down the backside to take up
the chase, rallied smarty two wide entering the final turn, swept to the lead leaving the turn, and held QUEENS OVER JACK'S safely at bay in the stretch
drive under confident handling. QUEENS OVER JACK'S settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, began to advance
midway down the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly
second best. SWANGIN broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside,
battled into the final turn from the inside of LICORICE entering the final turn, was quickly overtaken leaving the turn, and was outfinished in the drive.
ANZAC BAY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final turn,
steadied when in tight quarters at the rail in mid stretch, and struggled to regained her momentum late. DARLA'S FURY away well and stalked the leader
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.
Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into the start as was as an incident in mid stretch. After review there was no change to the
original order of finish

ROSE OF TEXAS away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of GWEN entering the first turn, battled with that rival in the run down the backside,
took control approaching the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. DRILL BABY DRILL away well and stalked the contested early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, waited briefly before shifting off the rail entering
the lane, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. GWEN broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, battled for the lead in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with ROSE OF TEXAS approaching the final turn, rallied two wide
through the turn, and finished five wide in the drive, and just failed to hold the place. PERFECT PENNY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to just miss the place. ISLAND LIVING stalked the leaders in
the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

QUEEN OF ATTITUDE hesitated at the start to get away slowly, and trailed the field into the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide into the final turn, and split
horses in mid stretch to take command and draw clear late. KOALA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a
pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late. VIVA LA VINO
away well and stalked the contested early pace into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, shifted four
wide leaving the turn, and finished evenly to garner a share. LASTING LIGHT broke sharply and engaged the leader two wide soon after entering the
backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished in deep stretch while finishing three wide.
BELLAROO stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. ADDENDUM stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid.

COUNTRY COWBOY broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the
final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to prove best. WISE MARKET away well and settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to get up for the place. VALUABLE COWBOY dueled for
the lead from the outside of DRILLER entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, continued to
battle for the lead into the lane, but was outfinished late while holding on for a share. DRILLER rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the
first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, but faded in the late stages. STAR ENTRY
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. FOOT
SOLDIER away alertly and stalked the battling leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn, shifted four wide in
mid stretch and was forced to steady off heels, and lost all momentum. Following the running of this race there was a stewards and riders inquiry into an
incident in mid stretch. The rider of FOOT SOLDIER lodged a claim of foul against the rider of COUNTRY COWBOY, for alleged interference in mid stretch.
After review the claim of foul was disallowed and no change was made to the original order of finish.

STRIKING VALUE hesitated at the start to get away slowly, settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time,
began to advance from along the rail midway down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed three wide from between rivals
in deep stretch to get up in time. MOUNT LOKI tracked the early pace from along the inside through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly three wide
through the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. HARBOUR STORM away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace
while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, launched her bid two wide approaching the final turn, took a narrow advantage leaving the
turn, but was outfinished in the late stages while grabbing a share. SWEET AS HONEY stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the stretch the first
time, maintained a striking position in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive.
LILSISTERLEE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and outfinished late. BE SPARKY settled off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first
time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon. BECKAS BOY broke sharply and pressed the pace two
wide through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue in the run down the backside, took up approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer
late. OKANAGAN GOLD dwelt at the start, to get left well behind the field in the run to the first turn, was never in contact with the field, and not persevered
with. The stewards conducted a review of the start following the race. After review there was no change to the original order of finish. The final time for this
race was hand timed

the first time, battled for the lead from the outside of MR. QUALITY in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled determinedly two
wide through the lane. GORKY PARK tracked the leader from along the inside entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid from along the rail
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. APPELLANT stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing two out from
the rail, raced into a tracking trip entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, to loom a danger, but was unable to sustain his bid late
