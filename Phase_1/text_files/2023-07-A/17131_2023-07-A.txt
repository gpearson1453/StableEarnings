Footnotes
SHOW ME GRACE set the pace in the two path, shook free of an outer presser at the five sixteenths pole and drew off entering the lane. TAP N SWAY took
light contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide, split foes to gain place at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the
lane and held place from an outer rival through the final furlong. DUPLICITOUS broke outwardly, chased along the inside, tipped out to the four path leaving
the three sixteenths pole and ran on but needed more to reach place. PRINCESS NINA tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path but faded
turning for home. HIGH SPEED pressed the leader from the three path, yielded to that one at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses at the
quarter pole before getting rank from rider's restraint from bearing out entering the lane. SHE DAZZLE broke a step slow while brushing an outer rival,
checked briefly in the aftermath, lagged behind the rest while remaining well off of the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
RABBIT HOUND set the pace along the inside, shook free to a loose margin at the five furlong pole, showed the way from a pair of pursuers while taking the
far turn in the two path, then kicked away in upper stretch and lasted safely as his margin narrowed late. FIGHTING BACK settled off of the pace, shifted out
to the five path at the nine sixteenths pole, pursued from that path around the far turn, inched closer to minor rewards outside of foes in upper stretch, but
hung on his left lead and lugged in slightly at the furlong grounds, changed over in the aftermath, sustained a bid for place and gained that position in the
shadow of the wire. MY UNCLE FRANK tracked in the five path and outside of the leading trio early on, eased back and tucked to the three path entering
the backstretch, gradually shifted down to the inside approaching the far turn, pursued before gaining place from an outer foe while tipping to the three path
at the quarter pole, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader shortly after, embraced challenges for place from rivals on both sides in the final furlong and
was bested by the outer one late. CREPE YARNS saved ground off of the pace, stayed on to bid for place nearing the final sixteenth, but flattened out late.
GUCCI BOY prompted the leader from the three path, failed to sustain pressure at the five furlong pole, chased while maintaining place around the far turn,
but weakened after being floated to the four path nearing the lane. ABSOLUTE COURAGE stalked outside of the leading pair and from the four path, but
weakened with three furlongs to go and was done early.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL DANCER pursued from midpack two wide, inched closer in the three path turning for home, grinded away behind the leaders through upper
stretch, split those foes to offer a bid in the final sixteenth and edged and advantage late. KESSEL bobbled a bit at the start, pursued from midpack along
the inside, shifted two wide around the far turn, hoped to take aim inside of the new leaders and from the two path entering the lane, but brushed with an
inner rival while losing that path passing the three sixteenths pole, altered course outside of rivals at the furlong grounds, produced a late kick to range up to
the leaders and produce a bid nearing the wire, but narrowly came up short. BACKSTRETCH ROSE tracked two wide, gained four wide around the far turn
to bid at the quarter pole, vied with an inner rival through midstretch, but was outkicked by a rival on either side in the closing stages. URBAN DREAMER
stalked two to three wide, bid along with an inner rival and an outer foe at the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, shifted inwardly while sparring with the latter
through the final furlong, but was bested by a trio of rivals in the final sixteenth. KRICKLE raced forwardly along the inside, but got rank from restraint
passing the seven furlong pole, settled into stalking stride in the two path entering the backstretch, bid outside of the faltering leader along with a pair of
outer foes at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by those rivals in upper stretch and gave way through the final furlong. ISLE OF HOPE laid off of the pace
two wide and between horses, spun four wide turning for home and failed to menace. WHIMSICALLY tracked along the inside, took light contact from an
outer rival entering the lane, but failed to slip inside of a rival in upper stretch before lacking room to do so at the furlong grounds, and faded behind that foe
thereafter. GLOSSY LIFE laid off of the pace along the inside, surpassed an inner weakening rival nearing the lane and failed to threaten. DOOBLAY broke
a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, vacated the rail around the far turn and failed to factor. OUR GIRL FLINT settled off of the pace three wide, then
made little impact after taking the far turn in the three to four path. HER BEST FRIEND trailed in the three path and was outrun around the far turn. NEXT
DOT bolted to the outer part of the course around the first turn, gathered and tucked back down entering the backstretch, but ran off and opened up a wide
margin in the process, weakened entering the far turn, got overhauled at the quarter pole, readily stopped and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MAC DADDY TOO crossed over to set the pace along the inside, vied with a trio of outer bidders around the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, yet
regained an advantage while cutting the corner entering the lane and held gamely from outer rivals thereafter. SPEND BENJAMINS laid off of the pace in
the three path, inched closer around the turn to loom a danger behind the leading quartet and from the four path at the quarter pole, tipped outside of them
entering the lane, sustained a grinding rally to attempt a late bid but needed more while gaining place at the wire. OSCAR ECLIPSE pressed two wide and
between horses, dueled among foes around the turn, kept on well while pursuing his inner counterpart through the final furlong and was caught at the wire
by an outer foe for place. OVERBORE tracked along the inside and chased evenly through the lane. PAGE ONE stalked four wide, bid and vied around the
turn, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but relinquished the lead to inner rivals entering the lane and yielded between horses while hanging on
his left lead. PLAUSIBLE DENILE prompted the pace three wide and between horses, sparred among foes around the turn but gave way nearing the final
furlong. GREENER PASTURES stumbled and lost his rider at the start, pursued behind the rest of the field around the track, then was gathered by an out
rider and walked off.

Footnotes
HIGHWAY ROBBER settled off of the pace two wide, gained in the five path around the far turn to be within striking range nearing the lane, then sustained a
grinding charge to bid in the final sixteenth and forged an advantage late. TALL BOY raced forwardly four wide into the first turn, moved closer to press the
leader entering the backstretch, bid in the three path at the five sixteenths pole as outer rivals applied pressure, gained an advantage in upper stretch, dug
in to resist an outer challenge in the final sixteenth and was worn down nearing the wire. MIRANDA RIGHTS pursued from midpack two wide, tracked
between horses around the far turn, then chased the leaders evenly through the lane while gradually shifting out. PROMISE ME A RIDE rushed forward to
set the pace in the two path entering the first turn, felt pressure from an outer rival entering the backstretch, sparred with a trio of outer bidders turning for
home, got headed in upper stretch and yielded entering the final sixteenth. INTERLOCK EMPIRE bobbled and broke a step slow at the start, trailed, moved
out of last in the four to five path turning for home and ran on while one paced through the lane. QUATERNION tracked along the inside, chased around the
far turn and gave way. WINNEMAC AVENUE stalked in the three path, ranged up outside of the leading pair to bid in the four path nearing the quarter pole
before an outer rival joined the fray, then weakened between horses entering the lane. WINSTON WOLF checked out from between horses entering the first
turn, settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and made little impact.

Footnotes
CHARLIE WHISKEY vied along the inside early on before easing back to stalk approaching the backstretch, shifted two wide leaving the three quarter pole,
ranged up three wide into the far turn before bidding two wide with five sixteenths to go, led entering the lane, drove clear and shifted ground outwardly at
the furlong grounds before fending off an inner rival through the late stages. SHORTLY tracked along the inside, pursued close up into the far turn, tipped
outside of the leading pair at the quarter pole, grinded away while aiming inside of the clear and drifting leader leaving the furlong grounds, but was kept at
bay thereafter. ROYAL DECADENCE saved ground off of the pace, gained fourth turning for home, shifted off the inside and stayed on along with an outer
rival through the final furlong to gain show in the closing stages. MY FAVORITE UNCLE took firm contact from an inner rival around the opening bend,
trailed in the aftermath, offered a rail rally around the far turn, tipped to the three path at the quarter pole, leveled off while hanging on his left lead in upper
stretch, yet stayed on mildly to miss reaching show. VALUABLE CARGO prompted the pace two wide, allowed an outer rival to clear in order to stalk along
the inside at the five furlong pole, produced a rail bid to gain an advantage at the three furlong pole, led as the eventual winner menaced turning for home,
got headed by that one entering the lane and weakened. LOCO was last away, raced off of the pace three wide and made little impact. I NINETY FIVE
shifted out a strongly bumped an outer rival around the first turn before being hustled to the fore outside of the leading pair, drew clear in the four path with
five furlongs to go, tucked down to the two path entering the far turn, but was swallowed between bidders at the three furlong pole and wilted. NORTHWIND
pursued from the five path early on, but failed to sustain position entering the backstretch and steadily faded thereafter. MOON OVER DUBAI lacked speed
two wide and between horses and never got involved. AIRBIZ pursued from midpack in the four to five path, but weakened around the far turn and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH CLASS bobbled a bit at the start, set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, sparred with that one around the turn, then drew off
entering the lane and widened under moderate urging. RED RIVER MAGIC prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but was turned away while
proving no match for the lead entering the lane and remained well clear of show. FLAG FLYING broke a beat slow, saved ground off of the pace, improved
entering the lane, sustained stride to gain show approaching the furlong grounds and was best of the rest. EMPIRICAL VIEW hopped while breaking slowly,
then bobbled briefly soon after, trailed in the five path, gained turning for home before fanning to the seven path entering the lane and stayed on mildly to
narrowly achieve fourth at the wire. PHAT CHANCE FANCY stalked along the inside, chased around the turn, shifted out to the four path leaving the three
sixteenths pole but gave way thereafter. ROSARIO'S PRAYER lacked speed in the two path and improved along the rail in the closing stages. ROYAL
BLOOD was antsy in the starting gate awaiting the off, pursued the main group from the three path but made little impact. BADGELAND chased from
midpack in the two path, shifted out to the four path entering the lane and tired. A LOTTA WILD broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four path, then
faded between horses at the five sixteenths pole. CANDY BAR tracked the leading pair from the four path, chased them under urging around the turn, but
weakened while drifting to the six path nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GUNTON ROE set the pace outside of a prompting foe around the first turn, cleared that one nearing the backstretch, showed the way along the inside
around the far turn before his aforementioned rival offered an outside re-bid at the quarter pole, dug in nearing the lane and held firm thereafter.
MAHAAMEL prompted the pace along the inside early on, backed off to stalk his outer counterpart approaching the backstretch, shifted off the inside soon
after, inched closer entering the far turn before offering a two wide rebid at the quarter pole, but failed to gain even terms and was staved off through the
lane. POINT ME BY was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses around
the far turn, shifted three wide to take aim outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but only managed to chase them home while slowly closing in. GREY
STREAK laid off of the pace three wide, crept closer four wide turning for home before fanning to the five path entering the lane, but only managed to stay
on willingly while one paced. STOLEN BASE tracked along the inside, but only managed to chase through the lane and lacked a bid. GREYS THE BOY
bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path, pursued in the four to five path around the far turn before tipping to the six path in upper stretch,
but failed to factor. LIFE IS HARD broke outwardly and bumped a foe causing his own hind quarters to be knocked from underneath him at the start, tracked
two wide, was roused three wide around the far turn in hopes of offering a bid turning for home, but was outmoved by an outer rival while yielding between
horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
HOLY FOLEY laid unhurried in the two to three path, trailed at the half mile pole, gained four wide around the far turn, sustained a good kick in the five path
in the final furlong to kick past the leader at the sixteenth pole and drive clear. JENNIFER MY LOVE vied along the inside early on, stalked her outer
clearing counterpart leaving the eleven sixteenths pole, followed as that one's main pursuer around the far turn, took aim on her from the three path in upper
stretch, but lacked a bid through midstretch, got outkicked nearing the sixteenth pole, kept on to gain place in the final seventy yards and lasted from an
outer oncharging foe for that position. MAKE THE BOYS WINK settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, awaited racing room behind rivals
around the far turn, shifted three to four wide turning for home before tipping to the five path entering the lane and offered a good late kick in the final furlong
to just miss reaching place. PREEMPT prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, led nearing the backstretch before tugging clear at the eleven
sixteenths pole, showed the way via an open margin in the two path around the far turn, held sway through upper stretch, but began to tire entering the final
furlong, was caught at the sixteenth pole and faltered inside of rivals late. TIGER TAP laid off of the pace three wide, chased in the four path and between
horses while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, was outkicked by an outer rival while changing over inside the final furlong but lacked a bid. MINDFUL
tracked along the inside, steadied repeatedly entering the backstretch, raced keenly two wide and between horses soon after, and failed to threaten through
the lane. CALM COOL saved ground off of the pace, gained show at the three furlong pole, but weakened through the lane. CATHERINE BLAZE saved
ground towards the rear but to no avail. SNOW PRINCESS stalked in the three path and weakened between horses turning for home.
