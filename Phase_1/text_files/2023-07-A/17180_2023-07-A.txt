Footnotes
TILSA saved ground throughout, slipped through at the top of the lane, bid then edged ahead in the final sixteenth. MS. MALEVOLENCE settled off the
pace inside, swung wide into the stretch and rallied. MATOULA raced close up between rivals, ducked out in midstretch bothering rival and continued well.
LEAN ON E alternated for the advantage outside, bid clear nearing the eighth pole but tired. FRAME THIS was eased back early and trailed then offered a
mild late rally. CARLY HUSTLE chased very wide and was always outrun. STARSHIP BLANCA raced three wide, bid closer on the turn, was taken up
sharply in the stretch retreating. SNOW FORECAST earned a narrow advantage inside then faltered after half a mile. Following a stewards inquiry and an
objection by the seventh finisher against the third finisher for interference in the stretch, MATOULA was disqualified and placed seventh.

Footnotes
SHARP SENSATION moved clear inside then widened throughout driving while drifting out through the stretch. IT'S A PITY prompted the pace outside,
drifted in midstretch, was straightened and finished willingly. SPARTAN BOY advanced inside on the turn, drifted in to the gap briefly, was taken up near the
eighth pole. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN lacked speed outside and finished well while no threat. BUBBY PAPERMAKER dropped back wide and was never a
factor. LITTLE HENRY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter early and weakened. THE BOATMAN lacked speed and raced far back throughout.

Footnotes
MARCO ISLAND saved ground, rallied on the final turn, bid to the front through the final furlong. NIGHT OPS bid three wide on the final turn, loomed a
threat but was outfinished. ANGELUS WARRIOR hustled to clear lead for three quarters then weakened. SAMURAI SAINT settled well back inside then
closed well to get up for show. SUNNY SAINT pursued the loose leader to the stretch and faltered. THE ANGRY MAN dropped back early and was always
outrun. SKILLFUL broke sluggishly and trailed early and was never a factor. STAY HYDRATED bobbled at the break, moved close up for half a mile and
stopped.

Footnotes
GORDIAN KNOT prompted the pace four wide, bid on the turn then edged clear through the stretch while kept to his task. MASK PATROL raced off the
pace in the two path and closed gamely in the final eighth to gain the place. TUSKEGEE AIRMEN inside early, angled wide rallying on the turn, loomed a
threat in the stretch but flattened out late. BATTUTA D'ORO dropped well behind then offered some late energy. LORD OF THE NAVY dueled three wide
down the backstretch, held a brief lead on the turn then weakened. RABBIT lacked speed trailing for half a mile and was never in contention. PALM ISLAND
flashed speed inside then began fading on the turn. NAVY RULES led narrowly inside in the opening quarter then stopped.

Footnotes
LA CIENEGA dueled three wide, led before the half then gradually widened through the stretch while kept to a drive. CAUSE I SAID settled outside dueling
pacesetters, rallied in the stretch and was up for the place. ET'S MOON MAIDEN rated off the leaders inside, bid into the stretch and finished willingly.
CONFIRMED GENIUS advanced four wide on the turn then lacked a closing kick. PEACHY WEACHY dropped well behind, moved inside and lacked a
response. SPANIKOPITA raced far behind wide and was never a factor. CHRONOLOGY led narrowly inside , vied for half a mile and gave way. COLLIN'S
GREY LADY dueled between rivals, ducked out tiring at the top of the stretch, had her heels clipped and was eased to the wire. BROAD JUMPER trailed to
the stretch, clipped heels and fell then walked off afterward. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident at the top of the stretch.
