Footnotes
MR. COWBOY BRADLEY took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, widened at the rail on the far turn, was kept alert through the upper stretch then
taken in hand later yards. TAKE AIM stalked off the rail, challenged approaching the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and settled for
second best. ASK HIM OAKEY hopped at the start and raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS settled just off the pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. ARTHUR S GOLD started bucking shortly after the start, regained control
and dropped well back from contention and could only improve position. STRONG CURLIN showed little response. COLONEL CAPPY steadied at the start
then stalked the early pace, dropped back approaching the three eighths pole, showed no response and was eased from the mid point of the far turn then
collapsed post race and had to be vanned off.

handling. FORTES chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and dueled for second mid-stretch. GARY DOING BIZ gave chase past
the half mile pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the turn and relented second mid-stretch. KOBE'S GIRL gave chase outside, raced in the five path
on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. CAPTAIN SAM broke a step slow and steadied at the start, raced in the four path on the turn and was eased the final

Footnotes
PURE NONSENSE pressured the pace from the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, contested the edge at the rail on the turn and
dug in determinedly to hold off ELLIES AT WINDSOR through the stretch. The latter rated a slim early lead then set a pressured pace leaving the three
eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and finished well at the outside flank of the winner. LET'S DO THIS gave chase, raced
at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. AWESOME MOON was unprepared for the break then gave chase leaving the chute, raced off the rail on
the turn and finished well to pass rivals. POWER SONDE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened stride. COWGIRL ATTITUDE chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and ran evenly in the stretch. LIVANA chased through the backstretch, raced close in the four
path on the turn then weakened in the lane. CAT WITH A NOTION was not a factor and rounded the turn about the six path.
