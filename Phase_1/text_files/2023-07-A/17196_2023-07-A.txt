Footnotes
ORGANIZED CHAOS sprinted clear early on, raced under a hold into the far turn, roused through the stretch and remained safe under steady handling.
CHARM ALARM chased the early leader racing two deep, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. DARLING DONNA
chased the early leader from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. ARROGANTE coaxed along from the outside, raced three deep in the drive and
moved up to improve position. PHANCY PHILLY dropped back early off the early going, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and had not enough in
the drive. UNION FOLLY raced mid pack early on, was six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally while racing from the outside.
SCHNUER WILL raced off the early pace setters, was three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. BOUND BY TRUTH was coaxed along early
and faded.

HE IS BAD vied for the early lead along the inside and kicked clear late under strong handling. BANJO vied for the early lead between rivals early on, dug in
late racing four deep and narrowly got up for the place position. IF WE GET LUCKY pressed the three deep from the outside of foes and was outkicked in
the final stages. MILLBANK MAN dropped back to race near the back of the pack early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and moved up to improve
position. GURT'S WARRIOR settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no closing run. ABBY'S SPIRIT was off
slowly, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
PRINCESS RUNAWAY showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear late under steady handling. GIFT OF
GAB was off slowly, rushed two deep to lay just off the early leader and kept on gamely to the wire. MY MASTERPIECE chased the early pace three deep,
raced from the outside in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK was void of early speed, raced four wide near the quarter pole,
angled in through the stretch run and moved up to improve position. ZIPPY JO chased the early pace, raced along the inside and weakened in the drive. IN
GOOD TROUBLE coaxed along early, checked sharply from the inside near the three eighths pole, raced three to two deep in the lane and lacked a bid.
SASSY BABE dropped back early and failed to respond. JUSTICE OR APPEAL chased the pace from the inside and faded.

T REX settled off the early going, made a good bid to move from the inside near the quarter pole, angled to race from the outside in the stretch and finished
strongly to surge clear under strong handling. READY REWARD rated along early, raced near the rail past the three eighths pole and finished well to rally
for the place position while racing four deep. JACK SLYE showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. SKIMBLE SHANKS dropped back of the early pace, moved up three to two wide in the lane and showed good late interest. AUCHINCRUIVE raced
mid pack early on, was six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SPIRITUAL KING prompt the early leader from the outside two deep and
weakened in the drive. RECYCLE tracked the pace from the inside and faded. BOCA GUY raced off the early pace, was near the outside of rivals in the
stretch and lacked a bid. SENSIBLE JIM void of early speed, raced five deep into the upper stretch, shifted in and never threatened. SYNONYM stalked the
pace three wide and retreated.

BABKA showed good early speed to set a clear early lead and held gamely in the drive to prove best under strong handling. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH stalked
the early pair, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and slowly closed in on the leader in a willing effort. MADISON COUNTY settled off
the early going, raced four to five wide in the stretch and raced along for third. MS KAYS COWGIRL was void of early speed, saved ground and never was a
serious threat. FAIR AND TRUE dropped back early and failed to respond. LALLYBROCH forwardly placed, was getting out near the quarter pole and was
eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHOYYOOKH showed good early foot from the inside to set the early pace and drew off to be clear under steady handling. HAPPY TAPPY TIM was
bumped soundly at the start, stalked from the inside and kept on gamely to the wire. ESTA CHUCK settled off the early going, raced near the inside around
the far turn through the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. HIGHWAY QUEEN raced mid pack early on, raced four to five wide around the far
turn and raced evenly late. LIL H prompt the early leader from the outside and weakened in the drive. MISS JUNEBUG was forwardly placed to lay up close
early, was four deep past the quarter pole and faded. SHARP CATCH was void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened.
