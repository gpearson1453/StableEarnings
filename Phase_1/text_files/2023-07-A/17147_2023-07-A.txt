Footnotes
TAZMAN took this field unchallenged into the turn, was collared outside at the five sixteenths marker, battled inside down the lane and resurged in mid
stretch to inch away for the victory crossing the wire. ASTAPOVO tracked the winner alone down the backstretch, engaged outside for the lead just before
turning for home, had a narrow lead in upper stretch, battled stubbornly to the wire but was just outfinished by the winner in a hard fought stretch run. IT'S A
FLUKE travelled in mid pack outside watching the pair down the back straight, took up the chase to bid three wide outside looking the threat at the quarter
pole, but could not find another gear and settled for a non threatening third in the end. SMOKIN HOLIDAY watched the top duo nestled on the rail in the
early stages, waited in behind the contesting top three at the two furlong marker, could not find another gear to the wire to pose a threat and finished up for
a small share of the prize. FOUR K FORCE was away slowly to begin, recovered to sit mid pack on the rail, was in tight quarters entering the turn, steadied
briefly inside losing momentum, shifted five wide for the drive and was one paced to the wire. STREET SERENADE settled near the rear down the
backside, took a few awkward steps on the rail with nine sixteenths to go, started to find his best stride at the top of the lane inside and put in a good stretch
rally to be involved for the minors in the end. CHAIRMAN LAYLA was void of any early speed and trailed in the beginning, took closer order still seeing the
field four wide driving to the line but showed little in the stretch run passing a tired runner in the final sixteenth. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER was off slowly to
begin, regrouped to settle in midfield down the backside, offered a mild run three wide around runners at the half to be in with a chance turning for home but
stopped in mid stretch.

Footnotes
HEMLO GOLD was unhurried on the rail in last in the first turn, trailed outside of runners down the backstretch, started a sustained run three wide with three
eighths to go, angled out widest in the six path for the drive to the wire and wore down rivals through the stretch to get up for the win. CALUSA DONNIE was
brushed inside to begin, tracked three deep outside four furlongs from home, was roused three wide at the quarter marker, shifted to the five path to engage
for the lead with runners on either side turning for home, was in tight quarters in the last sixteenth and stubbornly fought on the win the place battle at the
finish. SOVEREIGN CAUSE broke out on the start, had a good spot behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited on the rail behind the top duo on the
final turn, shifted four wide finding a seam to contest for the front at the top of the stretch, drifted out under the drive in the final sixteenth and gave way
grudgingly for place losing the tight photo. PAT'S GAMBLE stalked near the rear on the rail, was on hold behind a wall of runners looking for room to go at
the quarter pole, finally found a seam in the final six path but by that time it was too late and had to settle for a minor share in the end. WHADDYA MEAN
tracked four wide into the first turn, hounded the frontrunner outside at the half mile marker, took command midway on the final turn, was clinging to the lead
between foes at the furlong pole and faded late. MOON OVER EGBERT travelled in mid pack between horses at the half, was urged for more at the three
eighths marker, offered little response and could not get involved down the lane. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE cleared the field to get the lead on the rail into
the first turn, was headed outside at the two furlong pole, fought inside in upper stretch and retreated on the rail the final sixteenth. LITTLE DOMI travelled
on the rail in midfield into the first turn, continued in that position down the backside, could not keep up with runners quickening on the far turn inside and
was not a presence driving to the wire. RCOF #6 CALUSA DONNIE AGAINST #1 HEMLO GOLD AT THE VICINITY OF THE SIXTEENTH POLE

Footnotes
LIGHT THE LAMP took command from the onset, was uncontested running throughout the turn, opened up on rivals at the top of the lane and was kept to
the task on the fence with left handed reminding to win comfortably at the wire. RESERVENOTATTAINED leapt on the break, recovered to settle in mid
pack on the rail at the half, shifted out to the four path turning for home and closed in strongly to capture place besting the rest. IT'S GAME KNIGHT pressed
inside in the early going, was throttled down at the half, had a snug hold into the turn, chased the loose winner on the rail midturn, was tiring in deep stretch
but willingly hung on for third money at the finish. COMMANDER JOE tracked outside three wide with a half mile remaining, was roused to go after the loose
on the lead winner five sixteenths from home, made little impact at the top of the stretch and finished evenly to the wire. DRAGON'S BREW co-trailed
outside three deep down the backstretch, offered a mild turn of foot outside passing some rivals, angled four wide for the drive and was gaining mildly to the
finish line. FORESTER'S TURN stalked in the two path co-trailing down the backside, could not get involved running on the turn, lost its path between in
upper stretch and passed a straggler to the wire. FORESTER HUMOR settled in mid field outside two wide, was ridden to go on with three furlongs
remaining, could not find more and was empty in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
AHA MOMENT got away alertly and moved clear, shifted in heading to the first turn, was overtaken on that bend and switched outside the new leader about
the six- and one-half, moved forward to press that one from outside at the five- and one-half, continued to bide time into the far turn going three wide and
then inheriting the lead about the five-sixteenths, kicked clear into upper stretch, held safe under steady but moderate handling. RUNAWAY CHARLIE
settled off the pace three to four wide outside foes into the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, edged a bit closer on the far turn still travelling four wide,
was no match for the winner but fought gamely between runners to secure the place. FANORE (IRE) was under a hold into the first turn and in tight along
the rail, rated tracking the pace while saving ground, edged closer on the far turn but lacked room in behind about the five-sixteenths, moved out to advance
between foes three deep at the quarter pole, fought on but needed more. OVER AND OLLIE was unhurried early racing last but one and near but off the
rail, continued in a settled manner to the far turn, began to advance willingly on that bend shifting out starting at the five-sixteenths, was five wide past the
quarter pole advancing and with aim on the leader at the top of the stretch but could only run on evenly. JIM'S HOPE settled off the pace saving ground
inside, came out two deep on the far turn advancing some, ran on evenly inside foes in late stretch. LANIGAN broke a bit awkwardly and inwardly,
unhurriedly brought up the rear racing near the inside, came out six wide for the drive, finished up with mild gain, fell past the wire and was vanned off.
GREYSTONE raced off the inside well back of the pace, was ridden along coming past the half, swung seven deep into upper stretch, was never near
enough to threaten. GOLDEN BURN checked on heels and brushed with a rival heading to the first turn, altered outside a foe and intent on the lead
advanced rapidly to the front early on that bend, shifted in by the latter part of the turn to set the pace, faced pressure while racing inside, faltered and faded.
LEGAL CATCH was brushed just lightly heading to the first turn, raced up close two to three wide early, began to drop back midway up the backstretch,
asked to keep pace past the half but had no response, was eased through the lane, walked off.

SEATTLE CAUSEWAY was bumped outside to start, had a good position inside watching the contesting pair on the turn, shifted outside three deep at the
half, engaged for the lead three wide at the five sixteenths marker, drifted inwards under left handed encouragement in upper stretch and drew off in the
final furlong. CLOUD STORAGE was brushed outside on the break, dictated the pace down the backstretch, was headed outside five sixteenths from the
line, determinedly fought on the fence down the entire stretch and won the contest for the runners up share. BEQUIA prompted outside down the backside
and throughout the turn, bid for the front with rivals on either side at the five sixteenths marker, was steadied sharply in upper stretch, regrouped outside in
the three path late but lost the place battle at the finish. MACHINA was brushed at the start to trail the field down the back straight, commenced a run
around runners three furlongs from home, shifted inside for the stretch run and showed good late energy to finish up for a minor share. HALLANVAARA
travelled on the rail in the third flight four furlongs from the prize, rallied four deep to loom the threat turning for home but stalled outside in mid stretch.
TARA LUNA was bumped at the start, stalked outside in the third flight at the half, asked three wide at the top of the lane and made little impression running
to the wire. SHARP AZA RAINBOW stalked near the rear down the backside, could not get involved running on the turn and passed a tired weary rival down
the stretch. TOTAL BETTY rated kindly watching the top pair outside in the early going, tracked four wide at the half, was ridden to quicken with others three
furlongs from the wire and gave way in the stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RCOF #7 BEQUIA AGAINST #5 SEATTLE CAUSEWAY IN UPPER

Footnotes
TAPSASIONAL moved to the lead while in hand, dictated terms on the front end inside on or just off the rail, faced moderate pressure up the backstretch,
met the bid of a challenger at the three-sixteenths and put to urging, held foes at bay under strong and steady urging. RON'S GIZMO moved forward
shadowing the eventual winner from outside two to three wide, drew even at the top of the stretch but couldn't get past, was held at bay. MEYER settled
outside the second flight stalking the leading pair, raced three to four wide throughout, gained steadily in the stretch but was too late. GREEN FLEET was
reserved early as the eventual winner shifted in front heading to the first turn, stalked from between runners in the second flight, kept on evenly. HOMER
SCREEN (BRZ) tracked from inside under a hold early, was pushed along past the three-eighths, came out a couple paths in upper stretch for room still
racing in behind the leaders, ran on evenly. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION settled at the rear, swung seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
PERFECT SPEIGHTY raced outside foes three to four wide toward the rear, came out five wide at the top of the stretch, needed more. GRANDSON angled
in and settled at the back saving ground inside rivals, was never near enough to threaten. TWOWAYCROSSING was just a bit fractious in the gate, raced
off the pace between runners two to three wide early, was not a threat.

Footnotes
KEROUAC took control at the start, loped along up front setting a moderate pace down the backstretch, dictated the pace throughout the last turn, was
asked in mid stretch and held comfortably crossing the line. CRUDEN BAY tracked the lone frontrunning winner on the rail in the first turn and throughout
the backside, waited to pounce inside three furlongs to go, angled just outside in the two path at the quarter pole, looked the only threat turning for home but
could not reel in the winner who had something in reserve at the finish. CALL CURT travelled near the rear four deep outside horses down the back straight,
started to pick up rivals circling three furlongs to the finish, had clear run in the six path turning for home and offered a good late run to close in to be a clear
third. SOUPER COHIBA travelled in mid field three deep outside runners four furlongs from home, took closer order on the leaders three furlongs to go,
battled between runners in the six path straightening for the stretch run and was one paced to the wire to get a minor share in the end. EMBRACE MY
UNCLE trailed the pack into the first turn, continued to see the field down the backside, started to advance just outside midway on the final turn, shifted out
in the four path for the drive to the finish and closed with determination in the late stages of the race. GUNS N' ROJAS rated kindly in the middle of the pack
on the rail half mile from the finish, steadily advanced on the fence in the final turn, was in range of the leaders four wide at the quarter pole and stalled in
mid stretch. ARGENTIUM stalked near the rear in the beginning, trailed the field through the far turn saving ground and passed weary runners on the fence
showing run to the wire. LAC MACAZA rated in mid pack at the half, put in a mild run four deep midway on the final turn, angled eight wide for the drive and
could not put together a finish to be a factor. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE tracked in the two path in the beginning, was coaxed for more run entering the far
turn, offered little response and showed little down the lane. MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU prompted the pace two wide into the first turn, sat just outside the
winner down the backside, was ridden to keep up three furlongs from home and faltered in upper stretch. CURLIN'S GHOST settled near the rear in the
early stages of the race, offered a mild run circling foes five sixteenths from the finish, was floated out in the nine path straightening out for the drive but
could get involved to the finish.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN LAD broke outwardly, settled off the leader tracking inside, advanced inside the leader's hind end about the seven-sixteenths, bided time till the
stretch, bid inside about the three-sixteenths, dueled with a rival exchanging very minor brushing, dug in to prevail. BLAST IN THE SNOW settled outside
the eventual winner stalking the loose leader, advanced three wide on the turn taking a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, dueled with the winner from the
three-sixteenths, exchanged minor brushes, was denied. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN hit the gate, settled mid-pack outside a rival, fanned five wide into upper
stretch, ran on to capture show honors while no threat to the top pair. SILVER SMOKE quickly sped clear opening up daylight and some five lengths to
nearest pursuers up the backstretch racing well off the rail, throttled down into the turn still kept in the four path but moving in to be two wide coming to the
seven-sixteenths, challenged by inside then outside rivals at that point, dropped back between while lugging a bit in upper stretch, continued to weaken
gradually. GOOD SOLDIER was forced out and in tight at the start, raced in behind runners along the rail, came out at the top of the stretch, failed to rally.
KILLARY was forced out at the start and outpaced thereafter.

Footnotes
CLEAR DESTINATION had a good spot watching the contesting leaders inside at the half, waited behind the still dueling front pair at the two furlong marker
and slipped up the fence in upper stretch to rally late on the rail for the victory. CONGLOMERATE had a nice position outside tracking the top duo with four
furlongs to go, rallied four wide at the quarter marker to bid for the lead turning for home, took over control at the furlong marker but was caught nearing the
wire by the well timed late rush by the winner. WAR COURT stalked four wide near the back in the beginning stages, began to lengthen stride at the three
furlong pole and found his best stride late closing strongly to capture third at the wire. MALIBU EDGE took the field on the rail into the first turn, was
hounded outside down the back straight, battled inside when headed by runners three sixteenths from the wire and was one paced late holding for the
minors. DOLDER GRAND broke inwards at the start, pressed outside on the first turn, hounded the frontrunner down the backstretch, bid three wide
between horses at the top of the lane and faded in deep stretch. HE'S A MACHO MAN tracked three deep into the first turn, lost ground to the leaders down
the back straight, keep pace with rivals through the last turn and levelled off down the stretch. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed the field down the
backstretch, could not get involved on the final turn and was not a factor down the stretch. BRINGER OF RAIN stalked three wide in the early going, made
little change down the backside, was asked for more run three eighths from home, eased at the quarter pole and walked off.

Footnotes
BRITISH CROWN broke a step slowly, saved ground on the turn racing well back and inside, came out six wide in upper stretch, rallied from between rivals
and got up late. GRACE ON THE GREEN switched off the inside tracking the pace from off the rail and inside a rival, advanced two then three wide on the
turn, bid and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was clear by mid-stretch, fought on with inside and outside challengers late but was outkicked.
MASON'S MUSIC settled mid-pack, saved ground inside on the turn, came out to the three path in upper stretch, faced traffic and had to step on the brakes,
shifted in at the sixteenth pole and rallied inside but too late. GOLDEN SUZIE stalked from outside going three to four wide on the turn and in range in upper
stretch, was forced out five wide in mid-stretch by a rival, exchanged light bumps with that one inside the final sixteenth. SWEEPING PASSION settled
mid-pack outside a foe into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, angled seven wide into upper stretch, ran on. SWEET BOMBOLINI got away well,
settled in behind the leader to track inside saving ground on the turn, sought room through upper stretch in behind and hemmed in, came out about
mid-stretch, exchanged several bumps with a rival in the process and steadied inside the final sixteenth. SHEZ A SEALY settled well back racing off the
inside going in the three to four path through the turn, swung out eight wide for the drive, ran on mildly. CAN'T STOP ME NOW got away well, set the pace
racing off the rail, gave way in the stretch. SPEEDY JOHNY was outpaced racing outside foes at the back and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SWEET BOMBOLINI AGAINST GOLDEN SUZIE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.
