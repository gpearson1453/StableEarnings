Footnotes
PRINCE FILIP hustled to the front inside, widened on the turn then remained safe under moderate urging. BOURBON BAY raced close up, was in tight at
the three eighths pole then made a gradual late gain. MANOLETE dropped far behind then rallied inside through the stretch. NOTTOWAY rushed to
contention three wide down the backstretch then tired. TACTICAL PLAN trailed far back then narrowed the gap without menacing. MISTER WINSTON bid
three wide on the turn then proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
LEVIOSA hustled to the front inside, moved clear briefly then held rival off through the final furlong in a game score. REITERATE advanced in the two path,
came out bumping rival near the quarter pole but could not get by the winner. BOCA ROYALTY dropped back inside, angled out in the stretch and closed
well. LIVE AID forced the pace between foes for half a mile and weakened. CALL THE PO PO broke alertly and dropped back then showed some late
energy very wide. ANGINETTI saved ground behind the dueling leaders, moved closer on the turn then faded. GAVICHI raced wide down the backstretch,
bid extremely wide into the stretch. JET FORCE dueled three wide, was soundly bumped tiring near the quarter pole causing her rider to briefly lose his right
iron and stopped. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the eighth finisher against the second finisher for interference at the quarter pole the
result was allowed to stand.

Footnotes
WICKED SECRET angled inside early, angled out advancing on the final turn then closed strongly to get up in time. MORETHANAFEELING set a
pressured pace inside, repelled challenges and continued gamely but was nailed at the wire. SPIRIT SKY forced the pace outside, loomed a threat but
could not get by the runner-up. PRINCE OF CHILL lunged at the start, quickly recovered, bid then flattened out in the stretch. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN trailed
early then passed rivals without menacing. DUDLEY DICKERSON chased inside just off the pace and was finished on the final turn. TIZ SPEEDY rated
three wide off the pace and lacked a rally. SON OF A BUCK dropped far behind early and was always outrun. The race was delayed by a loose fox on the
track surface.

FAST BREAKIN CASH controlled the pace inside then began widening on the final turn in a decisive score. JARDANI broke sluggishly and trailed for five
furlongs then advanced inside to gain the place. SENIOR INVESTMENT settled inside close up, was asked for run on the final turn then drifted out through
the stretch. HIDDEN PROMISE raced off the leaders outside and lacked a solid rally. RUBY BLEU prompted the winner outside then began fading on the
final turn.

KING'S HOUSE quickly sped to the front, widened on the turn and stayed well clear in a dominating victory. THERISASTORMBREWIN saved ground
throughout and closed well to gain the place while no threat to the winner. DAYTIME LOVER raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then flattened out in
the stretch. JUPI'S LIGHTNING chased wide in the second flight and gave way after half a mile. THE ANGRY MAN broke sluggishly and trailed to the
stretch while no factor. COBBLE HILL raced wide and was never in contention. TRIGGER PULL dropped back after a sluggish break and weakened.

GLIDING AFLEET rated inside, steadied near the three eighths pole, angled out and was up after a long drive. MORE THAN A DANCE far back early,
moved out in the stretch and closed well late. BOX OFFICE WARRIOR pressed the pace outside, bid to the front in the stretch and battled to the finish.
BRINDISI hustled to the front inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened slightly. HOMETOWN HERO settled off the pace, moved wide in the
stretch and flattened out. DEPLANE trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. PANADERO saved ground, moved briefly closer on the final turn
then faded. LONG LEGGED BOY forced the pace for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

DATHOSS awaited room into the far turn, bid in the two path then wore down the pacesetter in the final yards. IN SKY WE TRUST broke slowest and
dropped well back, advanced inside, offered a late surge but could not get up in time. REJECTED AGAIN led under pressure early, shook loose on the turn
then weakened. JARLIAN lacked speed, advanced very wide and rallied late. ZILLION was fractious in the gate prior to the start and lacked a solid
response. FOX RED prompted the pace outside down the backstretch and faded on the turn. WAGON BOSS chased three wide then proved empty through
the stretch. MUCH BETTER was urged close up inside early then weakened on the turn. HEY PORTER dropped back early and was always outrun.

PEYTON ELIZABETH quickly took control then widened throughout under moderate pressure. BUCKS SOME pursued the winner throughout and continued
willingly for the place. BABY GUNDIN dropped back in traffic early, moved between rivals then wide with a mild bid. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED saved ground
close up then flattened out in the stretch. TOURING MARYANNE settled off the pace outside and lacked a response. STARTWITHABANG trailed for half a
mile then moved very wide in the stretch. CATTI LA BELLE chased along the inside and weakened steadily. LULI'S DANCER raced outside, was taken up
between rivals nearing the three eighths pole and gave way.

ALLEVARE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, bid on the final turn and held rival safe following a long drive. SIMOVITCH hustled to the front,
widened before half mile, vied remainder of way and held on gamely. A C EXPRESSWAY settled off the leaders outside, rallied on the final then made mild
gain in the stretch. ROAN MOUNTAIN trailed early then closed well without menacing. DREAMING OF GERRY chased in the two path, was asked for run
on the final turn and had only a mild bid. BATON saved ground early then flattened out in the stretch. IRISH HONOR dropped back inside and was never a
factor. COBBLE ROAD dropped back early, stopped and lost contact with his field. SUPER JOHN fanned very wide on the first turn, gave way readily and
was eased late.
