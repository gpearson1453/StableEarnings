BAYRON settled off the pace, rallied three wide between horses on the turn and drew clear under mild encouragement. WRANGLERED set a pressured
pace to the second turn, was unable to sustain his bid and finished second best. REVIVAL pressed the pace two across, bid between horses on the turn,
leveled off and settled for show. LIARS CLUB was outrun in an even effort. REVEREND AJ broke slowly, advanced towards the outside along the
backstretch, bid four across on the turn to loom a threat, swung wide and gave way.

EURONTHEMONEY vied to the second turn, drew clear and held well. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL bobbled a bit at the start, vied between horses, fell back
entering the stretch and finished second best. SMART BATTLE raced close to the pace, saved ground, bid inside leaving the turn, lacked the needed rally
under mild urging and held for show. AFLEET SNIPER was never far back, raced outside in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. TOAH pressed the
pace to the second turn, fell back and finished evenly. GUNNER PAUL was slow early, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late
response. EVENING STORM showed little.

CAPTAIN DOZER broke out, was hustled along to set the pace, swung wide entering the stretch, was under pressure in the drive and held on gamely.
LANGMEAD pressed the pace, bid between horses and was carried out entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire and was outfinished. JOE BILL raced
close to the pace, bid three across on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch, lost ground and continued to close once straightened.
AMMENTHEDESTROYER raced mid pack along the inside and was outrun in an even effort. RYAN EXPRESS was not a factor. OLD TOBY raced wide,
was through early and gave way. TEQUILAN ME SMALLS showed little. The rider of LANGMEAD claimed foul against the rider of CAPTAIN DOZER for
alleged interference leaving the far turn. No change was made.
