the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) well placed and outside, head the leader three wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, the weakened late and held show. PEEP'S DAY allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through

PEMAQUID PETE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off while drifting out and was kept to the task.
STARSHIP EMPIRE well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, bid on the two path into the stretch, then lugged
and could not threaten the winner. STRIKE THE TOP tracked the pace, angled out and moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three
wide into the stretch and flattened out. PATRIOT DRIVE unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had
no rally. J BERESFORD TIPTON was never involved.

TIME FOR AN ANGEL set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. HEAVEN RULES
hopped and broke in at the start, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn on the two path, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled
three wide, made a steady gain, edged up for the place and held. SOLDIERESS well placed and off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn,
came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick and missed the place. MY LILY MAE allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. DARK DAHLIA stalked the pace on the outside, lost
some ground on the two path through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch and weakened. HEAVENLY HASH mid pack, looped three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. SMARTY PANTS broke in at the start, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
and had no rally. STRUT was no factor.

Footnotes
HONOR LEO JEAN vied for the early lead on the inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, shook clear, then
lasted under steady pressure. WORLDS ON HIGH well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. ALTMEISTER set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged in
the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. AMERICA'S GUEST allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came
three wide into the stretch, then drifted in and got up for a share. PITTSBURGH never far back, gained position three wide through the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch and evened out. INAPPROPRIATE unhurried, angled out while moving up through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch
and flattened out. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened.
PREGAME well placed and outside, faded through the second turn. SAVVY ON BLANC was no factor. ROCKIN THE PALACE allowed to settle, looped up
four wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.
