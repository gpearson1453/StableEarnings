Footnotes
OUR BUCKWHEAT prompted the early pace along the rail, dropped back a bit before the turn, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide to
make the lead before the furlong marker and prevailed under mild right handed urging. PLAYING FOR KEEPS away alertly, drifted inward soon after the
start for several strides, causing the riders of STARS N SPACE and TURBO POWER to check, set the early pace two wide, gave up the lead on the turn
and finished second best along the rail. PROSECUTOR offered a mild bid three wide past the quarter pole then leveled off. THE GOSPEL OF MARK
passed tiring rivals. STARS N SPACE checked leaving the chute, prompted the early pace three wide, made the lead entering the turn, set the pace into the
stretch then came up empty. ATILANO'S THUNDER missed the break and was always outrun. TURBO POWER checked shortly after leaving the chute and
was through early.

OTIS OTIS OTIS stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead near the three sixteenths marker despite being carried out to
the six path by the leader and proved best in a stiff drive under right handed urging. ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS set a pressured pace two wide through the
turn, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, dug in gamely when joined by the winner but finished second best. YOU ARE AWESOME forwardly place
along the inside, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and was steadily gaining ground late. THE COACHMAN drew on even terms for the lead
along the rail before a quarter, dropped back a bit on the turn, came on again through mid stretch but was outfinished. GUN LAP with the second flight three
wide, swung wide and finished evenly. MASAI MAN was no threat. RUMBLE STRIP RON had good early speed then faded. POWERFUL MOON had speed
into the turn then wilted.

CAN I GO TOO dropped inside shortly after leaving the chute, rushed up to press the pace before a quarter, made the lead past the quarter pole then
widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while taken in hand late. PENNIESANDDIMES set a pressured pace two wide past the quarter pole
then was no match for the winner but gamely held on for second. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS stalked the pace from the start and finished with good courage in
the five path. MILWAUKEE CAT close up early, dropped back before the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
SWEET UNIQUE made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, shook clear in upper stretch and won under confident handling. SERGER never far
back, offered a mild bid in the three path into the stretch, angled out to the four path and finished clear for second. STEALTH MODE broke through the gate
prior to the start, upon being reloaded pressured the winner along the inside early, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch then faded. QUEENIE
ROSE failed to menace. SAVESOMEFORME hit the gate and was no threat. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM was no factor. MARGARITA CINCO had good early
speed and was through after a half.
