ran evenly in the stretch. SOCIAL EXCLUSION raced five wide on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about
the five path and raced evenly in the lane. EMMA AND I saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn

CHANGE THE WORLD rated close two deep on the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and entered the far turn near the rail,
eased out to come between horses into the stretch, took the lead past the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. THE SKY IS FALLING
saved ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, closed
to a clear second in later yards and was gaining on the winner. CHROMATIC LASS moved to the inside and rated the pace, was met by Cousin Winner at
the seven sixteenths pole but recovered the advantage approaching the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead
past the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. HESSICA rated close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close in the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. COUSIN WINNIE stalked the early pace two deep, took a slim lead at
the seven sixteenths pole but was met approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. TIMETOGETUP
raced close to the early pace inside then gave chase leaving the first turn, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened.

LOVE OF GRACE stalked two deep, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and took over two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear into the lane
and held well under steady handling. LUCKY BOP stalked three wide on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far
turn about the six path and finished well to clear second later yards. PHILMARY CASTLE saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, drafted LAUGHINTOTHEBANK at the rail through the far turn, came around that one in the upper stretch and dug in to take third later yards. The latter
rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. TRUE FLIRT rated the pace
inside, dug in to the challenge of Foxy Sista leaving the half mile pole, dueled clear toward the quarter but was met at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened inside the eighth pole. IHEARTRAINACOMN settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the five path but showed little in the lane. SNEAKY LYNK showed little response. FOXY SISTA became anxious and hit the gate at the break, raced in
the four and five paths on the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, challenged past the half mile pole but dropped back at the quarter and
weakened in the five path of the far turn.

Footnotes
DIVINE FASHION rated close inside, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead inside the
sixteenth pole and drew clear later yards. SENECA ROCKS moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and kept the edge over CASTLE OF CAYLEE through the backstretch, contested even terms at the rail midway on the far turn then dueled through the
stretch for second. The latter stalked two deep, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to even terms midway on the far turn, but was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. BACKSTREET AFFAIR settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. GRACE'S SECRET settled off the pace in the four and five paths, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path on the far turn. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD settled off the pace in the two and three paths, had her heels
clipped into the second turn and showed little response through the backstretch. KATALIMA saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. STAR RULES raced inside through the front stretch, came out a path and made contact with EX RATED
approaching the five eighths pole and proved no factor while saving ground. The latter raced well off the pace just off the rail, was forced out and clipped the
heels of Breadman's Rosebud approaching the five eighths pole and lost her rider. The Stewards reviewed the incident into the second turn before declaring
this race official.
