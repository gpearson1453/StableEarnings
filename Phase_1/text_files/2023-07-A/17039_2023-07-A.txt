LINDALOUIMAGE settled outside, commenced her bid from path three on the bend, fanned out some entering the lane, gradually lugged in as she split
rivals four wide with a sixteenth to and edged ahead. NEXT TIME YOU WIN pressed from outside, was three wide on the turn, drifted out badly leaving the
bend, also gradually lugged in the last furlong, vied for the lead with a sixteenth left then had to settle for second best. MINI DRESS chased from inside,
came off the rail some through the bend, rallied belatedly in the stretch but passed some tired ones to gain third late. LIFE OF SATURDAYS vied for the
lead from inside but flattened out for the drive. G CITY WARRIOR contested the pace just outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS, moved ahead upper stretch but
began to wear down inside the final furlong.

GOLDICAT stalked the early speed, went for the lead four wide on the bend, took the advantage nearing the final sixteenth and shook free with seventy
yards left. CANTOO shared the lead from inside on the backstretch and turn, moved clear upper stretch, gradually drifted out as she began to wear down
and proved easily second best. TENSE vied for the lead from outside, was three wide taking the bend, bumped leaving the turn and gave way for the drivfe.
CANDY LOOKER disputed the pace between horses, floated out slightly to bump TENSE leaving the turn and also gave way in the lane. THAT'S A BIRD
soon dropped back from outside, sustained an injury, lost her rider and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ABBMAR kept close between rivals, was three then four wide taking the bend, rallied in the stretch, moved clear inside the last eighth and kept SUPERTRIX
at bay. SUPERTRIX was away slowly, settled outside, lost ground widest through the turn, weaved slightly a couple times upper stretch as she rallied and
gradually lugged in through the waning yards. BEIRUT BEAUTY was sent to contest the early pace between horses, moved clear and stayed just off the
inside on the bend, floated out some entering the lane and gradually wore down. SWEET JUSTICE forwardly placed along or just off the rail, lodged a mild
bid into the stretch and leveled off the final furlong. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke in stride and gradually moved to the inside, was overtaken on the turn and
gave way for the stretch run. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN was an early factor toward the outside but faded three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
SHOBIZ STAR broke on top, was hustled to a clear lead and the inside, allowed to relax on the backstretch, roused again on the second bend, floated out
some entering the stretch and held on under urging. FUTURE VISION forwardly placed from outside, stayed in path three through the second turn, moved
clear for second inside the last eighth but did not have enough to catch SHOBIZ STAR in the waning yards. READY REDDING prominent just off the inside,
took the rail entering the stretch, ran evenly but was clearly best of the others. FRONTANA chased from outside and only passed between tired ones deep
stretch. JOEY B raced in contention from inside but began to yield from just off the inside on the second bend. AMERICAN SUCCESS a step slow at the
start, chased from along or just off the rail and had no late bid. JOHNNY LONGBOAT hesitated at the break and was always outrun.

Footnotes
WARNING LABEL pressed while toward the outside, was four wide on the bend, angled in some as he commenced his bid entering the lane, rallied and got
up in time. WINDIGO SPIRIT jostled with SAFE after the first sixteenth, vied for the lead, took over two wide on the turn, lengthened command upper
stretch, began to wear down in the late going and was narrowly outfinished in a game effort. BRASKA kept close from outside, did not keep up five then six
wide taking the bend, rallied belatedly in the lane but pulled clear for third in the waning yards. MARY'S BOY whose rider did not carry a riding crop, also
jostled with SAFE after the beginning sixteenth, disputed the pace between horses, retreated three wide on the turn, came into the stretch behind
WARNING LABEL and finished evenly. THACKER FROMM displayed early speed from inside but gradually yielded the last quarter mile. SAFE jostled
between horses just after the first sixteenth, was still a contender two wide on the bend, flattened out for the stretch run, drifted out late and was steadied.
HE'S A FINE MAN lugged in some shortly after the break, bumping STAY STRONG, moved to the inside early on, advanced along the rail on the turn,
angled out four wide upper stretch and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. STAY STRONG bumped shortly after the start, chased between rivals,
lost ground four then five wide through the bend and had no significant stretch response.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE gradually moved to the inside trying to stay clear of THE LAST FACT on the backstretch, was outrun into the bend, checked when
he lost his path just past the three-furlong marker, was boxed in and waited for room the rest of the turn, gained a clear path three wide upper stretch, split
rivals with a sixteenth left and began to move clear in the waning yards. STALLONE broke alertly, was rated off the early speed, went for the lead three wide
on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, took the advantage inside the last furlong but did not have enough left in the late going. DIAMOND
MAXIMUS without early speed, picked up his pace on the bend, angled out five five wide for a clear path upper stretch, made a strong move the final eighth
and got up for the show. COMFORT ME NOW settled well off the inside, lost ground fanning widest into the stretch and found best stride too late. W W
SCOUT'S HONOR pressed from outside, took the advantage two wide on the turn, battled in the lane but began to wear down inside the last eighth. THE
LAST FACT was sent to the lead, gradually angled in, gained the rail into the bend then wore down.

Footnotes
FASTNFURIOUS bumped with READY MADE at the break, shared the early lead in hand from outside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, came into
the lane from path three, widened command then kept BERNIE LOMAX at bay under steady handling. BERNIE LOMAX rated off the early speed,
commenced his bid three wide on the turn, fanned outside FASTNFURIOUS entering the lane, drifted out some upper stretch, kept a straight path the last
eighth, lacked the needed late kick but proved easily second best. BEEASY a step slow at the start, chased from outside, picked up his pace just off the rail
on the bend, moved clear for third upper stretch then could only just hold his position late. A BOLD RYDE chased in midpack from outside, lost ground
widest through the turn and lacked a significant stretch bid. SONO GRATO was also a step slow at the break, trailed just off or along the rail and only
passed between tired rivals deep stretch. EMPTY HOLSTER chased from inside, swung out to path three for the drive and had little to offer. READY MADE
bumped with FASTNFURIOUS at the start, contested the pace inside that one for nearly three furlongs then steadily gave way.

ITS THE WHISKEY broke alertly and maintained control under steady urging. SCANDYLOUS pressed ITS THE WHISKEY from the beginning then lacked
the extra needed in the waning yards. EC ABELLA drifted out some shortly after the break and found best stride too late. EAGLE JOY rallied belatedly deep
stretch, lugged in nearing the wire and finished on even terms with EC ABELLA. MTC HOT TOPIC crowded briefly after the start, also found best stride too
late.
