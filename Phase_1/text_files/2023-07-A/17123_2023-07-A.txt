Footnotes
HUGHIE'S HOLIDAY moved up inside to set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead under mild urging. JUVAL saved ground, got through
along the inside on the turn and closed to get up late for place while no threat to the winner. CLUE veered in at the start to be away slowly, steadily
advanced inside, bid, hung and was caught for second. BRUIN MAGIC led early, pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. RAFAEL'S
SURPRISE showed speed to the turn, fell back and flattened out. SO CAL MEMORY raced in close, fell back on the turn, swung wide and gave way.
MONEY LENDER raced outside, had brief speed only and was not a threat. JUST AWESOME M was outrun in an even effort. TENACIOUS LION raced
mid pack in a wide trip and lacked a stretch response. SMOOTH BLUES was not a factor. RELEASE THE GENIE showed little.

Footnotes
REINING PESOS pressed the pace along the inside, got through on the turn, challenged for the lead, dueled through the stretch and proved best. LEAD
MONTEREY set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and was outfinished in a long drive. GOLD BOUNDRY pressed
the pace towards the outside, challenged three across on the turn, swung out, dropped back and settled for show. DECK HUMOR was taken off the rail
early, angled back in, bid along the inside and had little left for the drive. DIABOLICAL MIGHT broke out, pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn,
dropped back and gave way. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE raced mid pack, swung wide entering the stretch, bid and came up empty. QUIEN ES improved
position in an even effort. THE GREAT DOME raced close to the pace, bid off the rail and had nothing left for the drive. MR. SILVER EXPRESS raced close
to the pace towards the outside, swung wide leaving the turn and stopped. FULL OF DRIVE hesitated at the start to be off slowly and trailed the field.

Footnotes
SHE HIT A HOMER pressed the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead into the turn, drew clear entering the stretch, was shortening strides and just
lasted. GRAN MANNA raced close to the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. FI FI D'ORO saved ground
while racing close to the pace, closed willingly, was gaining late and got up for show. WAY RITE led early, responded when challenged to duel, swung wide
leaving the turn and closed steadily. LITTLE SAMURAI was void of early speed, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. SHAKE RAG was
never far back, raced outside, lacked a bid and failed to threaten. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC pressed the pace, fell back into the turn and leveled off.
BINALLOVERDRINKEN broke in the air to be off slowly, was restrained early and not urged late.

Footnotes
MASK OFF set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel and drew off under left handed urging. PATRIOT pressed the pace while racing along
the rail, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late stretch, was no match late and finished second best. SILVER DADDY was void of early speed,
dropped inside to save ground, bid off the rail and closed well to earn show. SOUTHERN SUMMER lagged early, bid four wide and improved position. JAZZ
MAN DO raced mid pack in a wide trip and failed to menace in an even effort. FINGLAS LAD pressed the pace between horses, fell back on the turn and
gave way. JERSEY JOE was void of early speed, raced wide and passed tiring rivals. COWBOY TOBY led early, pressed the pace five across, dropped
back on the turn and gave way. GOLDEN BAND was never far back, was through early and steadily faded from contention. COLOR ME GONE was not a
factor. WHEREDOESTHECASHGO pressed the pace while racing between horses to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT WARRIOR stalked the pace, rallied on the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive. ARE YOU LISTENING set the pace to the turn,
fell back, went evenly late and finished second best. HOLOTTALUTE was unhurried early, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a mild bid to earn show.
SHAME ON CHARLOTTE raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to threaten. ABSTRACT LILLY dropped inside to save ground, lacked a bid and was
outrun. LEONAS GIRL held a good position, lacked a stretch response and stopped.
