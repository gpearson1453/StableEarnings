MORNING LINE NEWS inside duel early, cleared into far turn from between horses, dug in gamely in the final furlong for the nod on the wire under stout
handling. BELLE OF ST. JOHN saved ground never far back, shuffled far turn, led late between calls but nailed at the wire in a gutsy effort. AND I KNOW
speed between horses to the half, between, kept gamely for show. TRAUMARAMA trailed to the half, angled out quarter pole with no response. LA MAMA
CHULA tried to keep up three wide to the half, gave way far back.

MISTER MAN reserved early on to the far turn, made a steady run in the stretch to grind down leader and clear late under good handling to the wire. LEVEE
PROUD battled to the half, took over into far turn, ran clear in the stretch run while no match for the winner and best of the rest. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA trailed
the field to the half, angled widest past the quarter pole and rallied on mildly in the final furlong. CINDY'S STORM speed to the front, dueled to the half,
chased to far turn while used up and faded back readily. ENGLISH CLASSIC never factored throughout. CUPID'S NUMBER a bit tardy at the start ran up
and tracked leaders for a half but began to fade and dropped back from the far turn.
