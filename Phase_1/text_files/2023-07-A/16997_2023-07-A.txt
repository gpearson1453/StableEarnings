Footnotes
NOEL'S ANGEL was sent to an early lead, opened up while racing in the two path around the turn and held his margin to the wire. KING OF THE KIDS
trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily in the lane while
drifting late. MONGOLIAN BEE raced off the pace early, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the stretch. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE)
stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. OUR VALLEY chased the
leader on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. LAPIS LAZULI raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN PINE angled over to save ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and dug in in the lane
to just hold the win. SUPER WISE raced in the two path early, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the the
three path and gained ground late to the wire to just miss. NOBLE PURSUIT stalked the pace setters on the inside through the opening half mile, continued
to save ground around the second turn and gained ground late on the rail to narrowly miss. OF GOOD REPORT raced in the two path early, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and improved position in late stretch. WAR
CHEST tracked the leader on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the four path and was outkicked in
the lane while finishing evenly. KING NATE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, came around the second turn in the four path and showed no kick. NACHO S trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground
throughout and was never a factor.

NOT A DANCE tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, switched to the outside to began a bid in upper stretch
and kicked clear late. TAP THAT DIAL dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and in upper stretch
and was caught in the final strides. WESTERN CHARM bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the bend and was caught late. HE'S CONNECTED raced in the middle of the pack early, came around the turn
in the three path, switched to the inside in upper stretch and improved position from there. JAMAICA MISTAICA bumped extensively with the horses to both
sides leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the pace setter through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path and was outkicked in the lane.
CHARISMO raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and showed no kick. FURLOUGH FIT raced at the back of the pack
through the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path and was empty in the stretch. FALCONITE bumped with the horse to his inside at the
break, dropped back to trail far behind the field racing up the backstretch and never factored.
