Footnotes
JOEY TICKLES got away alertly, forced the pace from outside three wide battling with inside rivals, edged clear turning for home, held sway. WILD ALEX
was urged at the start, pursued from off the pace battle up front, advanced willingly three to four wide on the turn, could make no headway in the lane but
was clearly second best. CLEVER TIGER vied between runners up the backstretch, dueled inside the eventual winner but off the fence, proved no match
and steadily weakened. CHICA CHUCK was outpaced early racing off the inside, came out further in the stretch, ran on. WESLEY THOMAS moved forward
under urging and contended for the lead briefly, dropped back leaving the backstretch, ran on evenly thereafter. SUBSCRIBED bobbled at the break and
was consequently a length or two slow to begin, was never able to menace.

Footnotes
BINOCHE contended three wide between runners up the backstretch, dueled inside a foe but well off the fence through the turn, edged clear by upper
stretch, held sway under steady handling. RUBY DOOBY DOO was urged at the start but lacking speed then urged again past the three-eighths going four
then five wide on the turn and beginning to advance, steadily gained through the stretch but was too little too late. SUZY Q THE QUEEN pursued the
leading quartet from inside, moved out a path to pass a rival in the stretch, kept on inside to get up for show honors. BEARGREASE forced the issue from
outside, dueled with the winner four deep through the turn, weakened for the drive. JIMMYDABOOK was urged forward at the break, vied briefly between
runners up the backstretch, dropped back some and switched out entering the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, failed to rally. LIZZIES RED
VELVET bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the early pace from inside, started dropping back about the seven-sixteenths, failed to rally. EXPECT A
CIRCUS bumped with a rival at the start, was outpaced trailing while racing off the inside, was never near enough to threaten. PER THE HORSE RACING
INTEGRITY AND SAFETY AUTHORITY, RUBY DOOBY DOO HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A CROP VIOLATION.

Footnotes
MAYBE IT'S TIME was quickly clear to set the pace racing off the rail, rider looked back on the far turn for competition, edged away willingly, was well clear
in the stretch and eased up late. GRUNION dwelt at the start, shifted in and saved ground early racing off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn moving
out to split rivals four wide at past the quarter pole, secured the place while no threat to the winner. FACTUM LOVE STYLE tracked from inside just off the
leader, saved ground on both turns, lost the battle for place through the stretch while no threat to the winner. WORD FOR WORD was reserved toward the
back racing inside, advanced inside foes in upper stretch, was forced in badly in the gap and had to adjust to left-handed use of the crop to avoid the rail
after the gap, ran on to improve. EL BUFFALO settled mid-pack racing off the inside, advanced outside on the far turn moving out from five to seven wide by
the end of that bend, drifted in badly throughout the stretch and needed more late. MULSANNE (IRE) came out at the start, raced in the back half of the field
near but off the rail, failed to menace. PRACTICALLYMINE was within range between runners two to three wide, came up empty. ALLIWORSHIPNADORE
broke outwardly, was forwardly-placed stalking from outside three to four wide, steadily weakened. ENTRUST was a bit hard to load, broke very poorly
tossing the head, bobbling and nearly losing the rider, made no impact.

EXIT RIGHT tucked in two wide heading into the first turn to track in behind, came out four to five wide turning for home, took command by mid-stretch and
kicked clear, was taken in hand and eased up late. MY REDEMPTION was caught four wide into the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, advanced three
wide and encouraged along three furlongs out, struck the lead past the quarter pole, was soon overtaken and no match for the winner. FLAT OUT FLYING
settled off the pace inside saving ground, came out for upper stretch and ran on. BAHAMA CHANNEL bobbled slightly at the break but still broke on top,
was urged clear to set the pace racing in the three path into the first turn, moved nearer the rail and was pressured up the backstretch by an outside foe,
overtaken early on the far turn, came up empty. GOLDEN SPOKE was caught five wide into the first turn, moved forward while shifting in to press the
pacesetter up the backstretch racing two to three wide, took the lead past the three-eighths, was overtaken by the end of the far turn and lacked the needed
late kick.

Footnotes
REACHING STRIDE was brushed lightly at the start, shifted in and moved forward to track into the first turn, moved forward to press from outside late up
the backstretch, bid three furlongs out, was held at bay till the stretch then took command, edged away from one rival and held another foe while taken in
hand late. SEIVER was forced out a bit at the start, settled tracking inside just off the leaders, came out a bit in upper stretch for room, found it between
runners by mid-stretch, gained steadily and slowly inside under an all-out drive but needed more. SHE'S JUST QUALITY broke outwardly, moved to the fore
to set the pace racing inside, faced pressure up the backstretch and battled especially hard on the far turn to maintain a narrow advantage, gave way in the
stretch. LOUISE BROOKS was quite fractious in the gate, forced out at the break, settled at the back racing wide, went four to five deep on the first turn,
advanced rapidly sweeping past foes four to five deep on the far turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but evened out thereafter. MAGNIFICENT
PEARL was caught about four to five wide in the early going racing well back, advanced on the far turn outside foes, kept on evenly in the lane.
CONSTITUTIONALRAGE was under a hold racing toward the back inside early, came out in the stretch, ran on mildly. FILTERED LIGHT was caught wide
in the early going but able to move in from six to three or four deep on the first turn racing about mid-pack, shifted in further near the five-sixteenths, passed
foes inside into upper stretch and ran on. EARLEY ROSE shifted in and was unhurried at the rear early, was guided out turning for home, passed tired foes.
MORETHANASTORM shifted in from five to three wide on the first turn racing mid-pack, was up close and nearly within range two to three deep on the far
turn, faded in the stretch. OJITOS BELLOS was forwardly-placed while caught four wide in the early going, continued about mid-division off the leaders in
pursuit three to four deep, came up empty. UNBRIDLED SASS brushed a foe lightly at the start, moved forward to stalk just off the leader two to three wide,
soon retreated. ALL THE WAY MAE was caught three to five wide outside at the rear early, swung eight deep into upper stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
PARADISE PRIDE was forwardly-placed three deep stalking the leader, shadowed that one up the backstretch, moved to the fore to take command past the
five-sixteenths, moved clear in upper stretch, held well. I AM THAT I AM was urged at the break, moved forward to set the pace inside but off the rail, was
shadowed by the eventual winner up the backstretch, overtaken by that one late on the far turn, was no match but kept on to get the place. CURLIN'S
THRILL settled off the pace racing two wide early and between foes up the backstretch, began to advance willingly on the far turn moving out to be four
wide coming past the quarter pole with aim and in range of the leader, loomed a threat but levelled out and missed the place. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY was
coaxed forward from the break, tracked from inside just off the rail in hand, began to drop back and was ridden along coming past the three-eighths, had no
response and ran on evenly while failing to rally. TINY TIN was unhurried at the back shifting in to the rail about the seven-eighths pole, came off the rail on
the far turn still with a lot to do but never got near enough to threaten. PRIVATE NETWORK stalked outside the second group three to four wide, was forced
out a bit leaving the far turn still within range but faded thereafter. HROTHGAR raced outside foes at the back three to four wide in the early going, failed to
rally.

Footnotes
IZZYBELLA got away well and moved clear under mild coaxing, set the pace near the rail, edged away coming into upper stretch, held sway under steady
handling with enough in reserve to keep a rival at bay. DOWNTOWN KATIE settled off the pace inside toward the rear, switched out on the far turn
advancing two then three wide on that bend, had aim and loomed a threat in mid-stretch gaining on the winner but in late stretch was held at bay. MURPH
moved forward heading to the first turn, stalked the eventual winner from off the inside racing in the two to three path, lacked the needed late kick. MY
THOUGHTS tracked from inside, saved ground on the turns, ran on evenly. NEECIE MARIE was caught outside runners three to four wide off the pace
early, failed to rally. BRUMMAGEM raced between foes two to three wide early, dropped back to last heading up the backstretch, shifted in, failed to
menace. MOSALAH settled at the rear racing three wide through the first turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
HONEYCAMP bumped lightly with a rival at the start but moved right to the front, set the pace from off the rail shadowed by an outside foe into the turn,
asked for run at the top of the stretch, responded to draw off and was geared down late. DATS A SUPERSTAR shadowed the winner from outside going
three to four wide on the turn, was no match but second best. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS raced between runners three wide early, advanced by foes and
shifted in late on the turn, secured show honors. PEACE PACT raced outside foes early, went four wide on the turn, needed more. COWGIRL HOP
exchanged a light bump at the start, brought up the rear racing outside early, went five wide on the turn, failed to threaten. JOB'S NOT FINISHED was held
up inside heading into the turn, altered out past the quarter pole, ran on. IVY WAY chased two to three wide between runners early, was never able to
threaten. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE was urged forward showing brief speed inside just off the leader, dropped back and faded.
