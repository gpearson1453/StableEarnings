the lead inside, dueled throughout and continued determinedly just missing. FAST INTENTIONS reserved inside, moved closer on the final turn then went
evenly. NOT A TRACE vied outside to the final furlong then flattened out. BEYOND A MILLION dropped back early and gave way readily. VALERIE FIRST
angled inside early and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
EMPIRE'S SCORE dueled in the two path, shook loose into the stretch and remained safe while kept to his task. MACH TRIAL lacked speed then finished
with good energy to gain place too late. ROCKIN COWBOY moved up to duel inside then weakened slightly in the final furlong. R GOODTIME CHARLIE
broke a step slowly, rushed to contention outside then tired. MANAHAWKIN raced off the leaders three wide and lacked a closing bid. HOT AND HEAVY
chased five wide on the turn and faltered. CATCH MY VIBE saved ground off the pace and faded after half a mile. MAGNETRON dropped back early and
raced far behind throughout. FEARLESS FLY lagged far behind and lost contact with his field.

DAYDREAMING BOY settled outside the pacesetters, bid strongly on the final turn, moved clear at the quarter pole, drew away eagerly and was being
geared down late. ASSUME NOTHING alternated for the advantage outside, faded briefly on the final turn then came again for the place. PARKERNESS
vied outside, was challenged again on the final turn and weakened in the final eighth. BEYOND BEST dropped back soon after the start and trailed
throughout.

CUP OF LIFE quickly took control, repelled a challenge the turn then quickly drew away again while drifting out in the stretch. CRAZY SERENA stumbled
badly at the start, chased inside, drifted wide in the stretch narrowing the gap. AMERICA'S PRIDE forced the pace outside, was repelled on the turn and
faded in the stretch. JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL broke a step slowly, moved up inside then drifted wide on the turn. ROLIN N CONTROLIN dropped back early
then passed rivals without menacing. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE lagged far behind and was never in contention. RISEN CHANGE dropped back despite urging
and was never a factor. NANA'S BOOPA broke through the gate prior to the start then showed little. FALL CAMPAIGN was urged close up in the opening
quarter then stopped abruptly.
