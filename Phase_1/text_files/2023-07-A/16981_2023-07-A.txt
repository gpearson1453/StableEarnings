Footnotes
HOT LOOKIN ROYAL , bumped by CHEM MAJOR leaving the starting gate, circled foes on the turn, eased out four deep entering the stretch, advanced
outside horses, led late and drove clear. CHEM MAJOR came in bumping the winner at the start, set the pace in the two path around the turn, drifted in
inside the eighth pole and finished gamely. TAP N GLO stalked the pace while three deep on the turn, took aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out.
COCKTAIL DREAMING hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace to mid stretch and weakened. PERFORMANCEANXIETY lacked speed, raced in the two
path on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace. MARIA FROM MIAMI saved ground on the turn, weakened in upper stretch
and was eased the final furlong. SHE'LL MAKE WAVES raced along the inner rail on the turn and steadily dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
CLAUDEE BOY settled three wide outside rivals into the turn, commenced a run mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch, responded to right handed asks
and forged to command a furlong out, kicked clear, switched over to his left lead and widened while steadily hand ridden late. CRAZY ODDS saved ground
off the early pace, eased out in upper stretch, worked between runners with run past the eighth pole, shifted back in towards the rail and kept on gamely to
nab the place. WAR AND ROSES , three wide between runners early, was lightly shuffled nearing the turn, angled out around the turn, shifted six wide for
the drive, moved up in mid stretch, churned on but was out kicked for second. CAVALRY COMMAND prompted the pace three deep into the turn, bid to
apply more pressure approaching the stretch, gained a slim advantage inside the three sixteenths, cede to the winner a bit later then faded through the final
yards. DOC ROCK , in a bit tight soon after the break, raced between foes, eased out some in the drive, chased between runner past mid stretch but
needed more late. AWESOME STEPHEN rated off the leaders soon after the break, stalked two wide into the turn, came three wide for the drive and gave
way. THANK YA PETE broke outward, vied between foes into the turn, chased two wide from the three eighths to upper stretch and weakened. DON
BERNARDO was outrun. HAGGERSDALE set a pressured pace towards the rail, was headed in upper stretch then tired through the final furlong.

TOUPIE set the pace outside REMEMBER ME around the turn, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, drifted to the inner rail near the eighth pole then
eagerly increased her advantage under a brisk hand ride. REMEMBER ME hugged the inner rail around the turn, prompted the pace to upper stretch, was
no match for the winner, drifted out near the eighth pole and held the place. TIZ VINNO , lightly bumped by G'S FIREBALL soon after the break, saved
ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied mildly. G'S FIREBALL came in a bit soon after the brerak, raced in the two
path on the turn and was not a factor. CUNDI , outrun, raced along the inner rail.

Footnotes
NAUTILUS , nudged to the early lead, was soon joined from his outside and sparred with BOB MARCO, was nicely handled around the turn, spurted clear
under some coaxing in upper stretch, came under a strong ride leaving the three sixteenths, turned away JACKIE A heading to the sixteenth pole and
widened while kept alert. JACKIE A , bumped at the break, rated close up between rivals past the three quarter pole, stalked the leaders four wide into the
lane, ranged up to give hard pursuit in mid stretch, switched over to his left with a sixteenth to go and continued on with effort to be second best. RUSTYS
GFIVEFIFTY , bumped at the start, edged up inside early on and stalked, was kept from getting out mid turn, stayed inside for the drive and churned on.
BOB MARCO disputed the pace two and three wide outside the winner, failed to match strides soon into the stretch, gave willing pursuit to about the
sixteenth marker then faded. JOHNG broke slowly, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide for the drive and failed to respond. POWER BACK ,
bumped then pinched back at the break, raced under rating and outside JOHNG early on, failed to kick on around the turn and retreated. STRONG
HEADED bobbled at the break, stalked the early pace while about four wide then dropped back leaving the half mile marker.

Footnotes
SUPER ACCELERATE saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, swung to the four path in upper stretch, took command under urging outside horses
near the sixteenth pole then drew off. FREEZE THE FIRE sped to the early lead, hugged the rail around the turn setting a pressured pace, was challenged
by FRIGHTLAND in upper stretch, battled inside that one and weakened late. FRIGHTLAND circled the turn three wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch,
dueled to mid stretch and weakened in the drive. LEFT HAND THREAD , off last, steadied behind horses near the six furlongs pole, swung out leaving the
backstretch, circled the turn four wide, drifted to the five path turning for home and weakened. JEBOLOGIST prompted the pace outside FREEZE THE FIRE
and weakened approaching the eighth pole. GOLDENIZE , between horses down the backstretch, steadied in traffic near the five eighths pole and
weakened on the turn.

COCONUT CAKE settle well back off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner and was put to strong asking past the quarter pole, sustained a grinding
run under right handed asks, took over to the inside of rivals leaving the sixteenth pole and was edging away at the wire. SPUN GLASS drafted back off the
early pace and dropped in to save ground, edged up towards the rail in upper stretch, eased out and responded to rousing, closed in between foes to be on
near even terms with a sixteenth to go, kept on with good effort but was second best. MONEY'S WORTH rated close up and outside a rival early on, saw
the leader get away some mid turn, circled five wide with run into the lane, shifted a bit wider and bid outside runners past mid stretch, switched over to her
left lead and flattened out late. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER was hustled up to the inside of runners to reach a stalking spot, eased out and advanced nearing
mid stretch, was bumped and floated out by the winner leaving the furlong grounds and failed to seriously kick on. HOLLYWOOD WALK , bumped and
steadied at the break, advanced to the inside of a rival mid turn, shifted out some, gained past mid stretch then lacked a serious finish. NEXT EPISODE ,
well wide throughout, failed to menace. CAN THE QUEEN took over soon after the break, handled outside pressure then cleared leaving the far turn, was
guided further off the inside into the lane, wandered outward under left handed asks, bumped with WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER nearing the sixteenth pole and
faltered. MY THOUGHTS , off the pace three wide, angled in through the lane but failed to rally. DULCE KIARA , firmly rated early, steadied when getting in
nearing the turn, raced wide in upper stretch and faded. GIFT OF GAB had speed and prompted the leader into the turn, dropped in some around the turn,
chased two wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN sprinted to the early lead, moved to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, opened up in mid stretch
and held sway under encouragement. STREET LUTE , checked in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, remained along the rail around the
turn, angled out in mid stretch and rallied gamely. DECO STRONG raced in the two path around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied.
RESPONSE TIME hesitated at the break, rushed up to press the pace outside the winner and weakened in the drive. MOODY WOMAN lacked speed,
swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to rally. CENTRE COURT CHAMP bobbled at the break, circled the turn three wide, chased the pace to the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FORE HARP took command outside rivals early on, cleared heading to the turn and dropped in to set a rated pace, responded when shaken up soon into
the lane, kept on under solid right handed asks past mid stretch, switched over to his left lead leaving the sixteenth marker and held firm. WITTY broke
slowly, regrouped and edged up towards the rail early on, eased out around the turn, shifted five wide past the quarter pole, straightened away and finished
with good energy. MID DAY IMAGE rated to the inside of rivals nearing the turn, angled out and advanced to take aim into the stretch, gave hard chase of
the winner in mid stretch but came up empty. SMOKIN' JAY settled outside a rival early on, circled four wide with some momentum into the stretch, pursued
past mid stretch then flattened out. STEAL THE CASH was outrun. GRATEFUL BRED broke a bit slow and had his rider briefly lose his left iron, recovered
and rushed up between foes, stalked between rivals leaving the far turn, eased back off of foes mid turn, failed to generate a run into the lane and gave way.
NOBLE EMOTION , away alertly, stalked three deep into the turn, failed to kick on under asking nearing the stretch and faltered.

ROWSIE EXPRESS settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out and advanced between rivals mid turn, shifted out wider in upper stretch and
cruised up between horses, took control from the leader leaving the eighth pole, responded to a couple sharp asks and eagerly widened. QUEEN
TAPITURE stumbled at the break, recovered and accelerated to contention inside rivals, moved through to the inside of leaders around the far turn then
emerged in a battle to the inside of LIL SPINNER, got the better of that one and cleared into the lane, began to drift out soon after, failed to contain the
winner's charge past the furlong grounds, continued to drift out but stayed on with effort to hold down the place. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD , between foes and
in range early, saved ground around the turn, edged up some past the quarter pole then went evenly through the final furlong. LIL SPINNER , with the pace
four and three wide outside rivals, dueled with QUEEN TAPITURE from the far turn to mid turn, drifted out entering the lane and weakened. BOSSYNESS ,
off the pace, made a mild run between rivals around the turn then came up empty in the drive. SUPERSNAKE , wide, dropped back. AUNTIE RONA settled
off the pace, came under pressure around the turn but lacked a kick. STORMIN' AMANDA sped clear leaving the chute, set the pace off the rail, was taken
on from both sides nearing the turn, briefly chased the leaders past mid turn then faltered.
