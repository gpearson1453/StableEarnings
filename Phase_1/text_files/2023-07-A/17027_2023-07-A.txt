Footnotes
MOR TEQUILA was closest in pursuit early, bid from outside around the bend, four wide into the lane, cleared in upper stretch under left handed
encouragement and drew off under light coaxing. SIR LONDON stalked three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the lane, drifted inward
in the stretch and gained the place. GIVER NOT A TAKER tracked off the rail at the back into the turn, went three to four wide around the bend and was
along for the show. MISTER ICEMAN cleared from inside, pressured by MOR TEQUILA around the turn, clung to a short lead a bit off the rail into the lane,
yielded to the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PATRON D'ORO scrambled slightly at the start, stalked the pacesetter up the
backstretch, rounded the bend two to three wide and weakened.

KRISTI'S TIGER chased GYPSY LYNN to the turn, bid between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, came out a bit into the stretch, took over past the
quarter pole, kicked clear under hand urging and coasted late. GYPSY LYNN cleared quickly to take control, led on the inside into the turn, roused when
pressured by the winner on the turn, showed the way a bi off the rail into the drive, overtaken past the quarter pole and churned on for a clear second.
PROFESSORS' PRIDE chased outside a rival early, three deep into the turn, failed to stay with the top pair and came four wide into the drive, eased in the
final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
CIRCLE THE MOON cleared two then three wide on the first turn, inched away on the backstretch, stayed off the rail and was allowed to ease out further
around the far turn to come five wide into the stretch and remained well clear to the wire. REEF CITY got bumped in the beginning, chased six then five
wide around the clubhouse turn, angled in chasing the lone leader in the middle stages, saved ground through the far turn and finished willingly for the
place. STELLA BOY raced up close three wide then four wide on the first turn before dropping back off the pace, remained off the inside and came five wide
into the drive and showed a mild response to outkick BYE EVERYBODY for the show honors. BYE EVERYBODY shifted out to bump REEF CITY at the
start, trailed two wide into the first turn then passed a couple rivals, came three wide into the drive and got edged for third. ACCELERAY broke a step slow,
got shuffled between foes four wide on the first turn, trailed into the second bend, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
BRAVESTONE was antsy in the starting gate, brushed with inner rival then cleared and crossed over to the inside, vied with outer pair around the
clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, dueled with STAR PROSPECT into and around the far turn, brushed with that rival at the quarter pole, shook free
past the three-sixteenths pole and was kept to task to remain clear. STAR PROSPECT vied for command three deep early then outside BRAVESTONE
approaching the half-mile pole, fought two wide into the lane and brushed at the top of the stretch, could not kick on with the winner approaching midstretch,
drifted out then back inward in the final furlong and finished willingly to hold second. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY brushed with BRAVESTONE leaving the
gate, went up to challenge between rivals for the lead, got crowded a bit and suffered a mild shuffle near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased the top pair along
the rail into the far turn, tipped three wide around the bend, drifted out in the lane and could not get by STAR PROSPECT for second.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE CURLY chased three then four wide early, challenged from outside midway up the backstretch, dueled three then four wide around the far
turn, cleared briefly at the three-sixteenths pole, was challenged again by L L L COOL with a furlong remaining and held gamely. L L L COOL brushed start,
cleared from inside early, challenged by TAKE CHARGE CURLY on the backstretch, dueled inside that rival while two then three wide on the far turn, lost
touch with that rival at the three-sixteenths pole, came back on entering the furlong grounds, finished gamely to the wire but was held at bay. LEN'S LUCK
lost footing to come away slow at the start, jumped the shadow from the lightly pole around the first turn, saved ground while pushed on through the far turn,
could not threaten the top pair but kept on for a clear third. MOON TIME broke out but was quickly corrected, chased along the inside then two wide on the
first turn, raced outside a rival around the second bend and weakened. GIRTH fractious in the gate, brushed inner rival at the start, forwardly placed two
then three wide early, raced outside rivals in the middle stages then trailed into the far turn, remained off the rail into the drive and tired.
