Footnotes
CARLEA'S DREAM vied for the lead while two wide into the first turn,then gained command in the early backstretch, cleared the far turn and was kept to
task in the home stretch to prove best in the end. DAME PLATA vied for the lead inside early, then pressed the pace throughout the remainder of the course
under a long drive and could never catch the leader in the end. CATDADDY stalked the pace while three wide, was in a long drive heading into the far turn,
to bid gamely in the stretch but came up empty in the end and was best for show. HERN saved ground while two to three wide on the backstretch, then
urged steadily on the far turn to rally in the early stretch but came up even in the end. SONNEMAN tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
bid gamely on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. GOLD PILOT was unhurried early then saved ground throughout the first three quarters then
rallied from the three path in the home stretch to no avail in the end. MR. NIGHTBLINGER stalked the pace from the two path throughout the first half then
was in hard drive leaving the far turn, was used up and tired in the late stretch. COWBOY MISCHIEF chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs
then flattened out on the far turn and was no threat.

Footnotes
GUITAR BOY raced mid-pack through the first turn, was taken back in traffic down the backside to trail, knifed between rivals entering the turn, angled out to
the four path in upper stretch and closed with a rush to be up in the final stride. NOISE COMPLAINT stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch,
rallied in the turn to challenge in upper stretch, took a lead in deep stretch and was caught in the final jump in a game effort. LIL SWEET THANG reserved
off the pace racing two wide down the backside and closed quickly in deep stretch in a belated bid. TAPITURE JONES well placed racing two wide in the
second flight most of the trip and finished with a good closing kick. FARM DOG stalked the leader from three wide in the first flight, mounted a bid in the turn
to take the lead in upper stretch and flattened out late in the lane. BAY BE GONE bumped and crowded leaving the gate to be near the back of the field,
moved up to contend into the far turn and finished evenly. VILLAGE WAY set the pace through the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the back
straightaway while under s strong hold, responded when engaged in the far turn but tired in the stretch. FORT HOOD bumped rival dropping in leaving the
gate, moved up the rail to prompt the pace for three quarters and gave way down the lane. RED SUMMERBIRD squeezed at the start and taken up to be
several lengths behind out of the gate, made a brief run up the backside and tired.

Footnotes
THIRD STREET set the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then lead the way throughout the turn, then drew off in the stretch to prove best in the
end. PURE MALICE stalked the pace while three wide, then rallied gamely in the upper stretch, dueled for the place prize down the lane and was up at the
wire. CAT STORM pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch to duel with an outer rival for the place position and hung
in the end. DELTA FRONT saved ground throughout the early furlongs, then rallied while four wide in the early strtech and was closing well in the end.
TOOTHMAN raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, then made a mild bid on the turn to close evenly in the stretch. HOLUS BOLUS was away well
then settled back to chase the pace while three wide, then bid on the turn while two wide and was no threat in the end. COPPERLITE chased the pace from
the inside early, then faded and had no final bid in the stretch. WHAT THE HEY trailed throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
KATIES SPIRIT stalked the pace from three wide, rallied to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch and drew clear. STHENIC rushed up the fence to take
the lead into the first turn, opened a clear advantage to upper stretch, could not go with the winner but held the place while weakening late. CURLIN'S
MAGIC reserved off the pace in mid-pack while racing wide, made a steady rally into contention in the turn and closed with a strong kick to be gaining late.
COPPER BOUND well placed to be tracking the pace through the turn and lacked a late response to close the gap. LADY ZEPHYR unhurried early to be in
the back half of the field, angled to the clear in upper stretch and made a mild late bid. CHAINSAW CITY rated in mid-pack and found his best stride in the
lane to be gaining belatedly. HAULIN HAY pressed the pace for the early going and gradually faded. KENTUCKY ANGEL slow early to be near the back of
the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MOON RIDGE prominent in the early going, moved up to challenge in the turn and gave way to wire. SARAH
EXPRESS Y G well placed for the first half mile and weakened. SWISS DANCER went evenly never posing a threat. TIZ MEDAGLIA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MR. VALENTINO stalked the pace down the backstretch while two wide, was moving up on the far turn to duel with the pace setter heading into the early
stretch, was battling grudgingly down the final furlong and was up at the wire to prevail. TEXAS CLUBMAN set the pace into the first turn, then dueled with
an outer rival heading into the far turn, continued to bid gamely down the stretch but was out finished in the end. TEAM GORMLEY chased the pace from
the inside down the backstretch, then rallied from the three path on the far turn to close belatedly in the stretch. KING ARTHUR RIDGE was rated in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, continued to bid from the inside on the far turn, then rallied in the stretch but came up empty in the end. JOHN
LOUIS' BEVO was bumped at the start then settled in the two path throughout the early furlongs, then rallied in the upper stretch to close well in the end.
MODOC was bumped at the start, then was unhurried early, came out four wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but ti was too little too late. MORO
TRENDSETTER chased the pace while two wide in the first half then flattened out in the second half of the course. KEEPMOVINGFORWARD settled along
the inside and was no threat. KING SAUL was rank early then dropped back on the backstretch and failed to rally. There was a timer malfunction so
fractional times were recorded by hand.

Footnotes
AMERICAN XPERIMENT tracked the leaders from the fence to the turn, snuck through on the inside of the tiring pacesetter, cut the corner to engage the
new leader in mid-stretch and drew clear late in the drive under a well handled ride. IMPRESSED broke several paths outward leaving the gate, angled back
in to prompt the pace to the turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, dug-in willingly down the lane to battle the winner and was out-finished in deep stretch
while second best. CHATTALOT stalked the pace from four wide in the turn, loomed large turning for home and hung in the lane. JACKMAN slow early to
be near the rear for a half mile, swung six wide at the top of the lane and closed well late in the stretch. FIRST AVENUE trailed to the top of the lane and
showed late interest closing along the fence. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE well placed to be in contention in the turn and lacked a response when called upon for
the drive. IT MAKES SENSE went evenly posing no threat. SILENCE D'ORO flashed early speed to duel through the turn and tired. UNDER THE GUN
chased the leaders and came up empty.

Footnotes
JUST BATTLE was moving down the backstretch while four wide and outside rivals, then continued to gain ground gamely on the far turn to vie for the lead
in the early stretch, drifted in to the two path then continued to draw off in the final furlong and succeed in the end. DAWSON CITY was moving up on the
backstretch while three wide to duel with an inner rival throughout the far turn, then continued to battle for the lead in home stretch and was best for second
in the end. IT'LL DO dueled for the lead with an inner rival into the first turn and down the early backsrtch, was clear of that rival heading into the far turn
then was challenged by an outer rival, vied gamely to gain the lead but couldn't not in the stretch and gave way. MOHAYMEN HOLIDAY was rated along
the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to close willingly in the stretch while three wide. WILD WING stalked the pace along the inside
throughout the first three quarters, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch and needed more in the end. LIVINGSTON settled along the inside
down the backstretch, was gaining ground while four wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly. GOLDEN FLASH raced in the middle of
the pack along the inside under a steady drive then flattened out in the second half and lacked bid. SHAMEFUL ALLIANCE settled in the two path and was
no menace. DIXIE MOONSHINE tarield behind the field and passed a tired rival in the end. RAH ORPHANA dueled for the lead from the inside in the early
furlongs then dropped back after the half and had no final bid. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION, the rider of IT'LL DO claimed foul against the rider of
JUST BATTLE for interference in the stretch drive. After reviewing the replay no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
HALE'S ANGEL sped to the lead after an alert break, dueled to the top of the lane shook off the presser in upper stretch and held the closer safe.
MISSISZIPPY BLING reserved off the pace to be mid-pack, mounted a rally into the turn from three wide and kept making steady gains to the wire.
BROADWAY DISH tracked the leaders through the turn to threaten turning for home, and finished well to hold the show. SCARLET POSITION stalked the
pace to the turn, lost position around the bend and came again. MY GOLDEN BLING chased the leaders from the rail to upper stretch and failed to close the
gap. LEGENDARY GIFT slow early to be at the back and found her best stride late to mount a belated close after circling eight wide. GIRONA well placed to
be in contention and lacked a closing response. FOR FUN failed to menace. GANGSTER RAP fractious at the gate in the loading process, dropped to the
rear of the pack down the backside and passed tired rivals in the stretch. HIT'EM UP went evenly never posing a threat. SOUL SET FREE hard sent away
from the gates in the early going to duel on the lead and came up empty turning for home. PRINCESS PHONE flashed brief speed and tired.

COLOR FAST saved ground in the early furlongs, then urged steadily throughout the far turn, angled to the three path and closed fastest down the lane to
be up at the wire. STRICTLY CONFIDENT was rated in the middle of the pack while two wide, then rallied on the far turn and into the stretch to close
belatedly just missing success in the end. R DOC vied for the lead between rivals in the early furlongs, was in a long drive to duel with an inner rival on the
far turn, then gained command mid stretch, led briefly but was caught at the wire. HOLY EMPEROR dueled for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive
throughout the majority of the course, was used up in the home stretch and gave way. FEDERAL HILL chased the pace while three wide, then rallied in the
upper stretch to close willingly in the home stretch. TAPADINE chased the pace from the inside under a steady drive throughout the first three quarters then
closed evenly in the home stretch. JOHN DOUGH settled in the three path then rallied in the home stretch while four wide and was no threat. FAST
