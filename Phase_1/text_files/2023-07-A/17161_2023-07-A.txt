ROYAL CITY REIGN tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the far turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch
fought gamely for the win. MY GIRL HOOTER was unhurried early and had a good position on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
was outgunned. AWILDAS TREASURE set the pace and had the lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. DOODLE
DANDY was off slow and moved up on the far turn but had no late kick. ORIGINAL ME stalked the leader early but lost ground on the far turn and was
empty.

FEELING was in range, raced evenly on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BROADWAY RUCKUS stalked the
leader, was a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner. BEST AND FINAL set the
pace but was headed on the far turn and had nothing left. UNBRIDLED INFERNO was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and was up for a share.
MUNGER broke outward and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. CATRIN was off the pace and
showed little in a dull effort. EL GUERO was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

from the six path through the stretch was up for show. MOBILIZER was in range and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
needed more. BOUND LUCKY was hustled early and saved ground on the turn but was no threat. ONE MORE RING was well back, trailed the field and

Footnotes
MUSICAL RIDE set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. CARISMATICA was in range,
raced evenly on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for place. FRERET was in touch and a factor on the far turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. SAVVY'S SISTER was unhurried early and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch had no kick. BORN TO BE GOOD was well back and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. SAN NICOLA STAR was off the pace,
trailed the field on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. IS THERE A FOREST forced the early pace and dueled on
the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened.

FRESH DREAMS was away alertly, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. THINK IT THRU was
unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. MORE SAVVY stalked the early leaders and was a
factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. HONEY GIRL was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch needed more. SUBZERO PLUS was in touch and saved ground on the turn but had no late kick. ORBITING THE SKY was well back
and closed the gap on the turn but was never in contention. EASY ACCESS was hustled early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
ROAD MAP was in touch, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. FORMENTOR stalked the early leaders and was
roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. VERMONT HOLIDAY was hustled early, dueled on the turn and from the
three path at the top of the stretch held show. ONLY BELIEVE was well back, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. FINAL
EPISODE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. LOADED SECRET was away alertly and had a slim lead on the turn but
gave way mid stretch. HONEYBUNNYBOOBOO was in range but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch faded.
