Footnotes
HEAVY TIMBER led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dug in in the lane to hold off a closer. YATTA was reluctant to load,
broke well and chased the leader up the backstretch, continued pursuit of that rival while racing in the two path around the bend and gained ground steadily
to the wire. FINICKY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and
improved position in the stretch. LUIS ALBERTO veered sharply to the outside leaving the gate, was taken in hand by his rider to race off the pace up the
backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the final furlong. MORTAL SIN raced at the back of the pack on the
inside early, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick while drifting out. LEE ALEJANDRO trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
angled in to save ground around the turn and made no bid. HONEST ROGUE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages,
came around the turn in the two path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
FLIRTINI dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend and drew off in the lane. WILD GIRL raced off
the pace on the outside through the opening stages, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to chase the winner
home in the stretch. BEST WORST IDEA bobbled leaving the gate, tracked the pace setter on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid
between horses coming around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. SHEMADEMEBLUSH raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn
from the three path and never threatened. SUNDOG dueled on inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. HUMOR
SENSE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and tired in the stretch.
