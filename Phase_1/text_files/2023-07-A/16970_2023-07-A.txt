MRS. RIP dueled for the lead inside of a rival while remaining a path off of the inner rail around the turn, shook free of that one entering the final furlong, dug
in to resist an outer challenge leaving the sixteenth pole and held gamely CAT'S CAVE raced in mid pack early, advanced five wide through the turn, was
gaining through the stretch, needed more ground and finished second best. WHATTA WORLD was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the turn,
drifted in mid stretch, was angled out and was along for third. BOOTSY'S MERLOT was outrun early from the inside and finished evenly late. SAPPHIRE
NIGHTS dueled outside of the eventual winner while taking the turn in the three path, but drifted out subtly entering the lane and weakened through the final
furlong. LITTLE MUSIC was reserved early while racing four wide through the turn and offered no late rally. ESPERE was unhurried early, angled out in
early stretch and never fired. TAPWRIT WARRIOR was void of any early speed while racing three wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ABSINTHE prompted outside of the pace setter, inched closer to vie around the turn, wrestled an advantage entering the lane and edged clear through the
final sixteenth. PUMPKIN SCONE set a pressured pace inside of the eventual winner, vied with that one around the turn, but was headed at the three
sixteenths pole, fought on through midstretch but gave way with a sixteenth to go and was clearly second best. MO BLOOMS was rushed early, settled
while advancing between rivals into the turn, fell back through the turn, followed the top two finishers and was along for third. FANCY broke a step slow, was
unhurried early, advanced four wide through the turn, angled out and passed tired rivals. THEROANRUNNER was void of any early speed, raced five wide
into the turn, angled out mid-stretch and finished evenly late. HAPPY AM I tracked the early pace, went four wide into the turn, drifted out late and was
empty. PETTICOAT was reserved early, saved ground through the turn, angled out and offered no late rally. SUGAR BOO trailed in the four to five path into
the turn, but lugged outwardly turning for home and jogged home.

Footnotes
WADSWORTH stalked the early pace, saved ground, angled out to the five path out of the home turn, drifted out slightly out of the turn, made a bid on MO
STASH in mid stretch, dueled briefly and edged clear late. MO STASH set a clear early pace early on, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer bidders
around the far turn, sprinted free of them in upper stretch before an outer WADSWORTH loomed a danger entering the final furlong, met that ones bid
entering the final sixteenth, dueled briefly but couldn't hold him off and was second best. DESERT DUKE stumbled at the start, was allowed to settle early,
advanced four wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. SHARAR broke out slightly at the start before being slow into stride, was void of any
early speed, raced in the six path through the second turn, found his best stride outside of rivals in the final furlong and finished with a mild late rally.
HIDDEN PATH tracked two to three wide, ranged up outside of the leading pair to around the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep
pace with the early leader before getting outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds and yielded between horses soon after. GIGANTE was not far
back early while racing between rivals through the home turn, angled in late and weakened.

Footnotes
EDIFIED stalked close up along the inside, patiently awaited racing room behind the leading pair around the turn, tipped outside of them leaving the quarter
pole to offer a bold bid entering the lane, quickly took control in early stretch, opened up while drifting inwardly leaving the furlong grounds and drew off.
LIBERAL ARTS stalked three wide, got a jump on the eventual winner into the turn to offer a bid outside of the leader at the five sixteenths pole, led leaving
that marker, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and held place well thereafter. DJANGO broke out at the start, was unhurried early,
advanced four wide through the turn, angled out late and was along for third. FEEL THE MAGIC was taken back early, raced along the inside into the turn,
angled out advanced between rivals and finished belatedly. UNO MAS BOURBON broke in at the start, was void of speed, raced three wide into the turn,
angled out and flattened out. LEAD FOOT was allowed to settle early, raced four wide, drifted out and was empty. TOP OF THE STREET raced in mid pack
early from the inside, angled out in early stretch and never fired. SEIZE THE GREY was void of early speed, advanced outside of rivals and in the five path
entering the turn, but faded while floated to the six path turning for home. NORMANDY HERO was away alertly, set the pace in the two path entering the
turn, got headed by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole, gave way to the top two entering the lane and folded through the final furlong.

SINFILTRE was allowed to settle early, eased back into the home turn from between rivals, angled out mid-stretch, was closing fast, took control late and
surged clear for the win. NOT SO CLOSE set a clear early pace, raced along the inside through the turns, kept on through the stretch to finish a game
second. FANCY MARTINI tracked the early pace, loomed four wide through the second turn, made a bid on NOT SO CLOSE, couldn't sustain the run and
was out finished late. LADY ARSINOE was vid of any speed, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out through the stretch, was gaining late and
needed more ground. UNDER ONE SKY raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the second turn and finished evenly late. ONE TIME MO was taken
back early, angled out seven wide through the second turn and flattened out. FLATTER ME SILLY was unhurried, advanced eight wide through the second
turn and offered no late rally. SHE'S GONE was reserved early, raced six wide out of the second turn and never fired. MUSIC AMORE stalked the early
pace from the inside while being rank and faded. TOO PRETTY was up close early from between rivals and gave way.

Footnotes
BANGO set the pace along the inside, met the bid of MARSALIS at the three furlong pole, got narrowly headed by that one at the five sixteenths marker, yet
sustained the duel entering the lane, regained an advantage at the furlong grounds and gamely held from pursuers through the late stages. MARSALIS
prompted the pace two wide, bid at the three furlong pole before forging an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to kick away form his inner
counterpart in upper stretch, relinquished the advantage to that one at the furlong grounds, fought on through the late stages, but failed to regain even terms
and saved place from an inner rival. MILES AHEAD tracked behind the leading pair into the turn, chased them from the two path while subtly failing to keep
position around the turn, turned for home between horses, yet kept on through the final furlong to vie for place along the inside in the late stages, but missed
reaching that position. TEJANO TWIST was unhurried early, inched closer in the four path turning for home, took aim in the five path and outside of rivals in
upper stretch, but only offered a slow grind in the final furlong and needed more to produce a bid HAPPY JACK trailed in the three path, moved up in
midstretch while hanging on his left lead, shifted out in the final furlong and was gaining late. SURVEILLANCE was void of any speed, raced along the
inside, angled out and never fired.

HOIST THE GOLD dueled for the lead along the inside, opened up in midstretch and drove clear. GULFSTREAM WAY tracked the main group early on,
chased them from the four path around the turn, then ran on in the five path to gain place in the final sixteenth and narrowed the leader's margin late.
AWESOME AARON dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner via a narrow advantage around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that one nearing
the furlong grounds, gave way and lasted for show. BROKEN RIB was void of any early speed, went four wide through the turn, was drifting out through the
stretch and was closing late. TRAFALGAR was impeded early, was outrun early, raced six wide through the turn, was carried out through the stretch and
was gaining late. VIOLENT CITY tracked the early pace, went four wide into the turn and was empty late. BRON AND BROW raced in mid pack early from
the inside and finished evenly late. CALL ME MIDNIGHT was taken back early, raced between rivals through the turn, steadied in crowded quarters
approaching midstretch and made little impact. MR. BIG NEWS trailed while well off of the inside and was outrun

PAULINE'S PEARL was allowed to settle behind the leaders early on, chased outside of them around the far turn, inched closer under moderate urging
turning for home, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, sustained a steady grind to bid in the final furlong and was up in time. BELLAMORE set a clear
early pace, raced off the rail through the first turn, showed the way from a bidding A MO REAY while remaining off the rail around the far turn, battled while
drifting into that rival in midstretch, then bumped her in the final sixteenth while getting outfinished by an outer bidder. A MO REAY prompted the pace two
wide, loomed a danger outside of the leader and from the five path into the far turn, bid with three furlongs to go, vied turning for home, but was bumped and
brushed by her inner counterpart through the lane, then took contact from that one late while getting outkicked by the eventual winner. THE STEWARDS
POSTED AN INQUIRY AND DISQUALIFIEDE BELLAMORE AND PLACED HER THIRD FOR INTERFERANCE TO A MO REAY THROUGH THE
STRETCH.

WEST WILL POWER prompted the pace three to two wide, bid at the three furlong pole, drove clear in upper stretch and held from an outer bidder in the
closing stages. RATTLE N ROLL settled well back along the inside, took closer order approaching the far turn, pursued in hand while patiently awaiting
racing room around that bend, swung out to the five path entering the lane, then rallied to attempt a bid outside of the leader in the closing stages but was
fended off late. HAPPY AMERICAN lagged behind in the two path, gained entering the lane, split rivals two wide nearing the sixteenth pole to produce a bid
for place, but failed to match strides with an outer rival for that position soon after. LAST SAMURAI tracked from the three path, was urged along in the four
to five path around the far turn before being floated to the six path entering the lane, then ran on evenly. SMILE HAPPY tracked along the inside, pursued
from the pocket into the far turn, tipped to the three path at the five sixteenths pole in hopes of offering a bid between horses turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with the leader in upper stretch and yielded between horses approaching the final sixteenth. STILLETO BOY prompted the pace along the inside
before easing back to track leaving the seven furlong pole, shifted outside of the leading pair entering the backstretch, pursued them into the far turn, inched
closer while getting floated four wide at the five furlong pole, offered a mild bid at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper
stretch and gave way between horses through the final furlong. SPEED BIAS set the pace two wide around the first turn, tucked to the inside entering the
backstretch as an outer rival continued to apply pressure, met that foe?s bid at the three furlong pole, failed to keep pace nearing the lane and weakened in
upper stretch. PROXY laid off the pace along the inside into the opening bend, but steadied hard out of a bit of tight rail quarters passing the mile pole,
shifted out before tipping to the five path entering the backstretch, then faded in the six path around the far turn.

Footnotes
XIGERA followed the early pace, ranged up three wide through the second turn, mad a bid through the stretch, dueled with HEAVENLY SUNDAY and
prevailed for the win. HEAVENLY SUNDAY set a clear early pace, raced along the inside through the turns, met the bid of XIGERA, dueled to the wire and
just missed. SAFEEN was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the turns, waited for room mid stretch, angled out late stretch and was closing fast.
METAPHYSICAL was outrun early, advanced between rivals into the home turn, angled out to the five path and offered a mild rally. WONDERFULL LADY
(FR) was reserved early, saved ground and finished evenly late. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE was void of any early sped, went five wide through the second
turn and offered no late rally. SANTA FE GOLD tracked the early pace, raced fur wide through the second turn and was empty. KLASSY BRIDGETTE off
slow, was unhurried early, raced five wide through the second turn and never fired.
