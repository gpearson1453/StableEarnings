Footnotes
MAJOR DEAL was off mid pack in the three path, slowly advanced up the back side into a stalking position behind the leaders, edged out into the four path
nearing the five sixteenth pole, launched a bid and took the lead at the quarter pole, was kept on point and lightly encouraged down the strretch and got the
win. MORO LEGEND was well off of the pace and racing in the two path, was allowed to settle in hands, launched a bid after the half mile pole, saved
ground through the turn, passed rivals at the quarter pole, chased the eventual winner down through the stretch, repelling an outside challenger, could not
get to the the winner but was second best today. POINT BLANK was off the pace early, raced in the three path near the b ack of the field early on, inched
out into the four path and launched a bid passing the first set of rivals at the half mile pole, edged out into the four path and passed rivals through the turn,
battled in the upper stretch wit and inside foe and down the lane for second place but did not have enough today finishing third. COUNTRY CUT was strong
in the bridle and went from mid pack into stalking the early pace setter right away, stalked that foe until the five sixteenth pole, was passed on the outside by
another contender and faded. SUPER INTENSE willingly led, was three and four wide early, shifted into the two path, led until the three eighths pole and
faded through the turn. LIT A SHUCK stalked for a quarter mile and then faded.

Footnotes
BOMBER COMMAND showed early speed, took the lead, raced in the two path, was uncontested through out. SAN JUAN HILL stalked the pace setter in
the three path, gently shuffled back a bit, angled in towards the rail in the upper stretch, was asked and responded by closing up the rail, shifted out into the
two path near the wire but could not get past the winner but did repel an outside contender holding onto second place honors. ALL IN GOOD TIME was
racing four wide and stalking from in between horses, was angled out at the three eighths pole into the five path, could not get to the eventual winner but
battled for second, just not enough today. HOLIDAY RUN was off mid pack, steadied for a moment during the initial jockeying for position out of the gates,
angled out into the five path, raced there through out launching a mild bid through the turn and into the lane, raced in between foes while briefly battling with
and outside foe, was ble t out finish the rest. SACRAMENT vied for the lead, was three wide, settled into stalking the leader from the three path, stalked until
the quarter pole and tired. HEZA ROYAL CAT showed brief speed early, raced four wide, angled out into the six path in the upper stretch and ran even.
PIKACHU was never involved. DABOOGEYMAN trailed through out. MANDOLORIA was no menace.

Footnotes
ROSES ARE GRAY was off a step slow, was allowed to settle i hands in the two path, started to advance at the half mile pole, angled into the four path at
the three eighths pole, circled the field through the turn, went widest of all, was asked and responded well closing ground in the stretch was under heavy left
handed crop through out, closing with each stride all the way down to the wire, getting her nose in front at the wire. FUHR MEO showed natural speed early,
angled over and took the lead and the rail, set the pace, showed the way to the wire, was caught by an outside closer in the last jump and just missed.
TWENTYTWENTYREDO raced three wide, was in the middle of the pack and in between foes, advanced at the half mile pole, launched a bid at the three
eighths pole, passed foes entering the stretch, was challenged by the eventual winner, battled with her for a few strides, then chased the rest of the way
coming away with third place honors. GUEST IN MY HEART raced four wide, was mid pack on the outside, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, but had
no late kick. MAGICAL STARDUST was mid pack and racing on the rail, but was never involved. SUPER ET bumped gates, showed little. LIL HOT TODDY
was sharp outo f the gate, settled off of the pace and stalked the early paced setter, faded after the half mile pole.

Footnotes
DEPUTY KNIGHT vied for the lead, settled off of the pace and stalked from the four path, hooked company and advanced as a set at the three eighths pole,
was pushed out into the six path by the battling inside rival, was six wide and fighting down the lane, switched leads and was able to put her head in front for
the win. GOD'S GOLD raced on the rail in mid pack, moved at the half mile pole, race in between foes, challenged for the lead, shifted out at the five
sixteenth pole into the five path, matched strides and advanced down the lane battling with every stride, shook one rival but continued to battle intolate
stretch, nearing the wire and just missed. ROSIE'S BOY vied for the lead, raced between foes, battled until the eighth pole and could not sustain the bid
tiring late. NOBLE CONNECTION vied for the lead, faced in the two path, raced in betwen foes and tired at he eighth pole. ROYAL DE BE was two wide
and racing on the inside of a large set, traveled in that position but had no late kick. VERO CAMPIONE mid pack, three wide, and in between foes, but never
got involved. CUNNING raced in the four path and in between horses in the middle of the pack, but to no avail. SEEKING CHROME vied for the lead, raced
on the rail, led in a set of four, could not sustain the bid and gave way. RIANTE SKY raced from off the pace was five wide and launched a mild bid. FLAT
OUT FABIO flashed early speed, vied for the lead four wide, led on the outside of a set of four and gave way. MR CANDIDO was mid pack, six wide and
between foes and had no impact. BLACK CHEETAH showed little.
