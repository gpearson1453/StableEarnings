Footnotes
EL GRANDE O showed good speed on the outside then moved clear leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when
asked near the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop just inside the furlong marker and held
under strong urging. JIMMYTHETOOTH showed speed on the inside of a foe then dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the three
path on the turn, re-engaged the leader late on that bend, lost touch with that rival under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while well clear for the
place. PERLIANO chased the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show.
SKYLER'S STARSHIP was restless in the gate then broke slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on
the turn and failed to threaten. SPECIALAGENTJONSON broke a half-step slow then dropped back under urging, went three then four wide on the turn and
capitulated. DISCO PREACHER broke a bit slow, was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the two to three path, bumped with a foe near the
furlong marker and was no factor. BALI AMOUR broke a half-step slow then dropped back, saved ground on the turn, had the rider hit the rail with a
left-handed crop in upper stretch, bumped with an opponent near the furlong marker and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
VALLELUJAH was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, rallied late on that bend, closed well to make a bid in upper stretch, took the lead
inside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth and just held off the runner-up under strong urging. OK HONEY was hustled from the gate then ridden
along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while able to
get the place. SECURITY CODE acted-up at the start then was away awkwardly and taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged well off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. FANCY JOKE bumped
with a rival at the start, dueled on the inside of a foe while along the rail, dropped back coming to the half-mile pole then switched to the two path, chased in
the two path through the turn, took the lead in the three path into upper stretch, led under threat from the winner into the final furlong then lost the
advantage, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. SILVER FIST broke in and bumped with a foe, dueled on the outside of that rival, moved
clear nearing the half-mile pole then dropped from the two path to the inside, lost the lead in the two path into upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and tired. HAPPY SOPHIA settled behind the leading duo, was asked in the three path on the turn and lacked
the needed response. BACKED BY GOLD was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail under the crop in upper stretch and was
no factor.

Footnotes
SUNDAESWITHSANDY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, tipped to the two path through the turn and was let out
continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. SHADOW DRAGON chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along
second best. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS prompted the pace of SUNDAESWITHSANDY from the outside three wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BIG BOBBY coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, lost ground and continued four to five wide into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish.

THANK YOU JON showed good speed from the outside, moved clear in the three path with a half-mile to run then dropped to the two path, responded well
when asked at the top of the stretch, drew off into the final furlong, was put to a left-handed crop at that point, widened into the final sixteenth then was
eased up while much the best. NOBILIS dropped back while urged along, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and
improved for the place. TWIRLING VINE chased the pace down the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn and weakened then lost the place
while clear for the show. CHALKY CAT bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged early then settled off the pace, dropped back late on the
backstretch, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ALPHA SONNY bumped with a foe at
the start, showed speed under urging then pressed the pace, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and tired. LOOKIN' TO WIN
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, slipped past the injured foe without incident at the
three-eighths and failed to threaten. TIP OF THE BOOT dropped back on the inside then moved out near the five-eighths, went three wide early on the turn,
moved five wide to go around an injured foe nearing the three=eighths, continued five wide into the stretch and was no factor. SEIZE THE CITY bumped
with a rival at the start, showed speed then was well placed just off the pace, traveled in the two path under urging on the turn, suffered an injury to his left
foreleg outside the three-eighths pole and was pulled up then vanned off.

BRING ME A CHECK chased inside briefly before being taken hold of and tipped to the two path five and a half furlongs out as SENBEI took to the inside in
front, advanced to press that rival from the outside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive dueling through the stretch to the finish and gamely inched away inside the final seventy yards to score. SENBEI established the front and
showed the way briefly from the two path before tucking inside with five and a half furlongs to run, came under increasing pressure from the top one through
the turn and was placed to coaxing in response nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in dueling through to the finish in game
fashion but was ultimately collared with seventy yards to the finish and denied at the end and had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the inside in the
final steps to the wire. MAXWELL ESQUIRE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. PINE KNOLL three wide in aim early on latched on the top pair, eased off those rivals five furlongs from
home and chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kept on one paced to the finish.
PAROS broke outwards brushing the off side stall at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper
stretch and offered no rally. AFTER FIVE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued
in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

a bid at the quarter-pole, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, drifted in while moving clear inside the furlong marker and proved best under steady
urging. FLY RIGHT was hustled to the front then went clear early, rounded the opening bend in the two path, showed the way with a clear advantage,
opened up more outside the five-eighths pole, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner in
upper stretch, fought with that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the place. SWORE went four then three wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the final turn and finished willingly to just miss the place while well clear for the show. HEADLINE
NEWS traveled three wide on the first turn, settled in fourth position, was asked in the three path on the far turn and failed to rally. NOSTALGIC ONE was
hustled from the start then angled in early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, went around a stopping foe in the two path early on the far turn
then dropped back to the rail and failed to threaten. WHENLOVETAKESOVER went two to three wide on the turns and failed to respond. FLUORESCENT
BAY went five then four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn and also failed to respond. MUGSY FURY was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced a bit eagerly early, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three
path on the far turn and capitulated. LOCKE AND KEY went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, came up empty late on

outside, came under hustling and showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing just outside the
quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and edged clear through the final furlong to prevail. PLAYINGWITHMATCHES chased

the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors between foes at the end. MOVING PICTURES bobbled at the
break, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. PRESSURE

MORE THAN LOOKS broke a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved to the three path late on that bend,
shifted out while asked for his best in upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong, closed fast on the embattled leaders into the final sixteenth and got up
under good handling. TALK OF THE NATION went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival while in hand, dropped from the two path to the rail
under coaxing on the turn, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to NAGIRROC at the quarter-pole then came out under a
left-handed crop and brushed with that opponent into upper stretch, fought on well while dueling inside of the aforementioned foe into the final sixteenth,
gamely bested that foe for the place but was overtaken by the winner. NAGIRROC prompted the pace on the outside under restraint, drew even with the
leader in the three path on the turn, took a narrow advantage at the quarter-pole then brushed with a foe while in the four path coming to the
three-sixteenths, dueled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was also overtaken while just missing the place. MAJOR DUDE was well
placed just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. DREAMING OF KONA
broke in and bumped with a foe then was pulled off that rival with a tug of the right rein, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the four path on
the turn and capitulated. BELOUNI (FR) was bumped at the start and forced in then taken up, raced under very stout restraint while tugging hard on the bit,
advanced quickly when removed from cover outside the half-mile pole, gained to make a bid into the turn, bore out from the five path to the eight path going
around that bend and had nothing left. AMSTRONG was hustled from the gate then settled towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn
and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DIAMOND STATUS four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in and held safe from a late challenge to the finish. FREEDOM
FOR ALL saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and closed well to latch on
the aforementioned foe as she hit the wire. VOLATILITY broke out at the start bumping MEOW MEOW HISS, chased just off the inside down the
backstretch until tucking to the inside half a mile from home, continued along the inside through the turn, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch,
tipped out four to five paths nearing the eighth pole and offered up a good finish to secure the show honors. WHISKEY LULLABY five to six paths off the
inside through the dog legged turn into the backstretch, tucked four wide and took over command inside the seven-eighths and showed the way down the
backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the last major share. FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MEOW MEOW HISS got bumped at the start by
VOLATILITY, who broke outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was
outkicked. KATIE'S CHECKRIDE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in
the late going. CANT KEEP ME DOWN four wide into the backstretch, darted inside when seeing an opening to do so five furlongs from home, rode the rail
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered no kick. WICKSIEPIXIE chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DON'T TELL AMY chased three then
two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
