Footnotes
NEED A MARKER stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and went up to vie for the lead on the outside of the trio, made a three wide bid by the five
sixteenths and was clear by the quarter pole, then remained clear by the furlong marker and then held off the late closing ILLUSION OF HOPE to prove
best, driving. ILLUSION OF HOPE was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn and came six wide into the lane, closed well on the outside but
could not get to the winner. VICTORIAN RIVIERA vied for the lead between rivals, then fell off the pace leaving the five sixteenths and shifted to the inside,
was still in contention off the turn but faded late, bested rest. GLEAMING BRUTALITY tracked the early pace, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter
pole and came four wide into the lane but flattened out. MY SISTER CLURRIE was away alertly and was soon clear and crossed over to the inside, then
vied for the lead on the inside by the half mile marker, weakened on the turn. BOSS ANGEL tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid nearing the
quarter pole, came five wide into the lane but was empty, eased late, walked off. CAPTIVATING GAL chased the pace four wide, then was wide on the turn
and stopped.

Footnotes
CHICKS DIG SCARS stalked the pace three wide while in hand, came four wide into the lane and was sent down leaving the turn, wore down the
pacesetter in the furlong grounds and edged clear late to prove best, driving. GOLDEN JUAN set the pace on the inside while clear, then dug in nearing the
furlong marker, drifted out in the furlong grounds and was caught while being second best. MEET ME AT MUNDIS was allowed to settle early, advanced
two wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane but lacked a late rally. GALAXY MUSIC chased the early pace and weakened. CHOCOLATE SHAKE
was well placed along the inside, tipped out two wide off the turn, was attempting to split rivals by the furlong marker, but clipped heels when GOLDEN
JUAN drifted out and fell, walked off. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the stretch run, after reviewing the replays GOLDEN JUAN was
DISQUALIFIED from second and placed fourth.

Footnotes
BOMBERELLA was settled and hard held on the inside early, advanced on the rail on the turn to loom boldly, tipped out off the turn for aim on the
pacesetter, engaged that rival leaving the three sixteenths, then was roused nearing the furlong marker and took over, then was clear by the sixteenth
marker and was geared down to prove much the best. AMOR SALVAJE was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the far turn following the winner,
swung out three wide leaving the turn, finished willingly to gain the place award while no match to the winner. HOPEFUL CURE was bumped at the start,
then vied for the lead two wide early, then went on to set the pace on backstretch and draw clear and move to the inside, then was headed leaving the three
sixteenths and weakened the final furlong, bested rest. CHEZ SOLEIL was settled early on the inside, shifted out three wide at the half mile marker, made a
three wide move nearing the three eighths marker, came four wide into the lane but flattened out. BOUNTY KILLAH vied for the early lead on the inside,
then backed off on the backstretch and switched to the two path, then tracked the pace on the turn but weakened in the drive. CANDY COOP lacked a rally.
EXOTIC CAT was four wide into the first turn, then made a four wide middle move nearing the three eighths marker but tired. LOOKIN AT KISSES was
settled two wide early and tired. JUMP A FOX showed little.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING LARRY prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then was three wide off the turn and edged away
in the furlong grounds to prove best under right handed crop urging. SIR WELLINGTON set the pace on the inside, then was headed nearing the quarter
pole and dueled for command to the furlong marker, but was outfinished while being clearly second ebst. CHIEF RON was rated early, made a three wide
move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole, came four wide into the drive but flattened out. BEREN was off a step slow, then moved up to tracked
the leaders on the inside, saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed winning stretch bid. NO SABE NADA was rated two wide early, shifted out on the
turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. DRAFTED chased the pace on the outside and had no rally.

Footnotes
NOW AND LATER was settled along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn, then had a long drive the final
sixteenth with ASTHROS and prevailed gamely to prove best. ASTHROS was well placed on the inside, then made a bid to split rivals at the three eights,
but the pacesetter responded on the turn, then angled in leaving the turn when the SLEIGHT OF HAND floated out off the turn, engaged with the winner in
the furlong grounds but was outfinished to just miss. SLEIGHT OF HAND vied for the lead on the inside, turned back the bid from ASTHROS at the three
eighths marker, floated out off the turn to the three path while leading, then was headed leaving the furlong marker and yielded the final sixteenth while
besting the rest. HISTORIC HEART (IRE) vied for the lead three wide, cvame four wide into the drive but faded the final furlong. TIO TONY tracked the early
pace two to three wide, then had a three wide pursuit on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and had no kick. SWALLOW BEACH was reservd on
the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and had no rally. FACTUM LOVE STYLE was taken back early, not a threat. SKY STYLISH was off a step
slow, then was three wide early, two wide on the backstretch, dropped to the inside on the far turn and tired. SCORESTOSETTLE chased the pace three
wide and then stopped.

Footnotes
AWESOME PIC was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside while clear, well handled and drew off on the turn, then was given a vigorous hand ride
in the lane and then was geared down late to prove best. WATERWORKS was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a three
wide bid nearing the half mile marker, then chased the winner on th turn and was between rivals off the turn, held the place gamely. MUSICAL CAT
stumbled at the start, tracked the pace on the inside, finished willingly to the wire getting the nod for the show award. BIG CHEEKS was rated early, made a
three to four wide rin on the far turn but hung late, missed show award. DOTADA was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. TIMELY TRADITION
stalked the pace between rivals and three wide and then tired.

SOPRAN BASILEA (IRE) was reserved on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and awaited room by the quarter pole, steadied slightly by the three
sixteenths, then got thru on the inside of PARNAC when the gap opens for the chute to get by that rival, closed well to get up in time to prove best, driving.
EVER SUMMER set the pace along the inside while being well handled, shook clear by the five eighths marker, then was challenged entering the stretch,
but dug in gamely and kept on but was caught late to just miss. PARNAC (FR) was well placed on the inside, was in the pocket on the turn awaited room
leaving the turn, made a bid when the gap opens for the chute on the inside, but was out-kicked by the winner and could not get to the pacesetter.
TALBEYAH (IRE) was allowed to settle while saving ground, shifted off the inside by the quarter pole, swung out four wide leaving the turn, was among
traffic by the furlong marker, finally got clear at the sixteenth marker and had a late rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. LADY ROCKSTAR (GB) had
a two wide pursuit throughout and came three wide into the drive and had no late kick. VIAREGGIO (IRE) pulled early, then stalked the pace two wide and
relaxed on the backstretch, made a two wide bid off the turn but flattened out. FRIVOLE (FR) was settled early two wide, then was asked on the turn and
came four wide into the lane but was empty late.

FOGGY NIGHT was rated behind the front runners towards the inside, shifted out to be two to three wide on the turn, was roused left handed by the quarter
pole to make a four wide bid entering the stretch, then was switched to right handed crop urging lugging in, then was corrected and another pop right
handed and lugged in again bumping MIRACLE but corrected again and then drew clear under another right handed pop to prove best. OPUS FORTY TWO
set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed leaving the five sixteenths, continued to battle to the furlong marker on the inside of the trio, could
not go with the winner late while getting the bob for the place award gamely. MIRACLE stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to
duel for command, then was between rivals by the furlong marker vying for command, then was bumped by the winner and hung late, lost bob for the place
award. FIRELINE was settled two wide early, between rivals at the five eighths marker, ridden along on the turn but was on e paced, came four wide into the
lane and had no kick. COVER THE SPREAD was settled on the inside and lacked a rally. BALPOOL was four wide into the first turn, reserved on the
outside and had no response. FAST TRACKED was off a step slow and hit the gate, then was five wide into the first turn, failed to menace. CATS INTHE
TIMBER was three wide into the first turn, settled three wide and tired.
