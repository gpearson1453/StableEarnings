Footnotes
ST. ELMO pressed the pace early while in the three path, cleared in mid-turn, was put under pressure outside the eighth pole then repelled that challenge
and cleared late. TRICOLOUR bobbled at the start, raced in the two path into the far turn, bid two wide and in the three path through the turn, continued in
the three of four path into the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then had to settle for second best. GLEN AIRY settled off the early pace while
in the two path, bid three wide and in the four path through the turn when moving closer, came into the lane from the four or five path and flattened out.
FUJIN bid four wide and in the five path through the turn, swung into the lane from the six path and tired. GUNNER BAY pressed the pace along the inside
into the far turn and was done along the rail.

Footnotes
SMOKEY MANDATE pressed the dawdling pace two wide through mid-turn, was asked in late turn and into the lane, was well clear when straightening then
drew off under a strong hand ride. CABLE BOSS was along the inside through the turns, never far back into the far turn, came off the rail and into the two
path for the drive, could not gain on the winner then was under a drive to save the place spot. GETTLEMAN raced along the inside into the far turn, steadied
while running up on slower rival in mid-turn, continued near the rail into the lane and moved up for the minor share. AIR MARSHAL set the pace along the
inside through late turn while under pressure then gave way entering the lane. THE MOTTO raced off the rail into the far turn, bid four wide through the turn
when getting closer, swung into the lane from the six path then flattened out late. HIGHEST RATED (IRE) chased the pace from the three path into the far
turn, bid three wide and between rivals through late turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired. SCHOOLMASTER (GER) never a factor while near
the rail through the turns. CLOSE TALKER chased the pace while along the inside through mid-turn then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
DESIGNATED hopped at the start and trailed briefly, raced in the two path through the turn, angled into the five or six path for the drive and methodically
edged up from mid-track to be up in time. BAYTOWN BAMA GIRL raced along the inside through the turn, shifted into the four path for the drive and was
closing with the winner to be up for the place spot. GREEN GRACE chased the pace from the two or three path into the turn, continued between rivals
through the lane when near the front then weakened late. LADLE bid three wide through the turn, moved to near even terms with an eighth to go then
faltered late. PRETTY VEGAS set the pace on a clear lead into the turn, was joined by two rivals in mid-turn, continued to duel with those through the lane
then gave way late. TIDBIT was in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the eight path and never was a factor.
MASTER THE TACTICS dropped far back into the far turn, continued to lose ground into the lane and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
NOBALS set the pace while under pressure through the turn, shook clear outside the eighth pole opened his largest advantage with an eighth to run and
was kept to the task to the end while not seriously threatened. CHARCOAL was in mid-pack while in the three path through the turn, was asked for more in
late turn, came into the lane from the six path, continued with good energy inside the eighth pole and gained the place spot late from mid-track. JUST
MIGHT chased the pace from the two path through the turn, tipped into the three path into the lane, had aim on the winner while moving closest to that one
inside the eighth pole, slowly gained late but lost the place spot at the wire. SHIMMER ME TIMBERS pressed the winner two wide through the turn, lost
contact into the lane then weakened late. UNPREDICTABLE BAY was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and finished
evenly from mid-track. MAJOR WAGER was put in tight early while between rivals, steadied out to last, trailed into the lane then was never in it. DON'T
WAIT UP never a factor while along the inside. DIAMOND CITY was put in tight with the rail early and jostled, raced near the inside and never made an
impact.
