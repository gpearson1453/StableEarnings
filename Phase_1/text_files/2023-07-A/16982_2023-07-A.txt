turn, then drew off in the stretch and held on well to prevail in the end. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER lunged at the start, then chased the dueling leaders from
the inside into the far turn, rallied to gain the place position in the early stretch, but could never catch the leader and was best for second. INFINITE MORO
set the pace into the first turn, then dueled with an outer rival down the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way for the lead then re rallied in the early
stretch to gain the show position and held till the end. IMA BIG BOPPER chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the
far turn to menace in the stretch for the show prize but was out finished in the end. CANATLAN raced close behind the pack throughout the first half, then
came out four wide to rally on the far turn and into the early stretch to battle for the show prize but gave way in the end.

Footnotes
MR MONEY BAGS dueled on the pace from the rail to the top of the lane, shook clear in upper stretch, drew off handily as much best and was geared down
at the wire. MY GOLDEN M broke sharply to lead from the gate, battled on the lead with the winner to the head of the stretch, could not keep pace with the
winner but kept on well to be clear for the place. BOBBY BRINKLEY herded toward the rail leaving the gate by CHIEF BRADY to be in tight, shortly after the
start was continuously bumped when FEARLESS PRINCE dropped in, causing him to drop to rear of the field, was gathered up, rallied down the lane well
enough to pick up the show in a very rough trip. FEARLESS PRINCE shortly from the gate dropped in to bump CHIEF BRADY, who in turn bumped BOBBY
BRINKLEY, causing both rivals to bump several times and take back to the rear of the field, then found a tracking spot along the rail and went evenly never
threatening. BLING BLING BLING chased the leaders down the backside, made an early bid in the turn and flattened out. CHIEF BRADY leaned in leaving
the gate to crowd BOBBY BRINKLEY, straightened away and immediately was bumped by FEARLESS PRINCE, causing a bumping match with rivals, fell
out of the squeezed position and lost all interest. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN DOWN THE BACKSIDE AND UPON REVIEW
MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

IMA SKY TRAVELER stalked the leader down the backside, rallied four wide in the turn while still in hand to engage the pacesetter at the head of the lane,
assumed command in mid-stretch and drew clear. KELLEY SAID READY prominent throughout while saving ground along the fence, cut the corner and
closed willingly up the rail in the lane. SALTAMONTES DIVA tracked the early pace in striking position, lost position through the turn and finished well when
called upon in the lane. DIXIE CARROUSEL slow early to be at the back of the field and rallied well to be closing down the stretch although belatedly.
PHUNK sped to the lead from the gate after breaking alertly, opened a clear advantage, slowed the pace in the turn while well rated, had no response when
collared turning for home and weakened through the lane. CROSS CLAIM well placed to be in striking distance through the turn and lacked a closing
response. BEBOP BABY went evenly as a non-threat. AZUNIA unhurried early, made a threatening middle move in the turn and flattened out in the stretch.

SHINING EXAMPLE chased the pace while two wide, was gaining on the turn to vie for the lead with inner rivals in the early stretch, then dueled grudgingly
with an inner rival in the last sixteenth and was up by a nose in the end. CRANKY SHEILA chased the pace from the inside, then battled with outer rivals
leaving the turn, pulled away to duel in the last furlong but hung in the end. MAGICAL GOLD was unhurried early, then was in a steady drive throughout the
turn, then found the best stride late stretch and was up for the show prize in the end. GLITZ AND GLAMOUR raced in the middle of the field while two wide,
was moving up in the turn to vie for the lead with inner rivals then gave in the stretch. POQUITO LADY was rated along the inside in the early furlongs, then
urged on the turn to rally in the stretch from the three path and was closing well but it wasn't enough. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN settled along the inside, then
rallied on the turn and into the stretch but came up empty. NOMOROTHAT was unhurried early and no threat. MUCH ALOHA raced in the middle of the
pack while two wide, then made a mild bid on the turn from the inside and gave way in the stretch. FREE DROP GYPSY chased the pace while two wide,
then settled back along the inside on the turn and stopped bid in the stretch. LIL PARTY CRASHER was off slowly at the start and was no menace.
DIVAESQUE set the pace from the inside, then vied to keep the lead heading into the stretch, was used up and gave way. B. A.'S LITTLEBIT no factor.

SINGAPORE FLASH settled into a tracking position along the rail through the first turn, dropped back midway down the backside to be near the rear while
taken in hand avoiding traffic, angled wide into the far turn when asked leaving the three-eighths pole, circled six wide through the turn to challenge at the
top of the lane and took command down the lane in a determined drive. SUNLIT SONG unhurried in the early going, loomed up five wide down the backside
to mount a strong rally in the turn, briefly assumed command in the lane but was out-finished to the wire. QUARTERBACK DAK prompted the pace through
the first turn, moved up between horses to duel on the lead down the backside, took a short lead at the quarter pole, battled gamely through the lane but
could not hold off the top pair. EASTER SNAP set a pressured pace through the far turn, responded when challenged, kept on down the lane in a good try.
ROBO well placed for the first half mile, bid from between horses for the lead to upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. TRULY DANZIG close up to
be in striking position throughout and was outkicked down the stretch. DUST EM lunged at the start, was taken in hand to trail and never posed a threat.
STANS HOOKIN BULL flashed speed to press the early pace, settled just off the leaders down the backside and steadily lost position.

Footnotes
TEXAS ASCOT QUEEN dueled with an inner foe throughout the backstretch and into the turn, then took command in the early stretch and held onto the
lead under a strong drive to prevail in the end. IMA DISCREET LADY was under a steady drive while chasing the pace from the inside throughout the first
half, then rallied in the late stretch to close willingly for the place pprize. RECLUSIVE saved ground along the inside down the backstretch, then circled four
wide on the turn to close belatedly in the stretch and be up for the show prize. TOLONDA was bumped at the start, then chased the pace while two wide,
was in a hard drive throughout the turn to rally in the stretch but came up empty in the end. UPTOWNBLINGITHOME chased the pace at a moderate pace
throughout and needed more in the end. LADY AVE dueled for the lead from inside throughout the first four furlongs, was in a long drive heading into the
stretch then gave way in the final furlong. HEAVENLY RHYTHM bumped rival at the start then was out run and no menace. HAPPY SAILOR settled along
the inside and was no threat.

Footnotes
IMALUCKYCHARM sped to the lead down the lane the first time, set a well measured pace down the backside, steadily drew clear to the top of the lane and
finished well having been unchallenged. ROSIE JANE taken in hand to settle at the rear of the field, saved ground through the far turn, angled out at the
head of the lane to split rivals and closed ground well to gain the place. RUN WITT RUN prompted the pace while hard held down the backside, continued
to chase the pacesetter and failed to gain ground while holding on for the show. JAN'S TURN TO WIN raced rankly down the lane the first time while
tracking from the rail, settled in mid-pack along the fence down the backside, tipped out turning for home and finished willingly. NO MAS TEQUILA tracked
the leaders from between horses down the backside, moved up in the final bend to striking position and could not sustain the bid. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY
raced evenly in mid-pack most of the way and made a late mild bid down the stretch. DISCREET SMILE prominently placed while under a strong hold for
the first half mile, continued to stalk the leader to upper stretch and weakened deep in the drive. MY PATRIOTIC GIRL well placed to the far turn and faded
in the stretch. BLOOD ORANGE never menaced.

STRONG PROMISE pressed the pace from the three path down the backstretch, then moved up to duel with TRUE AND READY leaving the bend and into
the early stretch, battled gamely and was up at the wire to prove best. TRUE AND READY lead the way down the early backstretch, was challenged for the
lead by an outer STRONG PROMISE on the turn, then dueled grudgingly down the stretch and hung in the end. VICTORY FOR VETS stalked the pace
while two wide into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch but came up evenly in the end. CLASSIC RICK was bumped at the start, then rushed up the
backstretch while five wide, continued to bid throughout the turn to rally in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. SHAKIN LOOSE was bumped at
the start, then chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive throughout the turn to rally in the early stretch but came up empty in the end. MY
BUDDY MEL was bumped at the start, then bid mildly from the inside throughout and was no threat. MARFA SKY pressed the pace while two wide down
the backstretch, then flattened out on the turn and had no final bid in the end. SADDLE UP was bumped at the start, then trailed behind the field and was no
menace. SPRINKLE TAP raced while two wide in the second group of rivals, then faded on the turn and was no menace.

Footnotes
DIVINING HUMOR stalked the pace from four wide into the turn, ranged up to challenge on the turn, took control at the head of the lane, opened a clear
lead in upper stretch and drew off as much best. MILLIE G pressed the pace from the start from between rivals, dueled on the lead to upper stretch and kept
on gamely to keep the place. TOO MUCH KIKI unhurried in the early going, raced three wide in the second flight down the backside, circled six wide coming
for home and finished willingly down the lane. CLEARLY COPPER tracked the pace from two wide to the turn, was held up off heels in the turn, angled five
wide in the stretch and made a late bid. GYPSAN tracked the leaders from the fence into the turn and failed to gain when set to a drive. ALL AMERICAN
LADY hopped at the start leaving herself at the rear of the field, raced near the rear and made up ground steadily to the wire. SPEAK SOFTLY raced from
between horses early to rush up and take the lead on the fence, dueled in a four way battle to midway on the turn and faded down the lane. BLING
DANCER pressed the pace from between horses to the turn, briefly stuck her nose in front midway on the final bend and tired turning for home. COPPER
KAN was never a threat.

Footnotes
OIL N CANDY was bumped at the start, then was well rated along the inside, came out four wide on the far turn, then dug in gamely to close fastest down
the lane and was up at the wire to succeed. MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL set the pace into the first turn and down the backstretch, then cleared the far turn,
continued to hold the lead grudgingly down the home stretch but was caught at the wire and was second best. GOLD MAKIN GIRL was in a steady drive
while chasing the pace from the three path, then rallied on the far turn to vie for place position down the home stretch and was out finished in the end. DICE
ARM was forwardly place while two wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the stretch, then
vied to keep the place position in the final furlong but gave way in the end. BLAME THE STARS raced in the middle of the field while three wide, then rallied
on the far turn and into the early stretch from the five path, angled in to the two path then continued to close well in the end but it wasn't enough.
CHARMING LEAH settled along the inside throughout the first half, then bid mildly on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. HOT COOKIE was
unhurried early and no threat. JADE ENVY chased the pace while two wide, then bid on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. BODI ODI raced in the
three path in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, then flattened out throughout and was no menace. SAVE BALE MONEY broke inwardly and
bumped rival then failed to rally. COPELANDER raced towards the back of the pack while four wide then faded throughout and was no menace.
