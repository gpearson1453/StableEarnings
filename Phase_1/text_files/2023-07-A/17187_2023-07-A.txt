rated along on the inside, slipped through leaving the turn and made a bid to go on even terms for command by the furlong marker, but was out kicked by
the winner while staying on for the place award. QUEEN'S GARDEN was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and closed well late. RUGELACH
tracked the pace two wide, made a three wide bid off the turn to vie for command, between rivals nearing the sixteenth marker and faded late.
DETERMINED FIRST was allowed to settle on the inside and had a no rally. SOMEBODY LOVES ME was reserved early and lacked a rally. HOPEFUL

Footnotes
MINT GAME unhurried early to trail the field for the first half mile, steadily gained ground to the far turn circled six wide in the turn to engage the leaders, ran
the pace-setters down inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear to the wire. TEMPLET stalked the pace comfortably from striking distance to the turn, moved
up to challenge the pacesetter at the top of the lane, took a brief lead midway in the stretch and was out-finished late. CITY PLAN took command shortly
away from the gate, set a well rated pace while on a clear lead, responded when challenged turning for home but could not hold on. NOBLE CONQUEST
well placed throughout, was set to a drive in the far turn and failed to respond. PURPLE SHIRT raced prominently in the early going, and was through early.
DUE TO A MISPLACEMENT OF THE STARTING GATE, THIS RACE WAS RUN AT AN ABOUT DISTANCE.

GIRLS HOUSE checked nearing the five eighths marker, then advanced two wide on the turn, steadied leaving the turn, angled out four wide for racing
room, made a bid to draw off in the final furlong to prove much the best, driving. HERECOMESPUDD was off slowly, settled back on the inside, came three
wide into the lane, angled out in the lane and rallied well for the place. ROMANCE IN HABANA stalked the early pace, came two wide into the lane and was
empty, held show award. AIN'T NONCENTS tracked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and lacked a late response, missed show award.
LOVE KNOT set the pace while clear and then weakened in the lane. AHSOKA was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. RACE N RETURN was
settled on the outside and had no rally. RED DELICIOUS chased the pace and weakened.

DIABLO DADDY took the lead shortly away from the gate, opened a clear lead through the first turn, slowed the pace down the backside, responded when
challenged turning for home and re-rallied pulling clear in deep stretch. MOR THAN TOUGH stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied three wide to
loom boldly in upper stretch and failed to gain on the pacesetter in the lane. JEBY saved ground racing mid-pack to the far turn, mounted a two wide bid at
the quarter pole to engage the leaders and made a mild bid down the stretch to gain the show. YOUNGDUMBANDBROKE prompted the pace from the gate
to upper stretch and weakened through the drive. FAR FROM HOME unhurried early to be at the back of the field down the backside and showed late
interest in the lane. AMANI'S TIGER dropped to the back of the field in the first turn, made steady gains down the backstretch while saving ground along the
rail and flattened out turning for home.

MOONSHINING rated off the early pace down the backside, steadily picked up the leaders into the turn, rallied five wide turning for home and drew clear in
dominant drive. LUNA AMARILLA pressed the pace into the tun, dueled with the pacesetter through the turn, took a brief lead in mid-stretch and was
overtaken by the fast closing winner. MS EXCUSE slow early to be at the back after breaking alertly angled out for the drive and closed well to be the best
of the rest. HIGH DONNA prominently placed along the rail into the turn, dropped back losing position to the upper stretch and was gaining late down the
lane. DELIZIOSA sped to the lead from the fence, opened a clear advantage early, dueled through the turn and faded down the lane. RIVER CITY
ROCKER showed brief speed and came up empty.

Footnotes
INANNA'S QUEST stalked the pace from the rail down the backside, saved all the ground to upper stretch, tipped out mid-stretch and surged late to clear at
the wire. LIGHTRESS controlled the pace from the gate, set a well measured pace and could not hold off the winner late in a good effort. MALAWNIA
prompted the pace through the entire trip from two wide, moved to engage the leader turning for home but failed to gain ground down the lane. COLOR
CRUSH saved ground tracking the pace from the rail through the far turn, angled wide at the head of the stretch and mounted a late mild bid. ALEXA'S
DREAM tracked the pace from three wide down the backside, was set to an early drive into the far turn and failed to gain ground. LUCK IN THE DUSK
prominently placed to track the leaders from two wide into the far turn and weakened through the lane. PRETTYKEEN slow early to trail to the top of the
lane and showed some interest closing ground late. DETERMINED GOLD went evenly never posing a threat. MELITZA raced three wide near the rear of
the field and was never a factor.
