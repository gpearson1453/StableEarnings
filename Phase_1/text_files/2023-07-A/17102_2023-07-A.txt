Footnotes
CHRIS'S COMMAND pressed the pace from the three path, was roused entering the stretch then drew clear under intermittent encouragement.
CHARMING VINTAGE stalked the early pacesetters while four to five wide, asked to quicken in the final turn, rallied three wide then dueled through the
stretch for second. BEAUGATTI saved ground heading into the far turn, drove between then was out-finished in the stretch duel for second. AMEER rated
well off the pace inside, and passed a tiring rival deep stretch. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN vied inside for the lead, and faltered in the stretch. MAMA'S PROUD
JOKE offered little.

WYE CROSS raced from the back of the field, advanced inside in the far turn then shifted outside at the head of the lane, gained on the leader steadily and
was along in time to score. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH raced four wide into the opening turn, rated a slim lead outside of ALL THAT GOLD, dueled through
the final turn, moved clear entering the stretch, and was rundown deep stretch. FULL VELOCITY settled along the rail, chased five wide on the last turn, and
showed little further. ALL THAT GOLD sent to the lead, contested the pace inside of INDEPENDENCE NEIGH, was unable to move on with rival after the
quarter pole, and stopped. MAJOR SHEPARD sat mid-pack and lacked a bid. IGNITE THE MOON was reserved off the leaders and tired early.

HANDSOME HENRY raced three wide leaving the opening turn, shifted out to the five path in the backstretch, chased in the far turn, advanced quickly
outside then dueled in the final sixteenth and inched clear. AL REICHERT raced four wide entering the backstretch, rallied under light handling, hooked up
with rival midstretch but was outfinished. DADDY'S PEPPER went four wide leaving the first turn, angled inside to the rail to give chase, gained closer
contention in the final turn, moved up menacingly but was outkicked. COOL DOMINION saved ground inside, lodged an all-out bid entering the stretch and
passed a tiring rival deep stretch. LOLLIPOP KID showed the way through the backstetch, drew away with good margins but so those rapidly shrink after
passing the quarter pole, and gave way in the stretch. CANADIAN AUTHORITY rated off the pace while four wide, and had no response when called upon.
TRAPEZE never reached contention. AL REICHERT is hereby disqualified and declared unplaced due to a positive test.

Footnotes
KYSTONE rated well off the early pacesetters, went in pursuit of the leaders in the far turn, drove four wide off the last turn, struck the front moved clear and
finished on a light hand ride. CLANCY'S PISTOL hesitated at the start, advanced quickly in the far turn, was brushed at the head of the lane, closed
gradually improving position late. THESHACK hurried outside, contended the pace outside of GODGUNSNCOUNTY, was quickly overtaken at the quarter
pole, kept under urging through the stretch and held on for show. MACHINE settled in the four path, and lodged a late mild bid. SILVERFOOT saved ground
from along the rail in second flight, was brushed near the three-sixteenth pole, kept on evenly through the drive under urging, and missed. SIMMS failed to
be a factor. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES settled five wide, and lacked a bid. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY away alertly, drew away from the field while in a dueling
match with THESHACK, and had nothing left in reserve. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving
CLANCY'S PISTOL. After review it was determined that CLANCY'S PISTOL did receive a fair start and made no change.

Footnotes
SUNBIRD broke inward bumping into VANTASTICCANAVERAL, hurried up inside of FOUR O SIX CREED to press the early pace, dueled through the final
turn, gained an advantage in the stretch and held under steady pressure late. FOUR O SIX CREED disputed the early pace outside of SUNBIRD, was
unable to continue to match strides at the head of the lane, but continued to keep the pressure late stretch. KAUAI DAN broke outward into SHURAZ,
chased from the rail, and lacked the kick needed. BIG BAD INTAGLIO settled in stride from the five path, exchanged brushes inside of
READYTOTAPNSING, and was unable to improve position through the drive. READYTOTAPNSING fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, came
together with BIG BAD INTAGLIO at the head of the lane and lacked the bid that was needed. SMART CAT chased wide through the backstretch, angled to
the four path, and faded. VANTASTICCANAVERAL sandwiched leaving, chased briefly, and dropped back. SHURAZ squeezed out at the start, and was
unable to recover any ground throughout. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SHURAZ against the rider of SUNDBIRD alleging
interference at the start was not allowed after review of the film.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE GOLD tracked outside through the backstretch, went five to six wide in the far turn, responded to urging at the three-sixteenth pole, and
closed gamely to get by with time. MUCHO MAGIC tracked three wide, dropped back through the far turn, lodged a rail bid, and was along deep stretch for
to score place honors. JULIUS THE GREAT sat just off the pace while four wide, overtook the lead at the head of the stretch and was caught late.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER was under a snug hold into the backstretch, fanned five wide, chased outside nearing the quarter pole, and lacked the closing
response needed while under steady urging. DUNE D'ORO chased inside, shifted out entering the stretch and bid belatedly. TAPIT TO THE WIRE
experienced traffic in the backstretch, was roused sharply entering the lane, shifted inside and came up empty for the drive. KOVACS tracked four to five
wide, and faded steadily. FAST EH led the field into the backstretch, had no response when challenged, and stopped. PRESS GANG chased outside,
lacking running room leaving the backstretch, and was roused to no avail.

Footnotes
OUT FRONT showed good speed outside early, emerged the leader leaving the backstretch, responded to CARRIE'S SUCCESS heading into the lane, and
drew clear in the final sixteenth. CAPA BELLA broke in bumping into WAVESINTHEOCEAN, chased outside, and closed steadily outside getting up late for
second. CARRIE'S SUCCESS brushed leaving then hustled up to contest the early pace, dueled in the final turn and weakened late stretch. DAZZLING
CHIC hustled away, and lacked a kick that was needed. KISSABLE U away well then vied three wide, chased the leaders into the final turn, and flattened
out. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI assumed a tracking position, and came up empty in the drive. LITTLE ROSALYN offered little. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY chased
three-wide leaving the backstretch, and gave way. KERIK was outrun. WAVESINTHEOCEAN was bumped then started to buck away from the gate, and
was distanced.
