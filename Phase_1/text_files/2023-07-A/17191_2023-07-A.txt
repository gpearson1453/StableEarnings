Footnotes
PLAY MASTER broke in good order, settled in mid pack while four wide into the first turn, continued to race unhurried and outside up the backstretch, rallied
three wide into the lane, reeled in the leader inside the furlong grounds and was edging away late under steady handling. PAYOFF CYCLE broke on top,
with the pace immediately, dueled in the two path through the first turn and up the backstretch, shook clear with just over four furlongs to run, continued to
maintained a sizable advantage past midstretch, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the place. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN settled off the pace
and the inside, main body up the backstretch, splits foes outside a tiring early leader midway on the second turn, steadily gaining on the top two latee.
CHIEF KIMOSABI one paced between rivals, came four wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. PLENTY OF CENTS chased the dueling leaders for
almost a half, moved closer to the runner up late backstretch, chased that one through the final turn and then weakened through the stretch. UNBRIDLED
PULPIT last to leave, continued to be devoid of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late after altering course in midstretch. LITTLE STAR TARGET
remained back in failing to threaten. HESACALENDARBOY dueled up front inside the runner up, stopped with a half mild remaining.

Footnotes
PITALE took command along the inside soon after the start, narrowly showed the way into and through the turn, briefly shook clear past the furlong marker
then had enough left in the final strides to withstand the next two at the wire. BORDEAUX RED lacked early foot in trailing early, continued back while
toward the inside turn, switched to the outside when straightened for home, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late while between horses at the
wire. DRAG MALIBU pressed the issue up the backstretch from between foes, appeared rank, checked up between horses early the turn, continued to
steady, fell back to trail, roused in upper stretch, also finished with good energy while widest of the first flight at the finish. GOLDUSTER broke well, pressed
the winner from the three path in the run up the backstretch, continued to apply pressure through the turn, angled in toward the gap with less than a furlong
to run, little left in the late going. ZAICI forwardly placed early outside, remained in a striking position four wide early turn, went flat in the final furlong to lose
a couple of positions. CATALINA LATRINA in mid pack and inside, continued to idle along upper straight, bothered slightly with less than a furlong remained
when GOLDUSTER angled in, no late kick. CHECKULATER last away, had nothing for the drive. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ZAICI AGAINST
GOLDUSTER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
RISKY PRIORITY off slow then was slow to settle to fall further back, three wide far turn, dropped to the rail late in the bend when advancing, continued to
make some progress up the inside past the furlong marker, altered course to the outside for room with a sixteenth to run, late bid, dug in gamely to narrowly
prevail. HARD KINGS lacked speed, split rivals when commencing to rally late in the turn, continued to close, late bid outside the winner, outfinished in the
final strides to miss. FLASHY LOVER pressed the early leader from the outside, engaged that one into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, not
enough late while inside the winner and between rivals at the end. BLEEP BLEEP broke out but on top, set the pace inside, responded when challenged in
upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the wire. CALL ME FIREY broke at the break, went one paced throughout while off the inside in lacking a closing
response. WICKED TOUGH within striking distance outside, four wide into the lane, lacked a rally. CAMALEON finished early, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
MR. WIMBLEDON BAY close from the start, pressured the leader from the two path into the turn, engaged that one from the outside turn, wore that rival
down nearing the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late. GOLDEN QUALITY prompted the issue up the backstretch in the three path, continued on
the outside into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late, clearly second best. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER in mid pack after moving outside, four wide through
the turn, finished up best of the rest without posing a serious threat to the top two. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS sprinted clear out of the inside and moved to the
inside, set the pace for a half then weakened when headed by the winner midway on the turn. LET'S GO RANDOM lacked early foot, steered out, four wide
into the lane, went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing response. CARRIES MAN broke back, raced outside, four wide turning for home, improved
slightly without posing a serious threat. LONG ARROW made little impact while racing toward the inside. SIXTO last away, trailed most of the way in
showing little. BRADSTREET flashed brief early speed and stopped.

Footnotes
MONITOR MILLS broke on top, was clear and in hand past the wire the first time, continued to rate through some moderate fractions, remained clear
through the lane when put to pressure. JOEY'S LIGHTENING settled off the early pace, moved closest to the winner in the second turn, chased that one
into the stretch, could do little with that one the final furlong, extended margin for the runner up position. BOULDERING broke back, moved up to race in the
main group while three wide, continued at that pace into and through the stretch to report home best of the others. SALUTE NOW within striking distance
early, fell back a bit the middle half, came on the outside for the drive, lacked a closing kick. JIMMIE'S HALO void of speed, continued back in trailing into
the far turn, passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious factor. GENERAL EISENHOWER a bit wide into the first turn when closest to the winner,
continued to pursue that one in the run up the backstretch, gave way. BATTLE OF WILL off the pace while outside, four wide through the second turn, tired.

Footnotes
FOOLISH STEVE lacked early foot off the inside, ranged up with a solid four wide move to contend turning for home, lugged in under a right handed crop
nearing the furlong grounds to help tighten up inner rivals, was quickly straightened, outkicked LIKEN IT in the late going to be edging away at the end.
LIKEN IT also raced well back off the early pace, advanced into contention three wide turn, bid between horses and inside the winner upper stretch, pushed
in by that rival soon after, could not get back to that one late, far clear of the others. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL fell back in the turn to trail, four wide into the
stretch, some traffic inside the furlong grounds, up late for the show when clear, no threat to the top two. G VICTORY pressed early off the inside, moved up
to duel in the two path turn, was vying approaching midstretch when put in tight and squeezed with both inside and outside pressure, weakened. FULL
IMPACT moved up to take control leaving the chute to show the way up the backstretch, dueled turn, drifted out nearing the furlong grounds to help tighten
up G VICTORY, faltered soon after. STEPHEN'S ANSWER forwardly placed in the early going, faded. DRAFT CHOICE was finished early. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH MIDSTRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LIKEN IT AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH A FURLONG TO RUN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
REAL CITY SPEED hopped at the break to be away slowly, raced back and outside, ranged up four wide to challenge late in the final turn, put a head in
front entering the stretch, accelerated quickly to be clear, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. DEER CROSSING void of speed, asked along
in the second bend, four path and behind the winner into the lane, steadily getting to that one late. TOUCHDOWN JOE in the first flight into the first turn
while three wide and between horses, bid before a half, put a head in front while closest to the inside far turn, vied into the lane, proved no match for the top
two late, comfortably saved the show. TARAASHOQ bothered a bit at the start, lagged well back for six furlongs, came three wide for the drive, found best
stride too late while improving position. PEPPER JACK lunged, popped stall doors prior to the start, broke out, quickly straightened to vie into the first turn
between, dueled early backstretch, fell back, little for the stretch run.'. LAURI'S WISH flashed some brief speed along the inside, fell back before a half, also
had little for the stretch drive. MINNESOTA MIRACLE pressed the issue into the first bend from the four path,moved up to duel before a half, continued to
vie through the second turn then gave way at the head of the lane. DEVIL'S HARVEST broke through the gate before the start, reloaded, away in good
order, mid pack early, stopped, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
TERRI GOT A FRIEND back off the early pace, angled out four wide into the stretch, finished full of run to win going away at the ned. GRACE'S SOLDIER
within striking distance, moved closer on the leader turning into the lane, bid between horses, took over, proved no match for the winner late. CALCITE in
mid pack outside, closer three wide late into the stretch, brief bid, all out to save the show. SPARKLE CITY dueled up the backstretch in the two path, shook
clear in the turn, weakened in the drive. SHEEZA PRIORITY off a step slow, improved through traffic down the stretch, not a serious threat. TOUCHING
ACES off a step slow when put in tight, trailed well back for a half, showed some belated interest to improve position. A. P. STYLE broke back, improved
four to five wide through the turn, flattened out through the lane. GLORIOUS GEARS broke in, brush, saved ground when well back off the pace, lacked a
rally. THAT IS AWESOME in mid pack early, faded through the stretch. MARDI GRAS GORMLEY forwardly placed early, retreated after a half.
DOWNTOWN PORTER broke with the leaders, dueled early along the inside, stopped in the turn, fell far back to be distanced, jogged in.
