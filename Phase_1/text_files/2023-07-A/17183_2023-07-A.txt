in late and edged clear. LUCKY ANDY chased the early pace, assumed command two wide after a half, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle
the winner. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs, remained a
sharp threat into the stretch and faded late. RAMIRIN was no factor. OWN THE TOWN well placed, failed to respond. RIDING IN THE WIND was outrun.
