DATTTSAFANCYFOX dueled early, drifted out in the stretch, held gamely after a long stretch battle, prevailed and returned bleeding from the nostrils. MISS
EASY was never far back, rallied on the inside, drifted out late and just missed. WORTHINESS vied for the early lead, was carried out in the stretch, held
stoutly in the stretch and just missed MY DANCING QUEEN raced close up throughout and weakened ,late. CONTESSINA was no threat while three wide.
MY D'VALENTINE had brief foot and quickly gave way. The stewards posted the inquiry sign and the rider of WORTHINESS claimed foul against the rider
of MISS EASY and DATTSAFANCYFOX for alleged interference in the stretch. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.
