Footnotes
CALY BALI dueled on the outside up the backstretch, shook clear while racing in the three path around the turn and drew off in the lane. ALLOTROPE
dueled between horses early, continued to battle from the two path coming around the bend and chased on in the lane, no match for the winner. MY FOUR
POINT OH dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the stretch while proving to be no match for the winner.
RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE chased the pace setters up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. INARI raced at the back of the
pack on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and never threatened. CONTATA SONATA was away from the gate
slowly, raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GRANDIOSE SUMMER tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch and
kicked clear. DR Z'S ELSA trailed the field on the inside early, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground between horses late. KARATS
KOUNT bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace through the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path and
gained ground late in the stretch. LET ME DOWN EASY was sent to an early lead racing up the backstretch, opened up further coming around the bend in
the three path and stopped in upper stretch, tiring quickly while drifting out. FAST N FEARLESS bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, settled in
the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and flattened out in the lane. SMART LEAH hopped up
leaving the gate, stalked the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded from there.

Footnotes
HOLDENTIGHT dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear in the lane and held that
margin to the finish. STUN GUN raced off the pace between horses early, saved ground around the bend, began a bid entering the stretch and gained
ground late. HALO'S LADDIE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leaders while saving ground around the turn and kept on
in the stretch. TIGER HUNTER raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path coming around the
turn and improved position mildly on the outside from there. HEAVENLY GAZEBO dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the
three path around the turn and faded in the stretch. EYE ON DESSERT raced off the pace on the inside early, dropped back to trail from the two path
coming around the bend and made no bid.
