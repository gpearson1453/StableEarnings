Footnotes
STOLEN JEWEL stalked in the three path, moved up alongside THRILL OF THE NITE at the three sixteenth pole to challenge the front, match strides deep
stretch and won the nod after a long drive. THRILL OF THE NITE assumed the lead under a snug hold, responded gamely to challenge from STOLEN
JEWEL, kept on inside under heavy steady urging and was out nodded. SMILIN EVIE tracked inside, shifted out to the three path in the final turn, and
lacked a closing response that was required. FOREVER LADY sat in striking position while three wide, lodged a bid near the five-sixteenth marker and tired.

BOOTIFUL ROSE quickly took command, saved ground while showing the way, remained unchallenged into the stretch, and held safely. BIG HUG tracked
from the two path, gained ground late on the leader but was no match. ECHO CREEK settled outside while in range, roused through the final turn, and failed
to threaten. SOFIA D 'AMORE flipped prior to loading, stalked the pace while four wide, and tired early. TENDER LOVE saved ground and was outrun.

SOLO RING was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, saw margins recede nearing the quarter pole, responded to a looming threat from
HYPERFOCUS at the head of the stretch, and held firm. HYPERFOCUS settled in stride, tracked while in the three path, hustled on the final turn in pursuit
of the leader, and kept pressure through the stretch but was unable to get by. SHORTY THE SWEDE raced in closest pursuit, rallied four wide at the head
of the lane, angled inside late, and just held on for show. RACE HOME angled inside from the back of the pack leaving the backstretch, rallied late, and just
missed placing. VIATURE settled outside, and lacked a closing response. PARKING PERMIT saved ground from the four path, and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SASSY MISS ELLIOTT vied outside early, sat in striking range while three to four wide, moved up alongside BUNNY NOREEN at the quarter pole to press
the issue, dueled through the stretch then dug in, in the final yards and won the nod. BUNNY NOREEN vied inside for the early lead, showed the way
through the backstretch, was confronted by SASSY MISS ELLIOTT at the head of the lane, battled inside, and was worn down, losing the nod. DYLAN'S
SAVE tracked the pace while four wide, drove up five wide at the quarter pole, chased the pacesetters through the stretch and secured a show placing.
GIMME THAT GIRL broke outward into ALBERTA, chased inside, and came up empty in the drive. ALBERTA bumped leaving the gate, lodged a mild bid
into the stretch then faded. BAKED N WIRED raced wide through the backstretch, and was outrun. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL returned to the paddock for a
tack adjustment, and showed little.

Footnotes
MOHAYMEN DAY contested the early pace from outside, moved up willingly outside of SUBLIME EUPHORIA, drew clear despite being unasked in the
stretch, and was ridden out under a confident ride. SAYGE'S SPIRIT stalked from the rail, shifted out to the four path in the final turn, finished well but was
no match for the winner. REBATE broke outward into ANNA'S IMAGE, chased four wide, moved inside in the far turn, lodged a rail bid but was unable to
improve her position through the stretch, and held on for show. FAMOUS LAST WORDS brushed leaving, chased wide through the backstretch, and offered
a late rally, missing out. WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE sent for early speed from between foes, dropped back leaving the backstretch, and lacked a closing
response. SUBLIME EUPHORIA hustled up to contest the early pace after a tardy start, was overtaken with two and a half furlongs remaining, and gave
way. ANNA'S IMAGE dismounted the rider while at the gate, bumped away from the gate, chased wide and tired. NORTHERN GOLD saved to no avail.

Footnotes
MANFORALLSEASONS sat in striking distance outside, raced four wide leaving the backstretch, rallied three-wide at the head of the stretch, and got by
driving. FLYING SUN contended the pace from just off the rail, turned back a challenge from HIGH FLYIN TIGER, but was rundown late and held for place
honors. LITTLE CHICAGO raced near the back of the pack while inside, raced in traffic near the three-sixteenth pole, angled out to the four path, and closed
gamely missing out. HIGH FLYIN TIGER sat just off the pace while four wide, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole but was unable to get by and
flattened out in the stretch. TRICKY SPEEDSTER rated off the pace in the five path, roused at the quarter pole outside, and closed well to improve position
deep stretch. DANZA UNBRIDLED tracked two to three wide, lacked running room from along the rail, steadied midstretch in traffic, and was outkicked.
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR circled into the lane and was unable to improve his position. WYE CROSS broke awkwardly, and was unable to recover the
ground lost from the start.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BLAZE sat mid pack while three to four wide, advanced quickly in the final turn, came together with NORTHERN JEWEL entering the stretch,
dueled determinedly and edged away late under steady urging. NORTHERN JEWEL rated well off the pace, roused at the three-sixteenth pole after
inheriting the front, accepted the challenge lodged by AMERICAN BLAZE, came together early stretch, fought on inside but was unable to sustain the rally
needed then gave way grudgingly. IT'S A FACT sat just off the pace while three wide, pressed the issue in the far turn, was kept under handling through the
stretch and was able to hold on for show. MUDINATOR fanned four wide in the opening turn, chased leaving the backstretch, angled inside nearing the
stretch run, and passed tiring rival. LAHUN reserved off the early pacesetters, lodged a bid inside, and tired. BIG BAD INTAGLIO failed to threaten.
FLASHIN ACES returned to paddock for tack adjustment, brushed leaving, raced wide in the backstretch, and was outrun. LIL ZAPPER saved ground while
showing the way, veered out sharply at the head of the lane, and yielded. MONEY MUNCHER never reached contention.
