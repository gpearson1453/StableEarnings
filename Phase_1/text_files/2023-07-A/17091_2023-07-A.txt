Footnotes
QUALITY CAT settled just off of the early pace and raced widest into the backstretch run, tracked outside of rivals to the far turn, was roused four wide
nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow advantage to the furlong marker, held WAY TOO HOT at bay while
battling that rival inside of the furlong pole, drifted in under firm urging into deep stretch, shook free in the final stages and held in a drive at the finish to
prevail. WAY TOO HOT stalked the moderate pace while outside of rivals, prompted the pace through the backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing
the quarter marker, vied for the lead between runners into upper stretch, fought back to the furlong grounds while inside of QUALITY CAT, drifted out under
left-handed urging in the drive while battling QUALITY CAT, was bumped and crowded by that rival heading to the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides
with the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while besting the rest. MOVIETIME stalked the moderate pace while inside of rivals, could not keep
pace in the drive and weakened in deep stretch, while holding clearly for third. TRIBUTE TO M hesitated at the start and was off slowly, settled outside of
runners into the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn and did not offer a response in the stretch. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke
alertly and dictated terms in the early stages, set modest fractions to the far turn, was overtaken leaving the quarter marker and gave way in the drive.
FRESNO CHILE chased inside of rivals along the first turn, was steered four into the four path along the far turn and tired. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WAS MUTUAL DRIFTING BETWEEN
QUALITY CAT AND WAY TOO HOT AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

VINOS ANGEL broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, set a contested pace into the turn, shook free along the bend, drew to a clear lead into
upper stretch, was given a reminder tap nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew off under hand urging in deep stretch in an impressive debut. BROOKYS
GAL chased the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and ran on to be best of the rest. BIG
CATTY showed early speed and pressed the pace while inside of a rival, chased VINOS ANGEL along the turn, weakened in the stretch, was outfinished for
second and was clear for third at the finish. CEE'S THE IMAGE lacked early speed, was coaxed along in the three path to the quarter marker and did not
threaten. CATTIN ALL AROUND ducked in at the start and was away slowly, chased inside of rivals on the turn, was steered three wide into the drive and
tired.

PRETTY THIRSTY showed early speed and disputed the solid pace into the turn, shook free along the bend, drew off while in hand into upper stretch and
kept to task under hand urging in lane to be much the best. CRY ME A RUNNER pressed the early pace while three wide and between runners, ran in
pursuit of PRETTY THIRSTY along the turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch run and stayed on to be second best. WHATWASTHENISNOW took
back off of the solid early pace and tracked from the four path into the turn, chased outside of rivals to the quarter marker, was able to make a mild late gain
in the final stages and was up in time to secure third. SHE'S SO FANCY chased from the four path while between runners into the turn, lost ground into
upper stretch, needed more in the final stages and just missed for third at the finish. EXTREME BLAZE chased the solid early pace while widest into the
turn, was steered to the three path into upper stretch and tired in the drive. WESTERN TOWN was sent to dispute the solid early pace, pressed inside of
PRETTY THIRSTY into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch.

turn, kept close attendance to MAGAZINE to the quarter marker, lost ground into upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and
outfinished GIANT KID in deep stretch to be best of the rest. GIANT KID took back off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the first turn, stalked
the moderate pace through the backstretch run, came within aim while two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased MAGAZINE to mid-stretch, tired in the
final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear in the end for third. GADDING bobbled at the start then was crowed leaving the break and was
away a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, advanced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on the far turn, could not
sustain that bid into the drive and weakened. RAFANELLI broke out a bit leaving the start, settled in the second flight in the early stages, raced between
rivals along the backstretch run, was shuffled back nearing the half-mile marker, chased along the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave
way. GRASPY settled just off of the early pace while inside of rivals, tracked the pace to the half-mile marker and dropped back along the second turn.

Footnotes
YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS raced a bit in tight quarters leaving the start and was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position while two wide on the
turn then was coaxed four wide nearing the top of the stretch, continued to gain ground while widest nearing the furlong marker, closed fast in deep stretch,
took command inside of the sixteenth-marker and drew away in the final stages to prevail. HAUGHTY KITTY was away in good order and disputed the early
pace while outside of a rival, chased ALL HALLOWS to the quarter marker while three wide, ran in pursuit of that foe into upper stretch, closed in deep
stretch and vied for the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker, was outkicked by the winner in the final strides and just won the nod for the place on the wire.
ALL HALLOWS stalked the moderate early pace while inside of rivals, advanced along the turn and took command nearing the quarter marker, showed the
way into upper stretch and was set down at the furlong pole, held foes at bay to deep stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for the win
and placed, while just holding for the show on the wire. MY YVONNE chased from the second flight, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker and came
four wide into the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final furlong and just missed for the minor awards. ZIPPIDY DU DAD raced close to the
early pace, saved ground into the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch. GOLONDRINA bobbled at the start and was away
slowly, was steered along in the three path to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch. AUNT NOREEN broke alertly, contested the early pace
with HAUGHTY KITTY, lost ground while outside of that rival on the turn and faded in the stretch drive. STAR SO FAR chased the moderate pace while
inside of rivals and did not threaten.

Footnotes
MOB BOSS broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, disputed the pace while inside of a rival heading to the turn, set moderate fractions while pressed
to the quarter marker, held a narrow lead into upper stretch, was confronted at the furlong pole by WICKLOW HILLS, dueled with that foe into deep stretch,
dug in in the final sixteenth and determinedly held the runner-up at bay in the final strides to prevail. WICKLOW HILLS was brushed at the start by a
neighboring rival and was off a step slowly, recovered to chase the moderate early pace from mid-pack while outside of runners, made a steady advance to
the quarter marker while widest, was asked for run five wide into upper stretch, rallied and confronted MOB BOSS at the furlong marker, drew to even terms
with that foe into deep stretch, was denied the win by the determined MOB BOSS in the final strides and held safely at the finish for second. MR. FIGHTER
was shuffled back leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the moderate early pace from the second flight, gained ground while inside of rivals
nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, remained within aim to the final sixteenth, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and
was outkicked, while holding for third. PERFORMATIVE settled off of the moderate early pace and saved ground into the turn, was coaxed along off of the
rail and came two wide into the stretch, gained ground heading to the furlong pole, raced in the three path inside of the furlong marker, closed willingly in the
final sixteenth and missed for third. BIG DON'S SMILING was prominent in the early running and pressed the pace while outside of a rival, kept close
attendance to MOB BOSS to the quarter marker, lost ground into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. G'S LAST CHANCE was unprepared at the
start and was off slowly, chased outside of rivals along the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. DOGE OF VENICE chased from the second flight, raced
outside of rivals along the turn and did not offer a late rally. WEGOTBEERONICE chased the decent early pace, dropped back on the turn and tired in the
drive.

for home then surged through when the rail opened up and outran the field to the wire from there. MOTOWN CLASSIC veered out at the start and bothered
SON OF SHANGHAI just after the break, raced forwardly tracking the dueling leaders to the turn, was set down to go after the lead with about three furlongs
to run, had a head in front at the top of the stretch then could not match strides with the winner but was well clear of the third horse. START THEM UP was
in tight quarters after the break and fell back to last in the early going, lagged near the rear of the field to the stretch then made a big late rally to gain third.
ONE LITTLE INDIAN was slowly into stride and spotted the field a few lengths early, angled towards the rail before the turn, showed a little late run down
the stretch while never a serious threat. VIVA LEON JODIDO bothered a bit from the inside but was asked to set out for the early lead, sat just to the outside
of TACOMA SOUND and dueled with that rival through the turn, made a bid to take command at the head of the stretch but was spent from the early efforts
and came up empty for the stretch run. TACOMA SOUND broke out at the start and brushed VIVA LEON JODIDO, was sent for and gained the early lead
with that foe a neck behind to the outside, battled to the top of the stretch then was overtaken for the inside and outside and gave way readily. WAKES AND
WEDDINGS settled in mid-pack for the first quarter mile, moved into contention through the turn, came into the stretch five wide but could not muster a rally.
SON OF SHANGHAI squeezed at the start then almost immediately came under a ride, only had one beat down the backstretch, started to make some
forward progress through the turn while still being ridden then tired under pressure in mid-stretch. RIVER'S BENCHMARK stumbled slightly at the break,
raced mid-pack for the first half mile but was caught five wide, made a mild move on the turn and turned into the stretch still five wide then tired before the
furlong pole.
