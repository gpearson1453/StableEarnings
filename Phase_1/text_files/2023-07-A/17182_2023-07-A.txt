Footnotes
THISAINTJUMPSTREET tracked the pace, raced boxed on the two path through the turn, angled three wide when clear into the stretch, made a steady
gain, split foes late and drove clear. REDHOT KATIE hopped slightly at the start, was well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through
the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place.
NORTHERN ALLIANCE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for the show in the final strides. FAST FASHION sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened the final furlong. GLOVANNA was never involved. DYNA'S HOLIDAY well placed and inside, faded through the second turn.

furlong marker, then drew off under mild urging. VALIANT VICTORIA led in the early going, vied inside through the turn, edged ahead into the stretch, then
lacked the kick to sustain the bid. REAL GOOD VYBZ unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed
well for the show. BEAST BUNNY set the pace off the rail, then weakened in the stretch and held a share. LEMON CURRY mid pack, gained position three
and four wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and flattened out. BETHPAGE unhurried, moved up four wide through the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
SAMURAI LEGACY sprinted away from the field early, drew off through the turn, then lasted under steady pressure. JARETH mid pack and inside, moved
up through the turn, angled out to come three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and missed. AMERICAN UNION allowed to settle, moved up
two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. WORBOTHOR unhurried, saved
ground on the two path through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. KIKKERLAND mid pack, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and evened out. HEATHER'S GOLD well placed, moved up two and three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. BIG CHICKEN MAN chased the pace, held position on the two path through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong.

Footnotes
HOT BODE unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and drew off while being kept to the task. WATERLOO SUNSET sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway inside the furlong
marker, then when challenged was no match and held the place. BELLE BREZING mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane, closed through traffic and missed the place. ODD GAL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then weakened late and held a share. DOWN TO EARTH well placed and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn, fanned
five wide into the stretch and faded. DON'T MAKE ME BEG well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch.
KATESALUCKYGIRL well placed and inside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and had no rally. TIZ
SUSAN ANN was a brief factor.
