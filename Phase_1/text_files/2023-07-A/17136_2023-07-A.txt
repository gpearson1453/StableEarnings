opened a clear lead entering the final turn, and widened his advantage through the lane while being ridden out late. BARBERRY BANDIT tracked the leader
into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and while no threat to the winner, finished willingly two wide in the
drive to prove clearly second best. SOMTHING ELUSIVE broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail,
continued from the outside while rallying three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. TEXAS

WICKED NIGHT broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the leader while
commencing a two wide bid entering the final turn, took command midway through the turn, and held DESIRED OUTCOME safely at bay late to prove best.
DESIRED OUTCOME stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. STANFORD NORTH away alertly and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, was collared by WICKED NIGHT entering the final turn while saving ground
at the rail, was overtaken midway through the turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to prove best of the rest. EMPEROROFTHENORTH
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn but was unable to mount a late bid while
finishing four wide in the drive. MS. STANFORD unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make an

drew clear in the lane. YOU DON'T OWN ME stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, advanced smartly four
wide midway down the backstretch and took command soon after entering the final turn, was quickly tackled by BARNEY GOOGLE leaving the turn, and
while no match for that rival, finished willingly to prove second best. LIZZIES GIRL tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while saving
ground at the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, while awaiting racing room, shifted
two wide for the drive and finished with late interest to get up for a share. KNOPFLER away well and tracked the leaders one out from the rail through the
stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide approaching the final turn, steadied when losing his path entering
the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. CERTIFIABLE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of CALAMAZEUS through the stretch the
first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, but weakened over the final furlong. CALAMAZEUS broke sharply and vied
for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded in the

FILLY FATALE rushed to a clear lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear late. TUXEDO stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out
from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with FILLY FATALE entering
the lane, but finished three wide in the drive to prove second best. STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the
rail through the stretch the first time, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive with late interest to get up for a
share. SILVER ARROW hopped at the start, and trailed the field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, jumped shadows approaching
the wire the first time while causing her rider to lose his outside iron for a few steps, advanced into a striking position midway down the backside, and
finished from along the rail in the drive. CHAMPIOSA stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. EH TEE EM settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the lane the first time,
maintained his position into the backstretch, began to struggle to keep up in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

BLACKSTONE away alertly, and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, held a clear advantage into the final turn, and was never
seriously threatened at any point. DEANARROW stalked the pacesetter from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail
entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to hold the place. SHE'S ON FIRE away well and tracked the leader into the backside while racing
one out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. UNION MAN settled off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied with interest three wide entering the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive in
an even effort. MEMORANDUM settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BEST ONE YET unhurried early while trailing the field into the
backstretch, rallied two wide from the back of the pack entering he final turn, but failed to make a late impact. MILO'S COMMAND broke sharply and was
allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, continued with a wide trip throughout, and steadily retreated.

entering the final turn, quickly overhauled the pacesetter soon after straightening for home, and drew clear. BETTER TONE unhurried early while trailing the
field into the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive. DYNAMITER
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to garner a share.
RIMFIRE lagged well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and
finished two wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. MONTE away alertly and sprinted to a clear lead in the run to the first turn, widened
his advantage through the first turn, and maintained a massive lead in the run down the backstretch, continued with a clear advantage through the final turn,
was quickly overhauled shortly after entering the lane, and tired badly in the late stages. JERSEYS IMAGE broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the
early speedster, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
