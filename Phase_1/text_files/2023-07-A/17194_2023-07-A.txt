JUST A FLIRT ducked in leaving the gate and made contact with Pinnacle Reef, accelerated to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rated
the early pace, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in under steady stretch handling to hold on. ROCKING TO HOME came away sharply with a brief clear
lead then gave chase outside, was carried wider through the turn but dug in leaving the turn and finished well widest. TALKING TEDDY chased through the
backstretch, raced in range of the lead in the three path on the turn but drifted into the stretch and flattened later yards. SMALL PAW was bumped leaving
the gate then gave chase toward the outside, drifted on the turn but ran evenly in the lane. PINNACLE REEF was bumped inward and into Small Paw
leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN gave

JACKYSINTHECASTLE stalked the earlier pace from the three path, challenged toward the three eighths and took the nod approaching the five sixteenths,
raced clear into the far turn and held well under steady handling. I SHALLBE RELEASED rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase past the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. APPEALING ROAD raced two deep on the opening
turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. GOLDEN SALLY raced off the rail on
the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path but showed little in the lane. ODINA rated the pace inside,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. QUINCYS WAY saved ground.

Footnotes
REDWHITEANDTACOS raced with the early pace two deep, challenged at even terms into the backstretch and dueled from that point, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dug in determinedly to eke out the edge over the game effort of CRUZ IN THE CASTLE, who bobbled leaving the
gate but closed to the front past the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met at even terms into the backstretch and dueled from
that point, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely before ceding; grudgingly. SALTY SAUL rated close inside, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SAX saved early ground then eased out into the
backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and ran evenly in the stretch. MAE SAI PRINCESS
raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the stretch. TIZ MICHELLE'S
WAY raced in the four path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four
path and weakened in the lane. RED QUEEN became fractious in the gate and rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. CICI UNIFIED became fractious in the gate and saved ground.

Footnotes
ROCKY DICE settled in the four path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and contested even terms in the three path on the far
turn then dug in determinedly to inch clear of HERE AND NOFURTHER, who settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and contested even terms just off the rail on the far turn, dueled close leaving the turn but relented in later yards. MISS YOU AJAX raced off the early pace
about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and finished well to take third inside the
sixteenth pole. HE ROLLS took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the
lead toward the quarter but remained close through the far turn before flattening approaching mid-stretch. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE lunged outward and hit
the gate at the break then saved ground, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the five path
and showed little more. SPECTACULO settled off the pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn.
EISELE raced off the rail on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. NOTIMELIKEPRESENT settled in the three path the first
turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. SOUL PROVIDER stumbled leaving the gate and dropped well back,
showed no response leaving the first turn, was eased into the far turn and walked off.
