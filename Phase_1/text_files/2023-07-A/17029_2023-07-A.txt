four deep down the lane getting up for place. OLD FORTY FIVE a step slow through the turn rallied in kid stretch moving up late. COMMUNICATION FAIL
rushed up to threaten on the turn chasing in upper stretch weakening late. SANTIAGO'S CAT sent clear set the pace through the turn wilting between foes
into upper stretch. MOSES WATER played no factor. VERRAZANO LEGACY faded on the turn. PERFECT SPLIT showed early speed then gave way
abruptly in upper stretch.
