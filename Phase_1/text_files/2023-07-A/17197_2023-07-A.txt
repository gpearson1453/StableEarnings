Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY was bumped soundly at the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the
far turn, chased the runner-up under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, gained to take the lead
into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. VIRTUAL REALITY broke in and hit the gate, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was
roused outside the five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, shortened stride into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead
coming to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to get the place. MIA BEA STAR broke out then was corrected by the rider, dropped from
the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, paused off heels while inside leaving the backstretch then shifted to the two path, moved to the
four path shortly thereafter, gained late on the bend, turned into upper stretch under the crop then drifted out around the three-sixteenths, pursued the top
two while outside in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. SABRA TUFF was bumped on both sides at the
start then squeezed back in tight quarters, angled in at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, settled at the back, was urged along
before the five-eighths, dropped from the three path to the rail on the far turn, shifted four wide late on that bend, gained under a drive into upper stretch,
pursued the top three to the finish and earned the last spot in the superfecta. OCEAN GATEWAY broke in and bumped with a foe, went four wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths then moved inward, raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide,
continued three wide through the far turn and failed to respond. HONEY MONEY raced under a snug hold while two then three wide on the first turn, was
rated off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail while falling to the rear on the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SUGAR HI pressed the pace of LADY MOSCATO from the outside two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three
wide into upper stretch, took narrow command a furlong out, dug in and edged clear to the finish to prevail. LADY MOSCATO coaxed from the start, cut the
pace along the inside down the backstretch under pressure from the aforementioned foe, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, kept on to preserve the place honors. LADY
BLITZ coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages while clear for the show honors. CLEARLY A TEST hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued in the two path into upper stretch and improved position. HONEY DIJON coaxed from the start, chased three then four wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. CLASSY MISCHIEF tossed her head slightly at the break
and was unsettled at the start getting away last and conceding three lengths to the front, grew rank facing kickback and was guided four wide before tucking
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths detached at the tail of the field, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TAP
THE KEG stumbled at the start albeit only lost at most a length of ground to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, then tipped three to
four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide for home and tired. SOCA chased along the inside under coaxing
from three furlongs out, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, made no impact.

Footnotes
DIVA READY was restless in the gate, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, had her path
taken outside the eighth-pole then altered towards the inside for room, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. LINARITE settled
towards the rear on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and finished with good energy to just get the
place. SARATOGA GAZE was restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the two path to make bid
on the turn, took the lead into the stretch then kicked clear, remained clear under a left-handed crop into the final sixteenth but was overtaken then just lost
the place but held the show. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY broke out and bumped with a foe then hustled, settled for a couple of strides then came back under
urging, was ridden along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, pursued the runner-up into the final furlong, came between foes into the final
sixteenth and finished with good courage for the last spot in the superfecta. ROSEMARY POTATOES was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, came
out while dropping back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and
failed to threaten. LA AGUILILLA settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, drifted out in pursuit of the leader nearing the furlong marker and
weakened. FABULOUS FANNY was well placed just off the pace, lugged out leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, spun
into the stretch in the two path, chased under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. DEVILLY broke out a bit and was last to commence,
was taken in hand briefly early then angled in at the rear, raced at the back under urging, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to
rally. LIANA B moved in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside on the turn, was roused under threat late on that
bend, lost the advantage into the stretch and faded.

YARROW just off the top pair in pursuit two then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command near the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. RUNNINGWSCISSORS got brushed when just off the inside five furlongs from home
by BAR FOURTEEN due to pressure from ROUGH DRAFT, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. WINNERS LAUGH coaxed from the gate, showed the way along the inside under pressure from PHANTOM
SMOKE to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just
outside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. PHANTOM SMOKE pressed the pace of the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two
path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ROUGH DRAFT broke
outwards brushing the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside tucking in behind the leader and pulling a bit keen behind foes forcing BAR
FOURTEEN to steady behind him five furlongs from home, continued just off the inside through the turn patiently handled until set down spinning three wide

Footnotes
INTO HAPPINESS was urged along while lacking early speed, angled to the far outside near the three-quarter pole, lagged well behind under strong
encouragement, went around the turn in the five path, came seven wide into the stretch, rallied near the center of the track into the final furlong and closed
strongly to win going away. SA FORADADA bumped with rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn then driven six wide into
the stretch, chased the leading duo into the final furlong and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. MURSAL tracked the pace on the
outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the five path while on even terms for the lead, led
under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then lost the place but was clear for the show. GRACEFUL ROSE made light
contact with a foe at the start, was well placed just off the pace, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, took a short lead late
on that bend, floated four wide into the stretch, lost the lead under a drive before the furlong marker, battled until outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened.
NEED SOME MONEY settled towards the back, moved from three to five wide under urging on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. MY GIRL JAL was restless in the gate, settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun six
wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive, angled out around the sixteenth-pole and came up empty. CONDIMENT GIRL was hustled to
the front then angled in, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper
stretch and tired. MISCREANT settled towards the rear, passed the five-eighths under urging, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, spun three
wide into the stretch and was no factor. CARBON moved up to race towards the front, dropped back late on the backstretch then moved out, went around
the turn in the two path and failed to respond. OBRIGADA stumbled badly at the start and was last to commence, settled on the outside, was roused four
wide on the turn, dropped back seven wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
BECKY'S JOKER broke a bit slow, moved up under urging to establish a more forward position, drafted inside to the the two path on the turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, gained to make a bid between foes in the three path into the stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths then inched away
while drifting out, was straightened by the rider inside the furlong marker and drew clear under steady handling. SARATOGA SECRET was coaxed along
while pressing the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, vied in the three path while on even terms for the lead on the turn, gained
a short advantage into upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner inside the three-sixteenths, moved inside that drifting foe near the furlong marker, drifted in
while proving no match late and was clear for the place. CLOSING ACT settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch
and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. WINE ON TAP bobbled ever so slightly while breaking in front, pressed the pace on the outside
of two rivals, vied in the four path while asked on the turn, dropped back five wide into upper stretch and capitulated. CARMELINA went to the front, set the
pace under pressure from two opponents to her outside, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, lost the advantage while turning into upper
stretch in the two path and gave way. SUGAR TREAT settled on the outside near the back, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. KISS
FOR LUCK was urged along at the rear, angled in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
THUNDARA three wide through the first turn, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to collar the leader just inside the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. ARISAEMA tossed her head at the start getting away last
in a tangle and conceded six to seven lengths to the front, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five
wide into upper stretch, angled inwards a furlong out and offered up late foot to secure the place honors while too late to threaten the winner. JANNIE MAE
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under threat and was caught just inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. CHARISSE got bumped at the start by POWER AND
GLORY, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside, tipped four to five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. STONE OF DESTINY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. APRIL FIRST along the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch
before tipping five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MARY
KATHERINE chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide for home and weakened in the late stages.
FOLLOW THE FED chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
POWER AND GLORY broke out at the start bumping CHARISSE, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far
turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. SO ARE YOU just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear
of the field, came under coaxing four wide at the five-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PIMENOVA three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired. HERE WE GO AGAIN coaxed from the gate, led briefly before
being restrained to ease off of JANNIE MAE and grew rank under the restraint just off the inside through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim for
the opening half mile, came under coaxing midway on the far turn in retreat, swung three wide into upper stretch and folded.
