Footnotes
BELLA PALOMA eased back and tucked in behind the pace heading into the first turn to track from the three path, split rivals at the quarter pole, drifted out
a bit to be five wide at the top of the stretch, struck the lead near the furlong marker while drifting in just a bit and edged clear. GUN RUNNIN' GAL bobbled
ever so slightly at the start, pressed the pace from outside three wide, applied more pressure up the backstretch dueling on even terms, took over about the
three-eighths, was outkicked by the winner but clearly second best. VOLTA D'ORO stalked four to five wide, had no extra but fought on to narrowly secure
show honors. BROOKLYN GIRL broke a half-step slowly and was encouraged along early but lacking speed, raced outside at the rear caught five wide
early, moved out from five to six wide on the far turn, needed more. ELKE LODGE moved straight to the front to dictate terms to the first turn racing off the
rail, faced increasing outside pressure up the backstretch, was overtaken near the three-eighths pole and asked to keep pace but lacked the needed
response.

Footnotes
HELEONORTIZ shifted in three to four wide off the leading pair into the first turn to stalk those while racing off the inside, lost some ground up the
backstretch, given some encouragement about the seven-sixteenths then put to stronger urging by the five-sixteenths while advancing, moved out four wide
turning for home, took over the lead at the top of the stretch and forged clear. NURSE RACHETT moved straight to the lead to set the pace inside, faced
pressure by an outside foe coming to the three-quarters, was headed by that one past the three-eighths, fought on to regain the advantage over that rival
but was no match for the winner. CHICA RABIOSA pressed the pace from outside shifting in two to three wide on the first turn, applied more pressure after
the opening quarter dueling up the backstretch, put a head in front past the three-eighths, had no extra for the drive. RAVENEL moved out from three to four
wide on the first turn racing off the pace and kept well off the inside, continued outside a foe at the back swinging eight wide into upper stretch, ran on but
was not a threat. KIRBY broke just a half-step slowly, raced in behind the leader along the inside early on the first turn under a hold, lost ground up the
backstretch, shifted six wide turning for home, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
YOOOU KNOW attended the early pace from outside applying pressure into the turn, dueled outside four wide on that bend, drifted out two paths turning for
home, took command by the three-sixteenths and edged away under steady handling. BROOKLYN GIRLEE moved between runners shortly after the start
to set the pace with outside pressure and brief inside pressure, dueled inside the eventual winner but off the inside part of the track through the turn, could
not kick on with that one but was second best. APPLE SHAKE SHAKE switched outside a rival early, raced outside at the back going four wide on the turn,
improved position while no match for the top pair. LADY LANCER was a little bit fractious in the gate, went straight to the front, showed brief speed inside,
steadily retreated. PINK SUNSET was urged at the break, chased from off the leading trio, went four wide on the turn, was not a threat. MEDB was urged at
the break, shifted in early and ridden along, was not a factor. SEA IMAGE broke a step slowly, lacked early speed racing off the rail, was never near enough
to threaten. PER RULING FROM HISA, MEDB WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR CROP VIOLATION.

Footnotes
RATIONALMILLENNIAL settled off the leaders in the three path early, advanced four to five wide on the far turn in range coming to the quarter pole, took
command at the top of the stretch making a bid outside, kicked clear. CIRCLE OF COURAGE raced three wide into the first turn and moving to the fore to
dictate terms, shifted in leaving that bend, faced outside pressure up the backstretch racing near the rail, was headed by the seven-sixteenths, kept on in
the stretch, drifted out a bit late, was no match for the winner but held second. MERGER OF EQUALS settled off the leaders three to four wide, dropped
back heading to the far turn, began to pick it up after swinging out six deep for the drive, ran on but just missed place. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS broke in the
air, settled into stride at the back, advanced outside foes four abreast late up the backstretch, shifted in on the far turn, raced off the rail into upper stretch
then nearer the rail for room and kept on evenly. FORTIBUG stalked from outside four wide, moved forward to press up the backstretch, took a narrow
advantage about the seven-sixteenths, put to a drive by the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. CRIMSON LILLE raced inside at the rear early,
moved out to go two wide and ridden along heading into the far turn, failed to rally. GRASS CUTTER showed brief speed inside, dropped back off the leader
chasing from inside, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START DOROTHY'S THE BOSS WAS DECLARED A
NON-STARTER WITH WAGERS TO BE REFUNDED INVOLVING THAT RUNNER.

I LOVE YOU gained forward position along the rail willingly into the first turn to track the pace, advanced rapidly to take a narrow lead at the half, began to
edge away on the far turn, saw the rider look back a couple times for competition coming into upper stretch, was in hand through the length of the stretch
while drawing away under a gallop. CRICKET WEST pressed a rival heading to the first turn as that one went to the lead, was still caught four wide on that
bend and eased back to stalk up the backstretch, lost ground to and on the far turn and shifted in for that bend to save ground, kept on in the lane to get up
for second inside runners but was not in range of the winner. ASTERS D'ORO moved to the front and shifted in two deep to set the pace, was hounded by
rivals inside and out, overtaken coming to the half, weakened thereafter. STARRY HOPE was forwardly-positioned three wide between runners early,
stalked the leader up the backstretch, was put to urging three furlongs out, floated out wider for the drive, ran on without a late menace.

Footnotes
THE SICARII was prominent chasing the leading pair early then moved closer to vie between heading into the turn, dueled inside a foe in upper stretch and
took the lead nearing the furlong marker, edged away and was in hand late. BAZOO got away well, set the early tempo from off the inside, vied with two
inside foes going three to four wide on the turn and a narrow lead, drifted out a path or two leaving the turn, was outkicked but second best. SHANGHAI
SUPERFLY attended the pace from inside, forced the issue up the backstretch putting a head in front late up the backstretch, began to drop back some
three furlongs out, put to urging by the quarter pole, had no extra but was best of the rest. LITIGANT failed to threaten while racing on or just off the rail.
MONDAY'S WITH MIKE was urged from the start but devoid of speed, raced off the inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHINELIKEADIAMOND exchanged a light brush soon after the start, forced the pace under urging from between runners three to four wide into the turn,
drifted out a bit in upper stretch while taking command, drew clear and held. SYSTEMIC RISK exchanged light contact with the aforementioned, attended
the pace from outside four to five wide into the turn, dropped back a bit on that bend, drifted eight wide into upper stretch, continued to drift out through the
lane but kept on willingly to secure the place. FLIRTATIOUS LASS bobbled slightly at the start, advanced while wide up the backstretch and in behind a rival
four deep into the turn, moved out six wide a bit later, was floated ten deep into upper stretch then carried out a bit further, ran on. INSIGHTFUL vied
between runners early two to three wide then inside the eventual winner, had no extra for the drive. MY CAJUN LADY broke a step slowly, raced toward the
back, went three to four wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. TOUISSET showed brief speed vying inside, dropped back and came off the
rail, weakened. TRULY AMBITIOUS was outpaced racing inside and not a factor.

Footnotes
KIDYOUNOT was lightly bumped at the start, moved forward three wide to the front on the first turn to set the pace facing pressure, moved clear up the
backstretch still kept several paths off the rail, was challenged in upper stretch while drifting out a bit, held that foe to prevail. ZIPPER ZAPPER had early
foot inside racing on or just off the rail, eased back off the leader to track, switched out for the second turn going four wide in pursuit of the leader on that
bend, was carried out a bit in the stretch while ranging up to just off the winner's flank, proved no match. SALTY HEIR was just a bit fractious in the gate,
had minor contact at the start, gained forward position four wide heading to the first turn, eased back to stalk from off the leaders, advanced four to five wide
on the far turn, was no match for the top pair but best of the rest. STORIED FELLA was urged from the break, outsprinted to the first turn racing on or just
off the rail, ran on evenly. ICY MINISTER exchanged light contact at the start, raced outside a foe off the pace early two to three wide through the first turn,
swung six wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly. CALL ME MAESTRO saved ground on the first turn, moved out from two to four wide on the far turn, was
not a threat. POWER (BRZ) brushed a rival at the start, was in tight quarters racing inside on heels into the first turn, was never a threat. SINGLINO moved
forward outside five wide on the first turn, edged in a bit to press the pace briefly up the backstretch, dropped back and faded.
