Footnotes
LOFTY COWTOWN surged to the front three wide nearing the turn, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under strong handling to
win as much the best. VAMONOS PIACENTE close along inside from the start, offered a mild bid in the four path entering the stretch and finished second
best. HALO EFFECT unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the six path. MOST ADORABLE set the early pace along the inside, remained a sharp threat
into the stretch and weakened late. CAT'S PURSUIT broke a step slow then veered in at the start, shifted outside then raced greenly. THELMA LUCILLE
was restless in the gate, hopped at the start and was no factor. THE KID'S PRAYER pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
STAR ENTERTAINER never far back, rallied determinedly along the rail under left handed urging through the stretch and got up in the final strides. AZTEC
too the lead two wide after a quarter, set the balance of the pace, edged clear late and just missed hanging on. TIMESATAPPIN slow early, found his best
stride late along the inside. BLUNDER vied for the lead two wide, drifted to the five path entering the stretch then faded. PERMAFROST close up in the five
path, was bumped past the seven sixteenths pole, swung wide then weakened in the lane. QUARANTINO set the early pace along the inside, shifted
outside after giving up the lead, had his heels clipped at the even sixteenths pole then tired in the stretch. RED COMET was no threat. DOWNTOWN
CONNECTOR was no factor. ON SPOT stalked the early pace in the four path, was in tight between rivals while lacking room bumping with PERMAFROST
to his outside then clipped heels with QUARANTINO to his inside at the seven sixteenths pole, fell and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CHILTEPIN stalked the pace into the stretch, surged through deep stretch two wide under right handed urging and was along in time. MY HOMBRE dueled
for the lead along the inside for a half, shook clear at the top of the stretch then couldn't handle the winner. VEGAS PLAYER settled mid pack then passed
tiring rivals in the five path late. SOMETHING ON TAP went evenly. IPPOLITO'S WONDER was no factor. ORVILLE B battled for the lead two wide for a
half then gave way late. TRANSPIRED was no threat. NIKAO was outrun. TEAM LUCKYTOBALIVE slow from the start, lost contact with his field before the
turn, was distanced and walked off.

Footnotes
LATIN SPICE away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the far turn, gave up a narrow lead then fought back gamely under left handed urging to get up
in the final strides. ATOMIC TONE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, gained a narrow lead, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging
on. JOHN'S ROCK vied for the lead three wide, drifted to the seven path through the stretch and was steadily gaining ground in a determined effort. FAT
DADDY went evenly. NAUGHTY PRINCE failed to menace. OAKS HONEY had good early speed then faded. CARILLO was outrun. LAZARUS PROJECT
was restless in the gate, hopped at the start, gained ground two wide on the far turn then was used up.

Footnotes
BLAKE'S RYEN sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and just lasted under strong handling.
MY TICKET never far back, rallied determinedly three wide through deep stretch and just missed getting up in time. COLOR BEARER pressed the pace two
wide into the stretch then was outfinished. NOSEY POWER went evenly. WHY KENNY WHY vied for the lead three wide and was through after a half.
STRIKING AGAIN was bumped at the start then no factor. RAISE YOU ONE was no threat. MY BUDDY MICAH was restless in the gate, broke inward
bumping STRIKING AGAIN then trailed.
