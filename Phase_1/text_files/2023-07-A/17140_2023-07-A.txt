Footnotes
DIVINE FEMININE chased two wide near the back early, moved forward up the backstretch, advanced in the two path through the far turn, bid inside at the
three-sixteenths pole, took over midstretch, cleared and began to drifted out with a furlong remaining and won going away. DR. TROUTMAN broke out to
lose a step then rushed up outside inner pair to vie around the first turn, cleared to take full control in the middle stages, opened up on the far turn in the
three path, challenged from both sides at the three-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead to the winner soon after and outfinished VICENT'S SHADOW to
hold second. VICENTE'S SHADOW settled inside at the back then angled out on the first turn, drew closer in the middle stages, chased four deep around
the far turn, came five wide into the lane, launched a bid three deep at the three-sixteenths pole, could not stay with the winner in the furlong grounds and
faltered late to lose the place. KRIXUS FLASH vied between rivals for command early, chased the leader past the five-eighths pole, went two wide into the
far turn, moved out and exited that bend four wide, then weakened down the lane. PAPALE coaxed from the gate and vied inside a pair of runners around
the first turn, chased past the five-eighths pole, lost ground while along the fence through the far turn and tired in the lane.

step slow recovered quickly to challenge for the lead, vied between foes into and around the turn, could not go on with PRINCE OF MONACO at the top of

Footnotes
THINK OF ANITA raced up close four deep early, got bumped by JAYCEE while three deep into the turn, bid outside CAL around the bend, took over at the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared inner rival then began to lug inward from the eighth pole to the sixteenth pole but still held safely in the end. CAL set the pace
three deep early, angled to the inside around the bend, was overtaken at the five-sixteenths pole, fought to upper stretch then chased the winner through
the final furlong. JAYCEE brushed inner rival leaving the gate, pressed between foes, drifted out and bumped THINK OF ANITA into the turn and had take
up, entered the stretch four wide and was along for the show. AUNTIE BEV stumbled a bit and brushed with JAYCEE at the start, raced up close inside a
trio of rivals up the backstretch, chased around the turn while moving out and came three wide into the lane, then weakened down the stretch. NOISEY
BURGLAR reared as the gates opened and unseated the rider and walked off following the race. THERE WAS A PAIR OF INQUIRIES REGARDING RACE
THREE. THE FIRST INVOLVED THE START OF NOISEY BURGLAR AND THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS BY
REARING AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A START. THE SECOND INQUIRY INVOLVED THE INCIDENT BETWEEN JAYCEE AND THINK OF
ANITA ENTERING THE TURN. THE STEWARDS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THINK OF ANITA DID SHIFT IN TO BOTHER JAYCEE AT THE
SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE BUT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
PROJECT LEADER sped to the front, showed the way two wide through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely under a drive. WINDING took
a bump from outside at the start, chased along the rail then shifted to the two path at the three-eighths pole, moved back inside around the bend, steered off
the fence in the lane and went willingly late to close the gap on the winner. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN was closest in pursuit three to four wide around the bend,
saw the leader kick away in upper stretch and faltered to third. SHARP WARNING chased four wide outside rivals into the turn, moved into the three path
around the bend, asked in the lane and failed to rally. J T'S WATCH chased outside a rival at the back early, went two wide into the turn, attempted to split
foes early on the turn but lost his path when WINDING shifted out at the three-eighths pole, altered out into the clear and came four wide into the lane and
failed to rally. PAUL VINCENTS POEM broke in and bumped rival, chased off the inside at the back, went tow wide into the turn, steered out and came five
wide into the lane and was not a factor.

ASSUREDLY raced up close early then stalked three wide into the turn, four wide turning for home, closed well from the middle portion of the track and ran
down AMAZING FLYER approaching the wire. AMAZING FLYER vied for command early then chased HEAVENLY KISSES leaving the backstretch, was
closest in pursuit two then three wide around the turn, reeled in the leader approaching the eighth pole, took over shortly after and cleared briefly, then got
run down by the winner in the final moments. SENT BY ANGELS raced outside a rival at the back early, advanced two wide through the turn, moved into
striking distance in midstretch but got outkicked by the top pair. KIMBERLY'S DEVIL coaxed along early chasing off the rail, moved inside for the turn, came
two wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. OAK CREEK GAL was off a bit slow to begin, rushed up four deep to take over, cleared leaving the
backstretch then crossed over, lugged out when asked left handed past the quarter pole, clung to a narrow lead with a furlong left to run and weakened
once overtaken. HEAVENLY KISSES raced up close from inside early then chased the leader to the turn, saved ground around the bend and weakened in
the stretch run.

HANDY DANDY showed early speed inside a pair of rivals into the first turn, moved into a stalking position up the backstretch, steered out around the far
turn and bid four wide into the lane, got floated out by MASTERING before taking over in midstretch, then drew away in the furlong grounds. MASTERING
was off slow and broke out then sent three deep into the turn, lost touch with the leader briefly then reengaged from outside up the backstretch, kept the
pressure on through the far turn while in the three path, took over past the quarter pole and began to drift out, lost command midstretch and could not stay
on with the winner in deep stretch. ATOMIC DROP took control early between rivals in the two path then cleared briefly leaving the clubhouse turn,
pressured once again by MASTERING in the middle stages, dueled with that rival through the far turn, was overtaken past the quarter pole and weakened
down the lane. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT broke a step slow and was outkicked early while coaxed along, trailed along the rail into the first turn, moved off the
inside into the backstretch, trailed two to three wide around the far turn and failed to menace.

ALPINE THUNDER got bumped between rivals leaving the gate then crowded a bit between foes and took back early, trailed two wide into the turn, steered
out and was five wide turning for home, closed steadily from the middle part of the track, drew alongside the top pair with a sixteenth remaining and drove
past. DEVIL AMONG US vied for the lead three deep then chased two to three wide around the bend, moved out a bit into the lane then launched a bid at
the top of the stretch, kept the pressure on into the final furlong, took over after crossing that marker and led with a sixteenth to go but got run down by the
winner in the ned. AMERICAN CAT vied for the lead from inside then cleared rivals on the turn, showed the way off the inside into the drive, challenged by
DEVIL AMONG US at the quarter pole, maintained a short lead to the eighth pole, lost command shortly after and stayed on well while getting outkicked by
the top pair. SCARY FAST SMILE got bumped leaving the gate, stalked along the inside into the turn, cut the corner while ridden along into the lane, asked
right and left handed in the drive but lacked a late bid. COWBOY CHARLIE broke through the gate and was reloaded, came away alertly then vied between
rivals for command, could not keep up with the leader on the turn and began to drop back, then tired in the stretch run. STRAIGHTEN UP broke in and
bumped inner rival, steadied when losing his path early, chased three then four wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CITY OF CHAMPIONS stalked in the two path, loomed from outside into the lane, drew alongside the leader leaving the turn, gained the lead at the
three-sixteenths pole, put away inner rival with a furlong to go and inched away. REIGN OVER ME was off a bit slow to begin, trailed on the inside into the
turn, went two wide into the lane, rallied up the inside and got up for second. CAN'T RECALL tracked out of range two wide into the turn, angled out into the
lane, summoned a mild rally but got outkicked for the place honors. BLACK MAGICIAN sent for the front and took control set the pace on the inside around
the turn, challenged entering the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. LAMPY stalked three wide into the turn, came four
wide into the lane, drifted in and out in the lane and lacked a bid. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT sat off the pace four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide
and failed to threaten. MEDINA MAN chased five wide off the pace into the turn, moved into the four path around the bend and failed to menace. BOOMER
JUSTICE broke a step slow, raced up close on the inside early, chased two wide into the lane, got hemmed in at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened.
MONGOLIAN MASTER raced near the back four wide into the turn, trailed five wide into the drive and came up empty.

SAWASDEE broke a step slow then rushed up inside to clear, opened up while moving off the rail, showed the way four wide into the drive, held a
diminished lead into the final furlong but remained clear to the wire. BARELY FUNTIONAL chased at the back early, traveled three wide into the turn, tipped
four wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane and finished willingly to whittle the gap on the winner while gaining second. SMUGGLER'S RUN chased
two wide through the turn out of range, closed the gap in upper stretch but finished evenly in the final furlong. CREATIVE PEAK chased outside a rival three
wide into and around the bend and flattened in the stretch run. GOLF DRAMA broke a step slow, rounded the bend four then five wide and failed to menace.
