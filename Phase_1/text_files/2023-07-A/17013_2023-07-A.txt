Footnotes
COBRE was sent to be prominent in the early running and dueled for pace duties into the turn, set moderate fractions while battling with
THECHIEFHASTRICKS through the bend, shook free into upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker and pulled away in the final stages.
WOLF'S LIFE lacked early speed, improved position on the turn while saving ground, mounted an inside bid nearing the furlong marker, was not able to
keep pace with the winner in the drive, battled with THECHIEFHASTRICKS into deep stretch, drifted out in the final yards to crowd THECHIEFHASTRICKS
and just held for the runner-up spot. THECHIEFHASTRICKS broke through the gate prior to the start, was forwardly placed in the early running and pressed
the pace while between rivals, kept close attendance to COBRE to the quarter marker, could not match strides into upper stretch and chased to the furlong
marker, battled with WOLF'S LIFE in the final furlong, was crowded by that rival in the final yards and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third.
UPDRAFT chased the moderate pace while outside of rivals, made a mild gain while three wide on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a
late rally. CATCHMENT came a bit in tight leaving the break, took up and was shuffled back in the early running, chased the pace to the turn and advanced
inside of rivals nearing the quarter marker, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. NICKEY BIRD broke alertly and contested the early
pace, dropped back nearing the turn, trailed into the stretch run and lacked a late response. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH AND RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
GROWTH ENGINE bobbled a bit leaving the start but recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace through the backstretch
run, was given his cue along the far turn and confronted BRONZE WARRIOR at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, was kept to moderate
urging through the final furlong and drew away in the final stages to prevail. BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and dictated terms in the early stages, set
moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure from GROWTH ENGINE at the quarter marker, was overtaken by that rival into upper
stretch, chased the winner through the final furlong and bested the rest. WINE AND WHISKY settled just off of the early pace, raced between rivals into the
backstretch run, maintained that two wide position while between runners into the far turn, shook free approaching the quarter marker and advanced nearing
the top of the stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the stretch run and was outkicked, while clear at the finish for third. AWESOME DUDE settled
outside of rivals in the early running, was unhurried through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn and came within aim nearing the
quarter marker, could not sustain that bid into the stretch drive and gave way. POUR ON THE COLE settled off of the early pace while not far back, saved
all of the ground to the far turn and lacked a response in the stretch drive. MY SUNSHINE stalked the early pace while outside of rivals into the first turn,
maintained his position through the backstretch run, dropped back on the far turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
ST HELENA broke alertly and assumed command in the early running, set modest fractions while well rated through the backstretch run and showed the
way to the quarter marker, was confronted in upper stretch by LIGHT UP and battled with that rival to the furlong pole, continued to duel to the
sixteenth-pole, shook free of LIGHT UP in deep stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted in the final strides to prevail. STEIN'S GIRL tracked
the moderate early pace, advanced along the backstretch run and attended to the pacesetter into the far turn, raced outside of rivals to the quarter marker,
lost ground into upper stretch and chased to the furlong pole, re-rallied in the final sixteenth, came within aim of ST HELENA in deep stretch and just missed
for the win while besting the rest. LIGHT UP settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the half-mile
marker and stalked the pace into the far turn, chased from the inside nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, gained ground and vied for
the lead at the furlong marker, battled with ST HELENA to the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while holding for
third. BIG GIFT settled off of the moderate early pace, saved ground to the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and offered a mild late rally in the final
stages. BIG FAME settled outside of rivals, maintained his position through the backstretch run while not far back, gained a bit of ground while two then
three wide on the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and lacked a late response. CALIFORNIA GIGI broke a bit slowly and was unhurried in the early
running, was hard to place along the first turn and raced widest into the backstretch, chased outside of a rival into the far turn, was outrun into upper stretch
and did not factor.

Footnotes
BALLYVAUGHAN GIG was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the decent fractions from the inside, kept attendance to the leading pair while
saving ground to the quarter pole, was roused nearing the top of the stretch and took command into the drive, was kept to task under moderate late urging
and drew away in the final stages to prevail in a good debut. WESTERN SIERRA broke alertly, showed good early speed and contested the pace while
outside of a rival, pressed the solid pace to the quarter marker, lost ground into upper stretch, chased the winner to the furlong marker, could not keep pace
with BALLYVAUGHAN GIG in the late stages and ran on to secure second. HARD TIMES chased the solid pace while outside of rivals, raced five wide into
the stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, offered a mild late rally and missed for second while getting up in time to secure third. PINEAPPLE JUICE
chased the decent fractions while between rivals, raced four wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch drive, lacked a late response and
missed for third. DINOS DIXIE was hustled to be prominent in the early running, disputed the solid early pace while inside of a rival, held a narrow lead
along the turn while carving decent fractions, lost the lead in upper stretch and chased the winner to the furlong marker, could not keep pace in deep stretch
and faded in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
DANEHILL SONG rocketed away from the gate and quickly opened up a clear lead in the initial furlong racing in the three path under a snug hold, extended
through the turn, drew off in the stretch, drifted in towards the rail near the eighth pole, drifted back out under left handed urging then was geared down in
the final yards. RIVIERA SUNRISE broke in good order, chased the eventual winner througout, came under some pressure to keep pace with the leader
near the five-sixteenths and was not able to threaten the winner but kept to task to finish well clear of the third horse. MANY MARKETS came away from the
gate in good order then settled into the third position early, came under a stiff drive with three furlongs to run but was unable to improve position while
holding third. ENGEE OMBEE off slowly then trailed throughout, made a tepid bid in the stretch but was much too late.

TERRY'S BOY tracked the quick early pace from the inside, advanced on the turn and pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, angled off of the rail
leaving the turn and came three wide into the stretch, chased HONEYMOONZ OVER to the furlong marker, responded to steady urging in the final
sixteenth, vied between rivals in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to dead heat for the win. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke alertly, showed speed
and dictated terms in the early stages, set a pressured pace on the turn while carving fast fractions, shook free into upper stretch, was kept to task while
under firm urging through the lane, was all out in deep stretch and held on to dead heat for the win. TORPEDO AWAY took back off of the fast early
fractions and tracked the pace into the turn, raced three wide into the bend then was coaxed along five wide to the quarter marker, came widest into the
stretch and gained ground nearing the furlong pole, finished well in deep stretch, vied to the outside of the top pair in the final strides and just missed for the
win and place, while holding safely for the show. LITTLE CASINO was prominent in the early running and chased the fast pace to the turn, gave chase while
two wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made up ground in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response and was outkicked.
FULLY LOADED hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased from the rear while saving ground in the early stages, made a mild advance into the
stretch and improved position in the final sixteenth. BOSS OF THEMOSS raced close to the solid early pace while outside of rivals, stalked the pace from
the three path on the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way. PAPAPIFAS bobbled leaving the start then was shuffled back in the early
running, chased from the rear while outside of a rival heading to the turn, raced in the three path to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch.

TOM'S REGRET bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was steered to the inside and chased the moderate pace into the turn, saved ground while
advancing nearing the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, responded to steady urging at mid-stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong
pole, was kept to task into the final sixteenth, drew away in the late stages and was hand urged to finish as much the best. BIG SIS LITTLE SIS chased the
early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground while four wide on the turn, slipped to the inside in upper stretch and chased TOM'S REGRET to the
furlong marker, was not able to keep pace with the winner in drive and outfinished JUST A LITTLE LUCK in the late stages to secure second. JUST A
LITTLE LUCK was prominent leaving the start and tracked the moderate pace into the turn, advanced from the three path along the turn and took a narrow
lead nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by TOM'S REGRET into upper stretch and chased the winner to the furlong pole, was outfinished for
second in the final sixteenth and held safely at the end for third. ROUSING JEWEL was away in good order then was shuffled back in the early going,
chased the pace into the turn, was coaxed along outside of rivals along the bend and raced widest into the stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong and passed
tiring rivals in the late stages. JERSEY SUNSET was forwardly placed in the early running and chased the pacesetter while between runners, came in a bit
tight entering the turn and gave chase while two then three wide approaching the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch drive and weakened in
the final furlong. I'M A RISQUE GIRL chased the decent early pace from the second flight, ran in pursuit while between rivals into the turn, was shuffled
back a bit on the turn and came four wide into the stretch, could not muster a late response in the drive and gave way. LADY WOLF was sent leaving the
break and assumed command in the early running, set a decent pace to the turn, was confronted leaving the three-furlong marker and lost the lead midway
through the bend, dropped back heading into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ANNA'S MUSIC stumbled slightly at the break but quickly recovered and gained the early lead in hand, held the field at bay through the turn, responded
when asked to go on at the top of the stretch and ran off to a handy win. OH ANGEL hustled for the lead then settled in a tracking spot behind, made an
early bid under pressure with three furlongs to run, loomed a threat to the eventual winner at the top of the stretch but could not match strides, was passed
by ZOE'S PRIDE inside the furlong grounds but fought back and earned the place. ZOE'S PRIDE was last away from the gate, remained near the rear of
the field through the turn, started a rally from the five-sixteenths marker, came in on SOO BROOKLYN at the top of the stretch then ran on well down the
lane, briefly gained second but was outgamed in the final yards. SOO BROOKLYN broke inward at the start and mutually bumped with BOBBY'S GENIE,
then was bumped again by that one a few strides later, raced mid-pack and in the three to four path down the backstretch, angled to the inside for the run
into the stretch, was bumped by ZOE'S PRIDE at the head of the stretch but kept on and finished with some interest. BOBBY'S GENIE broke out slightly
and made contact with SOO BROOKLYN then continued to lean out and bumped that one lightly once again, moved quickly up the rail to challenge for the
early lead while the rider was doing his best to keep a straight course, loomed a threat through the turn then weakened from the three-sixteenths pole. RAY
TAYLORS RUMBLE broke with the pack but was outrun early, fell far back before the turn, stayed in the four or five path through the turn and into the
stretch and was never a factor.
