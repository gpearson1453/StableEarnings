speed to duel stayed to the stretch, gave in readily. HEIDI'S SINATRA broke slow never recovered while always far back. TEQUILA FLATS chased top two

Footnotes
MORETASTIC inside speed to the front with a sharp effort to the wire. YAMMY YAMMY BELLA bobbled after start, raced back to the stretch, rallied, no
match. JUDY ELAINE good position off rail turn, rallied into stretch for show spot. BELLA VALENTINA chased top pair to the stretch, stayed on gamely
between horses. YEHAWMEMAW close up to turn, bolted outside, stayed on in the stretch run. STEPHANIESWARRIOR inside run to turn while never a
factor. VALERIE BLUE broke slow from the gate, never menaced throughout. LUCK BE MY LADY never a menace. TONIC AND GIN dropped far back.
