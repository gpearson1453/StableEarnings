Footnotes
MY PAL prompted the pace from the two path down the backstretch, fell back on the turn but moved between horses nearing the quarter pole to take the
lead and drew clear in mid stretch. IMPASSIONED CLAIM rushed up to take the clear lead entering the main track and held that position through the turn
then was collared at the quarter pole and fought gamely to the eighth pole, tired but proved second best. CAPTAIN COMEBACK was off the pace in the
three path through the turn then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and matched strides to the eighth pole but gave way and held on for the show.
SHADYFIED raced near the back down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn but was not a threat. FRIENDLY FOE saved ground throughout to
no avail. RI' PIN SNAP trailed.

GOSPEL BONANZA pressed the pace from the three path down the backstretch then moved in to the two path on the turn to take the lead midway on the
turn and drew off in the stretch. IZZY IN A TIZZY was hustled along to set the pace for a half then was collared in mid turn and proved to be second best.
DOMERGOO was slightly rank early then made a rail bid on the backstretch and lacked a late response in the stretch. BRIGHT MIND was off slow then
moved up from two or three wide on the backstretch but failed to sustain the bid. CORTE had brief early speed to the five furlong pole and retreated. THE O
G had an awkward start, pulled up and vanned off.

PRECEDENT dueled for the early lead then settled off the pace around the turn on the inside, angled out to three wide into the stretch and dueled to deep
stretch and cleared late. RIGHT TO SUE dueled for the lead to the half pole then vied for lead from the inside around the turn, dueled down the stretch and
gave way grudgingly. LUCYS MAJOR MIRCLE broke out at the start, then prompted the pace to the half pole then fell back and saved ground around the
turn, slipped through at the top of the stretch to be a game third. DRISKILL dueled for the lead from three wide then took the lead at the half pole, was
collared at the eighth pole and tired. BRAVO KOLT pinched back at the start, moved up from three wide on the turn but never made a serious bid.

NEW YEARS LOVE vied for the lead from between horses to the half pole then fell back off the pace, made a rebid at the top of the stretch and engaged
the leader at the eighth pole, matched strides with the leader to deep stretch and drew clear in the final yards. MILLI STARR sprinted away to a clear lead
through the turn then was headed and matched strides with outside rival to deep stretch, weakened but was a clear second. DOZO pressed the pace from
three wide to the half pole then settled off the pace around the turn and flattened out. RIVER LIBERTY was void of speed on the backstretch then made a
mild three or four wide bid on the turn but faltered. SWEET TATUM tracked the leaders from mid pack but was not a threat. HIGH VALUE TARGET
remained back.

OPTIMAL went to the front to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch to prove best. JIMBO'S BIZ prompted the early pace the fell back off the pace but
was no match for the winner. GRAN EDITION raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail then moved out to four wide in upper stretch for a late run and
was a clear third. PODEROSO EQUS raced near the back on the backstretch then moved up and went between horses at the quarter pole but was out
kicked in the stretch. RANDOM AFFAIR saved ground on the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn and flattened out. THORNISH tracked the leaders
to the quarter pole and gave way. LIL LATIGO had no speed and was always back.

pack through the turn then moved to four wide in upper stretch, made a late gain on the leader to be a clear second. RONAMO raced in the middle of the
pack, moved out to five wide in upper stretch to just get up for the show. TRICKY LEE saved ground through the turn then moved out to three wide in upper
stretch and maneuvered through traffic in the stretch and just missed the show. ONE STEP AWAY was forwardly placed to the turn then made a bid on the
turn and was out finished in the stretch drive. THIRD WHEEL trailed the field on the backstretch then made a rail bid through the turn and improved position
in the stretch. GUNSLINGERS LEGACY was off the pace to mid turn and weakened. LAUNCHED pressed the pace to mid turn and gave way. JU JU GUY

EUSEBIO hustled to the front to take a clear lead to mid stretch then dug back in and was kept to task. DALE'S ADDICTION was forwardly placed through
the turn but couldn't catch the leader and was a game second. GOSPEL PIPELINER trailed the field early then made a rail bid around the turn and held on
for the show. EL JEFE COBB raced near the back on the backstretch then saved ground around the turn, drifted out in the stretch and missed the show.
RUNNIN BUFFALO moved up the rail early to be off the pace to the half pole then dropped back on the turn and flattened out. FUSAICHI WILDCAT raced
in the middle of the pack and faded. BARREL MAN raced wide throughout and was not a threat. BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR broke well and dropped back.
