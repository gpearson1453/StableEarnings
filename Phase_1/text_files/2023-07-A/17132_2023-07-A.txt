OUTRIGHT dropped back after breaking a step slow, moved up along the outside on the turn, was four-wide the final quarter and finished with a rush to be
up in the final strides. HEY SEQUOIA was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to be three-wide at the quarter pole, took the
lead nearing the eighth pole and then just failed to last. SPROSTON broke a step slow, then moved up three-wide to be in the middle of the field, continued
wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. WEAR THE CROWN saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened. PROUD LION saved
ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a rally. BESAME MUCHO prompted the pace early and tired.

Footnotes
BEER BEGONE dueled with CONRAD MEADOWS for the early lead, opened clear when that one bore out nearing the quarter pole and increased his
advantage. WELL IMAGINE THAT was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn and finished fast. VICTOR ALY was prominently placed while
racing four-wide and finished in a mild rally. CHESHIRE KID broke out to bump TERNI VALENTINO, then rallied six-wide into the stretch and was gaining
late. TERNI VALENTINO was bumped at the start by CHESHIRE KID, dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CONRAD
MEADOWS dueled for the early lead from along the outside, drifted out on the turn, then bore out badly nearing the stretch and finished willingly when
straightened. CONNECTER was forwardly placed to near the stretch while three-wide and tired. CHINOOK BEND was close up early racing along the
inside, moved up two-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid when CONRAD MEADOWS bore out and then faltered during the drive.

LIE AND DENY was close up throughout while racing five-wide and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. SUMMANUS prompted the issue while
racing two-wide, took the lead entering the stretch but was unable to resist the winner late. VALIDATE hopped in the air at the start, then dropped well back,
rallied eight-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. ROYAL CANDY bobbled at the start, then was allowed to settle, moved up strongly along the inside
on the turn, angled to three-wide to offer a bid entering the stretch and then hung. DANNY ZUKO was six-wide throughout and lacked a rally.
PREDICATION set the pace to near the stretch and weakened. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired. PHILIPIE
FAST was forwardly placed for a half mile while four-wide and gave way.

maintained a safe advantage. GABBY HAYES was unhurried early, raced erratically on the turn, swung out to be eight-wide entering the stretch and
finished fast. HUNTERS GHOST was reserved off the early pace while saving ground, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. YOU SPLIT
TENS was bumped at the start by MOSQUITO FLEET, then raced four-wide on the turn while in the middle of the field, was five-wide entering the stretch
and lacked a rally. PROVOST vied with BOSS NINE for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and weakened. PICK YOUR BID dropped back while
saving ground and failed to seriously threaten. BOSS NINE vied for the early lead from along the outside and tired. MOSQUITO FLEET broke out to bump

YOU GO GIRL prompted MS PARKSIDE from along the outside, moved up to join that one nearing the quarter pole, dueled with her from that point and was
all out to prevail narrowly. MS PARKSIDE saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when asked and held on gamely to lose a tough decision.
OUR LYLA GRACE was off a step slow. then was allowed to settle, moved up between horses on the turn while two-wide, came out looking for room
nearing the sixteenth pole bumping IN THE VAULT and was going well at the finish. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, OUR LYLA GRACE WAS
DISQUALIFED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE. IN THE VAULT was
reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, continued to be wide into the stretch, was bumped by OUR LYLA GRACE nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly then was moved from fourth to third via disqualification. FRISCO FRILLS was close up while saving ground but lacked a rally. CHIC
SAMARAI stumbled badly at the start to get away behind his field and was unable to recover. PEPPER MILL was forwardly placed early while racing
three-wide and tired.

three-wide, dropped back slightly in the stretch, then came again late to earn the place. BOURBON DANCER was off a step slow, moved up quickly
between horses on the turn while two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to sustain his rally. MOKKI saved ground while being close up,
had room entering the stretch but went evenly late. MR. EXECUTIVE was prominently placed while racing three-wide njt lacked a rally. GOLDEN AFFAIR
was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SIR ARGENTO hopped in the air to get away behind his field, then saved ground
and failed to menace. DIGITAL SOLDIER failed to break alertly, then angled out to race five-wide and tired after a half mile.

AWESOME MOVE was prominently placed from the start, took an erratic step nearing the half mile pole along the inside, continued on to pursue
THEUNTOUCHABLEONE, slipped through inside of that one entering the stretch, was brushed by him nearing the eighth pole while taking thje lead and
gradually drew clear. THEUNTOUCHABLEONE saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole, came in to brush with the
winner nearing the eighth pole and held on well; for second when straightened. TREASURE'S REALITY was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and
finished in a mild rally. SEVENTH HOUSE broke out to bump with BIG GALUTE, then saved ground while being unhurried and improved his position late.
BIG GALUTE was bumped at the start, then moved up three-wide to prompt the issue to the stretch and weakened. FOYT saved ground while being
unhurried and failed to threaten. POWERS WAR DOG raced four-wide early and was not a factor. CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU was prominent early and gave
way.
