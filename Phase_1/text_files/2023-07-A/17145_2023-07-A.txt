the turn, shook free in upper stretch and kept clear under steady urging. SAVAGE raced off the top trio in the early going, hustled along four wide around the
turn, stayed on three wide through the lane and gained place. COLONEL KLINK vied for the lead in the opening quarter, battled on three wide around the
turn, could not move on with the eventual winner past upper stretch but stayed on and cleared the rest. OURBESTFRIEND D L raced up close between
rivals in the opening quarter, weakened entering the turn, tipped wider for the drive and failed to move on. CLASSIC BET was not far back racing just off the
compact field, began to lose ground late on the backstretch, hustled up for more but failed to respond, weakened, angled inside in the stretch run and failed
to threaten. HACKER vied between rivals for the early lead, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive.

BIG BOSS BEN came away last then quickly advanced and raced between rivals up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, swung three wide
into the lane, steadily edged up closer, dug in determinedly in final stages and got up late. ROBUST raced in contention along the inside, had to wait for
racing room around the turn, steadied along the rail at the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the drive, regained momentum, poked a head out in front leaving
the sixteenth pole then got denied in final stages. UNREAL rated off the early pace, made a three wide move near the quarter pole, hustled along four wide
into the lane, edged up closer in deep stretch and captured show. LOUD BOY tracked the leader up the backstretch, took over a slim lead late on the turn,

BRICKBAT stalked the pace along the inside, angled out and moved up to challenge rival for the lead late on the far turn, gained the advantage near the
furlong marker and held late under a driving finish. PARALISSFRMANALYSS set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and held firm around the far turn,
took on the challenge of BRICKBAT in upper stretch, lost the lead near the eighth pole but stayed on gamely and fought back to the wire. RECORDER rated
off the early pace, picked up the tempo leaving the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the far turn, was no match for the top pair but stayed on
and cleared the rest. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) raced off the pace, swung three to four wide into the lane and had no response. HEZA WILD RIDE
stalked up the backstretch, came up empty with three furlongs left to run and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
AUNT NADINE settled nicely while forwardly placed in early stages, let out a notch late on the turn, moved up three wide at the furlong marker, took over
the lead and finished clear. CHEER UP tracked the early pace on the inside and continued in contention around the turn, launched a rail bid turning for
home, moved up to race in aim a furlong out, could not kick on with the winner but sustained good response and finished clearly second best.
MILLIGANMIKEANDME was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground and hustled up around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and gained a share.
GOLD MAKER vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free and held clear around the turn, came under attack from both sides at the eighth pole, lost the
lead and steadily weakened. DOLLY DIMPLE was not far back early on then lost some ground past the half, chased three wide around the turn and failed to
rally in the lane. LONG MONDAY chased two to three wide around the turn and had no response. RAINBOW SUREBET vied for the lead up the
backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
