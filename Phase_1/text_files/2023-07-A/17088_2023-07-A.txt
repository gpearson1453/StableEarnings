Footnotes
DYNA MAST lacked speed, worked between horses leaving the far turn, swung to the six path in mid stretch, closed and was up near the finish.
HUNTINGTON showed speed throughout, saved ground the far turn, remained near the inner rail in the stretch and was out finished. HIALEAH NATIVE ,
rated back approaching the first turn, raced well off the rail throughout, was well placed outside horses in mid stretch and rallied mildly. NANGA PARBAT
(GB) , a bit rank at the break, moved up four wide leaving the far turn then failed to sustain the bid. ROLLERCOASTER MAN , three wide both turns, chased
the pace to mid stretch then tired. SYNCOPATED , rank behind horses soon after the break, angled out turning for home, floated to the eight path in mid
stretch and passed tired rivals. WIRED IN , always in side horses, failed to rally. PAY THE SQUID , three wide the first turn, was not a factor. EL BONITA ,
outrun, was eased. D'ARPINO B C showed speed along the inner rail, faltered on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
PATRIOTIC PARTY cleared early then was nicely rated towards the rail, edged away under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, was guided three wide
into the lane, kicked away under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert. TYLER TIME settled inside while not far back, eased out and
responded to work between rivals past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the lane, gave willing chase from there and held down the place.
WONDER WATER edged up outside a rival to stalk the pace past the five eighths, was put to a solid ride past the three eighths, was fanned five wide into
the lane and came back on a bit through the final furlong. CHROME HEIR settled off the pace, raced two wide into the stretch, advanced between runners
near the sixteenth pole and continued with some interest. HE'S ON FIRE prompted the pace outside the winner, shifted in with hard pursuit into the lane,
failed to go on past the three sixteenths and weakened. SPECTRIER rushed up four wide early, stalked three wide through the backstretch run, was urged
along chasing past the five sixteenths then tired nearing mid stretch.

and on the far turn, checked lacking room approaching the stretch, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, swept to command near the sixteenth
pole and eagerly drew off. SOLOMON'S CHOICE rushed up four wide leaving the far turn, swept to command in upper stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and
was out finished. WORLD FACTOR hugged the inner rail on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and showed a late move. THUNDERHOUSE

Footnotes
CARVELLIAN QUEST , away alertly, was patiently handled off the rail and well within range, edged up leaving the far turn and sat perched off of a
contested pace, responded when set down four wide soon into the lane, forged clear nearing mid stretch and widened while kept to task. SWITZER , three
deep with the early pace, moved to engage PRACTICAL SENSE from his outside leaving the far turn, sparred to upper stretch, stayed on well and earned
the place through the final sixteenth. PRACTICAL SENSE vied two wide outside BOBBY RIDE early on, secured the lead heading to the half, dropped in
then was joined by SWITZER, battled with that one from the three eighths past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards.
TWICE GOLD broke slowly then was lightly steadied between foes, was under asking three to four wide nearing the lane but came up empty. BOBBY RIDE
took over leaving the chute then was taken on by PRACTICAL SENSE, disputed the pace inside that one to about the half mile marker, failed to keep pace
past the three eighths, faltered and wandered outward in the lane.

AESTHETICALLY , a forward factor in the two path between horses around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, went clear approaching the eighth
pole, was put to pressure and drifted out late. BOWIE TWO STEP lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path in mid stretch and
rallied inside horses. ZEN MASTER , pinched back soon after the break, was behind horses turning for home, swung to the five path near the eighth pole
and rallied on his left lead. SCOTTY BROWN , between horses entering the stretch, moved to the four path in upper stretch, advanced to the eighth pole
then flattened out. SPEAKERIT , steadied along the inner rail entering the turn, remained along the rail on the turn and in the stretch and weakened.
GRAND ESCAPE , outrun, swung to the five path in upper stretch. SOUTHERN LAD , three wide chasing the pace into the turn, weakened. HIS ROYAL G
bolted leaving the turn. GUSSY MAC (IRE) , carried wide by HIS ROYAL G mid way on the turn, dropped back.

Footnotes
NICK'S LITTLE BOY moved up between rivals early to entertain the pace, put a head in front leaving the far turn, met an outside challenge from
STELLWAGON BANKER soon after, spurted clear when set down soon into the lane, opened up under a brisk drive in mid stretch then continued to widen
while steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON broke a beat slow, recovered and moved up between rivals, advanced
four wide mid turn, had aim on the leaders into the lane, kept on willingly to gain the place but was no match for the winner. STELLWAGEN BANKER , with

Footnotes
ZABRACADABRA rated kindly behind rivals, angled out near the half mile marker, crept up then bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled outside
OURNATIONONPARADE into the lane, went clear under strong encouragement nearing mid stretch then edged away while kept to task.
OURNATIONONPARADE prompted the pace two wide outside of CORDMAKER, moved to a slim lead near the three eighths, battled inside the winner past
the three sixteenths, faded late but had enough left to save the place. EVERETT'S SONG stumbled at the break, regrouped and was taken firmly in hand
near the three quarter pole, rated in the clear through the backstretch, was put to a hearty ride chasing the leaders past the three eighths, saved ground in
upper stretch, eased out past mid stretch and kept on with effort. CORDMAKER cleared early and set the pace towards the rail, took pressure into the far
turn, couldn't quite keep pace under asking past the five sixteenths, swung out four wide into the lane, pursued past mid stretch then went evenly through
the final yards. AMERICAN D'ORO broke outward, dropped off the pace, circled four to five wide into the lane but failed to kick on.

RED WIND hopped at the break, comfortably rated behind horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, eased out upper stretch, took command
approaching the eighth pole then drew off. CONGRESS HALL , raced inside horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, angled out in upper
stretch and rallied. CUPIDS DREAM disputed the pace racing along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. WATER WITCH lacked speed, circled the
far turn three wide then offered a mild rally between horses. MS MERRABEL , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, was three
wide the far turn, floated four deep turning for home and flattened out. SNEAKY CHEEKY disputed the pace outside CUPIDS DREAM and gave way in
upper stretch. MAP EM UP hopped at the break and failed to rally. BAD TEMPER , rank approaching the first turn, was not a factor.
