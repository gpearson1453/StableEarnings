Footnotes
JOHNNY RITT pressed the early pace from the inside, then shifted off the inside and split rivals by the five sixteenths, dropped back down to the inside and
slipped thru on the inside nearing the furlong marker, and edged clear to prove best under a drive. DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN was close up early two
wide, shifted out and stalked the pace three wide on the turn, made a bid off the turn but was outfinished. PICTOR vied for the lead on the outside, made a
two wide bid to be clear on the turn, then was challenged inside and outside to be between rivals by the furlong marker and faded, held show award.
MARVALOUS MIKE bobbled at the start, settled on the inside, two wide on the turn and eased out and came five wide into the lane, finished well to just
miss the show award. JUMPMASTER was settled early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. NICE WEATHER vied for the early lead two wide and in
between rivals, then let PICTOR go and fell off the pace and dropped to the inside, then checked leaving the five sixteenths and weakened. There was a
STEWARDS INQUIRY and the jockey on NICE WEATHER claimed foul against the winner for interference leaving the five sixteenths, after the STEWARDS
reviewed the replays they deemed no clear view for a disqualification and left the race as is.

for the place award while no match to the winner. MISSING A SOCK stalked the pace and was ridden along three wide on the turn but weakened in the
drive, held show award. SO STEADY was outrun early, two wide on the turn and had no rally. PRINCESS WIGGY stumbled at the start, rushed up to vie for
the lead by the half mile marker, then went on to be clear and moved to the inside on the turn, headed by the quarter pole and stopped. TEMPTRESS

SON OF A BEAST was away alertly and sent to the lead, opened up a big lead on the first turn, remained well clear by the half mile marker, then was
roused nearing the furlong marker and maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. BLUEBERRY MASH was reserved early, advanced
on the inside nearing the half mile marker, then advanced on the turn and eased off the inside and came three wide into the lane to have aim, was slowly
gaining but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. SWEEPIN HARD was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out four
wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally. MOON WARRIOR was settled back early, shifted in nearing the half mile marker to the inside, advanced on
the inside on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. TUCKERTON BAY was settled early, four wide on the backstretch, three wide on the
turn and had no rally. GALILEE was settled early three wide by the half mile marker, two wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and tired in the
lane. NO ME DIGAS had a wide trip and was not a threat.

SPOOKY ONE was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside while in hand, then drew clear leaving the turn and by the furlong marker, then
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. KEEPING IT COUNTRY tracked the pace from the inside, came two wide into the lane, angled
out in the furlong grounds and finished well. ECLIPTICALS BEAR stalked the winner two wide and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole, came three
wide into the lane but flattened out, stayed on for the show award. LIONESQUE tracked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and had no kick.
PEAKY BLINKERS chased the pace four wide, three to two wide on the turn and had no rally. SCYNTZ was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the
turn but lacked the needed winning bid. BEAST OR FAMINE stumbled at the start, moved up between rivals, two wide on the turn, eased out and was four
wide by the quarter pole but came up empty in the lane. BOX OF JOE failed to respond. CAPTAIN CARDO failed to menace.
