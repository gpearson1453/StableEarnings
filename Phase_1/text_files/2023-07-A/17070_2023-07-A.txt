Footnotes
BEYOND THE PALE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, raced in contention down the backstretch, swung out in upper stretch, took command near the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. MOSLEY NATURAL opened up mid way down the backstretch, remained clear and well off the rail in upper stretch and tired
in the drive. BALLYHOO PRINCE bore out leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses through out and failed to rally. MASTER OF NONE , never far
back, moved up in the three path turning for home and failed to rally in an even effort. SOROLLA bumped with PURSUING PACE leaving the starting gate,
circled the far turn four wide and was no factor. PURSUING PACE bumped with SOROLLA when forced out by BALLYHOO PRINCE leaving the starting
gate, was rank behind horses approaching the first turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BUNKER HILL raced in mid pack and
was not a threat. ALOTTACENTS , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch and faltered. FOOD FOODIE , along the inner rail
much of the race, gave way. NOBLE PRENDERGAST , four wide the first turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
DIALING DIXIE , hustled from the gate, disputed the pace to the inside of SEANOW and BACKATYA, gained a slim lead heading to the eighth pole, spurted
clear under a drive soon after, kept on under solid pressure and had enough left to hold sway. SEANOW set a pressured pace between rivals, emerged in a
duel to the outside of the winner in upper stretch, saw that one get away a bit leaving the furlong grounds, battled back gamely through the final seventy
yards but had his run fall just short. BACKATYA , with the pace three deep, was pushed along outside foes past the five sixteenths, drifted out as the
leaders separated themselves in mid stretch, corrected and finished evenly. SPITBALL , off the pace, was hustled along outside a rival mid turn, shifted
three to four wide in upper stretch, edged up near the sixteenth pole then flattened out. MICE AND MEN stumbled at the break, saved ground while off the
pace and lacked a rally.
