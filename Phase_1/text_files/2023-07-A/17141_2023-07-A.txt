Footnotes
MINT was able to make the front and take the rail with out too much effort, settled next to another contender and set the pace as a set, happily matched
strides and raced with company until he launched a bid at the three eighths pole and drew away, put about a length between himself and the field, raced
down the stretch under encouragement on the rail, was able t hold on for the win. STANS HOME RUN raced four wide and stalked the early leaders, circled
the field in the turn, closed down the lane in the four path, caughta tiring front runner at the eighth pole, cleared that one, but could not catch the winner and
was second best today. HAIL SOUTHERN vied for the lead, raced in the two path, set the fractions in company with the eventual winner, tired after the
eighth pole but had done enough work early was still able to claim third place rewards. BREW CREW raced in the three path between foes in the third flight
of horses, improved position slowly gaining ground, raced in the two path in the upper stretch and closed mildly. QUICK TO BLAME raced five wide, from
mid pack and maintained that position through out. LEMON KICK was mid pack, raced in the three path in the third flight of horses, had no impact.
AFRICAN WARRIOR stalked the early pace from the three path, circled the field in the turn then tired in the stretch. SHANGHAI'S DREAM raced five wide,
from off of the pace and had no kick. MIND ON MY MONEY raced on the rail, was in mid pack early, saved ground but to no avail. SWEET RACHEL was
never involved. ROBTADI STORM showed little.

MR. TIN MAN led, had pressure through out, battled in between foes in the stretch shook the one to the outside, battled to the wire with and determinedly
got his nose in front. THROWIN' SHADE stalked the leader from the rail, launched a bid at the quarter pole, battled in a three way battle, shook one then
went on to the wire, trading punches, all the way and just missed. A MILLION STARS raced on the rail, saved ground, launched a mild bid late. KINGS
WAGER raced three wide, was in the middle of the pack, then faded. HALF A BUCK raced in the four path but was never involved. PAYNTED LOVER
