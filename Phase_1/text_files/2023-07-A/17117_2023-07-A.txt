Footnotes
SALSATION broke in and bumped rival then cleared early, crossed over to the inside on the turn, challenged near the three-sixteenths pole and was
overtaken in midstretch, got floated in and bumped late while fighting back and got up at the wire. ELIGIO was off slow to begin, chased at the back early
then made some progress four wide around the turn, engaged the leader inside the three-sixteenths pole, inched ahead with a furlong left to run, drifted in
and bumped that rival late and was edged on the line. ACE OF CLUBS got bumped from outside by the winner in the beginning, chased two wide into the
turn, tried to split rivals on the turn but lost the opening and had to check when PRIME TIME PORTA shifted off the rail, spun four wide into the lane, drifted
in through the drive and was along for the show. HALO UNCLE chased the leader from outside to the turn, came three wide into the lane, drifted out a bit
then inward in the stretch run and weakened. PRIME TIME PORTA raced up close early from inside, shifted to the two path near the three-eighths pole, and
faded in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SALSATION AND ELIGIO BOTH
CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR PROBLEMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TALKATIVE GAL forwardly placed two wide early, closest in pursuit of the leader up the backstretch, headed that rival at the three-eighths pole and quickly
cleared, led two to three wide into the lane and widened under urging. LUCY L chased three wide between before getting put in tight entering the first turn,
steered down to the inside around the bend, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, could not threaten the winner in the stretch run but churned on to
hold the place. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER bothered by TROJAN WAY soon after the start, trailed three to four wide on the first turn, passed a weakening rival
leaving the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide and gained the show. SHVERE ARBETER was off a bit slow and inward to come away
last, went up inside to take control then cleared, showed the way to the far turn, overtaken past the three-eighths pole, retreated in the lane and was eased
late, then walked off. TROJAN WAY raced up close four then three deep on the clubhouse turn, dropped back off the pace in the middle stages, trailed into
and around the far turn off the rail, eased through the lane eventually crossing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BENEDETTA broke in to bump rival at the start, went between foes to take over and clear early, led off the rail through the turn, coaxed along while the rider
took a look back approaching the eighth pole and remained unchallenged by coasting in late. TAMBO stalked four wide into the turn, moved into the three
path then came out a bit into the lane, chased after the winner through the lane within striking range but could not summon the needed late kick while clearly
second best. HAYLEY AMBER chased four wide into the turn, moved down to the three path then spun five wide into the lane and was along for third.
IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST broke well then chased the winner to the turn, rounded the bend two to three wide, angled out in upper stretch and weakened.
MISTY MUPPET chased near the rail early, lost her path when KALIFORNA K crossed over into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally.
KALIFORNA K was off slow and got bumped back at the start, chased two wide leaving the backstretch then angled to the rail entering the turn and tired in
the stretch run.

Footnotes
FIFTH STREET dueled for command around the first turn, lost contact briefly with the leader then went up take control from between rivals at the halfway
point, held a short lead while battling through the far turn, dueled outside WORCESTER in the lane, got bumped by that rival at the eight pole then drifted in
at the sixteenth pole and dug in to prevail. WORCESTER dueled for command then inched ahead on the clubhouse turn, cleared briefly in the middle stages
then got challenged and lost command at the half-mile pole, fought inside foes through the far turn, drifted out and bumped FIFTH STREET at the eighth
pole and stayed on gamely to the line. MUCINO got bumped leaving the gate, tracked four wide early, three then four wide on the far turn and held the
show. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES broke a step slow and got bumped at the start, chased two wide then angled out leaving the far turn, moved out further in the
lane and improved position. PURE FIRE forwardly placed outside rivals into the first turn, lost touch briefly then bid three deep at the half-mile pole, battled
three wide through the far turn and weakened down the lane. FLAT ON took a bump at the start, chased inside early, came two wide into the lane and
weakened. HAPPY TEARS was off a bit slow to begin, raced two wide near the back then trailed, saved ground on the far turn and failed to menace.
CLASSICALLY bumped inner rival leaving the gate, chased two wide on the first turn, four then five wide on the far turn and weakened. ADVENTURESOME
threw his head and came away slow, became rank and altered out into the first turn, went three to four wide on the far turn and was not a factor.

saved the place. WE NEED MARKETING vied four deep early then chased the top pair leaving the the backstretch, navigated the turn four then five wide,
finished willingly late and missed the place. PAT CAN'T COUNT sat off the pace early on, went two then three wide on the turn, churned on down the lane
for a minor award but needed to find more late. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS broke in and bobbled at the start, saved ground in mid-pack on the turn, corned nicely
into the lane and lacked a rally. TIGER'S ARROW vied for the lead inside a trio of rivals early then chased the leading pair to the turn, saved ground around
the bend and flattened in the furlong grounds. DISTANT STEPPES hit the gate to come away slowly and inward, chased on the inside off the pace, tipped
out leaving the bend and lacked a response when called upon. DANZING DREAM shifted in and bumped leaving the gate, began to climb behind rivals
early, came four wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SPOILED ROTTEN got brushed from inside shortly after the start, pressed the pace from outside, got floated out a bit on the turn, dueled into the final
furlong and proved best late. TEEN DRAMA chased the top pair four wide into the turn, angled six wide leaving the bend, finished willingly late and edged
HOT THOUGHTS for second. HOT THOUGHTS set the pace under pressure from SPOILED ROTTEN, led inside at that rival while drifting out a bit around
the bend, clung to a narrow lead with a furlong remaining, yielded to the winner late and got edged for the place. ROSY EDGE broke through the gate and
had to be reloaded, brushed the gate at the start, went two then three wide around the turn and produced a mild late bid. DALLAS ALICE chased off the rail
then angled in to save ground around the bend and lacked further response in the drive. ROMAN EMPRESS bobbled and bumped with outer rival at the
start, chased five wide into the turn, six wide exiting the bend and failed to make an impact. ZZYZX trailed on the inside and never got involved.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL BUSINESS chased on the inside through the turn, challenged at the three-sixteenths pole, took over midstretch and held the runner-up at bay.
DON'T JU FORGET tracked four then five wide on the turn, bid inside the leader but still well off the rail in the lane and got outkicked by the winner. SHEZA
GIRLY GIRL trailed three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, steered out in the drive and produced a mild rally to earn the show honors. KISS
MY KAT broke inward to lose a step then rushed up to clear and moved off the rail, led three wide into the turn, drifted out to the five path around the bend,
remained clear into the lane, yielded midstretch and flattened to fourth. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE raced near the back early on, rounded the bend wo wide
and lacked the needed resposne. SHANGHAI SUNRISE chased two wide into the turn, three wide into the lane and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
REINCARNATE stepped to the front early and went two to three wide around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, met the bid from PRINCE
ABU DHABI on the far turn, maintained a short lead three wide into the lane, kicked clear when asked near three-sixteenths pole and was kept to task to the
wire. SKINNER settled in the three path early, moved into range in the middle stages, chased four wide into the lane, got floated out slightly by PRINCE
ABU DHABI midstretch, then came in past the eighth pole and finished willingly for the place honors. PRINCE ABU DHABI closest in pursuit from outside
into the first turn, chased outside a rival three then four wide around the bend, launched a bid from outside on the far turn, fought four wide into the lane,
could not kick on with REINCARNATE in upper stretch, drifted out a bit midstretch then got floated in by SKINNER near the eighth pole and flattened to
third. ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN chased behind the leader in the two path around the first turn, traveled along the rail into the second bend, coaxed along two
wide into the drive and weakened. SMART MO hopped slightly to come away slow, trailed four wide into the first turn then angled down into the two path,
continued two wide into the second bend, was ridden along while easing further off the fence, entered the lane four wide and weakened.
