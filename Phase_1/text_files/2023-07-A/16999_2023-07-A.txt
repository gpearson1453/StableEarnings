DANCE LADY prompted the pace set by PARTY POLICE while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead before going a half mile and gradually increase
his advantage. HEART RIVER was reserved off the early pace, rallied four-wide into the stretch and was along for the place in a steady effort. JACANA
saved ground while being unhurried, angled out nearing the eighth pole and was gaining late. PARTY POLICE saved ground setting the early pace and
weakened when headed. CONFIDENCE BUILDER bobbled at the start, then was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. FLY PATTI FLY gave way after showing brief speed along the inside.

Footnotes
VORPAL saved ground while being allowed to setting, slipped through entering the stretch, caught ITS KRAKEN TIME nearing the eighth pole and bested
that one in a stiff drive. ITS KRAKEN TIME saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole, responded when challenged
and just failed to last. A SKIP IN THE PARK was reserved off the early pace, moved up between horses on the turn, lacked room briefly nearing the quarter
pole, split rivals entering the stretch and finished willingly when clear. TIGER TOO vied for the lead while racing two-wide and weakened during the drive.
MY DAD IS THIRSTY saved ground while being unhurried and passed tiring rivals. CROWN COUNCIL hopped in the air at the start,, then was forwardly
placed, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LUCKY CODE prompted the early issue while racing three-wide and tired.

REIGN OF FIRE vied for the lead with BRILLIANT BIRD from along the outside, shook that one off to open clear entering the stretch and increased her
advantage. PEARL RIVER DELTA prompted the issue while racing three-wide, could not reach the winner but continued on well for the placed in a steady
effort. MS LYNN saved ground while being unhurried, angled out for room nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. YOUR ROYAL COIL was
prominently placed to the stretch while four-wide but lacked a rally. BRILLIANT BIRD vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and tired.
CLASSIC LEAH broke slowly and then steadied from between horses shortly after the start, raced five-wide after that and was unable to recover the lost
ground.

JIN TONG was unhurried early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, split rivals entering the stretch and finished fast to prove narrowly best.
POVERTY BAY prompted the issue while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, responded when asked but wasn't quite
good enough in a game effort. J C'S A LEGEND was allowed to settle in stride, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, came five-wide into the stretch
and finished strongly. FIREWALKER was close-up early racing along the inside, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled out 4-wide in the stretch and
was gaining late. JOSE JOSE was prominently placed while racing along the inside, was in tight nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear.
ICE NEEDS WHISKEY saved ground setting the pressured pace to the stretch and weakened. HARBOR OUTLAW settled in the middle of the field while
racing four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. CONTEJAS gave way after showing brief speed.

Footnotes
SETTLER'S COVE prompted the issue while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage to the
wire. VANDULIE was never far back while racing along the inside, was blocked from the quarter pole to the three-sixteenths pole, angled out to split rivals in
the stretch and finished full of run when clear. BIKINI NATION bobbled at the start, moved up on the turn while racing three-wide, came five wide into the
stretch and finished well in a steady effort. ZEVA DEE saved ground while being forwardly paced angled out during the drive but lacked a rally. SENSUOUS
KITTY was three-wide on the turn while racing in the middle of the field, angled in for the drive and went evenly. DEBBI'S TALON saved ground while being
unhurried and failed to seriously threaten. A STORM TOO SOON saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and tired. CHEDOODLE RYLEE raced
four-wide and was not a factor. IN PLAIN SIGHT dropped back early and failed to menace.
