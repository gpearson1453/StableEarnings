KEEP YOUR COIL took control quickly from inside, led two wide into the lane, remained clear into the final furlong under left handed urging and was never
challenged. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN stalked the pacesetter outside a pair of rivals, took aim three wide into the lane but could not threaten the winner in the
final furlong while clearly second best. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) stalked between rivals into and around the bend, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. VEGAN stalked the leader inside a pair of rivals, saved ground to the stretch and flattened. PER RULING FROM HIWU, KEEP YOUR
COIL WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

SWEET VENGEANCE stalked from inside early, coaxed two wide into the lane, took over past the three-sixteenths and cleared while drifting out, continued
to drift in the late stages and was able to hold off the runner-up. RYDER'S CANDY trailed into the turn, went two then three wide around the bend, angled
five to six wide into the stretch and further out in the lane, rallied but was too late. ICY BREEZE was off a step slow, tracked two wide into the turn, three
wide leaving the bend, angled out into the stretch, closed well then was stymied behind the winner approaching the wire. CHEVY GIRL chased four wide
into the turn, had to tip six wide into the lane, challenged in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. COPPER BO TEN stalked from outside early, went
three wide into the turn, took aim at the leader leaving the end and got floated five wide into the drive, challenged in the lane but weakened in the final
furlong. FURSACE set the pace up the backstretch, showed the way two wide around the bend before drifting four wide into the lane, lost command past the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened.

SONG OF SHADOWS stepped to the front and set the pace two wide into the turn, came out a bit to lead three wide into the drive, responded well when
roused and asked left handed and widened in the final furlong. MS MOAB chased two wide into the turn, three wide into the lane and bested the rest.
ROSIE ANN RULES raced up close early, took the turn three wide, came four wide into the drive, flattened in the furlong grounds but managed to hold the
show. DORINE'S WILD CAT broke a step slow on the outside, chased outside a rival three wide into the turn, came five wide into the drive and lacked a
rally. SHAMBALA GIRL broke a step slow, trailed early, rounded the bend four to five wide and failed to menace. DIALING SCOTTY forwardly placed on the
inside, saved ground through the turn and weakened down the lane. PERFECT THREAT broke a step slow, raced along the inside and failed to make an
impact. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
HALF NELSON set the pace under pressure early, dueled around the turn, battled into the final furlong holding a slim advantage and held gamely to the
line. TURQUOISE BIKINI pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the turn and into the lane, hounded the winner through the final furlong and could
not get by. LA PALOMA BLANCA stalked widest to the turn, came six wide into the lane, took aim in the lane but lacked the needed late punch. MISS
JOANNIE got bumped leaving the gate, stalked two wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide, was in the mix entering the furlong grounds but lacked the
needed late punch in deep stretch. VIOLET CROWN broke in and bumped rival, tracked on the inside through the turn and lacked a late bid. ELECTRIC
GLIDE bumped leaving he gate, chased three wide into the turn, moved out and entered the stretch five wide and leveled off in the furlong grounds. MISS
POLO BAR was off slow and bumped in the beginning, trailed early then three wide near the back into the turn, angled six wide into the lane and failed to
menace. BIG UPDATE broke in and bumped rival, chased five then four wide around the bend, drifted inward in the lane and tired. THROW A KANIPCHEN
raced off the pace and angled in on the backstretch, trailed into the turn on the inside, drifted into the lane, had little left for the drive, was eased and walked
off. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE SIXTH RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS SPRING chased three wide around the first turn, trailed into the second bend, came four wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and
began to rally, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole and drove clear. LIBERAL LADY dueled for command in the two path inside a rival, fought along
the rail around the far turn, cleared leaving the bend, met the challenge from inner foe with three-sixteenths remaining, clung to a short lead over rivals on
both sides at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead to GLORIOUS SPRING shortly after and stayed on to secure second. TROUVILLE antsy in the gate,
pulled three then two wide on the first turn, chased two wide around the second bend, moved inside to launch a bid at the three-sixteenths pole but faltered
in the final sixteenth. HALOSNHEAVEN was forwardly placed four then three wide on the first turn, dropped back a bit to stalk the top pair outside rivals,
spun four wide into the lane and flattened. YOUTEYOURHONOR dueled for the lead outside a rival three wide on the clubhouse turn, fought with LIBERAL
LADY to the five-sixteenths pole, chased that rival into the lane, was not persevered with past the three-sixteenths pole, eased in the final furlong and
walked off. CHARLOTTE HARBOR was unhurried in the early going from inside, moved closer up the backstretch, lost ground through the far turn, eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
EXCESSIVE CAT vied between rivals to the turn, cleared at the three-eighths pole and powered away in the lane. TANGLEDUPINGREY broke a step slow
went up to press the pace from inside, could not keep pace with EXCESSIVE CAT around the bend, chased along the rail into the lane and kept on to best
the rest. KRIXUS FLASH got shuffled between rivals early, tracked two then three wide around the turn and gained the show. BETITO vied three deep into
the turn, chased the winner three wide past the three-eighths pole and weakened in the drive. MONGOLIAN MOON tracked outside a rival early, three wide
into the turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. RING GENERAL tossed his head and came away slow, saved ground around the bend and was
not a factor.
