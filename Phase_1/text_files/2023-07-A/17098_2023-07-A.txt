Footnotes
MAGIC CROSS off half a beat slow at the start, came under coaxing and chased along the inside just off the pace dispute up front, angled four wide into
upper stretch, took over command straightened away and went clear under a drive to prevail. DOROTHY'S DREAMS got bumped between foes who each
broke her way at the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, angled out nearing the sixteenth marker
and kicked home belatedly in tandem with EXHILARATE to her outside and was just up for the place honors. EXHILARATE coaxed from the start, chased
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly in concert with the aforementioned
foe and was along for the show honors. SEVEN NATTY PATTY brushed the near side stall at the start when breaking in a step, pressed four wide latched
on outside the top pair, had to steady off heels when coming in slightly as DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT came slightly outwards near the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT broke in at the start bumping DOROTHY'S DREAMS in tandem with LA
PICASITA, dueled from the three path with SUGAR N SPICE to her inside while joined outside by the aforementioned foe, came out slightly when placed to
coaxing near the five-sixteenths forcing SEVEN NATTY PATTY to steady when she came in slightly at that juncture, continued three wide into upper stretch
and weakened. MY STARSHIP coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no
impact. LA PICASITA broke out at the start bumping DOROTHY'S DREAMS in concert with DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT, chased along the inside under a ride
from the three-eighths, continued inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SUGAR N SPICE coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with
DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT to her outside and SEVEN NATTY PATTY applying pressure to both stacked outside that rival, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch yielding command and tired.

Footnotes
COOL QUARTET prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took a short lead at the quarter-pole,
came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while battling inside of the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that
foe outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away under steady urging to prove much the best. ZERTZ tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the
four path on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, battled outside of the winner under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop
at the furlong marker, lost touch with the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match under a strong hand-ride from that point while able to hold
the place. CARIBBEAN (AUS) dropped back on the outside then settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three then two wide on
the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DRINK THE WIND went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a foe, vied in the two
path on the turn, was asked inside the three-eighths pole, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and tired. MOLIERE was hustled from the gate, dropped
back early then settled near the rear under some urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BOUNCER broke out then was corrected by the rider, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the two path on the turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead in the three path into upper stretch then cruised clear, responded well when shaken up inside the three-sixteenths, maintained
a safe advantage under a confident hand ride in the final furlong and proved best. FENWICK settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused
near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, angled out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, gained on the leader into the final
furlong, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage for the place. LEDDY broke awkwardly and was last to commence then
dropped back, raced at the rear under urging, shifted from the two path to the four path nearing the three-eighths, was driven five wide into upper stretch,
gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. ON THE COME UP went to the front then sped clear, raced inside on the turn, was asked
under threat inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch and tired. RETURN THE RING settled on the outside, was roused in the three
path on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
CHARGE IT forwardly placed three then two wide through the first turn, advanced on the leader five paths off the inside into the backstretch to poke a head
in front just inside one mile remaining, tucked four wide midway down the backstretch shaking away to a safe advantage on hold and patiently handled,
tucked three wide nine-sixteenths from home and began to slip away given a notch to work with, tucked to the two path three furlongs from home, came
under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, had the rider look under his right arm and then over his left shoulder in
the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and was roused, edged clear under vigorous hand urging and was ridden out to the finish. CLAPTON three then two wide
through the opening bend, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch at the tail of the field early on, advanced steadily to be just off the pace when
placed to light coaxing half a mile from home tucked three wide, continued three wide through the turn coming under intensified urging and into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. UNBRIDLED BOMBER four then three wide through the
first turn, raced four wide in pursuit coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and kept on under a drive to improve
position and secure the show honors on the line. RED RUN established the front from the get go and showed the way through the first turn just off the inside
into the backstretch before being displaced on the front by the eventual winner just inside one mile to run, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into
the far turn, came under urging at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. TONAL IMPACT along the inside
through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under encouragement at the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LOON CRY was rated on the outside, tucked into the two path for the run around the turn, moved to the three path late on that bend, was roused five wide
into the stretch, rallied to the lead coming to the furlong marker, put away the runner-up near the sixteenth-pole and drew clear under steady urging.
WEEKEND RAGS was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive while in front in upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong marker, battled with that foe to near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to hold
the place. ROYAL DANCER was well placed just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole,
made a brief bid near the furlong marker but was out-kicked while able to get the show. CANDY MONET settled on the outside, moved from three to five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead inside the sixteenth-pole and lacked
the needed kick. SIKUM settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and lacked the needed response. ROBYN AND ELI broke a step slow, settled at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. QUICK POWER NAP was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. I'M NERVOUS NOW angled in early while settling off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, moved
out while asked for her best in upper stretch and failed to rally. RANTING stumbled at the start and spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the rear,
went three wide on the turn and was no factor. KREESA LA WROTE dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn and showed little.
LONGLIVE THE QUEEN tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and retreated.

DOT'S DOLLAR chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge
through the final furlong and was up between foes in the final jumps to prevail. MILTON THE MONSTER chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and
missed at the end while just up for the place honors. VITTORIO four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then
three wide into upper stretch rallying to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under challenge to the outside and came out five paths from the eighth
pole to the sixteenth marker to get a look at the pair threatening to the outside and was nailed by both in the final strides. MAJORITY PARTNER coaxed
from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn under pressure from SAGAMORE MISCHIEF every step of the
way, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared by VITTORIO with
three-sixteenths to run and weakened in the late stages. BUSINESS MODEL six paths off the inside briefly, tucked to the two path six furlongs from home
before taking to the rail through the turn, was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF led early on, then prompted the pace of MAJORITY PARTNER from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA got away to an awkward beginning when nearly sitting down in
the stall when the latch was sprung, got away askew to the left side and conceded five to six lengths immediately to the front, chased along the inside down
the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
ASPEN GROVE (IRE) was loaded with the use of a loading blanket, broke out leaving the gate and was off a bit slow while last to commence, angled in
early, saved ground under restraint on the first turn, was rated off the inside, traveled three wide on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, eased out a
path and replaced the tiring BE YOUR BEST outside the eighth-pole, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead just inside the sixteenth-pole
and prevailed under strong urging. PREREQUISITE showed speed on the inside of a rival, set the pace while inside to the two path, was asked near the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was headed by the winner, fought on to the finish but missed while just
able to get the place. PAPILIO (IRE) stumbled very badly at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced four wide on the far
turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and finished with good courage to just miss the place while up for the show. ASPRAY went two to three
wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace with cover, rounded the far turn in the four path, was roused five wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. FREYDIS THE RED (FR) angled in early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the
outside but with cover, went four to five wide on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and also lacked the needed kick then just missed the
superfecta. SPEIRLING BEAG (IRE) was rated while inside to the two path, moved closer under restraint midway down the backstretch, saved ground on
the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. MISSION OF JOY was rated
inside to the two path on the first turn, raced just off the pace under stout restraint while tugging at the bit, rounded the far turn in the two path, made a bid
while let out at the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. STRIKINGLY SPUN raced under a tight hold while between
foes into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was reserved towards the rear, pulled her way closer midway down the backstretch, moved from the
hedge to the two path on the far turn, waited behind horses from the quarter-pole to the three-sixteenths then was roused, raced behind horses under urging
to near the sixteenth-pole, was not urged while behind some traffic in the final sixteenth, moved out late and failed to threaten. BE YOUR BEST (IRE)
showed early speed, prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, was asked near the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and
came up empty.

FAR BRIDGE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace under some restraint,
was roused while inside to the two path on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch then moved out while picking up stride inside the three-sixteenths,
rallied into the final furlong, closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, was brushed by the runner-up shortly thereafter then gained the lead,
brushed again with that foe late and prevailed under good handling. THE FOXES (IRE) broke a bit slow and was last to commence, angled in towards the
rear, was hard held near the back in the two to three path, remained towards the rear while just behind the winner and snugly held between foes going
around the far turn, jostled with a rival coming to the quarter-pole then was asked, rallied into the final furlong, gained between horses into the final sixteenth
and finished with good energy to just get the place. MONDEGO (GB) was hustled from the start, moved in while showing speed, set the pace on the inside,
vied along the hedge while inside of a foe on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out
outside the sixteenth-pole then brushed with the winner, led determinedly into the final sixteenth then was collared, steadied while brushing and being
outfinished by the winner late and lost the place in the final stride while just able to get the show. WEBSLINGER bumped with a rival at the start, went
around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, went four then five wide on the far turn, bumped with an opponent while six wide into the
stretch, drifted in some inside the three-sixteenths and improved position for the last spot in the superfeca. SILVER KNOTT (GB) bumped with a foe but
broke towards the front, moved in while forwardly spotted early, saved ground just behind the leader on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, moved to
the two path around the three-quarter pole then turned up the pressure, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, battled under
a drive into the final furlong and weakened. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn and failed to rally.
REDISTRICTING (GB) went four wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, traveled three then four wide on the final turn, bumped with an
opponent while five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KALIK was fractious loading and in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start, steadied briefly
while having his path taken early, went four then five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, was asked for his best into
upper stretch and came up empty. WIZARD OF WESTWOOD bumped with a rival at the start, was taken under a very tight hold early, rounded the first turn
in the two to three path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three then two wide on the far turn and capitulated. CYBER NINJA was hard held near the
back on the inside, jostled with a foe at the quarter-pole then was roused and was no factor. BOPPY O dropped back early, went three to four wide on the
first turn, was reserved on the outside without the benefit of cover, raced four wide while roused on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAPLE LEAF MEL established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, had RED CARPET READY advance and latch
on outside near the five-sixteenths, remained patiently handled shaking off that rival continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got placed to light urging
and edged away to the eighth pole, got roused under a light drive inside that station being shown the crop to the right side and receiving a lone tap until the
sixteenth marker and then got hand urged to the finish to hold well and clear to the end. DAZZLING BLUE chased along the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while chasing her home along willingly for the place honors.
VAHVA chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. INTERPOLATE
bobbled after the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
DOWNTOWN MISCHIEF three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. TOPSY four then
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and tired. RED CARPET READY forwardly placed
four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide offering up a bid at the five-sixteenths to latch on the eventual winner to the
outside, angled four wide into upper stretch and was shaken off, then folded in the stretch. ADELIESE'S SMILE chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, tipped three to four wide at the head of the stretch, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BURN JAKEY BURN dueled on the outside, moved clear coming to the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch,
responded well under good handling into the final furlong, shortened stride into the final sixteenth and held desperately in a big effort. BOSTON STRONG
MAMA moved in early then was well placed, went around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead until outside
the furlong marker, gained on the winner while inside that foe into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. SCREW LOOSE settled
inside under some urging, was shuffled back off the heels of IT'S NOT MY FAULT between the three-eighths pole and the five-sixteenths, moved to the two
path in the process, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just
get the show. HERONEANDONLY raced on the outside in the second flight, was urged four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch, drifted in
inside the three-sixteenths, kept on in the final furlong and narrowly missed the show. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL was urged along off the pace, went around
the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. LEFTEMBEHIND was off slow then taken up,
spotted the front several lengths, traveled around the turn in the two path, brushed with a rival outside the quarter-pole then came three wide at the
quarter-pole, drifted inward in upper stretch and improved position. SINALOA was bumped solidly at the start and a bit slow into stride, settled at the rear,
went three wide on the turn, hesitated while splitting foes inside the furlong marker and never reached contention. KERN RIVER dueled on the inside of the
winner, dropped back nearing the half-mile pole, chased two then three wide on the turn, moved to the two path under a drive into the stretch and tired.
REAP WHAT YOU SOW broke out and bumped solidly with a rival, moved in while settling off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and failed to rally. GIO'S MAJESTICNESS came inward at the start then dropped back, settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn,
brushed with a foe outside the quarter-pole, shifted five wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and was no factor. IT'S NOT MY FAULT
was urged along in the second flight, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. BAY BANK settled towards the rear while well off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
