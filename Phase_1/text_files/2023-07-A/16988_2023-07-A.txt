Footnotes
VANISKY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions into the backstretch run then was well rated to the far turn, set a pressured pace
to the quarter marker, shook free into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong pole, kept to task in deep stretch and remained clear to the
wire to prevail. BEROLIJEAN (FR) settled outside of rivals in the early stages, raced four wide along the backstretch run and advanced nearing the half-mile
marker, maintained a wide trip into the far turn, chased VANISKY into the drive, made a mild late bid in the final furlong and held safely at the finish for
second. LOOKOUT POINT saved ground while unhurried, maintained a rail trip to the quarter marker, closed well in deep stretch and was clear for third. MR
BOTANICALS was forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run and kept mild pressure on the pacesetter to
the quarter marker, lost ground to VANISKY into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. UNUSUAL CODE settled off of the early pace while outside of
rivals, advanced along the backstretch run and came within aim nearing the half-mile marker, was outrun along the far turn and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CANYON CREST was allowed to settle into the first turn, was coaxed along into the three path into the backstretch run while inside of rivals, was well
placed into the far turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, angled three wide into upper stretch, caught BROOKYS TAPIT at mid-stretch and took
command approaching the furlong pole, was kept to mild urging through the final furlong and pulled away in deep stretch. BROOKYS TAPIT was forwardly
placed into the first turn, raced outside of rivals and disputed the moderate pace through the backstretch run, took command into the far turn, was overtaken
by CANYON CREST in upper stretch, chased that rival into the final furlong and held clearly at the finish to be second best. STATE OF THE UNION was
sent leaving an alert beginning and set disputed fractions into the backstretch run, contested the pace with BROOKYS TAPIT to the half-mile pole, lost
ground to that rival along the far turn, weakened in the drive and just held for third at the finish. BROKEN FINGER stalked the leading pair into the first turn,
was guided outside of rivals into the backstretch run and chased four wide into the far turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, tired in the drive,
steadied off of heels in the final yards and just missed for third.

DRAW NEAR raced close to the moderate early pace, advanced along the turn while saving ground and pressed the pace to the quarter marker, took a
narrow lead in upper stretch, battled back against rivals while maintaining a slim advantage to mid-stretch, was fully extended into the final sixteenth and
determinedly lasted for the win. PLEASANT WARNING pressed the moderate early pace while outside of SAINT HELEN, kept close attendance to that rival
to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into upper stretch, re-rallied into mid-stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, drew to even terms with
DRAW NEAR in the final sixteenth, Ayuso lost his crop in the final yards and just missed for the win, while just holding for the place. ROUSING STAR broke
out leaving the start and was off a step slowly, chased inside of a rival into the turn, gained ground on the turn while chasing from the two path, angled four
wide into the drive, finished well in the final furlong and just missed for the win and place, while clear in the end for the show. SAINT HELEN broke alertly
and set a pressured early pace while off of the rail, dueled with PLEASANT WARNING through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, lost the lead to
DRAW NEAR in upper stretch, fought back against that rival and while between runners to the furlong grounds, could not match strides with rivals in deep
stretch and weakened. CHANTELLE chased the early pace while outside of rivals, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.

BLUE WILDCAT broke alertly and showed the way in the early running, was engaged by a pair of rivals heading to the turn and took back to stalk from the
rail along the bend, saved ground while within striking distance approaching the top of the stretch, responded to firm urging at mid-stretch, drew to even
terms with DOLCE GHOST in the final sixteenth, got by that rival into deep stretch and held safely in a drive to prevail. DOLCE GHOST lunged at the start,
bothered SEEMS LOGICAL and was off a step slowly, recovered to contest the early pace while outside of rivals, took command into the turn and angled to
the two path nearing the quarter marker, led while off of the rail into upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong marker, was asked for more heading to the
sixteenth-pole, could not hold off BLUE WILDCAT in deep stretch and just held for second. SEEMS LOGICAL was bumped at the start by a neighboring
rival and was off a step slowly, chased while widest in the early stages, came five wide into the turn then angled to the three path nearing the quarter
marker, came within aim approaching the top of the stretch, chased DOLCE GHOST to the furlong pole, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and
was outkicked, while just missing for second and well clear for third. TAMANTARI came in a bit tight in the early stages and was shuffled to the back leaving
the break, lacked early speed and chased from the rear to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, was coaxed along into the three path into the drive
and did not factor. CANDY'S CLONE broke through the gate prior to the start, was away in good order and contested the early pace while between rivals,
could not keep pace heading to the quarter marker and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MISS IVES broke alertly then took back off of the early pace and tracked to the turn, gained ground while outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker and
loomed nearing the top of the stretch, took command in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, drew off in deep stretch and was geared
down in the final stages as much the best. A ROUSING BABE settled off of the decent early pace while inside of rivals, gained ground on the turn and
waited a bit for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, swung four wide for the drive, was no match for the winner in the stretch run and ran on in the final
sixteenth to secure second. LIKE NO OTHER tracked the early pace while between runners, gained ground into the turn and pressed the decent pace to the
quarter marker, could not match strides with MISS IVES into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished for second, while
holding safely for third. PACIFIC ZIP chased the decent early pace from the inside, lost ground into the stretch, needed more in the drive and passed tiring
rivals in the final stages. DAWN AT LAST was sent to establish the early lead and controlled the pace into the turn, was confronted along the bend by LIKE
NO OTHER and dueled through decent fractions with that rival to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the drive and gave way in the
final furlong. ANGI'S THIRSTY was unhurried while under an early hold, saved ground into the turn while trailing, swung widest into the stretch and did not
factor. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE chased the pace from towards the rear, lost ground while three wide on the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
SEATTLE BOLD broke alertly and dictate terms into the first turn, was well handled through the backstretch run, ceded the lead to NOLDE nearing the
half-mile marker and received a breather into the far turn, re-engaged while outside of a rival nearing the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch drive,
was kept to task under steady late urging and drew clear in the final stages to prevail. HARMON was a bit slow into early stride and was unhurried into the
first turn, settled outside of rivals into the backstretch run, advanced while saving ground into the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, closed well in the
stretch run and was up in the final strides to secure second. KINGMEISTER bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed
into the first turn and stalked from the rail into the backstretch run, maintained his position to the half-mile pole, was roused into the far turn and vied for the
lead at the quarter marker, lost ground to SEATTLE BOLD into upper stretch, chased that rival into the final furlong, could not muster the needed late
response and was outfinished in the final strides for second, while holding safely for third. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) settled outside of rivals in the early stages
while not far back, was well placed through the backstretch run, came four wide into the far turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not offer a late
rally. NOLDE raced close to the modest early pace while widest into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run and made a middle move to
vie for the lead nearing the half-mile marker, could not keep pace while three deep on the far turn and tired in the stretch drive. AMERICA GREAT was
prominent in the early running and attended to the pace while outside of SEATTLE BOLD, stalked that rival through moderate fractions to the half-mile
marker, lost ground while three wide on the far turn, raced a bit in traffic behind tiring rivals into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TOP HARBOR was allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the turn, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker, angled to the five
path in upper stretch, was full of run at mid-stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-pole and drove clear in the final stages. EVENEREVENWORSE
broke sharply and assumed command in the early running, set a contested pace into the turn and set decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker,
continued to battle with UNRAPTURED into the stretch, was not able to keep pace with TOP HARBOR in the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while
holding for second at the finish. UNRAPTURED was sent leaving the start and pressed the pace into the turn, kept close attendance to
EVENEREVENWORSE along the bend, battled with that rival into upper stretch and continued to duel to the furlong marker, weakened in deep stretch and
was outfinished for second, while holding for third. LARRY'S LEGEND was prominent in the early running and stalked the decent pace while outside of
rivals, raced four wide to the quarter marker, gained ground into the stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and was outkicked. TRUMPED
stumbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to chase from the second flight while not far back, made a steady advance while saving ground
along the turn and into the drive, could not sustain that bid into deep stretch and flattened out. GERLACH'S chased from mid-pack while saving ground in
the early running, swung to the five path in upper stretch and could not muster a late response. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD chased the decent pace while
saving ground and did not threaten. PSYCHO DAR was forwardly placed in the early running, took a bad step nearing the half-mile marker, was pulled up
and was vanned off.

Footnotes
RACKATAPTAP broke well, tracked EFFECTIVE GIG through moderate fractions while three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch, took
command passing the five-sixteenths marker, opened up on the field and was never threatened to the wire. RULER OF ANGELS outrun from the break,
was prompted to maintain contact with the field through the turn, was content to save ground near the rear of the field, began to rally through the turn but
encountered some traffic issues with three furlongs to run, split horses at the head of the stretch and ran on well but was no match for the winner.
CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN broke in a bit then quickly straightened, had good position tracking EFFECTIVE GIG through the first turn, then ceded the second
spot to RACKATAPTAP for the backstretch run, rated while still close up down the backstretch, rallied under heavy pressure from the three-eighths pole but
was boxed in to the top of the stretch, raced within aim to the furlong grounds, was outkicked in the final stages and held for third. LORD OF LIGHT lagged
near the back of the filed three to four wide in the early stages, rallied through the turn and into the stretch while still three to four wide and ran on well but
was outfinished for third. COUNT ASHER ridden from the gate and close up through the first turn then settled near the back of field though not far from the
front, was asked to rally from about the three-eighths marker but did respond and ran on one-paced well behind the field. EFFECTIVE GIG veered in after
the break then was sent to grab the lead and position off of the rail into the first turn, held a short lead over the compact field through moderate fractions to
the far turn, was overtaken by RAKATAPTAP near the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the stretch. BIG DIFFERENCE broke well, had good position
mid-pack but not far from the front, came under a ride passing the half-mile pole, began to lose position mid-turn and never recovered.
