DEVINE CANDY hustled form outset and established a ground saving stance, set the pace in concert, and refused to be outdueled to procure the victory.
EASTER VISION rushed from the break and led the field in tandem as the outer rival of two abreast, but failed to match strides with eventual winner in
homestretch. CAT TALE BREEZE chased the pacesetting duo through the first call as the lone rival in the second flight, trekked the two path around the
turn, but was unable to catch the lead duo in final furlong. BOTTLES AN BIBLES showed reserve and trailed the field aong the backstretch, saved ground
through the bend, and passed a tiring foe in closing strides. NITRO NINA gave chase from a three path position and tired in crucial portion of contest.

CAMDEN'S BEAUTY broke alertly, led the short field at first stride, and never relished for a wire to wire score while saving ground. EARLY DISMISSAL was
unhurried and gave chase from a ground saving stance through the opening half, swung to the two path while under urging around the final turn, but proved
to be no match for the clear runaway winner. MY GOLDEN PRIZE stalked the pacesetter from a two path pose through the opening half before weakening
in the closing stages.

SERENDIP RULER broke alertly, set the pace in tandem from an inside pose, and kept to task in final furlong for the score. REMEMBER ME TONY showed
reserve along the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and rallied along the rail in the closing strides to earn the place. BURTNJOE pressed the pace
while tracking the two path, was the lone rival in second flight at upper stretch, then couldnt fend off the late rallying foe and was nipped for place.
EURONTHEMONEY settled into second flight as the outer rival of two, trekked the two path around the turn, was within striking distance at upper stretch,
but failed to produce a late bid.

SAZON came away alertly, established an inside stance and led every step of the way while steadily widening the margin. SPIN TO WIN was unhurried in
the opening quarter, advanced on the pacesetter along the backstretch, rated a clear second at upper stretch, but was no match for the runaway winner.
LITTLE MAD MAX trekked the two path, led the second flight along the backstretch, and weakened in the crucial stages. HONOR THE LAW established a
ground saving pose, settled into mid pack and was void of any rally. POWER PROJECTION trailed from outset and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
HEY ROXY stalked the pacesetter from an inside pose, angled out at upper strtch and rallied mid track for the score. RED RED WINE rushed from outset,
led the field into the turn and at upper stretch, but failed to fend off the rallying rival in cosing strides. MARIA ELENA Y. G established an inside stance
shortly after the start and earned the show with a mil rail rally. HOPE AND A DREAM showed reserve in the opening stages, trekked the two path, and
improved placing with late interest. MISS M J was unhurried along the backstretch, travelled wide through the turn, and was gaining on leaders at finish.
TWO ANGELS settled between rivals in the second flight, then was void of any response to urging in the homestretch and tired in closing strides.
NOSTALGIA lost ground to front runners with a wide journey. LUCKY EVERY DAY faded rapidly to end a three wide journey.

Footnotes
SARA'S SAPPHIRE broke alertly, rated close up through the opening turn, gained command near the midway point, and drew well clear of rivals in latter
stages of contest. LYNN'S FOLLY lunged at the break, led the field at first call, saved ground throughout, but was no match for tough winner. HARPERS
VISION saved ground to no avail. NAUGHTY NATALIE lacked a needed rally after settling into mid pack and chasing the front runner from a two path pose.
FOREIGN CREATION trailed from outset and failed to menace.

ABSAROKA settled into mid pack through the opening half, angled out to three wide midway, gained command entering the final bend, and drew off in
closing strides. UNRESTRICTED showed reserve through the opening half, swung wide at upper stretch, and rallied to earn the place. WILBERT came
away alertly, exchanged command through the opening half while travelling the two path, led the second flight at upper stretch, then weakened in the final
sixteenth and held on for the show. WIN FOR FUN . REVIVAL failed to produce a late bid after settling in behind the front runners and trekking the two path.
CANEY'S GHOST broke alertly, angled out wide entering the first turn, then was geared down and stopped prior to the first call.

SPANISH HOMBRE pressed the early pace from a two path pose, gained command along the backstretch, and opened up on the field in the final furlong.
ELECTORAL tucked to save ground shortly after the start, rated between rivals at upper stretch, and finished with strong strides to earn the place. MAGIC
CARPET settled into mid pack, trekked three wide, and gained mildly in late strides to improve placing. VERRAZANO FIRST failed to sustain command
after rushing from outset to lead the field in early stages while saving ground. GRAB THE MUNNY lacked a needed rally after giving chase from a two path
stance. RONALD DALE trailed the field in the opening half before passing tiring foes in latter portion of contest. NOMOREMRNICEGUY failed to threaten
from a back rated stance. OKIE UNION flashed early interest from an inside pose and steadily faded thereafter.
