Footnotes
MAMACALLMEBOO saved ground setting the pace and gradually drew clear. FREESTONE saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped
through entering the stretch and finished well for the place. BEL RAGAZZO saved ground while being unhurried, found room entering the stretch, angled out
slightly and was gaining late. ARTHUR SPOONER was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide and weakened. TWO PRINCES was reserved off the
early pace, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. PLAYOFF BOUND was four-wide on the first turn while being forwardly placed, moved up
along the outside to prompt MAMACALLMEBOO to the stretch and came up empty during the drive.

STARRY BEACH vied with CHROME'S BEST COPY for the lead from the outset, came out nearing the sixteenth pole carrying that one out slightly and
drew clear late. CHROME'S BEST COPY vied for the lead from along the outside, was carried out slightly nearing the sixteenth pole by the winner and held
on for the place in a game effort. ANOTHER TEN saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved up along the inside on the turn, lacked room from the
quarter pole to the eighth pole running up on horses, angled out briefly leaving the eighth pole then back in and finished willingly. SAILING IN disputed the
issue for a half mile while three-wide and tired. THE JOCKEY OF CHROM'S BEST COPY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST STARRY BEACH BUT
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THAT STARRY BEACH CAUSED INTIMIDATION TO CHROME'S BEST COPY IT DID NOT
COST HIM A PLACING SO THEY ALLOWED THE ORDER OF FINISH TO STAND.

Footnotes
KISS RIDE GOODBYE saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through nearing the quarter pole, angled out two-wide nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth to win going away. LOW DOSE saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist
the winner late but continued on gamely for the place. HEAT SEEKING LETA was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole,
offered a bid entering the stretch and then went evenly late. MISCHIEF MAMA was unhurried early, swung out to be six-wide entering the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. COCOA CENTS was bumped at the start by YELLEN then was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened.
YELLEN broke out to bump with COCOA CENTS, then moved up to prompt the pace while racing two-wide and tired.

MUNNINGS TALE saved ground setting the pace in hand, responded when asked and gradually drew clear. CAMDEN HIGH saved ground stalking the
pace, angled out three-wide to offer a bid leaving the quarter pole, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place. LA POPIS prompted the issue
to the stretch while two-wide and weakened. TED'S CANDY GIRL saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole but lacked a rally. GUNNHILD was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and tired. EASY DOES IT dropped back early, came
three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. G G RULES showed early speed from between horses and gave way before going three furlongs.

SUPER CREATIVE steadied nearing the seven-eighths pole when FOREVER AMBER came in, angled out entering the backstretch to go around that one,
moved up strongly along the inside on the turn, steadied lacked room nearing the quarter pole, slipped through along the inside and was up in the final
eighth to win going away. THE GOLDEN EGG vied with CASH'S CAT for the lead, shook that one off nearing the quarter pole, drifted out entering the
stretch, was unable to match strides with the winner but was clearly second best. GOOD DANNY dropped back after an alert beginning, saved ground and
finished in a mild rally. EXIT STAGE LEFT stalked the pace while saving ground, angled out slightly at the quarter pole but lacked a rally. FOREVER
AMBER came in nearing the seven-eighths pole while racing erratically then saved ground and failed to threaten. CASH'S CAT vied for the lead from along
the outside for six furlongs and stopped.
