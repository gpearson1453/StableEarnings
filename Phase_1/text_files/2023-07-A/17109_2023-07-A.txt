Footnotes
MIKE'S LADY rated in the early going, was roused just off the inside on the second bend, split rivals two wide midstretch and edged ahead inside the last
eighth as she gradually drifted out. JERSEY GOLD bumped solidly with ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE at the start, vied for the lead between horses, did not stay
with the latter on the backstretch, went for the lead two wide on the second turn, edged ahead upper stretch, began to slowly drift out inside the final furlong,
lost the advantage and did not have enough left in the waning yards. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE threw her head up when the gate opened, bumped solidly
with JERSEY GOLD, was altered in awkwardly, rushed up to keep the inside and vie for the lead into the first bend, moved clear on the backstretch, was
challenged on the second turn and gradually wore down for the drive. WITCHING allowed to relax from outside on the backstretch, made her bid three wide
on the second turn, dueled from the outside in the lane but did not have enough left deep stretch.

Footnotes
MISS MIA hesitated at the break, was roused from inside on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch, was all out, engaged CARICIA in the waning
yards and edged ahead in time. CARICIA also hesitated at the start then found herself behind traffic, squeezed through tight quarters between horses with
five furlongs to go then was boxed in and waiting for room, got through three to vie for the lead three wide on the turn, edged ahead inside the last eighth,
was challenged deep stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. BORDER STAR contested the pace inside after the first furlong then
gradually wore down inside the last furlong. MO WANNA GO broke outward, brushing with W W VALID, led just off the inside for nearly a furlong then
shared the lead outside BORDER STAR, came into the lane two wide and began to wear down. THERE RUNS MARY bumped with W W VALID at the start,
raced in the second flight from outside, threatened four wide on the bend but gave way for the stretch run. W W VALID was bumped then briefly squeezed
at the break, shuffled back after travelling a furlong and showed little the rest of the way.

Footnotes
IRISH DECLARATION settled early, gradually progressed between horses on the backstretch, circled rivals into the second bend then steadily pulled away
with little asking in the lane. SUPER SILVER rated in the second flight two wide, commenced his bid after a half mile, came into contention on the second
turn, was in path three entering the stretch, moved clear for second then could only hold his position late. KRAMDEN settled well back, saved ground taking
the second bend, made a strong move along the rail the last two furlongs and was clearly best of the rest. LASTFORTINOFAMILY bumped with GO FOR
SHERRIE shortly after the break, raced in the second flight from inside, started his bid on the second turn, fanned out to path three entering the stretch,
progressed to vie for third midstretch but weakened inside the last eighth and was galloped out as his rider stood up the last thirty yards. TROY OUNCE
shared the early lead outside BOURBON DELIGHT, moved to have the lead solely nearing the second turn, gained the rail into that bend, was overtaken
shortly after that and steadily yielded through the stretch. BOURBON DELIGHT jostled with GO FOR SHERRIE shortly after the start, contested the pace off
the rail but inside TROY OUNCE then began to fade with four furlongs to go. GO FOR SHERRIE jostled between rivals shortly after the break, was steadied
briefly, ran widest most of the way and showed little.

Footnotes
STUMP rated on the front end, sometimes in close quarters along the rail, moved ahead on the bend, began to float out as he was asked for run leaving the
turn and steadily lengthened command as he slowly drifted out in the stretch. CAMPAIGN SPY raced in contention just off the inside, angled out some as he
made his bid on the turn, came four wide into the lane, edged ahead for second then could only hold his position late. ROAD GAME was taken inside early
on, reached contention along the rail on the bend, rallied belatedly the final furlong but caught W W TRAFALGAR for third near the wire. W W TRAFALGAR
quickly moved up between horses leaving the chute, angled in beside STUMP after the first sixteenth of a mile, did not stay with that one one the turn and
gradually lost position two wide in the lane. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was shuffled back from tight quarters after the first sixteenth, taken to the outside, was
just off the rail through the bend, angled out five wide upper stretch and had little to offer. CHANGE DIRECTION was soon far back, picked up his pace after
two furlongs, swung out widest for the stretch run and leveled off.

Footnotes
COMISKEY PARK broke alertly, was challenged from inside nearing the end of the first eighth, drew clear when allowed on the bend, floated out some
entering the lane then gradually widened his lead under urging. PAPA ROCKET settled outside, picked up his pace just off the inside on the turn, rallied
between horses in the stretch, angled in inside the last sixteenth and caught D' YANK for second. D' YANK prominent from outside, advanced just off the rail
on the bend, swung outside COMISKEY PARK for the stretch run, moved clear for second, could not sustain his bid in the late going but was easily best of
the others. CRANKSHAFT lugged in some just after the start to bump with CHICKS FOR FREE, quickly recovered to display early speed from inside but
began to yield before finishing a half mile. CHICKS FOR FREE was bumped hard from both sides shortly after the break, steadied and was never a factor.
TONYS MORNING LINE showed little in a ground-saving trip. SNOOZER bumped solidly with CHICHS FOR FREE shortly after the start, pressed the early
pace but began to fade from path three on the turn.

Footnotes
AHEADOFTHEGAME broke somewhat slowly, was rushed up to keep his place along the rail into the first bend, shared the lead in hand on the backstretch,
moved clear when asked on the second turn, opened up under urging in the lane and kept YOU'RE IN COREY at bay under steady handling. YOU'RE IN
COREY was hustled and gradually angled in into the first turn, shared the lead outside AHEADOFTHEGAME, did not stay with that one on the second
bend, slowly drifted out in the stretch, held a straight path the final sixteenth, made up some minor ground on the leader in the waning yards and proved
easily second best. MKAR THE FAST was bumped solidly at the break, chased the top pair from just off the inside, gained a striking position on the second
bend, swung out widest for the stretch run and could only unchallenged for third. JULIAISON stumbled outward at the start, bumping solidly with MKAR THE
FAST, was checked briefly when her path was taken into the first turn and floated out some, chased from just off or along the rail and had no late bid.
ALLEN was soon well back and never a factor. The rider of JULIAISON lodged an objection alleging interference from YOU'RE IN COREY into the first turn.
After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

MY LITTLE TIPSY was quickly clear of the others, showed the way in hand from off the rail, was roused upper stretch, gradually lengthened command and
was kept to task to the wire. TAPIT SAM raced in contention from inside, went for the lead on the bend, was no match for MY LITTLE TIPSY when set down
for the drive but was unchallenged for the place. MADE TO FIT was checked midway on the backstretch when his path narrowed, progressed from inside on
the turn, fanned out entering the lane, altered outside BAM BAM CAM upper stretch and drew clear for third inside the final furlong. CITY POSITION helped
prompt the early pace while toward the outside, retreated some four wide on the bend, floated out further into the stretch and continued to fade. BAM BAM
CAM prominent between horses, took the turn three wide and also flattened out for the drive. PEACOCK MAN in contention early from outside, angled in
nearing the turn then began to yield two wide after three furlong. STOSH soon trailed from outside, angled in on the bend and had little to offer for the
stretch run. YABA DABA DOO was an early factor while boxed in on the backstretch, did not keep up into the turn, angled to the outside on the bend and
steadily gave way.
