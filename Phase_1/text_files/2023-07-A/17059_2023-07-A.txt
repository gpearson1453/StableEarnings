Footnotes
CUENCA set a pressured pace on the inside, drew clear leaving the three eighths while still in hand, then was given three pops right handed with the crop
leaving the furlong marker and drew off to prove much the best. BLIND SIGHT tracked the pace from the inside, shifted off the rail and tried to go with the
winner on the turn, but could not keep pace and proved to be no match for that rivals, second best. TERPEYE was settled early and two wide on the
backstretch, shifted out and made a four wide run on the turn, but had no late rally, bested rest. PSYCHE pressed the pace three to two wide and tired.

Footnotes
KAZ PALACE broke outwardly at the start, then recovered and was sent to the front to set a fast pace while clear, got to the inside and remained clear while
getting into a good rhythm on the backstretch, then was still clear off the turn, was given a pop left handed but drifted out from that, then was corrected with
a pop right handed and then moved back in, then widened the margin late despite being erratic in the lane to prove best. CRITICAL THINKING chased the
pace from between rivals on the fist turn, three wide on the turn and came four wide into tbe drive and was up for the place award. JUMP FOR THE WIN
chased the pace on the inside of a trio, then was two wide on the backstretch and advanced on the turn and came three wide into then drive but faded the
final furlong. TUSKEGEE CAT chased the pace on the outside and was four to five wide on the turn and tired.
