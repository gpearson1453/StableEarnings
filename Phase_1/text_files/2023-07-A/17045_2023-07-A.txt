MID KNIGHT FLASH broke alertly, maintained a narrow lead in the stretch, responded to urging in the final stages and held in a drive. WALK TO THE TOP
battled outside of rivals, had the winner in his sights to deep stretch, was outfinished in the final yards and held for second. DOLLYS TALENT chased the
leader to the sixteenth-marker, lacked the needed late response and was outkicked, while holding for third. TWO TIMIN TAYLOR broke a step slowly and
chased from the rear, managed to pass a rival in deep stretch but did not offer a late rally. THREE TIMES A LADY chased the leader to the
sixteenth-marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DUPLICATION broke alertly and took back to track the early pace while outside of rivals, raced close to the modest pace through the backstretch run, drifted
in a path entering the far turn and crowded EL JOY and in turn that one crowded COOPERKLIMT, took a narrow lead to the quarter marker, shook free into
upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. EL JOY was forwardly placed into the first turn and
prompted the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, raced between rivals heading to the far turn, was crowded entering the second turn when
DUPLICATION drifted in a path then in turn crowded COOPERKLIMT, battled with DUPLICATION to the furlong marker, lost ground to that rival into upper
stretch, chased through the lane and was outfinished, while holding safely for second. COOPERKLIMT hopped leaving the start, was away a step slowly
and was hustled to be forwardly placed into the first turn, assumed command into the backstretch run and set modest fractions while prompted to the
half-mile marker, was bothered by drifting rivals entering the far turn, took up midway through the far turn and was shuffled back approaching the quarter
pole, trailed into the stretch and lacked a late response. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING ON THE FAR TURN. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT DUPLICATION DRIFTED IN A PATH ENTERING THE FAR TURN, CAUSING EL JOY TO
DRIFT IN A PATH WHICH IN TURN CAUSED COOPERKLIMT TO STEADY MIDWAY AROUND THE TURN. DUPLICATION WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED THIRD.

MADAME GAZELLE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while pressed into the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter marker
while inside of DUST MAKER, re-engaged in upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong marker, dueled in the drive while holding a narrow
lead to deep stretch, dug in in the final sixteenth and determinedly held-off the runner-up. DUST MAKER chased to the inside of MADAME GAZELLE in the
early running then was steered to the outside of that rival and pressed that one through solid fractions into the turn, took a narrow lead along the turn, lost
that lead in upper stretch and battled MADAME GAZELLE to the furlong marker, steadily closed on MADAME GAZELLE and drew to even terms into deep
stretch but could not get by the game winner in the final strides and was denied for the win, while holding clearly for second. MATCHLESS broke a step
slowly leaving the start, chased the decent pace from the inside, swung to the four path for the stretch drive and did not offer a late rally.

LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was unhurried in the early stages, settled while inside of runners through the backstretch run, was roused leaving the
three-furlong pole and was steered to the three path nearing the top of the stretch, overtook MASHHAD FLATS in upper stretch and assumed command into
the drive, was kept to steady urging through the lane and pulled away in deep stretch to prevail. MASHHAD FLATS was hustled to establish the early lead,
set the pace into the backstretch run and carved out moderate fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, shook free into the far turn and angled to the
rail nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by LORD WIMBORNE into upper stretch, chased that rival to the furlong pole, could not impact the winner in
deep stretch and held well in the end to be second best. WILD WAGER settled in the three path in the early stages, was well placed while outside of rivals
along the backstretch run, maintained his position while not far back into the far turn, needed more in the stretch run, passed tiring rivals in the final stages
and was up in time to secure third. WALKING BOSS was away a step slowly and was rushed up to be close to the pace heading into the first turn, prompted
the moderate pace while outside of the pacesetter through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn and chased MASHHAD FLATS while two
wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the drive and gave way in the final furlong. ON RAGLAN ROAD was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked
the moderate fractions from the inside through the backstretch run, lost ground along the far turn, was outrun into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SIR GREYSON showed early speed and assumed command leaving the break, set a decent pace to the turn then quickened along the bend, drew to a
clear lead into upper stretch and drew off under mild hand urging to be much the best. SHARONA'S WILD BOY chased the fast pace while inside of rivals
into the turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and stayed on to best the rest. LESSONS OF AUTISM chased the fast pace from the rear, was
steered into the three path along the turn then came widest into the drive, was not able to impact the top two in the final furlong and passed tired rivals to
secure third. RESPOND chased the fast pace from the inside, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way. CHARBONNEAU was asked to show
early speed and stalked the fast pace while outside of SIR GREYSON into the turn, kept close attendance to the pace to the quarter marker, dropped back
in the stretch drive and tired late.

Footnotes
TABLE FOR TEN settled between runners into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back, gained ground along the second
turn while two wide then waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, angled three wide into the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong pole, came within
aim of his stablemate in deep stretch, overtook SHOT OF A LIFETIME in the final yards and kept to task at the end to prevail. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was
sent to establish the early lead and dictated terms into the first turn, ceded the lead to SUNNY SPOT into the backstretch run and stalked that foe to the
half-mile marker, battled for the lead with SUNNY SPOT along the far turn, took command approaching the quarter marker, drove to a clear lead at
mid-stretch, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, was all out in deep stretch and was caught in the final yards by TABLE FOR TEN, while clear at the finish
for second. TWIRLING DERBY settled outside of rivals in the early stages, was well placed through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn while four
then three wide, chased SHOT OF A LIFETIME to mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and was outkicked, while holding clearly for
third. HOUSE OF LORDS stalked outside of rivals along the first turn, raced close to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost ground while three
then four wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SUNNY SPOT was a bit slow into stride early on, recovered to be
forwardly placed into the first turn and prompted the pace into the backstretch run, made a middle move and assumed command at the five-furlong marker,
set the pace to the half-mile pole and battled for the lead with SHOT OF A LIFETIME along the far turn, could not keep pace into the drive and faded in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
BLAZING JAMIE broke well despite being bothered by REFI NOW from the inside stall, then was forced to check when squeezed near the
eleven-sixteenths pole, moved out to the three or four path for clear run down the backstretch, remained there through the turn, launched a rally with three
furlongs to run then swung out to the five path for the stretch run, continued to boldly rally and outfinished a stubborn rival just yards from the finish. OUR
BOLD PRINCE veered out at the start and made contact with SAINT IVES, got behind horses and was hard to place in the initial furlong then got clear and
surged to the front before the turn, held a clear lead through the turn, responded and quickened away from the field at the top of the stretch then was unable
to fend off the fast closing winner in the final yards. SAINT IVES bumped in the initial strides by OUR BOLD PRINCE from the inside, forced to race widest
down the backstretch, took the three path through the turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but began to tire but kept on gamely to hold third.
GRAZEN SUN raced close up in the early stages, stayed in the two path through the turn while chasing the pacesetters, struggled to keep up as the pace
quickened before the turn, responded to strong handling, swung three wide into the stretch then found some traffic trouble to mid-stretch, got clear too late
but kept to task well enough to gain some ground in the end. UNION WAVE broke best and seized the lead early on, was joined by OUR BOLD PRICE after
about a furlong, was unable to keep pace with that one through the turn, stayed on the rail into the stretch and finished evenly. REFI NOW broke out at the
start forcing the two horses in the adjacent stalls to alter course a bit, started to make some forward progress before the turn then was stuck and forced to
idle behind horses, lost momentum and never recovered.

ALMOST SNOW broke alertly and established the early lead, set a pressured pace to the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out quick fractions to
the quarter marker, was confronted by SLEW'S JOY in upper stretch, held a narrow lead over that rival to mid-stretch, continued to battle with SLEW'S JOY
to the final sixteenth, put away the runner-up in deep stretch and drove clear to prevail in a good debut. SLEW'S JOY raced close to the fast early pace
while outside of rivals, gained ground on the turn while two then three wide, confronted ALMOST SNOW in upper stretch and battled with that rival to the
furlong marker, continued to fight back while outside of ALMOST SNOW into the final sixeenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and
was outkicked, while besting the rest. KERRY GOLD chased from the second flight in the early stages, raced outside of rivals along the turn, could not keep
pace with the top pair in the stretch run and weakened, while holding safely for third. GODSEND raced close to the early pace while inside of rivals, lost
ground on the turn, was coaxed along two wide into the stretch drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. AMERICAN EMPIRE was off a bit slowly and
chased the quick pace from the rear, came two wide into the stretch drive and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. TOWN PERFORMER stumbled then
lost his path at the start and was off slowly, chased inside of rivals into the turn, came two wide for the drive and did not threaten. BANGS pressed the fast
early pace from the inside, came a bit in tight approaching the turn, checked nearing the three-furlong pole and lost position heading to the quarter marker,
raced two wide into the stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. RAYS REGAL lacked early speed, saved ground to the
quarter marker and did not factor.
