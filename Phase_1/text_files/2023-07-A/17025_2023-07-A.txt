Footnotes
ZUPITA was off to an alert start, hustled out to a long lead, continued to be well clear through the turn and into the lane, was urged two times into the lane
then was ridden out through the final eighth. SNUGGLER chased the winner while along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two or
three path then continued to chase to the wire while slowly gaining and finishing clearly second best. BAND OF ROSES was in a bit tight down the
backstretch, continued in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was up for the show spot.
MRSINATRAGLORYLADY trailed through the turn while in the two path, angled into the seven path for the drive and gained belatedly. TWIRLING JUSTICE
was three wide through the turn and into the lane then weakened. PUMPITUPJUSTICE was near the inside through the turn when in mid-pack, came into
the lane from the three path and tired. NEVER TO MANY HUGS was in the three to the two path through the turn when in contention then was empty
turning into the lane. SHES MY TREASURE was jostled near the five-eighths pole, raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five
path and lacked an impact.

Footnotes
TERRANOVA moved to a clear lead soon after the start, continued to slowly widened when under minimal encouragement, was asked for more into the
lane then drew away. SIMPLY COMPLICATED chased the pace along the inside through the turn, came off the inside and into the three path for the drive,
could not gain on the top one but stayed on well to win the place duel. MIDNIGHT GRIND chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid from the
four path into the lane, dueled with another for the place spot while not gaining on the winner and settled for the minor share. ISABEL DE CLARE was never
a threat while in the two path through the turn and into the lane. A STAR FOR CORA was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and moved up
while never a menace. ZIPPIN PIPPIN chased the pace from the four path into the lane, was asked for more when straightening and was empty. MAJESTIC
DIAMOND was outrun while along the inside. UNCOMMON GRACE was in the three to the two path through the turn and and steadily lost ground.

BECAUSE THE NIGHT dueled outside of the leader, bid at the top of the stretch and drew off to be ridden out for the win. YAQUI VALLEY dueled inside but
couldn't match strides in the drive. SUGA STEVE was off awkwardly, stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered in the stretch.
MOONLIGHT JOKER was bumped at the start, stalked the pace inside but faded on the far turn.

the end to hold. IRISH TAP pressed the early pace two wide into the turn, settled off the pace through late turn, came into the lane from the three or four
path then rallied and just missed. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE bid four wide through the turn to get near the lead, made the lead into the lane, cleared outside
the eighth pole then yielded to the winner and just lost the place spot at the wire. TATTERED HEART pressed the pace three wide through the turn, came
into the lane from the four path then lacked a closing response. MILK MONEY raced three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
offered a mild gain. DARE ME raced in the two path through the turn when near the back, straightened in the lane from the seven path and finished evenly.
DR. BELLA saved ground into the lane and offered a belated gain. FREDERICIA was bumped at the start, raced in the two path through the turn and into
the lane and showed late energy while not a factor. SISTER SAINT was in the three path through the turn, came seven wide into the lane and never was a
factor. COOL CAROL set the pace into the lane then gave way along the rail.

Footnotes
BARN STORMER vied for the lead two wide into mid-turn, cleared soon after, continued on a clear advantage while in the four path into the lane, then
widened through the final eighth. RACING IN MY HEART chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path with
aim on the winner, could not gain on that one and geared down late while clearly second best. JACK THE BIRD saved ground throughout and moved up for
the show spot along the rail. RUNNING SMART raced in the four or five path through mid-turn, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths pole, swung into
the lane from the six path, could not gain while finishing on even terms for the show spot. GRAY MIKE was in the two path through the turn when in
mid-pack then lacked a closing bid. INEEDRELIEF raced near the inside through mid-turn, angled into the four path into the lane and improved position.
SAN RONIN was off awkwardly while breaking out and steadying, raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up while never a
menace. TRYGVE in the three or four path through the turn and tired after entering the lane. SWITCHBACKJUSTICE vied for the lead into the turn then
retreated along the inside. AMERIGOROUND was outrun while off the inside.
