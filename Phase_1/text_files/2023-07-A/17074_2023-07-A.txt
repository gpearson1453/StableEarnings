Footnotes
SPEEDY LYNN stalked on the rail near the rear down the backstretch, angled outside circling runners with five sixteenths remaining, continued to pass foes
seven deep straightening out for the drive finding her best stride in mid stretch and drew away comfortably at the finish. A GAL FOR T J broke out at the
start, tracked in the middle of the pack between runners two off the fence with five eighths to run, rallied six wide at the quarter marker, lost path in lane four
at the furlong pole, switched outside and closed to just get up for the runners up share crossing the line. VERY SAVVY was brushed inside at the break,
tracked the pacesetter three wide outside throughout the turn, assumed the lead turning for home in the three path, was headed outside in upper stretch and
battled inside holding for the show award at the end. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH travelled on the rail in mid field down the back straight, stalked inside
unhurried through the turn, commenced a run slipping up the fence then shifted out four deep at the top of the stretch to bid for the front, stalled in deep
stretch and had to settle for a minor role in the end. FORESTERS PRINCESS was in a good position tracking the early leader in the two path into the turn,
was urged left handed three furlongs from home, offered little response and made no impact driving to the wire. HALO STYLE broke outwards to begin,
settled in midpack four deep down the backstretch, stalked four well outside runners throughout the turn making little advance and could not be a factor in
the stretch run. CEDAR VALLEY hopped at the start trailing down the backside, shifted outside at the half mile marker, was fanned out to the eight path
straightening out for the stretch run and could not reach contention running to the wire. NADIABIZNIZ took command from the start, continued to dictate the
pace on the turn, was collared at the top of the lane and backed away on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HULLABALOO took control from the start to clear the field into the first turn, was left alone unchallenged down the backside, scooted for home at the top of
the lane and had enough left in reserve to hold safe at the wire. CANYOUHEARMENOW was nestled on the rail keeping a close eye on the leader down the
backstretch in the second flight, took up the chase going after the lone pacesetter two furlongs from the finish, could not close the gap on the winner through
the stretch and had to settle for second best on this day. JMR PURE SENSATION hopped at the break to trail the field down the back straight, waited inside
behind runners on the final turn, continued to save ground turning for home and offered a late sustained run on the fence to capture third in the end.
OCTOBER FROST travelled in the middle of the pack on the fence with a half mile to go, waited on the rail when the field bunched up three furlongs from
the wire, had clear run in the two path at the top of the lane and finished up to hold for a small share in the end. JUST START ME UP hopped at the start but
recovered inside to chase the pace in the beginning, was asked for run between horses to try to reel in the loose front runner midway on the far turn, could
not find more and levelled out five wide through the stretch drive. BOX N SCORE was away slowly to begin, travelled near the rear outside at the half mile
marker, offered a brief turn of foot circling around foes three furlongs from the finish and was only one paced in the stretch drive to the finish. TOURIST'S
DREAM settled four wide in the mid pack in the early stages of the race, rallied four deep three furlongs from the prize, was fanned widest five wide at the
top of the stretch and came up empty for the drive to the wire. INFAMOUS COVERT stalked four wide on the first turn, settled near the rear three deep
between foes at the half, offered a mild run when roused three furlongs from home until the quarter pole and had little to show in the stretch drive.
COPINSAY tracked between runners two wide into the first turn, was ridden to keep position with rivals on either side at the three eighths pole and gave
way midpoint on the final turn.

Footnotes
KID FORESTER was forced out a bit at the break then taken back and shifted in, raced in behind the leaders off the pace, lacked room about the
five-sixteenths, angled out coming past the quarter pole, came into upper stretch eight wide and full of run, drifted in a bit, struck the lead just past the
sixteenth pole and cleared. BIG INVESTMENT moved quickly to the front and clear dictating the pace in hand and racing inside, opened up on the turn,
began to shorten stride in the stretch, was no match for the winner but held second. BOKERMIN settled at the back racing off the inside, fanned nine wide
coming out of the turn, finished very well and willingly but was gaining too late. EXECUTIVE GIANT stalked from outside just off the leaders, advanced
outside the second group four to five wide on the turn, came out a bit turning into upper stretch, evened out. CHELSEA DAGGER came out just a bit at the
start, was forwardly-placed stalking in behind, switched outside a foe into the turn going three wide on that bend and advancing some, put to a drive about
the quarter pole, went evenly in the stretch. DR CHAPPELL raced between foes mid-pack into the turn going three to four wide, failed to rally.
AWESOMECREST broke a half-step slowly, advanced inside near the half under encouragement to get within range of the leader, given more stout urging
early on the turn, faltered and faded. TARADAR stalked within close range and shifting in, put to urging between runners two wide late on the turn, faltered
and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ARKLE was in a good spot on the turn not too far of the front group, started to close the gap on the leaders six wide at the three sixteenths pole,
had clear run and wore down rivals in deep stretch to narrowly prevail at the finish. NIKOLAOU was relaxed near the back of the field on the rail on the turn,
rallied inside to be in range of the leaders turning for home, had nowhere to go behind tiring frontrunners in upper stretch, finally found a seam shifting out
five wide at the eighth pole and closed strongly to just miss in the end. BAJAN BULLET was bumped outside on the break, regrouped to have a good
position watching the top threesome on the turn, took command four wide at the three sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly very late to be a clear third
at the wire. HARDWARE GAP brushed foe at the start, advanced smartly inside with three furlongs remaining, had clear run on the fence at the top of the
lane to be in the hunt at the furlong marker and evened out in deep stretch. BE LIKE CLINT was brushed at the start, trailed the field down the backside and
through the turn, still could see most of the field when straightening out for the stretch drive and had good energy to put in a solid closing run to the finish.
COLLABORATIVE stalked near the back of the field, continued to save ground inside on the turn and showed some late interest in mid stretch to pass tired
runners. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ stalked at the back of the pack three deep outside horses in the beginning, angled out widest in the nine path two
furlongs from the wire and finished evenly outside runners in the late stages. MUSKOKA GIANT settled four deep in mid pack down the backside, could not
make any headway on the leaders running on the turn, shifted out six wide for the drive but could not get involved driving to the finish line. GUNGI bumped
on the break, regrouped quickly to prompted the pace in the early going, tracked the frontrunner on the turn, bid three wide turning for home and retreated
between runners in the final furlong. LAKE SHORE DRIVE took the field down the back straight, opened up mildly on the chasers running on the turn, was
collared outside with three sixteenths to go and tired inside at the furlong marker. CONFUSING sat three deep just off the contesting pair down the
backstretch, continued to track in third throughout the turn, was in the mix for a share four wide at the top of the lane and stopped in mid stretch. ETHNIC
SOUL stalked near the back in the early stages, was roused but lost ground inside to rivals throughout the turn and could not pass any horses in the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
AIM FOR THE SKY broke sharply and quickly cleared to set the pace, soon faced pressure by an outside foe into the turn, shook free of that one past the
quarter pole, met the challenge of a rival in upper- to mid-stretch, held from that one. EMICRACK (CHI) got away well, settled in behind the eventual winner
tracking that one racing just off the rail, came out at the top of the stretch for room, loomed a threat in upper stretch, drifted out through mid- to late-stretch,
kept on late to be second best. WESTERN TROUBLE settled at the rear racing off the rail, lacked room and altered outside rivals past the quarter pole
eventually having to go ten deep by the top of the stretch, finished up well to be gaining but far too late. SIR SEAMUS hopped into the gate, advanced
outside foes three to four wide into and on the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. RED RIVER REBEL settled off the pace racing two wide into the turn and
moving four wide late on that bend, came out wider still for the drive, bumped with a tiring rival near the furlong marker, ran on. SUNSPEAR chased from
inside, came off the rail leaving the turn, failed to menace. ABOVE PAR was off the early leader then advanced rapidly to press the pacesetter and eventual
winner coming to the seven-sixteenths, began to drop back at the quarter pole, drifted out leaving the turn, was bumped near the eighth pole while
continuing to weaken and faded. HAPPYMAC raced outside off the pace four to five deep through the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
MT LOGAN was reined back inside off the early pace duel at the half, rallied when splitting runners three eighths from the finish, loomed the threat four wide
straightening out for the stretch drive and finished strongly to comfortably hold on to the win at the wire. SOUPER SUNSHINE prompted outside entering the
turn, bore out with five sixteenths to run, was eight wide at the top of the lane and re-rallied to close in for second money to best the rest. GRAND
AMBITION broke outwards on the break, was bumped repeatedly to start to be near the rear down the backstretch, advanced smartly on the rail through the
turn, sat behind horses looking for room turning for home, finally found a seam on the fence one hundred yards from the finish and closed in to capture third
in gritty overall performance. OLD BLUE CLIFF was bumped around between horses on the start to be near the rear leaving the chute, recovered to be
behind the leaders at the half but was a little headstrong, was roused two furlongs from the wire and determinedly finished up to close in for a minor share in
the end. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW broke in on rivals at the start, took command with a half mile remaining, opened up mildly on the field with five sixteenths to
go, was inside still clinging onto the lead in mid stretch and tired nearing the wire to lose positions late. SO CALLED VACATION settled outside in midfield in
the early stages, could not keep up with others through the turn and was one paced in the stretch drive. AMAZON FORESTER pressed the issue inside four
furlongs from home, lost some position on the rail running through the turn, did not give up and battled between inside through the stretch and lost his path
nearing the wire. SECRET STORM chased behind the frontrunner outside midway on the turn, bid for the lead just outside with a quarter to run and yielded
in the three path in mid stretch. MARTEN STORM was slow breaking from the gate, caught up to the field by the half mile marker, continued to keep pace
with rivals on the turn, was in the mix for a small share behind horses turning for home and levelled out at the furlong pole. DANCIN' DEPUTY stalked near
the rear down the backstretch, was shuffled to last with three furlongs to run and was not a factor running to the finish. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE was
pinballed between rivals to start, steadied sharply leaving the chute to trail the field and could not recover to be involved after that poor beginning.

Footnotes
CLASSY WHISPER raced toward the back off the inside, swung eight wide turning for home, took aim, struck the lead a sixteenth out while driving clear
late. HUNT MASTER tracked from inside, came out three to four wide through upper stretch just off the leader, took over by the furlong marker, was in turn
overtaken a sixteenth out and second best. REPEAT THE HEAT tracked mid-pack off the inside going in the three to four path on the turn, kept on in the
stretch to get show honors. POINT TO THE STARS lacked early speed trailing inside, shifted out eight wide at the top of the stretch, kicked on mildly.
FOREST BUZZ dueled inside foe but off the fence heading into the turn, edged away to a narrow lead for part of that bend, was challenged again past the
five-sixteenths, kept on till mid-stretch then faded. UNCLE JOE settled off the pace, advanced through the turn while moving out from three to six wide,
evened out in the stretch. SOONER LUNAR was reshod in the paddock, broke well to be prominent between runners early then taken back and switched
out to pursue the dueling leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. TEMPO MADNESS dueled outside a rival three wide heading to the
turn, lost some ground then re-engaged to again draw nearly even late on the turn, could not sustain the effort, faltered and faded. SOUPED UP raced near
the inside toward the back, was never a threat.

ABSOLUTE JEWEL battled between runners for the front at the start, was then taken back to sit off the contesting leaders at the five eighths marker, was
scrubbed on inside with five sixteenths to go, loomed the threat four deep at the top of the lane and wore down the frontrunning rival in deep stretch for the
win. HOT OMELET broke outwards to begin, dueled three wide for the lead down the backside, put away fellow pace rival midway on the turn, had a narrow
lead at the furlong marker and fought on to the wire just missing out for the victory in the end. CLIFF'S HEAD stalked in the two path near the rear into the
turn, was gaining steadily outside around horses two furlongs from the finish, was in contention five wide at the top of the lane but stalled late while holding
for the show award. ZIPPITY DAY was bumped soundly outside at the break to trail in the early stages, caught up to the field at the half, continued to pick
up horses inside through the turn, angled four wide at the quarter marker and determinedly was closing to the wire to be in for a share at the finish in a gritty
effort. MANITOULIN ISLAND was unhurried to be near the back of the field three wide down the backside, made little impression running on the turn and
showed some late energy between rivals driving to the finish line. GOLDEN TRAIN had the early lead after the start, was then in a chasing role down the
back straight, was hard ridden inside to keep up with the frontrunner at the five sixteenths marker and gave way on the fence in the final furlong. ITS A
BIRDIE settled near the rear on the rail with four furlongs remaining, could not get interested when coaxed on the turn, could see the field turning for home
and passed weary runners in the stretch drive. MERITAMEN broke in at the start, had a good position outside tracking the top three down the backstretch,
offered a mild run three deep with five sixteenths to go and stopped in mid stretch with runners on either side. JUNGLE TIGRESS tracked in the middle of
the pack on the rail down the backstretch, offered a mild run taking closer order to the top duo midpoint on the turn and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ASHBURY stalked in the two path near the rear when the field was bunching into the backstretch at the eleven sixteenths marker, relaxed kindly between
horses down the back straight, offered a bold move bursting between rivals two furlongs from home and was full of run in the stretch to draw away when
crossing the finish line. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL settled in the middle of the field five deep into the first turn, was under a snug hold outside four wide entering the
backstretch, was let out a notch to engage for the lead outside at the half, sat just outside off the contesting leaders on the far turn, pounced to the front
turning for home but could not find more to hold off the fast closing winner in deep stretch. ALBERTA BE MINE was off slow at the start, had a good inside
position with four furlongs left to run, followed the path set by the winner at the quarter pole and lengthened stride at the top of the lane to close in and be a
clear third at the finish line. WAR'S END KISS was bumped on the break, sat just behind the top pair at the half, was nudged on for more midway on the far
turn, was in a tight spot between horses in upper stretch, had to wait momentarily at the furlong marker and had clear run late to get up for a minor share.
BITTERSWEETBIZNESS was hustled for the lead inside taking the field into the first turn, was headed outside by runners at the half, battled stubbornly
holding onto the front through the far turn, was collared straightening out for the drive and levelled out in deep stretch. REINS OF PURPLE was fanned six
wide into the first turn, advanced outside runners four or five deep down the backside, continued to gain on the leaders outside while widest in the final turn,
was in with a chance for a share at the top of the lane and still willingly drove to the wire to be involved for the minors in the end. SMARTY ILLUSION was
unhurried early to see the field into the first turn, settled near the rear with a half left to run, shifted out six wide for the drive to the line and was one paced
thru the lane. GOLD FORESTER chased the leader in the early stages, bid for the lead two wide with runners on either side at the quarter marker and faded
in mid stretch. TENPENNY NAIL was bumped on the break to be last two wide into the first turn, continued to see the field down the backside and passed
stragglers in the stretch run. NORTHERN PASSAGE tracked three wide into the first turn, could not maintain position three deep between runners at the
half, was hard ridden on the final turn and was a non factor in the late stages. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was fighting the rider on the rail when trying to relax
behind the leaders into the backstretch, continued to be eager inside at the half mile marker, could not keep pace with horses through the far turn on the
fence and was empty for the stretch run.
