unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three wide for racing room, made a steady gain, dueled
with the winner late and hung. UPPITY UP allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and closed
well for the show. CAPPY tracked the pace well back, moved up and angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, then weakened the final furlong and
held a share. DENIECE OF DEGRACE mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, drifted in into the stretch and faded. CEREAL I D well placed and
outside, angled in and lost some ground through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. SHE'D RATHER DANCE pulled to a clear lead soon after the
start, then faded through the second turn.

ahead late and held. LOVELY EVER AFTER allowed to settle, moved up inside through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and lacked the needed late kick. AZTEC PRINCESS well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the

field early, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened and held a share. LIGHTNING ROUND rated close up, lost some ground two and three wide
through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. BOURBON BLAST well placed and outside, lost position four wide through the second turn, angled in

Footnotes
OUTHUSTLE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off under mild urging.
YARDMAN bumped at the start, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and closed well for the place.
TWELVETWO mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and got up for the show. KENJI'S EMPIRE well
placed and inside, angled out and moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. DOUBLE WARRIOR
set the pace off the rail, angled in and stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. CHANGE THE HOUR
well placed, lost some ground inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. PITON well placed, steadily lost
ground. POINT LOMA broke out, bumping a rival at the start, then improved position outside. BLOWN OUT void of speed, looped four wide through the turn,
angled widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. YANKEE TEA PARTY well placed and inside, held position two and three wide through the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. SEA CRUISE was never involved.
