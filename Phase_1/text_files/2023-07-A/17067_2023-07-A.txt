MINNESOTA MOON stalked the pace, assumed command into the turn, drew off for a long lead and held well. ICE AXE broke awkwardly to be off slowly,
was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied around the turn, bid five wide, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. REGIMENTAL was taken
back from between horses into the backstretch, bid inside leaving the turn, was impeded and checked mid stretch, continued willingly and held for show.
MERLOTTI raced in hand along the inside, was steadied slightly on the backstretch, fell back, angled out, bid in traffic, was impeded and checked mid
stretch, angled out and closed with good energly. EIGHT MAY set the pace, tired into the turn, stopped and had an uneven course in the stretch drive.
GONE AGAIN held a good position, had nothing left for the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
HURTS SO BAD set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held well. CHEEKERS was reluctant to load, chased the pace throughout and
finished second best in a steady effort. MODIFIER raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid five wide and finished well to earn show. MEMPHIS
PRAYER raced six wide along the backstretch, dropped inside, offered a mild bid mid track and improved position. PINBALLER bumped at the start, raced
mid pack, bid along the rail on the turn to get within range and came up empty late. TEA AFTER BALLET bumped at the start, was never far back along the
inside, tired into the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
HELEN MAE'S SONG pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, inched away and just lasted. ARCH FLYER pressed the pace along the inside,
shifted out on the turn, bid six wide, closed willingly, was gaining late and outnodded to just miss. GHAALEB'S MAGIC raced close to the pace along the
inside, angled out for the drive, bid seven wide, closed steadily and was gaining late. TAP N TWINE was slow early, saved ground, bid inside on the turn
and lacked the needed late response. APOLLO U ANYWHERE set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel, was unable to sustain her bid
and lost position. HER GOLD MINE stalked the pace, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. AUNT STELLA was outrun in an even
effort. MI CRESCENDO trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
KATIE M'LADY was sent to the front to set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead under mild urging. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD raced close to the
pace along the inside, bid along the rail on the turn, battled for place and was no match for the winner. SUMMER DAY stalked the pace, bid between horses
on the turn to loom a threat, had little left for the drive and settled for show. WHITE LIES pressed the pace to the second turn and flattened out. COWGIRL
FRANKIE was steadied into the backstretch, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. WAY TOO SMARTE was outrun in an even effort.

Footnotes
SANTINO'S FANTASY pressed the pace along the inside, fell back into the turn, rallied inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly, was
bumped mid stretch and drew off. LIMA ZULU pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, angled in for the drive, was no threat to the winner and just lasted for
place. DASTARDLY DEEDS broke slowly, rallied on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was outnodded for second. SUNDAY MISCHIEF set a
pressured pace, drew clear on the turn, bore out mid stretch while tiring, bumped and dropped back. MASQUERADE BALL dropped inside to save ground,
lacked a bid and was not a threat. LAMELO broke slowly, raced mid pack, was through early and dropped back. ROUGH JUSTICE was not a factor.
STORM APPROACHING was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
ROCKET HOSS set the pace, had the rider lose his whip in the upper stretch and held well in a driving finish. A P BLAZING GREEN chased inside, angled
out on the turn, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and finished second best. MANEUVER was slow early, bid three wide entering the stretch, drifted
out under left handed urging and closed to earn show. FAST FORWARD stalked the pace towards the outside, weakened in the drive and faded. ROCKET
MAN ATTACK stalked the pace while racing between horses, was in tight, steadied and gave way. FROSTED TEMPTATION raced mid pack inside, swung
out entering the stretch and lacked a bid. FLYING CRICKET broke slowly, trailed the field and failed to contend.
