Footnotes
JOAN'S WAY stalked the two rival duel into the turn, bid three wide in late turn, moved to near even terms with the leader with an eighth to travel then
inched up late. MONTGOMERY PARK pressed the pace two wide through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path with the lead, was joined
by the top one, dueled with that one to inside the sixteenth pole and yielded. BLOW SUM SMOKE raced along the inside through the turn, moved off the
inside when passing and brushing with a tiring rival, continued into the two path while dueling for the show spot and prevailed for the minor share while
inching up on the top ones. Z ZS RED was two wide through the turn and into the lane, was in the three path near the sixteenth pole when slowing gaining
and just missing the show spot. WILD TAPIT was three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, moved to loomed a threatening third
inside the eighth pole then flattened out late. SOUTHERN SMILE vied for the lead along the inside to the quarter pole then was empty turning into the lane.

OFFSHORE TITHE pressed the early pace in the three path, took back at the three-quarters mark, rallied on the far turn, was floated out slightly coming into
the stretch, dueled outside a rival and prevailed under steady urging. SMALL SAILOR bore out at the start, was clear early, lugged out entering the stretch,
dueled inside of the winner and was outfinished. GJALLARHORN was off awkwardly and was impeded at the start, then had no late bid. SUPER LIAISON
raced in the three path, giving way in the stretch. PEDRO O'TOOLE raced inside and was no factor.

Footnotes
RIBALDRY (IRE) chased the pace from the three path, bid into the lane from the three path, caught the leader with an eighth to go then drove past.
HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS unhurried into the far turn, raced in the three path when gaining momentum into the lane, settled into the four path for the drive
then moved up for the place spot while never a threat to the winner. HAPPY SAILS set the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane, could
not go with the winner but stayed on to be clear for the show spot. SPLIT DECISION bobbled entering the first turn when near the inside, continued along
the temporary rail through the backstretch and into the far turn, was still a contender into the lane but lacked a closing kick while moving into the three or
four path late. LONG BLACK VEIL raced along the inside while near the back into and through the far turn, was checked when running up on tiring rival into
the lane then moved up while not a threat. LIGEIA in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the five path and never
was a factor. MORNING ANGEL trailed into the far turn, was checked and taken out when rival also checked outward, raced in the six path through the lane
and never was a menace. PERTINACIOUS TIZ chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then was empty in late turn.

VOW pressed the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole and drew off late under a mild hand ride. PHILOGYNY STREET led between foes but then
couldn't hold off the winner. SEACHROME broke outward, bumping a rival, pressed the early pace in the three path, then had no late bid. KALL KAT was
bumped at the start, then bumped another rival, pressed the pace inside, but faded in the stretch. ALL THAT was bumped at the start, loomed four wide on
the turn but faltered. WICKED ECSTASY stalked the early pace inside, then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
RIVER REDEMPTION chased the four rival duel into the far turn while in the three path, swept past five wide in late turn and into the lane, quickly cleared
when straightening and was kept to the task to hold. GRACEFUL KITTEN raced near the rail into the far turn, came off the inside and into the four path in
late turn, waited for the winner into the lane, tipped into the five path and was gaining on the top one while clearly second best. CELERITY raced in the two
path through the turn and into the lane, split rivals just inside the eighth pole and moved up to be best of the rest. MISS GOODBAR trailed for three-quarters
while near the inside, angled to the seven path while gaining momentum and made up some ground belatedly. BIG PAPER was off to an awkward start,
raced two wide through the far turn, angled into the sixth path and moved up while never a threat. EVIL EYE stalked the pace from the four path into the
turn, bid four wide through the turn and into the lane, was a serious threat into the lane then faded. COUNT FROST pressed the pace two wide and between
rivals through the far turn then faded once straightened in the lane. BARRISTER TOM vied for the lead two wide and between rivals through the far turn and
was empty turning into the lane. PADDY'S HOUSE near the back while three wide through the far turn and tired. BRIT'S WIT vied for the lead along the
inside of three rivals into the far turn then gave way approaching the lane.

THE KID PATAKY pressed the pace in the three path, bore out to the ten path entering the stretch, hesitated while trying to get right, then rallied and
prevailed under steady urging. RAFAELLA was unrushed early, rallied four wide in early stretch, led late but was caught. J'S NAUGHTY KITTEN stalked the
early pace in the four path, then gave way late. MARTZ ROSEY was bumped hard at the start, then bid belatedly in the five path. RUSHIN LUCY led briefly
between foes, then gave way in the stretch. PRIMROSE GIRL stalked early inside foes, then faded. EURCOOL faded. ROSAS FOR LUZ pressed the early
pace before steadying at the three-eighths. CASHMERE JUSTICE stalked the early pace between foes, saved ground, then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
NICHOLAS JONES raced well back while in the three path into the turn, quickly in late turn while moving through the four to the six path, swung into the
lane in the five or sixth path, caught the leaders near the sixteenth pole and edged past. GUNOE chased the pace from two path through the turn, bid into
the lane, dueled for the lead with an eighth to go, was no match for the closing winner then was all out to the wire to hold the place spot. BOCO was three
wide through the turn, came into the lane while in the three path, dueled with the leader inside the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on
well to just miss the place spot. AKAMAI set the pace on a clear lead through the far turn, dueled for the lead with an eighth to go then gave way. CLASSIC
CUT raced in the two path through the far turn, appeared to have energy when moving up behind a wall of rivals, got free just inside the eighth pole then
lacked a response. FASTBYTE was unhurried while off the inside, angled into the seven path into the lane then offered a belated effort. DIGITAL
SOFTWARE hustled up along the inside into the far turn, was a threat in mid-turn then flattened in the lane. BUCKTOWN was along the inside throughout
and never factored. TOPF ROAD RULES chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was three wide in late turn when a contender then tired. FEVER
TEMPLE trailed throughout while off the inside.

Footnotes
INSOLITO was clear early and lasted under mild urging. BEST OF GREELEY saved ground, then bid late outside of the winner to be second best. ONE
FOR RICHIE stalked the pace in the three path but lacked a late bid. A FEW TOO MANY raced evenly between rivals. OVERLY D'ORO took back at the
start, then saved ground. EL ROSILLO pressed the early pace in the five path before fading. NOBLE REALITY (FR) stalked the early pace inside and then
gave way in the stretch.
