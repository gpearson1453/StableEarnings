furlong marker and pulled away. MADAME MISCHIEF stalked outside, was forced wide entering the turn, advanced at the quarter pole, came four wide into
the lane and rallied for second. GOLD ALLIANCE showed good early speed to set the pace, drifted in crowding MOMMA KIM causing that rival to clip heels,
then inherited a clear lead, dug in to midstretch and weakened. VICTORIA'S DANCER was off slowly, steadied entering the turn, came three wide into the
lane and closed well late. BYRD OF EDEN raced two wide off the pace, steadied entering the turn, then chased and closed belatedly inside. SYMPHONYS
