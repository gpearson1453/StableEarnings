Footnotes
MIGHTY MATT settled off of the solid early pace, advanced while well placed on the turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, confronted HAWK HILL
nearing the furlong marker, collared that rival and took command into the final stages, was kept to task under steady late urging and drove clear in deep
stretch. SASQUATCH RIDE was unhurried in the early running, saved ground through the turn, rallied three wide in the drive, could not impact the winner in
the final sixteenth and won the nod for second on the wire. HAWK HILL broke alertly and showed good early speed, carved out solid fractions to the quarter
marker, came under pressure from MIGHTY MATT nearing the furlong pole, could not go on with the winner in the final furlong, weakened in deep stretch
and was just edged for second, while well clear for third. RUNNING ON EMPTY chased the solid pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not
offer a late rally. TIZ A THRILL chased the fast early pace, raced in the three path while in pursuit of the pacesetter along the turn, could not keep pace into
the drive and tired.

Footnotes
ASANO'S BACK stumbled at the start and was away slowly, chased the moderate pace to the turn, gained ground while inside of rivals nearing the quarter
marker, was steered to the three path into the drive and continued to advance approaching the furlong marker, wore down foes in the final sixteenth, reeled
in DR PESCADO in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. DR PESCADO broke alertly then took back to track the pacesetter into the turn,
pressed OBVIOUS along the turn while outside of that rival, took command leaving the furlong marker and was set down in upper stretch, held foes at bay
to the sixteenth-marker, felt late pressure from ASANO'S BACK and was overtaken in the final strides, while holding safely for second. EXTRA INNINGS
tracked the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, matched strides with ASANO'S BACK to the furlong marker, was
outkicked in the final sixteenth and held safely at the finish for third. SURPRISE FASHION chased from the rear, saved ground along the turn, mounted a
two wide bid heading to mid-stretch, could not sustain that bid in the final stages and finished evenly. OBVIOUS was sent to establish the early lead and
dictated terms into the turn, was pressed along the turn by DR PESCADO, could not keep pace into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

CITY GLITTER raced close to the early pace, advanced to press the pace along the turn and took command nearing the quarter marker, drove to a clear
lead approaching mid-stretch, had her margin cut into a bit by the closing runner-up but kept to task in the final stages and remained clear to the finish.
AUSTRIAN NAVY chased the decent early pace while between rivals, raced two wide into the turn, was steered to the rail midway through the turn and took
the path of DON'T TELL HYDEE, chased CITY GLITTER to mid-stretch, was able to close into that rival's margin in the final furlong but was outkicked and
bested the rest. JACRODRA'S DEVIL bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the decent early pace and raced outside of rivals into the turn,
gained ground while four wide nearing the quarter marker and came within aim nearing the top of the stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair in the
drive and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for third. PROOF OF JAZZ showed early speed and set the decent pace into the turn, was pressed
along the bend and lost the lead to CITY GLITTER nearing the quarter marker, chased the leaders into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. DON'T
TELL HYDEE chased the decent pace from the inside, took up when AUSTRIAN NAVY took her path midway through the turn, lost contact into the drive,
gave way in the stretch and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
BEACHGRASS was unhurried in the early going and tracked the pace while inside of runners through the backstretch run, advanced from the two path
along the far turn then slipped to the rail into upper stretch, rallied approaching mid-stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong pole, took command inside of
the furlong marker, was kept to moderate late urging and drove clear under hand urging in the final stages. FEELING FLUSH was sent to establish the early
pace, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure from
BEACHGRASS at mid-stretch, could not hold that rival off and chased into the final stages, was kept to task under steady late urging and held well for
second in the final strides. PRANCIN N THE PARK settled outside of rivals in the early stages, made a middle move and came within aim nearing the
half-mile pole, took back and chased the leaders while four wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a mild late rally in the final sixteenth and
just missed for second while getting up in the final strides to secure third. OAT MILK LATTE settled just off of the early pace, was well placed while saving
ground through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground while inside of rivals on the far turn, advanced in the stretch drive, lacked the needed late response,
was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for the minor awards. LYINATTHEBAR was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, lost ground while three wide on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. SHEZA QUEEN
BEE chased the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, ran in pursuit through the backstretch run, trailed to the quarter marker while coaxed along in

Footnotes
CLEAR THE COAST was sent to establish the early lead and set a decent pace into the turn, rated nicely along the bend and showed the way to the quarter
marker while maintaining a comfortable lead, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, drew away in the final stages and was hand ridden to the finish. HALF
THROTTLE broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to chase the pace to the turn while outside of rivals, angled inside entering the bend
and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, came in tight and was boxed in nearing the top of the stretch, found room in upper stretch, was not able to
make headway on the winner in the final furlong and ran on in deep stretch to be best of the rest. I'LL SMOKEM chased from the second flight, raced
outside of rivals along the turn and came four wide for the stretch drive, was not able to impact the top pair in the late stages and passed tiring rivals to
secure third in the final strides. SPEEDANDGREED broke in and hit the gate at the start and was away slowly, chased the decent pace while outside of
rivals, gained ground four wide on the turn, could not keep pace with CLEAR THE COAST into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was just
edged for third. TWELVE VOLT chased the decent pace from the inside, lost ground into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. EL CANELO was
forwardly placed and chased the decent early pace, ran in pursuit while outside of rivals along the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DRUM BUNNY was asked to show early speed and was sent to establish the lead, set a decent pace to the turn then was well rated through moderate
fractions to the quarter marker, held foes at bay into upper stretch and kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, felt pressure in deep
stretch, dug in in the final stages and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. MELANIE'S TIGER hesitated at the start and was away slowly, chased the
decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced widest on the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into the drive and continued
her steady gain to the furlong marker, put pressure on the winner in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and just held for second at the
finish. ANISETTE lunged at the start then was squeezed back at the break and was off slowly, trailed into the turn then chased inside of rivals heading to the
quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, found her best stride late, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for second while holding safely at the
finish for third. CLASSY CITY chased outside of rivals early on, advanced four wide on the turn and came within aim nearing the top of the stretch, remained
within striking distance to the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked. AUTISM INCLUSION vied for the early lead
then took back to track from the inside into the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and did not offer a final bid. SIR GEORGE ARTHUR was a
bit hard to place while green in the early stages and lost position in the run to the turn, saved ground while chasing to the top of the stretch and did not
threaten. CORAL CAT broke alertly and contested the early pace, raced close to the decent pace while outside of rivals into the turn, lost ground heading
into the lane and tired in the final furlong. AUTISM PUZZLE vied for the early lead then chased the pace while not far back into the turn, saved ground to the
quarter marker, lacked the needed response in the stretch run and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
DANCING BONBON broke in at the break and made light contact with MISS FLAGG, recovered, then quickly took command passing the half-mile pole,
extended through the turn while in hand, came into the stretch with a commanding lead, was getting tired in the final furlong but held on. STANDFORGRIT
stumbled at the break, settled near the back of the compact field early, responded when asked to quicken approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, rallied
three wide through the turn then continued to rally down the stretch, gaining ground on the leader but ran out of ground while clear of the third horse.
RUNAWAY SALLY broke well from the outside, chased the eventual winner through the turn but could not find another gear when needed. MISS FLAGG
broke best, made light contact with DANCING BONBON, took the lead briefly in the initial stages, was passed, then chased DANCING BONBON through
the turn but was unable to keep pace in the stretch and finished evenly. MALASADA stumbled at the start and spotted the field a couple of lengths head
start, swung out to the four path down the back stretch then, checked briefly when STANDFORGRIT came out, then switched to the inside through the turn,
then responded to handling turning for home gradually working back out to the four path down the stretch and was gaining some ground in the end.
VALERIE got a clean break, raced close up to the turn, struggled to keep pace and fell back in the pack, then ran head to head with MALASADA down the
stretch to the finish.
