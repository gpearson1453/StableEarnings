then moved up while not a threat. BLAZEN JUSTICE was four wide through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the seven path and tired.
MACHO JUSTICE raced well back in the field while in the five or six path near the quarter pole, came into the lane from the four path and never was a
factor. MONTREUX vied for the lead along the inside through late turn then was done, was not persevered with the last sixteenth and was subsequently
vanned off. MISTER MACHO was along the inside through the turn and was done in upper lane.

ENCHANTED MELODY chased the duelers through the turn, bid three wide in late turn and into the lane, quickly gained the lead when straightening then
drew off under intermittent urging. QUEEN D chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path through the turn
and was up for the place spot. EMPIRE DANCER was well back while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, shifted into
the five path when gaining momentum and finished with good energy to just miss the place spot. SALTY SUE vied for the lead two wide through the turn,
had a short lead into the lane then was no match for the winner and weakened late. MY BOYS hustled along the inside to vie for the early lead then gave
way into the lane. IMA N H LADY CAT was along the inside through the turn and never was a factor. FAR'S LAST ONE saved ground through the turn when
near mid-pack then tired through the lane. LITTLEBITOFLASH was in the four path through the turn and was empty through the lane. FLAWLESS JUSTICE

Footnotes
HOT LITTLE THING stalked the two rival duel through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, was close up with a sixteenth left then surged nearing
the wire. CARIMBA vied for the lead into the first turn, pressed through the turn and into the lane, led with less than fifty yards to travel then was outfinished.
POETIC VERSE vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, was in the four path with an eighth to go with a short lead then gave ground
grudgingly. HUNGARIAN PRINCESS chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane, came off the rail and into the four path nearing
the eighth pole, shifted in late and turned in a good effort. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP trailed through the turn while in the two or three path, angled into the
seven path for the drive then gained ground and moved up belatedly. CHANDANA chased the pace three wide through the turn and into the lane then
weakened. CACTUS FLOWER was in the two path through the turn and never factored. VERRY AMELIA was four wide through the turn when never far
back, continued in the five path into the lane and never was a threat. SPEEDY DELIVERY was in the three path through the turn and tired. BOTOX KATIE
saved ground through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and had little impact while being in tight between rivals late. COMPRESSED ENERGY
never a menace while in the three path through the turn. BUOY was bumped and jostled early, moved to the inside, traveled near the rail into the lane and
was empty.

WHAT A BLAST pressed the early pace through the first turn, moved to the front soon after entering the backstretch, cleared near the half-mile pole,
continued on a clear lead into the far turn, slowly widened through the turn and into the lane then continued to lengthen the advantage while being kept to
the task. COACH PETRO was three wide into the turn when asking for more, could not gain on the winner but stayed on to be well clear for the place spot.
WESTERN AVENUE moved two wide and between rivals through the turn and into the lane then weakened. QAADER never was a factor while racing in the
three path through the turn and into the lane. ARAGUAIA vied for the lead along the inside into the backstretch, continued to chase the pace while near the
rail, was still a threat into the lane then was suddenly done near the three-sixteenths pole and was eased through the lane and subsequently vanned off.
