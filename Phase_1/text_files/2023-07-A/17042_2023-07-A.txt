HOUSE OF MAGIC took control early, led two wide around the bend, three wide into the lane, drifted a bit in upper stretch, remained unchallenged into the
final furlong and stayed clear under a drive. PAID IN GOLD stalked the pacesetter from outside, went three wide around the turn, chased after the winner
into the final furlong, could not summon the needed late kick but held the place. AVA'S STORM bobbled leaving the gate, stalked from inside into and
around the bend, drew closer nearing the midstretch but finished evenly late while missing the place. ACCELERINA chased off the rail early, went three
wide around the turn, four wide into the lane, had to alter out a bit from behind PAID IN GOLD in upper stretch and lacked a rally in the late stages.

moved off the fence in upper stretch, steered out past the eighth pole and held well. KANT BEAT THE ROCK stalked off the rail then between rivals in the
two path around the bend, finished willingly late and edged rival for the place honors. ESTABLISHED brushed the gate to break out slightly, chased outside
a rival then three deep around the bend, finished evenly in the final furlong behind the leader and got edged for the place. BIG SWEDE broke a bit slow,
tracked off the rail to the turn, went three to four wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and kept on to close the gap and earn a minor award.
MAJESTIC WIND chased up close from inside early, took hold when the leader was crossing over at the half-mile pole, chased along the rail through the
turn inside a pair of rivals and tired in the final furlong. PER RULING FROM HIWU, KANT BEAT THE ROCK WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MY DESTINY forwardly placed from outside early, chased outside a rival and shifted in to impede that foe entering the turn, took aim from outside four wide
into the lane, took over past the quarter pole and cleared shortly after, met the bid from INDY'S STAR approaching the eighth pole and turned that rival
away in a game victory. INDY'S STAR dropped back early, advanced around the bend while coming off the rail, launched a bid midstretch inside the winner
but was turned away in the late stages. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE tracked just out of range, raced near the inside then drifted out around the bend, was no
match for the top pair in the stretch run but finished a clear third. SWEET HEIDELBERG was prominent early inside rivals then chased the leader up the
backstretch, got impeded by MY DESTINY entering the turn, drifted seven wide on the turn and weakened. APART OF MY CHARM vied outside rivals then
cleared to take full control, led two then three wide around the bend, was overtaken past the quarter pole and gave way. THE REIGN SONG tracked well off
the rail, got bothered by MY DESTINY near the half-mile pole, had to alter out when SWEET HEIDELBERG was impeded entering the turn, was carried
eight wide into the stretch by that rival and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
EDA took control early setting the pace outside ELM DRIVE, dueled two then three wide while relinquishing the lead around the bend, battled into the final
furlong, regained command with a sixteenth remaining and gamely prevailed. CHISMOSA tossed her head, bumped and lost path at the start, chased out of
range outside a rival three wide into the turn, steered out around the bend and came six wide into the lane, closed in on the top pair from the middle portion
of the track, drew alongside EDA in deep stretch but could not get by. ELM DRIVE pressed EDA from inside up the backstretch, moved up on even terms on
the turn then inched ahead two wide leaving the bend, continued to hold a short advantage over EDA with a furlong left to run but got outkicked by the top
pair in the final sixteenth. DANCE TO THE MUSIC brushed the gate, stalked four then three deep up the backstretch, came five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE stalked three deep then came in a bit to bump PAMMY'S READY near the half-mile pole, chased
between foes two wide into the turn, entered the lane four wide and lacked a late bid. VEGAS MAGIC chased at the back outside a rival three wide into the
turn, fell back to last and steered down to the rail around the bend then showed a mild response to improve position down the lane. PAMMY'S READY
bumped leaving the gate, chased between foes then got bumped by outer rival and shuffled back early, raced near the inside on the turn then steered out
four wide and failed to threaten. REAL FIRE took back when crowded between rivals shortly after the start, got put in tight between rivals at the half-mile
pole, chased at the rear two wide into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. ROSE MADDOX stalked the
leading pair inside rivals to the turn, moved off the fence and chased three three wide into the lane and faded down the stretch.
