Footnotes
SUMMER SNOW broke sharp to lead from the onset, continued to set fast fractions on the turn, was asking for the wire with an eighth remaining but
determinedly hung on for a diminishing margin win at the finish. FRAC TALES tracked the loose frontrunner on the rail, shifted outside for clear run at the
quarter pole, was closing with every stride three deep in the stretch but just missed with her late surge at the wire. JO MARCH tracked the pacesetter sitting
just outside on the turn, was slowly gaining on the leader between horses through the stretch and could not find another gear late and had to settle for a
clear third. LEGAL STEPS travelled in the middle of the pack at the half, kept pace with rivals through the turn and offered some late interest in the final
furlong to get up for a small piece of the prize at the finish line. MISS BIKINI travelled on the rail in midfield in the early stages, waited behind a runner inside
three eighths from the finish, offered a mild run at the top of the stretch and was outfinished for the minor role in the end. THIS ONE CAN RUN broke
inwards to begin, could see most of the field down the back straight, could not improve her position running on the turn and never was in contention. LULU'S
LULLABY hit the inside of the gate to start, stalked near the back of the pack with a half mile remaining, could not improve throughout the turn and was not a
factor down the lane. INFINITE PASSION stalked near the rear at the half, was a touch headstrong fighting the rider some at the three furlong marker and
made little impression driving to the wire. SAKE AND SUSHI was sluggish to get into stride after the break trailing the field down the backstretch, could not
get interested running on the turn and made no impact in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SAMMY STONE rated kindly in the middle of the pack on the rail at the half, found a seam in the two path straightening out for the drive, had clear running
room at the eighth pole and burst through to get up nearing the wire for the victory. LEGISLATOR had a good position inside tracking the top pair into the
turn, shifted off the fence with five sixteenths from home, rallied three deep at the quarter pole to lead at the furlong marker and drifted out late to be caught
nearing the wire. TOUCH'N RIDE was unhurried in the beginning to be near the rear down the backside, started to commence a run three wide around
runners at the half, shifted out to the five path to loom the threat turning for home and was pushed out in the final eighth to capture third money. DIRECT
DRIVE had a narrow lead running throughout the turn, was headed outside at the furlong marker, could not find more to repel challengers and faded late
settling for a small share in the end. COHERENCE was allowed to settle on the rail trailing the field down the backstretch, took closer order to the pack to be
involved at the top of the lane and passed tired runners finishing up on the fence down the stretch. WICKED DJANGO tracked three deep outside horses
behind the top two in the beginning, was nudged on between foes to offer a bid three furlongs from home, was in the hunt at the top of the lane running in
the four path and stalled in mid stretch. FIGHTING IRISH stalked in mid field two deep at the half mile marker, angled out widest for the stretch drive behind
runners in the five path and levelled out in the final eighth. HANK OLLIE was content to sit just outside off the pacesetter at the half, could not quicken with
horses at the three furlong marker, was shuffled back through the turn and was not a factor in the stretch run. FINN'S MOMENT refused at the start and
walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #8 FINN'S MOMENT AT THE BREAK WAS DEEMED TO HAVE RECIEVED A FAIR START. ALSO,
STEWARDS GENERAL REVIEW REGARDING #5 LEGISLATOR AND #7 TOUCH N" RIDE NEARING THE FINISH LINE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
MUSICAL STRIDE broke sharply and quickly cleared, set the pace shifting nearer inside but off the rail, was pressured by an outside foe, turned back that
one's bid by mid-stretch, was tiring some in the late stages but held under steady handling. HEEZESPEEDY pursued the eventual winner in behind, saved
ground early on the turn, angled four wide at the top of the stretch, kept on late and was gaining steadily. BEE BEE THE KING stalked the eventual winner
early from outside, advanced to apply pressure three wide on the turn, made a modest bid past the quarter pole, was turned away by mid-stretch, flattened
out and weakened late. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN tracked from inside mid-pack, kept on evenly for a minor award. CLIVE CROSS was a bit reluctant to load,
urged from the break but lacking speed, came out eight wide through the stretch and rallied belatedly. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN settled mid-pack racing outside
a foe two to three wide on the turn, shifted five to six wide turning for home, needed more. COMMANDER AT SEA broke just a hair slowly, was encouraged
along early but was never a threat.

Footnotes
QUEEN JUDITH was relaxed going down the backstretch trailing the field, advanced smartly on the rail with five sixteenths from the line, put in the winning
move splitting runners quickly in mid stretch to lead by the furlong pole and was kept to the task to hold safe for the victory. PEMBERLEY travelled near the
back of the pack in the beginning stages of the race, angled outside in the seven path to be widest for the drive to the finish, began to pick up runners in mid
stretch to loom boldly at the eighth pole but could not gain enough late to threaten the winner. VIVID VIXEN stalked near the rear down the backside, waited
behind runners at the top of the lane found a seam on the rail three sixteenths from the wire and slipped up the fence to capture third money in the end.
WITCH HAZEL was in tight quarters to begin, tracked in the second flight outside with four furlongs to run, was in the mix up front in the five path two
furlongs from the finish and was one paced in deep stretch. TWIRLING CAT had a good position watching the top two leaders five furlongs from the wire,
was asked turning for home, lost path nearing the eighth pole and offered little in the stretch run under left handed urging late. PIONEER'S EDGE was
nestled on the rail behind the top duo at the five furlong pole, waited patiently inside throughout the turn, shifted three wide at quarter marker and gave way
with runners on either side in the final furlong. COURTLY RO settled near the rear three deep outside foes at the half mile marker, was ridden to go on six
wide at the top of the lane and could not get into contention driving to the wire. LADY URUS broke out to begin, took the field into the turn, continued to set
the pace to open up mildly at the top of the stretch, was swallowed up by runners at the eighth pole and emptied out in the late stages of the race. DIOSA
CATRINA broke inwards at the start, prompted the early pace scenario outside, was ridden to keep position at the five sixteenths marker and backed away
with runners on either side in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TURF KING (IRE) lightly bumped a rival after the start, shifted in racing mid-division saving ground early, bided time in behind runners through the far turn,
found room inside in upper stretch, bid coming to the furlong marker briefly engaging with a rival, was bumped by that one then edged away under urging.
KAUKOKAIPUU was very lightly bumped after the start, settled off the leading pair outside two to three wide, launched a rally leaving the far turn while
shifting out and drifting a bit further to enter the stretch six deep, lugged in through upper stretch while taking the lead, bumped an inside rival inside the final
furlong and was outfinished by that one. MIDNIGHT RISING settled outside a foe at the back racing two to three wide into and on the first turn, continued
toward the back between runners into the far turn and beginning to pick it up, came out seven wide for the stretch run, kept on to gain show honors.
STAYHONOR GOODSIDE was in just a bit tight heading to the first turn, eased back and shifted in to track from the inside, moved out on the far turn to
advance three deep, drifted five wide leaving that bend and in range but evened out. SIMCOE shifted in heading to the first turn, was reserved at the rear
racing inside, saved ground into the far turn as well before being guided out, needed more but finished up willingly to improve. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY set
the pace racing off the rail, weakened beginning at the top of the stretch. TWIN CITY raced outside three to four wide through both turns dropping back a bit
on the far bend, was never near enough to threaten. VELOCITOR was a bit fractious in the gate, headstrong early moving forward to stalk the early leaders
from outside about three wide, began to weaken on the far turn and was in a hair tight near the quarter pole, continued to fade in the stretch.

RHAPSODY pressed just outside for the lead throughout the turn, took control at the quarter pole, braced for closers in mid stretch and under a vigorous
ride prevailed to the finish. OLIVIA ROSE had a good position watching the contesting duo on the turn, took up the chase closing in on the leaders with five
sixteenths to run, was the only threat to the winner in mid stretch but could not get by in the late stages of the race. READY TO JAM stalked in the middle of
the pack three wide on the turn, started to close the gap on the leaders at the quarter pole and found her best stride late to close in and capture third money
in the end. EMERANCE was shuffled near the half mile marker on the rail in midfield, recovered to to commence a run on the fence at the top of the lane
and put in a good finish between horses to get up for a minor role. DYNAMIC STRIKE was in a good spot in the second flight on the rail tracking the
contesting leaders running on the turn, was scrubbed on for more three furlongs from home, could not match strides with the rival outside and stalled in
deep stretch. VILLI OLENTO led the field by a short margin while pressured by the winner outside running on the turn, surrendered up front turning for home
and weakened on the rail in the final sixteenth. CALLE REINA travelled in mid field through the turn, offered a mild run between horses starting at the three
furlong pole, was in the battle for a small share straightening out for the stretch run but needed more late to be a factor. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS was
checked at the nine sixteenths marker then shortly afterwards running between rivals at the half and could not regroup in the stretch run to make an impact
driving to the wire. MOION trailed from the outside post in the beginning, made little headway running on the turn and had nothing to show for in the stretch
drive. LANEY GRACE broke with the field, could not find her feet and trailed at the five furlong pole, saved ground running on the rail through the turn and
passed a tired runner in the stretch. SUGAR DROP made an early move five deep around horses at the seven sixteenth pole and faltered while out widest
in the seven path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SOLO ALBUM settled off the leaders outside runners four to five wide early, picked it up on the far turn sweeping to the lead coming to the quarter pole and
clear, widened in upper stretch and drifted out through middle to late stretch. HONOR D LADY was outpaced in the early going despite some moderate
encouragement racing toward the back inside, dropped back to last for the run up the backstretch, switched out and was asked for more on the far turn,
fanned seven wide into upper stretch, gained the place but was no match for the winner. TITO'S CALLING was brushed lightly at the start, angled in and
settled at the back riding the rail into the first turn before being guided out and advancing past a rival two to three deep, still raced toward the rear up the
backstretch, advanced rapidly four to five wide on the far turn, was outfinished for second while clear of the rest but no threat to the winner.
FORTYFIVESEVENTY settled to track while saving ground racing mid-division, came out in upper stretch and kicked on to improve some. DOLCE
SOPRESA moved forward and shifted in to set the early tempo but soon ceded the lead content to track from inside, came out three wide at the top of the
stretch, ran on. BE MY SUNSHINE moved forward with intent two to three wide to take the lead nearing the seven-eighths, shifted in once clear to set the
pace, weakened in the stretch. BLIND SPOT hit the gate, brushed the outer foe then bumped lightly with the inside one, was reserved off the pace three to
four wide early, swung nine deep turning for home, ran evenly and made no bid. WONDER WHEEL was well-placed near but off the lead racing three to
four wide, encouraged along coming to the seven-sixteenths, had no response and faded in the stretch. SPEED TRAP was lightly bumped at the start,
caught five wide into the first turn shifting in gradually through that bend and moving forward to stalk the pacesetter three wide up the backstretch, asked to
keep pace three furlongs out but came up empty.

LUCKY SCORE was bumped on the break, steadied mildly soon after the start to trail on the fence down the back straight, found clear run four deep at the
top of the lane, shifted inwards under a drive three sixteenths from the wire and gamely wore down his rivals late to edge away for the victory crossing the
line. OCEANIC stumbled on the start, stalked outside at the back with a half mile to go, still could see the field running behind horses in the six path in upper
stretch, determinedly split rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and battled gamely to the finish but could not get the win in a hard fought gutsy effort. ONE
TIMER engaged three wide outside horses under a lively early pace, took command in the six path in upper stretch, switched back to the outside lead at the
sixteenth pole, lost some momentum and finished evenly nearing the wire. OLD CHESTNUT brushed the inside rival on the break, had a good position on
the fence watching the top three battle running on the turn, shifted outside seven wide for the stretch drive having clear run, looked to be the winner closing
strongly at the eighth pole but stalled outside in deep stretch. SOUPER DORMY stalked between challengers near the back in the early going, rallied widest
in lane eight at the top of the stretch to be in the mix for a piece of the prize but could not find another gear in the final furlong to pose a threat in the late
stages. OUTLAW KID was brushed outside to start, prompted the pace between runners down the backside, bid for the lead with runners on either side
turning for home and yielded at the furlong marker. MASSETO (GB) was bumped on the start, settled on the rail near the rear in the early going, offered a
slight turn of foot entering the stretch three wide, lost its path inside the three sixteenths pole and had no rally to offer in the late running. STRIKER stalked
four deep outside horses near the back of the pack throughout the turn, could see the field in last four wide two furlongs from home and passed the tiring
early frontrunner in deep stretch. CADAMOSTO (IRE) led the field on the fence down the backstretch, was hounded outside by the couple of runners while
setting strong fractions through the turn, a quarter mile from home was collared by the other speed rivals contesting the pace, retreated in mid stretch and
was not persevered with on the rail to the finish.

Footnotes
TYSON broke outwardly just a bit bumping lightly with a rival, exchanged light contact with an inside foe heading into the first turn, was in a bit tight between
and behind runners into that bend, raced three to five wide mid-pack, angled out seven wide leaving the far turn to advance past foes, took aim on the
leader, struck the front a sixteenth out and edged clear while running on the wrong lead. TREASON was bumped after the start, rated mid-division off the
pace caught four to six wide through the first turn, edged closer on the far turn outside foes five wide striking the lead near the three-sixteenths, was
overtaken coming to the sixteenth pole but well clear of the rest. GASTON broke inwardly, bumped with a rival lightly and was in a bit tight heading to the
first turn racing two to three wide between runners on that bend, shifted out five wide turning for home before being guided out a bit further, kept on late to
get up for third. WAR BOMBER (IRE) came out several paths after the start and with the lead, set the pace in the three path into the first turn, was headed
and pressured past the three-quarter marker, vied inside retaking the lead at the half, could not kick on with the top pair and drifted out gradually through the
lane, lost show late. ARTIE'S STORM raced on or just off the rail mid-pack saving ground through both turns, ran on evenly but needed more. GOLDEN
GLIDER was in a bit tight after bumping lightly at the start, settled at the rear near but off the rail, swung nine wide leaving the far turn while advancing,
continued to run strongly in upper stretch then evened out. DUKE OF LOVE broke inwardly, was forwardly-placed but caught wide stalking the pace five to
six deep early, ranged up alongside four abreast midway on the far turn making a bid at the five-sixteenths, could not kick on in the lane. NOVO SOL (BRZ)
settled at the back racing off the rail in the three to five path mostly, failed to rally. CARROTHERS was forced in a bit and bumped a rival after the start, was
forwardly-placed but caught four to five wide on the first turn pressing the leader, forced the pace in earnest about the three-quarter putting a head in front
for a a couple furlongs, continued to battle on three to four deep through the far turn but was empty for the stretch.

Footnotes
FEV ROVER (IRE) was patiently handled galloping along four deep down the backstretch trailing the pack into the turn, was in no rush in last watching the
race unfold while in range of the field with three furlongs to go, continued to be unhurried sitting behind a wall of runners in upper stretch, a path opened up
five wide with three sixteenths to go, quickly burst through when asked to get the lead and drew away comfortably nearing the wire. MOIRA was squeezed
between runners on the start to trail in the early going, was then hustled down the backside to get early position sitting behind the leaders with five eighths to
go, shifted off the tiring pacesetter inside three furlongs from home, had clear run splitting foes at the furlong pole and finished well to best the rest at the
wire. MILLIE GIRL tracked the top two between horses in the second flight, was urged on the turn keeping up with other rivals, fought on stubbornly in the
six path when surrounded by runners never giving in and finished up late to capture third money in a gritty stretch effort. DEVIL'S BIT broke inwards to
begin, settled three deep between foes near the rear at the half, started to rally around horses three wide at the three eighths marker, bid for the front five
wide straightening out for the drive and stalled with an eighth remaining to hold for a minor role. EMINENT VICTOR was unhurried down the backstretch
shifting inwards to the rail with three quarters remaining, stalked in the third flight inside through the turn while on hold behind horses, was coaxed for more
run shifting out to be six wide entering the lane and was one paced in deep stretch. SCOTISH STAR (ARG) broke out on the start, pressured the frontrunner
outside through the turn, had a slim lead between foes three eighths from the finish, was headed outside by the closers two furlongs from home, battled on
for another furlong and faded on the fence in the final sixteenth. PURRFECT was situated near the back of the pack four deep outside runners at the half,
could not make any gain outside challengers running through the turn, angled out widest in the seven path for the stretch drive and could no be a presence
running to the wire. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) sat outside watching the contesting duo into the turn, began to inch closer to the front runners at the three
furlong marker, contested for the lead four wide with runners on either side two furlongs from the wire, shortened stride in mid stretch and tired in the late
stages. SISTER LOU ANN led the field on the rail down the backside, narrowly held on to the lead in the early part of the turn, was collared outside three
furlongs from the wire, had nothing left to give inside at the top of the lane and retreated in mid stretch.

Footnotes
GRANDE BELLA was among and between early leaders then moved to the fore and clear by the five-eighths, extended the margin turning into upper
stretch racing just off the inside, was weakening late, fought on desperately under stout urging and lasted. P. S. RISING STAR was forwardly-positioned
stalking, went three to four wide on the turn, drifted out in late stretch while gaining, surged but missed. HARD ROCK WARRIOR switched off the rail in the
early going under mild encouragement to keep pace with the field, lacked room in behind tiring rivals past the five-sixteenths, shifted out three deep at that
juncture, came out further in upper stretch and finished well to secure show honors. ROYAL CHROME settled off the pace, advanced outside shifting from
four to six wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in the stretch and evened out. SILENT CREEK broke outwardly just a bit, steadied two times when in tight coming
near the five-eighths, shifted in soon after, advanced up the rail on the turn, came out a bit passing the five-sixteenths, sought room between foes in upper
stretch, split at the furlong marker and ran on. BABA'S GIRL was forwardly-positioned into the turn, went four to five on that bend outside runners, asked for
more turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. CANDY WINE was among the early leaders racing inside, saved ground in pursuit through the turn,
faded in the stretch. SOME LIKE IT HOT was forwardly-positioned between runners chasing two to three wide on the turn, dropped back and faded.
IVICTORY dwelt at the start then veered out when leaving the stalls spotting the field about six or seven lengths, was hard-ridden at that juncture but lost yet
more ground to the field, saved ground on the turn, was never a threat. BLUEBERRY DOLL raced off the pace, was between foes three to four wide on the
turn and never near enough to threaten.
