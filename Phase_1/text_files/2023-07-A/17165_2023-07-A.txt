Footnotes
MARVELOUSMOONDANCE stalked the loose pacesetter, bid to the front at the top of the stretch, drifted and ducked out bumping opponent. TEXAS TED
raced off the pace three wide, rallied in the stretch, was carried out and bumped and just missed. SMOOTH MOTION quickly took control, was collared into
the stretch and weakened. LOTSA LUCK trailed early, finished with some late energy. PRIVATE CABANA prompted the pace inside then began fading on
the turn. UNION PARK was hustled off the pace three wide and gave way. KAIQUE raced within striking range early, was in tight early briefly on the turn
and gave way. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the second finisher against the first finisher, MARVELOUSMOONDANCE was disqualified
and placed second for interference in the stretch. A claim of foul by the last place finisher against the second finisher for interference at the three eighths
pole was denied.

Footnotes
LAYTOWN controlled the pace then widened when ready in the stretch in a dominating score under moderate urging. RETWEET stalked the winner outside,
made a brief bid at the quarter pole but no match for the winner. JUNGLHERLY LOVE saved ground, rallied on the final turn then flattened out late. ZOPPI
FISCHBEIN trailed far behind then advanced inside passing rivals. BOINTHEBACK lacked speed and failed to respond. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX dropped
back early, raced wide and was never a factor. CRACK THE CODE lacked speed in the two path and was never in contention. MERGING TRAFFIC raced
within striking range early then weakened steadily. BACK EAST moved closer up early inside, stopped, was eased then walked off.

Footnotes
RUNNIN REDBIRD dueled in the two path, took over into the stretch and drew away while kept to her task. TAKE IT TO THE MAX broke a step slowly,
advanced inside and was up for the place late. LUNA T saved ground early, angled out rallying in the stretch. DIVINARY prompted the pace three wide then
flattened out in the stretch. BAY AND GOLD hustled to the lead inside to the quarter pole and weakened. OLD HEAD lacked speed chasing in two path and
never a factor. BUNNY BONUS raced three wide off the leaders and gradually weakened. BODIL angled inside early and was always far back. FREE SHOT
trailed throughout racing wide. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
BIG BOYS ANSWER broke through gate and fell prior to the start, saved ground, bid into the stretch and quickly drew clear. SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE
prompted the pace between rivals and came again to gain the place. SEPARATE WAYS set a pressured pace inside, lost the lead in the stretch but was
nailed for the place. VIRAL VIDEO raced between rivals down the backstretch and continued well. WARRIOR'S PAYOFF dueled three wide to the quarter
pole and faded. WHOOSH raced very wide off the leaders and was never a threat. UPFOR PAROLE rushed up very wide in the opening quarter and faded.
NICKY DA FOX trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival. TYRANT REGIME hustled along the inside early then gave way.

POSITIVELY AWESOME vied along the inside and gamely held off repeated challenges in a determined score. CAUSES TROUBLE dueled the winner
throughout but could not get by in the stretch. HEALY'S HOPE saved ground off the pace, angled wide in the stretch with a mild late bid. TANKINATOR
close up from the outset, angled inside on the turn and flattened out. DANGNABBIT broke slowest and raced far behind then passed tiring rivals. FRANK N
DUCKY moved briefly closer on the turn then gave way. JUST A THOUGHT flashed speed wide down the backstretch and stopped. REFUND RIGLER
broke alertly then weakened steadily.

ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM controlled the pace, easily widened after half a mile and was kept to urging with a long advantage. CLASSY MISS settled off the
pace outside then rallied to be easily second. CURRENT SITUATION moved three wide within range and lacked a rally. SUMMER AT THE SPA prompted
the winner outside for half a mile and faltered. GINGERS WISH saved ground close up then steadily weakened. MISS LOYALTY trailed early inside and
was never in contention. MADAME ROUGE broke slowest, chased very wide and was always outrun.

SUNDRIA saved ground throughout, slipped through at the top of the lane and was up late following a long drive. WICKED SIGHT broke awkwardly and
took a bad step, raced greenly down the backstretch while far back then split foes and offered a late surge. GIRL TROUBLE dueled inside trio of rivals to
midstretch and weakened slightly. WILDCAT GIRL settled off the pace, swung very wide into the stretch rallying. WORST BEHAVIOUR dueled wide, bid
four wide at the quarter pole then weakened. AVATAL HERO forced pace two wide between rivals and faded in the stretch. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS lacked
speed and was never in contention. CELTIC TIGER dueled three wide between foes and stopped in the stretch.

the pace outside, led briefly on the final turn and was easily second best. MR LAOBAN raced off the pace outside and continued well for the show.
DISTURBED lacked speed, saved ground and passed rivals while no threat. CAPT COMPLICATED fanned very wide on the first turn, remained wide and
faded. ROAD CALL saved ground, moved briefly closer on the final turn then faltered. LOGAN'S RUNNER set a pressured pace inside then began tiring on
the turn. FLORIANOPOLIS chased in the two path and lacked a rally. STORMY FIRE moved close up briefly outside then gave way. FRUGAL JUDE lagged
far behind throughout. BEFRIENDTHEENEMY dropped back early and weakened steadily.
