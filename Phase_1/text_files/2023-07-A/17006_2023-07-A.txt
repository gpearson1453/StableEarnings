Footnotes
POGGIBONSI vied outside NAUGHTY NAN while under rating, poked a head in front mid turn, responded to some firm asking and kicked clear in upper
stretch, shifted in a bit towards the rail, kept on under solid encouragement near the sixteenth pole and continued nicely through the wire. CYNERGY'S
ELECTRA , outrun early while two wide, edged up into the lane, angled to the rail leaving mid stretch and closed willingly. LOVING CUP rated off the duel in
the two path, swung five wide advancing into the stretch, continued progress to mid stretch then hung late. NAUGHTY NAN showed sharp speed inside,
took outside pressure from the winner, ceded the lead leaving the five sixteenths, shifted out in the drive and faded. POLICE WOMAN broke outward,
lagged off the pace, angled well wide in the drive but lacked a rally. ANGEL ART tracked the embattled leaders three wide, crept closer under asking mid
turn, came four wide for the drive, lacked a further punch and tired in mid stretch.

FASHIONISTA lost ground four wide outside rivals while stalking the pace, took closer order leaving the three sixteenths, dropped in towards the rail, closed
steadily under solid handling, poked a head in front in deep stretch and prevailed. SULLIVAN STREET tracked the leaders while off the inside, bid three
deep in hand mid turn, moved clear four wide in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, was joined from her inside with
about a sixteenth to go, dueled and wasn't quite good enough. RIA FORMOSA , forced out a bit at the break, was taken to rate two wide, gained leaving the
half mile pole, swung out five wide for the drive, ranged up in mid stretch, chased then went evenly through the final sixteenth. QUARANTINI led early then
was headed from her inside nearing three quarter pole, attended the pace outside IMAGINETHEODDS, was under pressure battling between foes mid turn,
failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. IMAGINETHEODDS stumbled at the break, rushed up along the rail soon after and took
command with six furlongs remaining, was hounded by rivals mid turn, ceded the lead approaching the stretch and weakened. BIZ AS USUAL saved ground
pursuing, failed to keep up nearing the lane and faltered.

flattened out. SWEET SHUGS set a pressured pace along the inner rail around the turn, drifted out approaching the eighth pole and weakened. HAPPY
CLOUDS , four deep around the turn stalking the pace, floated to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY , three deep prompting
the pace around the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
LADY ZETA sped clear after a furlong, dropped in to set the pace under some coaxing, met an outside challenge near the quarter pole, spurted clear under
firmer asking soon after, kept on under a drive leaving the eighth pole, turned away a threat from SUMMER ODDS near the sixteenth pole and held firm.
SUMMER ODDS broke sharply, eased back off the lead and angled in to track, shifted 3wd with momentum into the lane, ranged up past mid stretch, briefly
engaged the winner near the sixteenth pole, was denied but kept on willingly to the wire. HITCH A RIDE broke slowly, rushed up between rivals soon after
and prompted outside the winner, bid under a ride past the five sixteenths, dueled briefly, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded late. BELLA BETTINA
bobbled at the break, raced three to four wide and offered a mild response. RAISE YOUR GAME saved ground and lacked a bid. EVANGELINE ALLONS ,
off the pace, raced two wide mid turn and failed to respond.

JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY sprinted to a three deep lead leaving the backstretch, opened up leaving the turn, remained well off the rail through the stretch
and prevailed under steady urging. ON THE MARK raced between horses around the turn and in upper stretch, was taken outside in mid stretch and rallied
willingly. CAJUN DREAM showed speed in the two path between horses entering the turn, raced inside horses thereafter and flattened out late.
REBELLIOUS STAGE broke slowly, bumped with R B'S THE BOSS leaving the backstretch, worked between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and had a mild rally outside foes. GREAT HEAVENS circled the turn three wide, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and flattened out. R
B'S THE BOSS bumped with REBELLIOUS STAGE leaving the backstretch, circled foes on the turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and failed to be a
factor. POMPOUS PRINCE showed speed along the inner rail, failed to keep pace on the turn and was checked in narrow quarters approaching the stretch.

LADNEEDSAHANDLER quickly went clear then secured the inside, handled outside pressure around the turn, spurted clear when called upon into the lane,
widened under strong handling in mid stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept to task. ROYAL SPY stalked three wide, was coaxed
along mid turn, circled four wide into the stretch and kept on willingly to steadily gain. RUNNING RIVER moved up nearing the turn and engaged the winner
from the outside, pressed under a ride mid turn, saw the winner get away into the lane but stayed on with effort to get the show. BOSS MAN J J broke in the
air and was away last, regrouped soon after and was urged along saving ground, gained inside rivals in mid stretch then flattened out late.

BACKNTHEWOODS , angled outside leaving the backstretch, rushed up three wide leaving the turn to engage CHATEAU entering the stretch, battled with
that one to mid stretch, gained a clear lead late and held sway under brisk urging. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , unhurried down the backstretch, circled horses
on the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied. CHATEAU , clear soon after the break, saved ground on the turn, battled with the winner in the
stretch and finished willingly. FULL AUTHORITY , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and lacked the
necessary late response. HELLO HOT ROD saved ground around the turn, was well positioned along the inner rail in upper stretch and came up empty.
YOUNGEST OF FIVE , along the inner rail around the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
FREESTANDING vied outside a rival before going clear near the half, was confidently rated around the turn, came two wide into the stretch and widened in
handy fashion. SURPRISE HELLO disputed the early pace to the inside of the winner, rated off that one nearing the turn, angled three wide and made a run
past the five sixteenths, failed to make any further impact, wandered outward in the final furlong and remained well clear of the rest. IRON RANGER broke a
bit slow, was coaxed along three to four wide and failed to make inroads. KING JOEY steadied soon after the break, saved ground and was outrun. An
objection by the rider of KING JOEY against SURPRISE HELLO alleging interference soon after the start was not allowed.
