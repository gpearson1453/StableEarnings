Footnotes
HE GOES FOREVER raced along the inside through the turn turn when unhurried, bid into the lane from the two path then reeled in the tiring leader and
cleared late. SIR RONALDO was off to an alert start and cleared at once, raced on a clear lead into the lane, had his largest advantage with an eighth to go,
looked to be a winner approaching the sixteenth pole while in the four path then shortened soon after and could not hold. SECOND TO NO ONE chased the
pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the leader then lacked a bid. SNERDLEY broke in and bumped rival at the start,
raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path under a drive and never was a factor. STUDENT PRINCE lacked a response
through the lane while saving ground. PURSUANT was bumped at the start, raced well back into the turn while in the three path and was outrun. BLAME IT
ON MILLER chased the pace from the three path into the turn and was empty in late turn.

Footnotes
COMMANDO JOE stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid two wide into the lane, moved closer to the rail when straightening, dueled to
the eighth pole and edged up. EPIC THE LEGEND chased the pace along the inside through the turn, angled into the four path for the drive and finished
with good energy and was up for place while slowly gaining on the winner. ALL READY settled off the pace while in the three path, bid three wide through
mid-turn and into the lane, was on near even terms with the winner at the three-sixteenths pole then weakened late. SCREAMIN PADDY was in the two
path through the turn when near the back, asked for more into the lane and moved up while not a factor. CADILLAC JUSTICE set the pace from the two
path through the far turn then gave way entering the lane. STANDOUTJUSTICE was in the four path down the backstretch, bid four wide through mid-turn
and was done entering the lane. NINE POINTER was never a menace while saving ground.

CHICA DE ORO was clear early while rated, then held sway under steady handling through the stretch. TALL GIRL raced well back, bid inside at the quarter
and closed late down the rail. ULTIMATE MISSION stalked the pace inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole, then rallied late. BALL GOWN stalked the
pace inside, angled outside of the winner at the eighth pole but couldn't close late. AZAMANA EMPIRE stalked the pace between rivals, angled five wide on
the far turn and then couldn't close. BLAME IT ON PARIS chased the winner in the two path before fading in the stretch. OH POLLYANNA stalked between
foes, then faded in the stretch. MEGAN'S NOEL raced in the four path, bid at the half-mile mark, then faltered. BICKERMENTS saved ground.

SIGNATURE CALL raced on the pace into the far turn, bid from the four path after mid-turn, continued in the four path into the lane then moved up for the
place spot while not a threat to the winner although second best. HURRICANE LASSIE chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane
then needed more while well clear for the show spot. FIRST ELKTON was rated on a clear lead through the turn, gave way straightening in the lane then
just lasted for the bottom of the super. PURELY MINE was in the three path through the turn, moved up a couple of spots through the lane and never was a
factor. ANGELSNDISGUISE bobbled at the start, raced in the two path through the turn when well back and never was a factor. SPOTTY SHOWERS

Footnotes
APRIL CLOVER was off to an alert start to quickly gain a clear lead, raced in the two path through the turn when still clear, slowly widened into the lane then
extended the advantage through the final eighth. CANDI GIRL chased the winner from the four path through the turn, came into the lane while still in the four
path and moved up to be closest and second best. PEGGY'S WAY chased the winner from the two path through the turn, came into the lane with aim on the
winner, could not gain on that one and just held of to the show spot. LILMORECRAKEN was in the three path through the turn and into the lane and moved
up while never a threat. THIRSTY ACCOUNTANT was bumped at the start, raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and weakened.
CLASSIC JULIA raced in the three or four path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the six path and improved position while never
a factor. MORNING GORDITA in mid-pack while in the three path through the turn and tired after straightening in the lane. OLD FASHIONED GIRL outrun
while saving ground. PERFECT MANHATTAN was bumped twice and forced in at the start ,moved to the inside into the turn and was never in it.
GLIMMERING LADY trailed throughout while in the three path.
