Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS GAL settled far back in the three path, produced a swift six wide blitz into the far turn to sweep past the leaders while tucking to the five path
at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command turning for home and drew off under a drive. AMANDA'S CHALLENGE tracked three to two wide and
between horses, tipped back three wide around the far turn and stayed on between horses to gain place at the sixteenth pole. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL
saved ground off of the pace, improved to a tracking position behind the leaders into the far turn, but was subtly shuffled back behind the tiring early pace
setter before tipping two wide at the quarter pole, and ran on for a minor share. GET BY laid off of the pace four to five wide and stayed on mildly. RED JAG
tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to bid two wide entering the far turn, but was quickly outkicked by the eventual winner at the five sixteenths
pole, then lost place and yielded between horses with a sixteenth to go. PROUD PERFORMER saved ground while lacking speed and never threatened.
MELINOE set the pace while a bit off of the inside into the first turn, tugged to inch a clear margin around that bend, but was headed by a pair of bidders at
the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the lane. HIGH END VIXEN broke a step slow while taking contact from an outer rival at the start, then trailed
along the inside and never got involved. BLOSSOM DIVA broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, stalked four to three wide early on, got outmoved
four wide into the far turn and weakened at the five sixteenths pole. NEWYEARSPRESENT got a bit antsy awaiting the start, stalked three to two wide and
between horses, but weakened nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
JACKIE'S SPIRIT vied two wide and between horses early on, sparred with his inner counterpart while in the three path around around the turn, wrestled an
advantage in the long battle and edged ahead in the final sixteenth. ITSABLINGTHING vied with a pair of outer rivals early on, dueled inside of only a single
foe while remaining a path off of the inside around the turn, sustained a long battle with that one while pulling away from the rest through the lane but was
bested in the closing stages. I GOTTA BOLT chased along the inside, then sustained stride to forge show in the shadow of the wire. STORM HAVEN
stalked two wide while pursuing behind the leaders, tipped outside of the embattled leading pair entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with them in upper
stretch and lost show to an inner bidder late. BOLTS BABE bobbled at the start, pursued from off of the pace two wide, attempted to launch a gain by
splitting foes in the three to four path turning for home, but flattened out without reaching contention. ALTER THE STARS stuttered a step at the start and
was outrun while remaining off the rail. BAMBEROOSKI prompted outside of the leading pair and from the four path, chased them under strong urging
around the turn, but weakened after being floated to the five path nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CHISELER tracked along the inside, loomed a danger while searching for racing room behind the leader in upper stretch, decided on offering an inside bid
at the furlong grounds, kicked clear in the final sixteenth and was ridden out under mild urging. MOUNSIEUR COCO was last away, yet rushed forward
early on to duel for the lead inside of rivals, shook free in upper stretch as a pursuing rival menaced, braced for that one's rail challenge in the final furlong,
but proved no match at the sixteenth pole and was well clear of show. RELEASE MCCRAKEN was void of speed, trailed in the two path, swung out to the
five path entering the lane and stayed on to reach show in the closing stages. BAL A KAZOO sparred for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed
to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, gave way thereafter and lost show late. MAJOR BLUE prompted the pace three wide and among
foes, but weakened nearing the five sixteenths pole. STORM DADDY pressed four wide, then three wide turning for home, but weakened on his left lead in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
JERSEY PEARL set the pace in the two path, inched a clear margin entering the turn, kicked away once set down entering the lane and was driven home to
seal the deal. LET'S BE CLEAR pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked while gaining show turning for home, tipped out to the four path as the
leader drew off entering the lane, ran on to bid for place at the furlong grounds and edged that position coming to the final sixteenth. KANT BELIEVE IT
broke outwardly at the start, prompted the pace in the four path and between horses early on, chased the clear leader from the three path around the turn,
failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane and lost place to an outer foe in the final furlong. FASHION RAGE raced at the rear two wide, improved
inside of wide foes entering the lane and edged fourth while failing to menace. FRANKEL BABY broke a step slow as his path was taken by an inner rival,
raced towards the rear along the inside, improved entering the lane, but was bested for fourth. J L'S ROCKETTE pressed outside of the leading pair and
from the five path early on, chased them from the four path around the turn but weakened in the five path turning for home. PUNCHY GIRL pursued from
midpack in the three path, then between horses around the turn, but weakened in the four path entering the lane.

Footnotes
TRIGGER HAPPY prompted outside of the leader and from the four to three path around the first turn, ranged up to that one turning for home to offer a bid
at the quarter pole, gained command entering the lane, drew clear at the furlong grounds, shifted inwardly and held sway. MOON CAT saved ground off of
the pace, grinded away along the rail to produce a bid for place leaving the furlong grounds, gained that position nearing the sixteenth pole, but shifted out
and impeded an outer rival at that marker, then lasted for that position from an outer bidder late. BEN DREAMING hopped at the start, rated unhurried in the
two path, launched a rally in the four path around the far turn, then stayed on to complete a bid for place in the closing stages, but came up short.
IMPULSIVENESS was away awkwardly, saved ground while trailing and stayed on willingly along the rail through the lane. MAHONEY ROAD set the pace
in the two path, was confronted by an outer rival turning for home before being headed by that one entering the lane, yielded entering the final furlong as an
inner rival bid for place, lost that position before being impeded by that one at the sixteenth pole, steadied in the aftermath and faltered. SKATE TO
HEAVEN laid off of the pace two wide, fanned out to the four path entering the lane and stayed on late. UNCLE BERLEY stalked behind the pace-setter and
from the two path, shifted out to the three path entering the lane, but yielded between horses in upper stretch before shying from an inner troubled rival at
the sixteenth pole. MISTER SHARPIE broke a step slow, tracked in the four to three path, chased between horses around the far turn and weakened
entering the lane. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE FINAL FURLONG, MOON CAT WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SEVENTH.

Footnotes
LOYAL COMPANY laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out and ranged up outside of the leading trio to offer a bold bid for the lead leaving the five
sixteenths pole, gained command nearing the lane, failed to kick away while drifting outwardly inside the furlong grounds, straightened under right handed
urging and drove clear approaching the final sixteenth before leaning out more in the closing stages. ITZOS stalked four wide, bid and vied three wide
around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the quarter pole, kept on well into the final sixteenth but was second best. COMMUNICATION
MEMO lacked speed in the two path, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and rallied to reach show at the wire. QUICK HAMMER set the pace two
wide, cleared an inner rival as a pair of outer foes applied pressure into the turn, sparred with them before an outer bidder joined the fray passing the five
sixteenths pole, yielded in upper stretch and lost show at the wire. KING'S GLORY took light contact from an inner rival at the start, pressed three wide and
between horses, vied two wide and among foes around the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. FUNNY UNCLE transferred moderate contact from an
inner foe to an outer rival at the start and was outrun in the five path. NULLARBOR broke outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, prompted the pace along
the inside early on, but backed off to stalk at the half mile pole and weakened with five sixteenths to go.

Footnotes
BEACH WALKN was floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, settled far back along the inside, quickly gained two wide turning for home before
fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and sustained her rally to drive past the leaders in the final sixteenth. LADY DYNAMO broke outwardly, pursued
from midpack three wide around the first turn, pulled forward four wide at the five furlong pole to achieve a stalking position, pursued two wide into the far
turn before offering a bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied while being herded outwardly by the leader in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the sixteenth
pole but was outkicked by an outer bidder late. JUST SAY SO pursued from midpack along the inside, gained two wide and between horses around the far
turn, sustained progress to produce a mild bid at the sixteenth pole, but needed more late. SCATLIE broke a step slow while leaning out at the start,
recovered to vie two wide into the first turn, drew clear around that bend, showed the way before meeting an outer challenge turning for home, drifted
outwardly multiple paths while clinging to an advantage in upper stretch but weakened between horses in the final sixteenth. TAKE SHAPE brushed the
outer part of the gate at the start, stalked the clear leader three to two wide nearing the backstretch, tucked behind that one approaching the far turn, then
only managed to chase through the lane and lacked the needed late response. BIRDIE ROSE broke outwardly, tracked two to three wide, pursued from
within striking range around the far turn but weakened between horses in upper stretch. BOPPY laid off of the pace two to three wide and failed to factor.
MIRUS laid off of the pace four wide, inched closer around the far turn before being floated to the seven path entering the lane and weakened. POOL
NOODLE tracked along the inside and faded around the far turn. KISS ME KATIE broke slowly and was outrun along the inside.
