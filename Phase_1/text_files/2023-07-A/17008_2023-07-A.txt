Footnotes
EMPRESSUM away cleanly, down half a length early, lightly asked left handed approaching the gap, caught SHOTT GUN passing the gap, asked lightly
again left handed midway, headed a game SCOOPS DYNASTY with a sixteenth left and inched away, and galloped out strong. SCOOPS DYNASTY away
cleanly, asked left handed right away, drifted in two lanes while taking the lead approaching the gap, asked again right handed passing the two twenty mark,
implored when caught by EMPRESSUM and gave all he had to the wire in a gallant effort. SHOTT GUN away best, asked right handed early, headed by the
top two passing the gap, asked again right handed midway and kept to task in a game effort. LONDON TOBY away a step slow, in a tight uncomfortable
spot in the first half of the race, drifted in and out while stuck in tight, asked right handed approaching the final hundred yards and responded well enough to
edge out others for fourth place in a game effort. JETTZ away well, shied in a path when SCOOPS DYNASTY drifted in, asked right handed, drifted out
under urging the second half of the race when being outfinished. UP AND ATEM rubbed outside part of the gate, leaving, outquickened early, which resulted
being in a bit in tight, asked right handed when having a wider path and failed to have enough response. JESS BEING A FRIEND broke out two paths at the
start, asked right handed early, kept to task to the wire while failing to threaten in a clean trip . FORTUNATE CORONA caused own trouble by coming away
three quarters slow and lugging in, kept to task right handed throughout and failed to produce any gain. APOLLITICAL FAMOUS V had head towards the
rail, broke in hitting the gate and came away slow, implored early right handed and midway, failed to respond and hand ridden to the wire thereafter.
