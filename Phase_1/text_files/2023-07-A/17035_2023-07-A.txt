Footnotes
WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE established the front shortly after the start and settled under a rating hold just off the inside conceding the front to FREEDYMO
FACTOR with six and a half furlongs to run, remained attending that foe latched on to the inside, advanced steadily to take command with seven-sixteenths
to run, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under challenge from RUNAWAY RUMOUR to the outside, swung four then three wide into upper
stretch on near even terms with that rival to the outside and was leaned on straightened away, then got bumped in the hind end to be turned out but
absorbed the contact inside the three-sixteenths, dug in repelling the challenge to edge clear under a drive and prevail. GOLDEN ROCKET settled tracking
the front just off the inside at the tail of the compact field while in range, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. RUNAWAY RUMOUR three wide in pursuit, advanced three wide at the
three-eighths issuing a bid to get on near even terms swinging five then four wide and leaning in on her main rival into upper stretch when let out for the
drive, dug in under a drive coming in and attempting to turn out WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE inside the three-sixteenths, had the move absorbed by the top one
and was rebuffed before flattening out in the late stages. FREDDYMO FACTOR broke out and was steadied at the start, ranged up three wide into the
backstretch to take command and show the way under rating three wide with six and a half furlongs to run, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, got
headed for the front at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs out between foes, swung five to six wide into upper stretch shaken off and
was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
BATTLEOFLEXINGTON dropped back under urging then settled well off the pace, rallied in the two path early on the turn, dropped to the rail while closing
fast nearing the three-eighths pole then made a made inside of the pacesetter, took the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear outside the
quarter-pole, came out under a right-handed crop into upper stretch, widened under urging while remaining on his inside lead to the eighth-pole, was
completely geared down at that juncture, remained on his inside lead while strolling into the final sixteenth, swapped to the proper lead late then galloped
home a handy winner. REFUAH was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back four wide
into the stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. I'M JUST was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in
the four path on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and tired while best of the rest. UNION TRAIL was hustled from the start, set the pace on
the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the five-sixteenths then dropped back, spun three wide into the
stretch and faded. GOSSIPING PANDO was hustled from the gate, climbed some while dropping back near the three-quarter pole, fell further back around
the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. BASTION dropped back while coaxed along, went around the turn in
the two path and was distanced.

Footnotes
FRAT PACK brushed with rivals at the start then went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn,
responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole and drew off under a brisk hand-ride to prove much the best. MAGICO bumped with a rival at the start,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and was second best. OMNI KING was well placed just
off the pace, dropped back with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and tired while just able to get the show.
DISAPPEARANCE brushed the inside of the gate then bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond then just missed the show. GOLDEN PURCHASE was urged along at the rear, went five wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MARK broke out at the start bumping and pinching MISTICAL CURLIN in tandem with WARRIOR RICHARD who broke inwards and got steadied
at the start, raced four wide in aim of the leader before tucking to the two path into the turn advancing to prompt the pace from the outside, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths and shook away as a pair through the latter portion of the bend, angled four wide for home, dug in dueling through the stretch to
the sixteenth marker, took over command at that station and edged clear to the finish kept to task. MISTICAL CURLIN got away to a rough start when
stumbling at the break, then got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was pinched between them, came under coaxing to establish the front
soon after and showed the way from the three path while in hand, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and came under intensified pressure to the outside
and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths in response, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads to the sixteenth marker when
displaced from the front, ran on to preserve the place honors. CENTAVO chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch and ran on to procure the show honors. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER chased just off
the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. WARRIOR RICHARD broke in at the
start bumping MISTICAL CURLIN in concert with CLASSIC MARK, then got bumped by WINNING CONNECTION, who recovered inwards from a stumble,
raced forwardly placed briefly and lost action awkwardly near the one mile marker for a single stride, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. HANG TIGHT chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
angled three to four wide for home, made no headway. WINNING CONNECTION stumbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping WARRIOR
RICHARD, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ARREBATO four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
HEAVEN STREET went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in hand, vied inside on the turn, hugged the hedge while cruising into upper
stretch under his own power, responded well when set down outside the furlong marker, came under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held
under steady urging. THIN WHITE DUKE settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
chased the winner into the final furlong, gained on that foe into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. SLIPSTREAM showed speed on the
inside of a foe then was taken back off the pace, raced under restraint while rated off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue coming to the
quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out near the furlong marker and improved for the show. CAZADERO was reserved
well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position with late energy but just missed the show.
YES AND YES bumped with a rival while last away then was taken up in tight off heels, spotted the front a few lengths, rushed up near the three-quarter
pole then tracked the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, kept on in the stretch and just missed the superfecta. VOODOO ZIP broke a bit
awkwardly then was bumped in the hindquarters, was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, came out into
upper stretch and failed to rally. LUCKY CURLIN was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn then driven four wide
into the stretch and came up empty. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) broke out and brushed the gate, was forwardly placed on the outside, ranged up three wide
on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.

BE UP attended the leader latched on to the outside while in the two path applying little pressure save through her presence until nearing the quarter pole,
came under coaxing at that juncture and issued a challenge to take command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming
under threat to the outside through the final furlong and gamely rebuffed the threat to prevail safe on the wire. MYRISKYAFFAIR tracked the pace along the
inside until tipped to the two path placed to urging at the five-sixteenths following the move by AMANI'S IMAGE in front, swung four then three wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish. AMANI'S IMAGE tracked the pace along the
inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
honors. PEACE SEEKER coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into
upper stretch and weakened. ARINA (GER) established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside joined by BE UP latched on to the
outside by facing little pressure, had that rival intensify the pressure just inside the five-sixteenths and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the
inside route into upper stretch displaced from the front, then weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY bumped with a rival at the start, was carried in early then bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, was taken in hand while off heels leaving the
backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final
furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final stride. ICY STARE DOWN pressed the pace down the backstretch, was eased back off the pace near the
nine-sixteenths, stalked three then four wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, led under a left-handed crop into
the final sixteenth but was denied in the final stride while clear for the place. AWESOME INDRA was hustled from the gate, showed speed from the outside
then set the pace, vied in the four then three path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the runner-up in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the show. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was coaxed along on the outside, went four
then five wide while asked for more on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. DIVA BANKER was hustled from the start
then bumped early, raced off the pace under urging, went two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. BEAUTIFUL
KAREN bumped with a rival at the start, angled in quickly in the early going, raced just off the pace, was given her cue in the two path on the turn and also
came up empty. MON PETIT CHOU broke a bit slow then was hustled, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

inside the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the two path three-sixteenths from home, rallied to collar the front inside the
eighth pole, then drew clear to the finish to score. ORTUS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. BE THE BOSS broke out hitting the off side stall and then bumping BE OF COURAGE in
tandem with EDDIE THE GREAT, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors on the wire.

finish. KREESA five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DR. SETTLE'S DREAM five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FACTUALLY CORRECT chased three

Footnotes
HIGHLAND GRACE dropped in while taken in hand early, moved from the rail to the three path on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was
roused three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, moved further out inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed strongly to get up late. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) quickly sped clear while well out in the course, dropped in entering the first turn, showed the way on
the inside, responded well when asked on the far turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, fended off a rival while still in front into the final sixteenth but
was overtaken while able to get the place in a good effort. PEGS A. K. GIRL went three wide on the first turn, moved closer early on the backstretch, tracked
the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid inside the
three-sixteenths, battled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. OUT OF SIGHT brushed with a foe at
the start, was hard held while keen against the rail going around the first turn, raced towards the front while rated, drafted behind horses while inside on the
far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked then just missed the show. ANATOLIAN went three wide on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the three path while moving closer on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders
into the final furlong and was also out-kicked then just missed the superfecta. OLKOVSKHA (FR) was last to commence then taken in hand early, brushed
with a foe into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. RHOMBIQUE brushed with an opponent into the first turn then was taken up while eager off heels, saved ground on that
bend, was reserved on the inside, swung four wide into the stretch, moved further out inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SWOOP
TO FINISH was hard held between foes in the two path through the first turn then rated off the pace, traveled three wide while let out on the far turn, spun
five wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. LULLABY LAND broke out and brushed with a rival, was taken under a tight hold while
coming inward early, went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor. MARIAH'S FORTUNE rounded the first turn in the two path, moved closer near
the seven-eighths pole then stalked the leader, was asked in the two path on the far turn.
