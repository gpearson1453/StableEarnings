HE'SPUREGOLD raced off the pace inside, angled out midway on the far turn, went three wide past the quarter pole, closed willingly outside, moved up
alongside of THERE ARE NO WORDS past midstretch and was going best late for the win. THERE ARE NO WORDS was well placed stalking the dueling
leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, took over turning for home, drew clear, then dug in gamely inside of HE'SPUREGOLD and yielded grudgingly.
SMITHWICK'S SPICE dueled between rivals in a three way contested pace, took over on the far turn, dueled past the quarter pole, weakened and stayed
on well to earn the show spot. LIKE WHAT I SEE raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly. WOLFE 'N HAWKE broke
a step slow, raced off the pace, inside on the far turn and closed belatedly. QUIBERON BAY raced off the pace, three wide on the far turn and had no rally.
LEO MONTE dueled three wide for command, chased on the far turn and faded. IRISH BOOLUM was outrun early, came two wide into the lane and did not
factor. LIB'S CONTENTO was outrun. CRAFTY DON dueled inside for the lead, chased on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MR. PENNY PINCHER raced off the pace, made a strong four wide run nearing the quarter pole, rallied to a short lead, then drew clear in the final
sixteenth. FUN AT THE FORT raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came wide, closed well late outside and got up for second. EL DE CHIREL
stumbled at the start, tracked on the inside, made a rail bid in tight quarters at the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside of the winner, then lost second in the
final strides. AL'S FROSTED dueled two wide for command, vied three wide at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. ROMPING RUNNER stalked two
wide, chased on the turn, was in tight between rivals at the quarter pole, then lacked a rally. WALK SADLY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and
did not factor. MR. HOUGHTON broke in bumped a rival at the start, dueled inside for the lead, battled between rivals at the quarter pole and faded.
