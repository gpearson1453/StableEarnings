Footnotes
FROGGY went to the front to a clear lead and set all the pace, was challenged at the top of the stretch, dug in and drew off. OH SNAP trailed the field early,
then moved up from three wide and made a late run in the stretch to be a clear second. HOT LIL MESS pressed the pace through the turn then engaged the
leader at the top of the stretch and tired. BULL RING steadied coming onto the main track, saved ground throughout but failed to menace. MORE ACTION
was off the pace to the four and a half furlong marked then was shuffled back, made a late effort in the stretch and missed the show.

the lead to the top of the stretch and weakened. DRYSPELL was outrun. SILVER AND ACES lost his footing leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn
but was not a factor.

PRINCE OTTO was hustled along to vied for the lead then took over at the quarter pole, drew off in mid stretch and held off late closer. BORN TO RACE
trailed to the turn then moved up on the turn and angled out to four wide in upper stretch for a late rally but was too late and to prove second best. DEACON
BEACON was rushed up the rail to be off the pace but ran into traffic entering the turn and had to check, made a rebid and was up for show. CASH
EXPRESS raced near the back through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch to improve his position. BUMPER POOL was off the pace through the
turn but lacked the late response in the stretch. SEAFARING WILDCAT sprinted to the lead from under pressure then was headed at the quarter pole and
tired. MYBESTISYETTOCOME tracked the leaders from three wide and gave way in the stretch.

RANCHER tracked the leaders to the top of the stretch then over took the leader at the sixteenths pole and held off the late closer. TASHKENT trailed
through the turn then moved out to four wide at the quarter pole and was gaining late but was not enough. GEE WHIZ WHO vied for the lead from the inside
then was coaxed at mid turn and took command at the top of the stretch but was over taken at the sixteenth pole and fought gamely to the wire. FERRARI
ROAD was off the pace on the inside but failed to menace. MASTERPIECE DAY was hustled to a clear early lead but was collared at the quarter pole and
tired.

turn then made a mild bid on the leader, drifted out in early stretch and tired. EL CHUMELITO was not a threat while racing evenly. DOUBLETROUBLE
