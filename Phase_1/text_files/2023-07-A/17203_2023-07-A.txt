Footnotes
O'CONNER SUNSET tracked the pace from the rail through the turn saving ground, rallied turning for home, angled out to the four path and wore the
leaders down in deep stretch while lugging in down the lane. FREE SOUL pressed the pace to the quarter pole, engaged the pacesetter in upper stretch,
dueled with that one down the lane, inching past late but was out finished by the winner. FREESTANDING sped to the lead away from the gate, was well
rated on the front end, responded when challenged turning for home but could not hold on. WELAKA slow early to be at the rear of the field and passed
tiring rivals down the stretch. SPITBALL broke alertly, was taken in hand to stalk the pace through the turn and faded in the stretch. MANOLITO went evenly
never posing a threat.

Footnotes
ACE UP HER SLEEVE set a pressured pace on the inside while in hand, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear, then drew off to prove much the best.
SERIOUS MOMENT was bumped at the start, tracked pace three wide, two wide turn, angled out leaving the turn and proved to be no match for the winner
while clearly second best. CLARIFICATION pressed the pace two wide and came four wide into the lane then weakened, bested rest. BANK CARD failed to
menace. MAKAAN chased the early pace four wide, dropped to the inside on the turn and stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
KING KONTIE broke sharp, was sent hard for the early lead, quickly opened a clear advantage, widened his lead in the turn and continued through the lane
unchallenged. MASSIF unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, split rivals midway on the turn to commence his rally and finished well to gain the
place. YAHMO tracked rivals from mid-pack through the turn from between horses, dropped to the rail turning for home and finished with good late interest.
SASSE'S CLASS chased the pace from four wide around the bend to be prominent at the top of the lane and finsihed evenly. TECH DUINN prompted the
pace from three wide in the turn and flattened out in upper stretch. TWO BRONZE STARS prominently placed for the first half mile and faded in the stretch.
CONCENTRATION flashed speed for three-eighths along the rail and dropped back as not threat turning for home. NANCY MADE MY DAY went evenly as
a non-factor.

WICKED FINN stumbled at the start, advanced on the backstretch, made a five wide move on the turn, took over off the turn and drew clear to prove best
under a drive. CARRONADE was forced wide into the first turn, then settled on the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn with the winner, could
not go with that rival off the turn, then finished willingly to be second best. ADMIRAL'S WAVE was settled early two wide, between rivals by the half mile
marker, shifted out on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and finished well. GRAEL was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and had a late
rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. ANAMNESTIC forced wide into the first turn, pressed the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn
and weakened the final furlong. THE HAPPY GIANT passed the tiring rivals. LE GRIFFON set a pressured pace on the inside and steadied nearing the
sixteenth marker while weakening. ROYAL VELVET was climbing into the first turn and got out five to six wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide
and weakened. SELECTO was reserved early, three wide on the turn and was not a threat. TOLAGA BAY pressed the pace two wide and tired. The jockey
on number five LE GRIFFON filed an OBJECTION against the number nine ANAMNESTIC for alleged interference in the stretch, after the STEWARDS
reviewed the replay of the race they left the race as is.

Footnotes
BOFFO KID reserved in mid-pack off the pace to the far turn, circled five wide with a strong rally into the head of the lane and drew off convincingly down
the stretch. MENTALIST tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside, gained ground along the rail saving ground in the turn, angled three wide at
the head of the lane and closed well for the place. SUMMER ANTHEM well placed in the second flight, was set down for the drive and kept on grinding
down the lane to earn the show. BOURBON BROWN rushed up on the outside to press the pace into the first turn, dueled with the leader to the quarter pole
and weakened in the stretch. THANK YA PETE sped to the lead down the lane the first time, dueled on the lead turning for home and had no late response.
DON BERNARDO went evenly posing no threat. ERLAN circled three wide down the backstretch make an early move to the leaders, engaged the
pacesetters from three wide into the far turn and flattened out. THE THINKER was outrun.

Footnotes
AIR ONE reserved off the early pace, swept up five wide turning for home in a determined drive and prevailed gamely. MOMENTOUS MISS stalked the
pace from the gate through the turn, assumed command in upper stretch, battled to the wire but could not hold off the winner in a good effort. YOU'RE
AVOIDING ME tracked the leaders from the fence throughout in striking distance and closed willingly up the rail. LOVING CUP tracked the pace from two
wide, mounted a rally turning for home and failed to gain ground. BABY LUCK unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field to the head of the
stretch and showed mild late interest down the lane. TOVIA sped to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear advantage and tired coming home.
BEDTIMEBOURBON trailed throughout as a non-factor.

MICHEAUX was away alertly and soon clear, saved ground on the turn, then kept to task and proved best. DOC ROCK allowed to settle on the inside
swung out five wide turning for home and closed well to be second best. AWESOME STEPHEN chased the pace and was between rivals on the turn, came
three wide into the lane and finished willingly, bested rest. DANCIN IN DUBAI chased he pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane
and weakened. TEMPTING MOMENT chased the winner on the inside and weakened. GOLDBUSTER was off slowly and showed little, vanned off.

Footnotes
GET THEM DIGITS unhurried in the early going, split horses into the turn saving some ground, waited for racing room patiently to the head of the lane,
angled to the clear in upper stretch and closed with a rush a convincing winner. DISCREET DEVIL pressed the pace to the quarter pole, took command
turning for home opening a clear lead and was run down in deep stretch. STARSTREET rated in mid-pack on the rail through the turn, angled out in upper
stretch and finished willingly. MUNNIS PRETTY saved ground racing prominently along the fence in striking position and failed to gain ground. SWIFT
DANCER stalked the pace from three wide, loomed up at the quarter pole and was out-finished in the stretch. SMILIN JACK went evenly in mid-pack. HIT
THE JACKPOT raced near the rear of the field to upper stretch and swung wide to make a belated rally. HEAVY WEIGHT prominent early, made a bid in
upper stretch and flattened. SHAMELESS APPEAL broke a step slow, raced at the rear and passed tired rivals in the lane. KALINBA showed brief speed
and dropped back failing to menace. RIP IT was never a threat. GREAT CALL flashed speed for the first half mile and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
CIBOLIAN was reserved early, between rivals on the second circuit, made a bid off the turn, split rivals nearing the sixteenth marker and prevailed late to
prove best under a drive. HIGH DEFF (FR) was rated along the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and made a bid to gain a short lead at the
furlong marker, and then battled to the wire and missed. NATHAN DETROIT was allowed to settle, made a inside bid in the lane and got through on the rail
but was outfinished to just miss. BE YOURSELF was settled back throughout and had a belated rally. STRAW INTO GOLD tracked the pace and made a
two wide bid on the turn and weakened in the dirve. I AM FORTUNATA (IRE) lacked a rally. ICANDOTHAT was void of speed and was not a factor.
GARRISON FOREST (IRE) was reserved early and tired. FINDING FREEDOM set the pace while clear and gave way. ABSAM chased the pace two to
three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
GOLD CHARM (IRE) was reserved early on the inside, made a three wide move on the turn, then continued that bid on the outside and drew clear to prove
much the best under a hand ride. LACEY UNDERALL set the early pace while well clear, then maintained a lead on the second circuit, stumbled badly over
the eighth fence and rider managed to hold on, then was headed off the turn and proved to be no match for that rival while being second best. AFRAID NOT
chased the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn but flattened out, bested rest. FOX IN THE PARK (IRE) was rated along the inside and made a
inside tun on the far turn but lacked a late response. BOURBON DIVERSION was settled while rank three wide and weakened. FUSEE DE POCHE (IRE)
was allowed to settle early on the inside, then moved up between rivals and made a middle move on the second circuit then tired.
