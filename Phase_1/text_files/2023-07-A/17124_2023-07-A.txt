Footnotes
MASTER SPY settled in mid pack under a snug hold on the turn, loomed the threat in the five path two furlongs from home, took command in the late
stages of the race and was edging away crossing the line. TRICKY MAGICIAN tracked on the rail well in hand watching the top pair with three furlongs to
run, was in range of the leader inside straightening out for the drive, shifted just off the fence to bid between rivals three sixteenths from the wire, battled
stubbornly between in deep stretch but was just outgamed by the winner in the end. CRAFTY CONQUEST had an uncontested lead down the backside and
through the turn, continued to be alone at the top of the lane, began to get leg weary at the furlong pole, was collared in deep stretch but still held for a clear
third. HIGHLAND SOCIETY chased the frontrunner down the backside, continued to follow the pacesetter on the turn and yielded between runners in mid
stretch. SEA SCOUT stalked near the rear in the beginning stages, was roused five wide behind horses at the top of the lane but could not get involved
down the stretch. MIDNIGHT MEADOW was off a bit slow to begin, trailed the field down the backstretch, angled six deep at the top of the lane , was
steadied to avoid fallen rival, was not persevered with afterwards and walked across the finish line. AL HEYBAY settled near the rear in the early going,
commenced a run six wide turning for home, was steadied sharply trying avoid the fallen foe and galloped across the finish line. UNCLE BULL had a good
tracking spot outside watching the top two throughout the turn, rallied four wide with runners on either side at the quarter pole, was in tight surroundings in
upper stretch driving to the finish, clipped heels, fell and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN RESULTED IN NO
CHANGE

Footnotes
VELIKIY bumped a rival at the start, was forwardly-positioned early, stalked the pacesetter into the turn three wide, struck the lead in upper stretch outside
the furlong marker, lugged out a bit soon after, held sway. ROCKET RILEY was in tight at the start, lacked early speed and was outpaced early, began to
pick it up on the turn, came out a bit leaving that bend then angled out further near the eighth pole for room, was gaining too late but got up for second.
CRIMSON NIGHTS was bumped at the start and bobbled slightly, settled off the pace, went three then four wide moving between runners leaving the turn,
loomed a threat in the stretch, was forced out a bit late, ran on evenly. BURLAP got away alertly, was overtaken by an inside foe and stalked that one two
wide coming out a further path for the stretch run, kept on evenly. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE got away several lengths slowly while breaking awkwardly,
steadily advanced inside up the backstretch to get within range of the leaders on the turn, came out a path to advance by a rival, rallied mildly inside foes
but off the rail in the stretch. SPEEDY BUBBLES was bumped into a rival at the start, raced four then five wide on the turn in range of the leader coming to
the top of the stretch but needed more. BELLASPINA moved forward inside under coaxing taking the lead by the end of the opening furlong, set the pace,
faltered and faded in the stretch. FOREST VIXEN was caught outside runners five then six wide on the turn, had no late bid.

Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN kept a close eye three deep chasing the leader at the half, started to reel in the frontrunner at the quarter pole, was mildly urged
right handed at the top of the lane to go after the speed, bid outside to take command at the sixteenth pole and edged away at the wire for the victory.
SILENT RESERVE took command from the onset, opened up on the field down the backstretch under a snappy first quarter, dictated the pace on the turn
setting lively fractions up front, was asking for the wire at the furlong pole, battled stubbornly when collared outside in deep stretch and held for the runners
up share. POULIN IN O T could not keep pace with the speed early and was throttled back to track the leader inside down the back straight, could not
match strides with the top pair running on the turn, started to lengthen his stride in mid stretch and was gaining late but could not threaten at the finish.
KINETIC STONE broke inwards hitting the gate on the start, trailed this compact field outside down the backstretch, made little impression making no
headway through the turn and was not involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HE'S FULLY LOADED was a bit hard to load, broke very sharply and was quickly clear to set the pace while shifting in, was asked for run in upper stretch
and responded to draw away from the nearest pursuer. LAST MONARCH stalked the pacesetter and eventual winner, drew to within range past the quarter
pole and put to urging, was no match for the winner but second best. FOREST STAR settled off the pace outside, went three to four wide on the turn, got
the nod for show. MR. DE was urged at the break, lacked significant early speed, switched off the inside racing two wide on the turn, put to urging past the
three-eighths, came into the stretch three to four deep, ran on late but just missed the nod for show honors. MR. MARSHALL was urged forward from the
get-go, chased inside, lacked the needed late kick. WILD CONVERSATION bumped the outer rival at the start, raced off the pace and off the inside, swung
six wide into the stretch, ran on mildly. DIXIE'S FLATTER was between runners off the pace early, began to drop back and was given some encouragement
at the half, failed to threaten. WONT FORGET YOU was bumped at the start, devoid of early speed, was never a threat. COMMANDER AT SEA chased
while racing off the inside, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ROSA was bumped at the start, settled near the rear down the backside, made a strong move on the rail with five sixteenths remaining, shifted outwards
three wide splitting rivals at the quarter pole, bid four wide turning for home and was full of run in deep stretch to win drawing away at the finish. WHY EM
SEA AY had a good spot tracking three wide in the beginning, crept closer to the front midpoint on the turn, had a brief lead in upper stretch running
between horses but was no match for the winner late and had to settle for second best on this day. YOU BE THE JUDGE travelled with runners on either
side in the middle of the pack,, tapped on the brakes in tight quarters seven sixteenths to the finish to be shuffle back of runners at the two furlong pole,
angled out five wide turning for home and closing in to capture third running on the wrong lead. LUNCH WITH BERNIE chased the frontrunner in the early
going, could not maintain position between midpoint on the turn when others were quickening and was one paced to the wire for a minor role. SILENT AND
SINFUL broke sharp setting the pace down the back straight, continued up front unchallenged on the turn, was collared outside at the top of the stretch and
gave way inside at the furlong pole. DIFFERENT DRUM trailed early on when squeezed between foes at the start, could not catch up to the field running on
the turn, found her best stride late closing between horses passing some to the finish. BLUE TANGO settled in mid field on the rail, offered a mild run
advancing on the fence seven sixteenths remaining and retreated inside at the quarter marker. MIRAMICHI broke inwards at the start, stalked three deep
outside in mid pack down the backside, rallied four wide circling runners three eighths from the finish, could not sustain her run and tired turning for home in
the six path.

SOUPER SUNDAY shadowed the pacesetter, went two to three wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, forged clear. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES stalked
in behind, shifted to the rail passing the three-eighths marker, tracked the leaders saving ground through the turn, came out at the top of the stretch, fought
on late between runners to get up for place. FOOLISH GAMES stalked from outside with good position, went three wide on the turn, came out a bit turning
for home, had aim on the leaders, kicked on evenly and was outfinished for second. CARA CARA was quick to the lead, set the pace near the rail with
outside pressure, was challenged at the top of the stretch, yielded grudgingly. ANAM CARA was bumped at the break, urged along but lacking early speed,
advanced inside heading to the turn, was bumped, steadied and altered out as a rival in front shifted in and the outside foe initiated said contact, was guided
back inside, kept on well late. SOUPER SINCLAIR lacked speed racing at the back inside, came out in the stretch, ran on. TAYLORMOON was very
reluctant and unruly behind the gate, got away well, raced mid-pack going four wide on the turn, kept on evenly. DOMER ALLURE was ridden along in the
early going but lacking significant speed, was forced to alter course to avoid a rival at the three-eighths, moved back in a bit before swinging out again for
the drive, was never near enough to threaten. GIVE ME THE BOOTS chased from outside, went four wide on the turn, came up empty. STRIKE THE POSE
raced outside a foe two wide heading into the turn, steadied and bumped with a rival then altered out at the three-eighths, failed to rally. RIFLING bumped a
rival at the start, raced in behind foes in the back half of the field, checked sharply and altered out abruptly to avoid runners at the three-eighths, failed to
menace.

Footnotes
ENGLISH SHIRL sat off the frontrunner under a strong hold three deep, cruised to the lead outside at the five sixteenths pole, was headed outside at the top
of the lane, put away that rival at the eighth pole and still had enough to hold the closer at bay late to prevail. FOXY DIVA was unhurried down the
backstretch trailing the pack, could see the field angling out widest in lane nine for the stretch finish and put in a solid late run outside just missing out in the
end. ROYAL BLUSH travelled in midfield surrounded by runners, advanced three wide on the leaders with three eighths to go, shifted out six wide to be in
the hunt straightening out for home, was gaining slowly to the wire but could not threaten the top two finishers at the end. HOT CARGO broke out at the
start, tracked the leaders between foes with four furlongs to run, loomed five wide at the quarter pole, battled outside for the lead until the furlong marker
and faded in the last sixteenth settling for a minor share. BEDAZZLE ME tracked behind the leader on the rail, waited on the fence through the turn, had
clear run in the two path three sixteenths from home and finished up evenly to the wire. DIOSA CATRINA travelled in the middle of the field with runners on
either side, could not gain on foes at the half and was not a presence in the stretch run. SPEEDY RIVER cleared to take the lead on the fence three
quarters from home, was collared outside by the winner at the three eighths pole, fought on inside to the furlong marker and gave way late. SWEET NOLA
was brushed inside at the break, travelled near the back of the field in the beginning, waited behind horses on the fence in midturn but could not reach
contention driving to the finish line. MARALINGA stalked near the back, could not make any headway four wide running on the turn and was not involved
running in the seven path to the finish. WELL ACTUALLY chased the pace in the early stages, sat behind the leader on hold throughout the turn, shifted four
wide for the stretch run and weakened. MEET THE SOPRANO settled in the middle of the pack five deep, advanced four wide outside closing the gap on
the leaders thru the turn, took a misstep at the three furlong marker, pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BUTTERED TOAST bumped lightly with a rival at the start, unhurriedly brought up the rear saving ground, swung out eight wide leaving the far turn, rallied
strongly through the lane to drive by late. GAYELETTE was bumped very lightly in the early going, settled well back off the pace shifting in, saved ground
unhurriedly at the rail through the first turn, edged closer on the far turn still saving ground but coming off the fence late on that bend, moved back inside
foes at the top of the stretch, found room at the rail to bid and take a narrow lead past the sixteenth pole, was outkicked but secured the place. LADY BREW
bumped a rival lightly early, raced in the back half three to four wide, fanned out seven wide on the far turn under urging past the five-sixteenths, rallied in
the stretch taking a narrow and brief lead coming to the sixteenth pole but was outfinished and missed second. MOSLER'S IMAGE moved forward to stalk
from outside four wide into the first turn, maintained position just off the leader continuing four wide on the far turn and beginning to edge nearer, bid and
took a narrow lead at the three-sixteenths, was outkicked. KITTEN'S ROMANCE was well-placed off but near the leaders while caught four to five wide
early, moved out a bit further leaving the far turn under pressure, bid in mid-stretch drawing even but was outkicked. UMNEYAAT raced off the rail mid-pack,
floated out leaving the far turn coming six wide into upper stretch, ran on. STATE OF MIND bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled off the pace about
two to three deep into the first turn, moved to the rail late on that bend, made a swift advance up the rail heading to the far turn, moved out gradually through
that bend coming to the top of the stretch four deep, faced some traffic in behind and between runners through the lane. BIZYMALINE bumped just lightly
with a foe at the start, quickly moved clear to set the pace, was pressed by outside foes racing just off the fence, weakened in the lane. HAI BOBBI was
forwardly-positioned pursuing from inside, came off the rail coming to the quarter pole, needed more. GLITTER BAY raced outside foes three to five wide
coming wider still for the stretch run, was unable to menace. ALPHA MIA chased the pace three wide through both turns, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
FEDALIA had a perfect trip watching the contesting leaders battle down the back straight, slipped up the fence to seize control midpoint on the turn, opened
up at the top of the lane and had enough left late to hold off the late closer at the finish. STARLIGHT RIDGE was bumped outside at the break, advanced
smartly on the rail throughout the turn, shifted just off the fence in the two path between runners straightening out for the drive and finished strongly late to
make it close at the wire. SILENT GHOST had a narrow lead being pressed outside at the half, was collared by the winner inside midway on the turn,
determinedly dug in four deep through the stretch to settled for a clear third in the end. LOIS LEN pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, could not
match strides with the leaders with five sixteenths to go, was in the mix for a small share in the stretch drive and was one paced late for a minor role. IPSUM
GRATUS was bumped to begin, travelled like many after the start near the back of the field, was ridden for more between horses three furlongs out, shifted
to the four path for the stretch run and had no finishing kick to give. JILLI MARIE travelled four deep in the pack of runners situated near the rear at the half,
offered a mild run four wide outside horses to be in contention in the six path at the top of the lane and stalled in upper stretch. NORTHERN RUBY broke
inwards to begin, trailed five wide outside horses down the backside, saved ground on the fence through the turn and passed a tired runner to the wire. HIT
AND RUN was squeezed on the break, travelled in the two path near the rear at the half, was hard ridden midway on the turn making little gain and stopped
in mid stretch.

Footnotes
EPHRATA (GB) settled along the rail saving ground through the first turn off the pace, moved out two to three wide on the far turn, split runners three deep
at the top of the stretch, bid outside in mid-stretch, dueled to the wire and kept on gamely to hold that rival at bay. INDY CHAMPAGNE settled outside a foe
at at the rear early, moved to the rail and saved ground on the far turn, came out a couple paths in the stretch for room, bid between runners but couldn't get
to the winner. STREGA set the pace racing in the clear and off the rail on the first turn, came out a bit at the top of the stretch, was challenged in mid-stretch
and outfinished. ENSEMBLE (IRE) settled mid-division three to four wide, continued three deep into the far turn in behind runners, moved out five wide
coming out of that bend, advanced between runners in upper stretch, ran on well late to secure the minor award. LADY MOONSHINE stalked the pace two
to three wide, dropped back and faded in the stretch. GLORIANNIA raced forwardly two to three wide on the first turn moving out four deep for the run up
the backstretch, was within range into the far turn floating five to six wide on that bend while dropping back some, failed to rally. SILVER MAGNATIZED
tracked the pace from inside, switched outside a rival heading up the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn coming seven deep into upper stretch,
lacked the needed late kick.

Footnotes
BIG RANSOM took control from the outside to lead on the rail into the first turn, was left alone upfront down the backside, opened up on runners midway on
the far turn, was headed outside in upper stretch and found more late to fight off the late closer in deep stretch. AIR FORCE RESERVE was hard held under
the wire for the first time stalking five wide into the first turn, was steadied briefly entering the back straight to be near the back of the field, rallied four wide
quickly circling runners three furlongs from home home to bid in upper stretch and could not get by on the outside late for the win. YORKVILLE travelled on
the fence in the middle of the pack, advanced smartly on the rail through the far turn to be in range of the leaders straightening out for the drive, continued to
fight inside down the stretch never giving up but had to settle for a non threatening third in the end. NGABE was fanned six wide on the initial turn, settled
mid pack outside four deep at the half, rallied four wide around foes two furlongs from the finish and continued the late run a get up for a small share in the
end. C R HOT SHOT settled near the rear down the backside, had nowhere to run behind horses at the three furlong marker, started to commence a run on
the fence with five sixteenths remaining and finished with good late energy in the final eighth. PREETZAH'S STAR trailed in the early stages of the race,
angled six wide seeing the field at the top of the lane and passed stragglers in mid stretch. PASSIONPLATE tracked the pacesetter on the rail, was content
sitting behind the leader down the backside, was asked to go after the frontrunner three eighths from the prize, offered a mild run to be in the mix turning for
home and faded between horses in the final sixteenth. SING DIXIE tracked two wide down the backstretch, was asked for more run midway on the final
turn, offered little response and was not a factor in the run to the wire. TORY'S HOLIDAY was nudged on to keep position with runners on either side at the
half, could not make any gains on rivals through the far turn and had no finish to offer in stretch run. SNOOKERED tracked four wide on the first turn, had a
good position three wide outside alone in the third flight at the half mile marker, could not quicken with rivals on the far turn and gave way at the quarter
pole.
