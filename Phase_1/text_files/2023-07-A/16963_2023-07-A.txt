Footnotes
MODERN MIDAS bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace between foes, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the
turn, gained four wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. TWO CHUCKLES was hustled from
the gate, bumped with a rival early then was taken up, steadied near the nine-sixteenths, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, shifted five wide
while gaining into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and willingly earned the place. WOODSIDE WARRIOR was hustled to the front,
showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, shortened stride under a drive in upper
stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and weakened but held the show. TUNNEL VISION was hustled from the start, chased the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MILAGROSO was sent from the gate then
chased the pace, dropped back four wide on the turn and capitulated. ONE FOR MY BROTHER bumped with a foe at the start, chased inside through the
turn and also capitulated. FORWARD CAST dropped well behind while ridden along, went four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path nearing the
quarter-pole and was no factor. MAJESTIC HEART broke in at the start, bumped with a rival early, was urged along off the pace, dropped back while
moving from the three path to the rail on the turn and failed to respond.

three-sixteenths to go and edged away under a drive kept to task. DIAMOND HANDS broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand

of the rest. CANDLE chased three then two wide, tipped out three wide midway on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the end. VIENNA CODE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the

VICTORY WAY was forced out at the start then bumped with a foe, established a forward position early, was rated under a snug hold while inside of an
opponent starting at the three-quarter pole, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead into upper stretch,
battled outside the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. FILM STAR
showed speed then dropped just off the pace, was asked to move forward near the five-eighths pole then gained to make an outside bid, vied in the three
path on the turn, took the advantage inside the five-sixteenths, was headed by the winner into upper stretch, fought on with that foe to near the
sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place. WHITTINGTON PARK settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole,
shifted from three to four wide early on the turn, gained late on that bend, pursued the top two in the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead late and
finished willingly for the show. COSTA TERRA bumped with foes on both sides just after the start, settled off the pace, was urged while inside to the two
path early on the turn, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SHIPSATIONAL broke
out then brushed with a foe, settled between horses, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond. RESERVE CURRENCY settled off the pace,
was roused outside the five-eighths pole, traveled around the turn in the two path and also failed to respond. MR. SWAGGER bumped with a rival after the
start, settled on the outside, was caught five wide early on the turn, angled to the rail near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground from that point into the stretch
then moved out and had nothing left. BEZOS broke in but came out in front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path,
lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
NORTHERN INVADER bobbled at the start but broke towards the front, came out some early then was bumped in the hindquarters, was rated off the pace,
moved up three wide on the turn, rallied to the lead while four wide into upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and drew away under a solid
hand-ride to win ridden out. TORIGO bumped with a rival early, was rated off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the turn, swung six wide into the
stretch, swapped back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner. RIGHT TO WIN (IRE) bumped with an
opponent early, was reserved on the outside without the benefit of the cover, bumped hard multiple times with WEYHILL ROAD while keeping that foe
behind horses near the half-mile pole, dropped from the four path to the three path early on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came five wide
into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lost the place while clear for the show. WEYHILL ROAD bumped with a foe early, was rated off
the pace, bumped hard multiple times with a rival while trying to get to the outside near the half-mile pole then steadied, dropped from the two path to the
hedge early on the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. GOLD FRANC (IRE) was rated on the inside, moved closer early on
the turn then drafted behind the leader along the hedge, was asked when a hole opened on the inside at the quarter-pole, chased past the three-sixteenths
and came up empty. FAST BOAT TO SKYE went to the front then moved clear, extended the advantage midway down the backstretch, raced inside on the
turn, came out under pressure into the stretch then jostled with a foe and gave way. PAXSATIONAL stalked the pace on the outside then dropped further
behind the leader, moved closer in the two path on the turn, jostled with a foe while three wide into the stretch then steadied and came up empty. VENGE
drifted inward at the start, settled towards the rear, saved ground while asked on the turn and failed to threaten. MEMPHIS broke awkwardly and was off
slow, spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two path and never reached contention. CUBANO was a bit slow into stride, raced on the
outside towards the rear under stout restraint, went three wide while roused on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
FORT BRAGG stumbled at the start, recovered to settle six paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, advanced into the turn into closest
aim then latched on with three furlongs to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and hooked up head to head with SAUDI CROWN swinging four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking narrow command a furlong from home, battled on gamely trading a minor bump near the sixteenth
marker before prevailing by a nostril on the wire. SAUDI CROWN broke in at the start bumping PROVE RIGHT, established the front shortly after the start
and showed the way in hand four then three wide through swift splits, had the aforementioned foe advance outside and came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch bracing for head to head combat, dug in and was collared a furlong out, fought on gamely inside to the
finish but was ultimately denied at the end while well clear of the rest. HARRODSBURG four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. JOEY FRESHWATER chased six then five wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered five wide into upper stretch, tired. ALTERNATE REALITY bobbled at the break, chased four wide down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing midway, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch, made no impact.
PROVE RIGHT got bumped at the start by SAUDI CROWN, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch, tired.

kicked clear while asked for his best in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. BREW PUB came away in front then wasn?t asked for speed,
settled off the pace, dropped back while climbing a bit into the kickback outside the five-eighths then came under coaxing, went three then four wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and got up for the place. WINTERS LION was rated just off the pace, came under urging while three to four
wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and missed the place while just able to get the show. VARATTI went to the front, set
the pace under pressure to his outside, was asked along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the winner at the quarter-pole and weakened then was caught
for the trifecta. SOUTH STREET was last to commence, settled at the rear of the field, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the two path, shifted
three wide late on the bend then was driven four wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. BAD TO THE BONES was rated just off the pace, came under
urging late on the backstretch, chased inside through the turn and tired. TWELTH MAN settled just off the pace, was asked between horses while two then

Footnotes
MIRACLE MIKE tracked along the inside near the rear of the field, tipped to the two path into the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
out eight wide into upper stretch, then offered up a good finish surging home to overthrow the leader in the last jumps to the wire. FAST STUDY broke out at
the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced along the rail, cut the
corner into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, edged clear under a drive through to inside the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and
was overthrown in the final strides to the finish and forced to settle for the place honors. YOUR MISSION got steadied at the start when the aforementioned
foe broke outwards, chased five then four wide, altered out five wide briefly as DRUID tipped out in front due to MUNNY FOR NUTHIN altering at the
three-eighths, got placed to coaxing at that juncture, went seven wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. OCTOBER BLISS four then
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, brushed with AULA nearing the eighth pole and offered up
a mild kick. AULA two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, got brushed by OCTOBER
BLISS nearing the eighth pole and offered up a mild bid. DRUID chased four wide until nudged five wide by MUNNY FOR NUTHIN three furlongs from
home forcing YOUR MISSION to alter out in behind, came under coaxing at that station, went six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the
finish. AWESOME FORCE two to three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. METAMORPHOSES tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and offered no response. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got let out spinning three
wide into upper stretch, yielded the front to FAST STUDY who rallied up the inside straightened away, then weakened to the finish. MUNNY FOR NUTHIN
tracked the front just off the inside from just off the pace, tipped three then four wide forcing DRUID outwards at the three-eighths and in turn forcing YOUR
MISSION to alter out, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, FAST
STUDY HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.
