BLUE EVEN SCORE bumped with BRIANA HARPER at the start, was rated off the rail on the backstretch, roused two wide on the bend, fanned out further
for he stretch run, rallied under urging and swept past TINA'S TAPIZAR the last twenty yards. TINA'S TAPIZAR soon shared the early lead from inside,
moved clear when asked upper stretch, began to wear down inside the final furlong, was outfinished but easily second best. BRIANA HARPER a step slow
at the start, was caught in crowding just out of the gate, bumped with BLUE EVEN SCORE, was hustled along between rivals, advanced from inside on the
turn then could only move clear for third late. DART ATTACK broke in stride, was soon engaged by TINA'S TAPIZAR from inside then began to give way in
the lane. FERGIE ATTACK fractious in the gate, soon trailed, stayed well off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
WARM BEAUTY was away slowly, void of speed though hustled after the break, picked up her pace along the rail on the bend, angled out widest upper
stretch, was all out and quickly overtook HALLIE'S RAINBOW nearing the wire. HALLIE'S RAINBOW set a pressured pace between horses on the
backstretch, moved clear along the rail, was roused leaving the turn, lengthened command but did not have enough left in the waning yards. VIVA
VIOLENCE prominent between horses, advanced three wide on the bend then leveled off the last furlong. SENORITA AURORA well placed from inside,
began to flatten out before finishing a half mile. AMARI S. pressed from outside, did not keep up two wide on the bend and also flattened out for the drive.

ZARMAE broke outward, bumping GEORGE'S VISION, was kept close just off the inside, split horses two wide at the halfway point, quickly moved clear
under urging, was just off the inside entering the lane, floated out some inside the last eighth, was challenged nearing the sixteenth marker, dug in, leaned
on GEORGE'S VISION through the waning yards and prevailed. GEORGE'S VISION was taken outside early on, angled in entering the second turn, altered
outside ZARMAE upper stretch, engaged the latter nearing the final sixteenth, lugged in some in the late going, leaning on ZARMAE, did not have enough
nearing the wire but proved easily second best. ARGYBARGY BUCK shared the early lead from outside, did not stay with ZARMAE after a half mile, came
into the stretch from path four and flattened out. OKLAHOMA HEAT failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. COPPER CROSSING was sent to dispute the
pace from inside, also did not stay with ZARMAE after a half mile, came off the rail some on the second bend, altered in for a better path upper stretch but
had little to offer.

FEVER NATION hesitated at the break but moved clear of the rest after the first sixteenth, showed the way in hand, had the rail through the bend, was
roused the final furlong and kept LAYTON THE DAY at bay. LAYTON THE DAY pressed FEVER NATION from just outside and lacked the extra needed
deep stretch. BUREAU well placed inside from the early going, ran evenly in the lane and found himself boxed in through the waning yards. EL RAYO in
contention early, did not stay close while saving ground through the bend, angled out widest upper stretch and had no late bid. A MERRY HEART
somewhat fractious in the gate, was a factor on the backstretch but began to fade three wide on the turn.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD MINISTRY moved clear of the rest from inside after travelling the first eighth, was just off the rail on the bend, floated out entering the lane,
steadily drifted out, held a straight path the final sixteenth and drew off. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS prominent between horses, went for the lead outside
WILDWOOD MINISTRY on the turn, lost ground staying outside the latter into the stretch, altered inside WILDWOOD MINISTRY when that one took his
path inside the last eighth, was no match for the leader in the late going but pulled away for the place. SECRET HONOR soon overcame an awkward start
to be a contender from outside, closed the gap widest on the bend, lost further ground staying outside GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS into the lane, gradually
angled in as he wore down inside the final furlong and narrowly held his position. DRAGGING MAIN void of early speed, was just off the inside taking the
turn and had no late bid. MY KINDA TETON was an early factor, saved ground through the bend then gave way for the drive. RA'DOM showed little. The
rider of GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS lodged an objection alleging interference from WILDWOOD MINISTRY inside the final furlong. After their review, the
stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
HIGHLY PERFECT in hand early from outside, was let out after two furlongs, came into contention two wide on the bend, quickly took the lead three wide
upper stretch, gradually angled in and steadily pulled away under mild urging. ST. LOUIE LOUIE was away somewhat slowly, rushed up from inside to
dispute the pace, floated out a bit into the lane, lugged in slightly nearing the eighth pole, angled out inside the final furlong and could only draw clear for
second. TRUIST also settled early, commenced his bid after a quarter mile, had the rail through the bend, was steadied as his path narrowed midstretch,
altered out and was unchallenged for the show. BLEEDING BLUE slow and somewhat awkward at the break, was hustled up to dispute the pace outside
ST. LOUIE LOUIE, began to drift out leaving the turn, continued to drift entering the stretch and steadily gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into
TRUIST'S loss of action midstretch but no action was taken by them after their review.

Footnotes
REBA ATTACK stalked the early speed from between rivals, went for the lead three wide on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, took the
advantage and began to draw off approaching the final sixteenth. TU ROYAL vied for the lead briefly, did not stay with CAHOKIA POSSE after a furlong,
came to the latter from just outside on the turn, battled for second in the stretch and began to edge ahead of CAHOKIA POSSE the last sixteenth. CAHOKIA
POSSE hesitated at the break, was encouraged to vie for the early lead, moved clear after a furlong, was challenged from outside on the bend, fought for
second in the lane but gradually yielded the final sixteenth. NAPABIT crowded briefly at the break, raced in contention from outside on the backstretch,
advanced four wide on the turn to threaten, fanned outside REBA ATTACK for the stretch run and could only just hold her position late. TOUR DE' PORT
bobbled a bit just after the start, was well placed just off the inside, retreated some on the bend, came into the stretch from path three and also failed to have
a stretch bid. LADY WHITE SOX brushed with NAPABIT at the start, was a factor between horses on the backstretch but began to fade nearing the end of
three furlongs. CALVIN'S GIRL also somewhat slow at the break, was soon well back, angled in midway on the backstretch, two wide through the turn and
had little for the drive. SKIP TO BALI hesitant and somewhat awkward at the start, was an early factor between rivals, moved to the inside nearing the bend
and gave way before finishing three furlongs.
