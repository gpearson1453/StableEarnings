Footnotes
KATIE'S C behind the early pace along the inside, crept closer in the turn while well in hand, angled out a bit and engaged the winner entering the stretch,
disposed of that one and drew clear. THROUGH THE CRACKS with the pace out of the chute inside, continued to vie into the turn, briefly shook clear late in
the turn, joined by the winner soon after, offered brief resistance then could not keep up. STOP SHOP N DROP lacked speed inside, cut the corner into the
lane to improve position, finished best of the rest while not a threat to the top two late. DARING DARIAN back off the pace, moved closer four wide into the
lane, also flattened out in the final furlong. SARATOGA KAREN vied up front while three wide up the backstretch and into the turn, began to weaken late in
the turn. AUNT JANA last away, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LUCKY HARBORAGE was
finished early. SLIDE vied up front early while between foes, stopped early in the turn, distanced late after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
GUITAR TRIBUTE outrun for six furlongs while moving out, came five wide for the drive, rallied down the middle of the strip and closed with good resolve to
be up in time. PAYDAY TOO back off the pace, moved closer toward the inside second turn, switched out for room when straightened for home, also
finished willingly while well out in the strip only to miss. HELLUVA LIFE in the second flight off the inside, ranged up to challenge four wide in the second
turn, vied into and through upper stretch, not enough for the top two late. MUFFIN NUTS dueled up front along the inside, continued to vie while closest to
the inside stretch, weakened. GALLANT STAR last to leave, recovered quickly to move up to a forward position before a quarter, challenged three wide and
between horses second turn, held a slight advantage past the furlong marker then faltered late. OUTLAW X. dueled up front, gave way in the second turn.
BINDING fell back to trail after the start, never menaced.

Footnotes
IZZY'S BABY BOY tracked the leader from the outside up the backstretch, asked along in the turn, began to rally entering the stretch while remaining
outside, closed with good resolve to collar the winner late. JAZZ IT UP pressed the issue early off the inside, advanced and lodged a bid midway on the
turn, took over, clear past the furlong marker, could not contan the winner, remained clear for the second spot. TANGO CHARLIE in mid pack early,
advanced through the turn along the inside, slowly gaining for the second spot late. GETCHA fell back to trail after the start, four wide through the turn,
improved position through the stretch, no threat to the top three. MONZZA forwardly placed early while breaking in good order, faded. QUEST FOR
AVETTE broke on top, set the early pace, raced on equal terms with the winner late turn then began to weaken when headed by that one into the stretch.
COMPLEX SYSTEM was finished early, well back.

Footnotes
STAR MOMENT stalked the pace three wide, challenged on the outside into the far turn, vied, kicked clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the end
under steady handling. ALLIACEOUS unhurried early, advanced into a striking position far turn, chased the winner upper stretch, could not get to that one
while drifting out in midstretch, clearly second best. MISS JANA broke in then steadied to be last away, continued to trail first turn, closer four wide second
turn, continued with a mild rally to capture the show while not a threat to the top two. OUR LITTLE GIRL back early, continued to lag second turn, four wide
into the lane while still able to see them all, staged a belated rally well out in the course to be gaining for the show. SNOWBALL rank in the first turn then
steadied toward the inside, raced in mid pack up the backstretch, checked up in traffic into the far turn, went evenly through the lane after recovering.
STRUMMER back off the pace toward the inside, bothered then was steadied in traffic far turn, fell back and failed to threaten through the lane. CRIDER
CHASE dueled up front off the inside, extended that advantage before a half, vied into the final bend, faltered in the drive. BLESSED ASSURANCE dueled
early along the inside, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
GOTTEMINABIND dueled early off the inside, disposed of that foe in the turn before being joined from the outside by the winner into the stretch, long drive,
proved best by digging late in game fashion. ZIPPING MOLLY in the second flight up the backstretch, engaged the winner from the outside late in the turn,
spirited stretch duel, outgamed late, well clear of the others. ZONG WAVE in mid pack for a half, advanced to be closest to the top two out of the turn in the
three path, proved no match for that pair to the wire, well clear of the others. SUNSET FLASH void of speed, moved out, was five wide out of the turn,
turned a mild rally down the middle of the strip to improve position. MINT JULIUS bumped at the start, lacked any early foot, three wide and in some traffic
into the stretch, improved position. BRITNEY B. within striking distance early, fell back three wide through the turn then went evenly through the stretch. LA
LOLA in the second group early, chased the top two late in the turn then began to weaken. LOVE CREED settled in mid pack early, had nothing for the
drive. DREAMED I AM FAST dueled up the backstretch inside the winner, gave way early in the turn. MALLORY UNBRIDLED was never dangerous.
LUCCA'S LILYBY broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded, broke in, bumped inner foes, was always outrun.

Footnotes
TAKNTOTHECLEANERS close from the start, took command from between horses into the far turn, clear by late in the bend, steadily drew out through the
straight under steady handling. CHEAPSKATE DIVA within striking distance, moved closer to the winner in the three path late in the final turn, proved no
match for that one through the stretch, well clear for the place. ANOTHER HOT MESS void of speed while saving some ground, began to move into the far
turn, came four wide for the drive, rallied to be in time for the show, not a threat to the top pair. EVE'S DELIGHT settled in mid pack, saved some ground
second turn, moved out for the drive, advanced to race closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit and was caught for the show.
WHOLELOTTAMO back off the pace, was floated out a bit by ANOTHER HOT MESS turning for home while unable to keep pace with that one into the
lane, improved a bit late while not a serious threat. SKYKAT void of speed, continued to lag through the second turn, showed some belated interest while
not a serious threat. CAVE CREEK settled in mid pack, came up empty for the drive. GATHER AS YOU GO broke on top, set the pace along the inside,
gave way in the second turn. TEASIN' TESLA away in good order, pressed, stopped. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF WHOLELOTTAMO AGAINST
ANOTHER HOT MESS FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE FINAL TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SILENT POWER unhurried early just off the inside, moved closer second turn, challenged from between rivals turning for home, dueled past the furlong
marker inside the runner up then outfinished that one late in a determined effort. FATHER RED lacked speed, advanced and challenged four wide turning
into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker outside the winner, outkicked in the late going, fully extended to hold the place. RICKY BOBBY fell back to
trail well back early, continued to lack speed into the far turn, came four wide fore the drive, steady gain on the runner up late, well clear of the others. NO
WHITE FLAGS broke through the gate prior to the start, balked at reloading, broke with the field, settled, closer between rivals late in the final turn, flattened
out a bit through the lane to finish up evenly. BRITE OUTLOOK moved up to duel inside, put the other speed away by midway on the final turn to be briefly
clear, caved in when headed in upper stretch. FAHAN forwardly placed early, shuffled back from between the two frontrunners in the first turn, chased that
pair onto the backstretch, was finished after a half. EUROBELIEVER dueled up front off the inside, stopped second turn, jogged in well back.

Footnotes
MONAASIB unhurried past the wire the first time in the two path, continued back under light restraint up the backstretch, picked way inside and through
traffic under clever handling through the second turn, prominent into the lane, split foes, took over a furlong out, extended that advantage a bit halfway to the
wire, enough left to withstand the runner up in the final strides. WOODS N WATER settled off the pace while off the inside, also rated in the run up the
backstretch, advanced into contention on the outside second turn, was five wide into the lane to lose ground to the winner,continued to advance past the
furlong marker, saw that progress stall a bit a sixteenth out, late push at the wire to be getting to the winner, missed. BUDRO TALKING void of early foot,
began to advance from between horses into the far turn, traffic through that bend, was five wide and behind the runner up into the stretch, finished willingly
late to be getting to that rival and the winner in the late going. FIRST GLIMPSE forward, four wide behind the two leaders turning for home, four wide bid
upper straight, vied past the furlong marker then went flat late. FORTUITY closest to the leader, took over in the two path late in the final bend, vied past the
furlong marker closest to the rail and weakened. PEACOCK KITTEN lacked speed, continued well back while three wide through the final turn, showed
some belated interest to improve position. STRONG EAGLE in mid pack early, fell back near the back the middle half, bettered position a bit through the
stretch without posing a serious threat. INTIMIDATION void of speed while inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, improved position
while also never seriously menacing. MUNQAD away in good order, cleared before a quarter, set the pace for six furlongs, gave way when headed late in
the final turn. MACHINE GUN MAN within striking distance for six furlongs, backed up through the stretch. CHROME BABY three wide when in mid pack
through the first turn, continued outside and tired while five to six wide in the second bend.

Footnotes
TROSKA in the second flight while between foes into the turn, advanced along the inside, dueled, wore down the early leader inside that one to edge clear
late. KRAZY KATIE broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded, broke sharp, quickly clear, responded when challenged by the winner while outside
that one, remained clear for the place. STRUMMIN MARY in the second flight along the inside, had little for the top two in the drive, finished up best of the
rest. DEE'S LIL FOOL fell back to trail after the start, continued to see them all out of the turn well off the inside, steered out to be widest for the drive,
improved position with some late interest. IAM DAKOTA in the second group while outside, weakened in the drive. NATURALBORNSENDER steadied at
the break to be last away, improved into the lane, went flat the final furlong. PLEADING GUILTY failed to menace. LADY KRISTEN steadied a bit at the
break, midpack, faded through the stretch.
