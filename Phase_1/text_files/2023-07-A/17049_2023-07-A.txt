Footnotes
FRENCH ROSE stalked outside, advanced to take over three-wide in late turn, opened up passing eighth pole, gradually drew out. WAIT A SEC had
outside speed to lead early, tracked leader off rail turn, made a bid between horses in late turn, couldn't go with the winner, gave best to wire. SWEET
DESIGN stalked off rail, rallied for show. KIM'S TEXAS BLING saved ground, passed a tired rival. MISS Z stumbled at the break, moved to short clear lead,
took inside turn, challenged late turn, gave way, faded.
