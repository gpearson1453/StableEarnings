Footnotes
ROSES FOR DEBRA broke out a step at the start bumping ADAAY IN ASIA, tracked the pace along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, split foes nearing the eighth pole to seize command outside that station, then edged clear to the finish. MAIL ORDER broke a beat slow when
away awkward, chased along the inside briefly before tipping to the three path, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing inside the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MAJESTIC D'ORO chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while prevailing in the battle for the show honors. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) got
bumped at the start by ROSES FOR DEBRA, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late going. SISTER ANNIE a bit keen pulling early on, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, got set
down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared nearing the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish.

Footnotes
WONDER GIRL came away in good order, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was asked in the two path
into the stretch then came under a right-handed crop, was brushed in the hindquarters by the runner-up when that foe came in inside the three-sixteenths,
battled inside that foe into the final furlong, drifted out about three paths when switched to a left-handed crop inside the eighth-pole and carried out the
unofficial runner-up, swapped leads back and forth while taking a straight course into the final sixteenth, gained a slightly larger advantage over the
runner-up at that point, switched back to her inside lead while drifting out about three paths a few strides from the wire and held. NIGHTSABER (GB) settled
just behind the leader on the inside, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide coming to the quarter-pole, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, drifted
in under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths and brushed with the unofficial winner, fought on even terms while both took a straight course into
the final furlong, was carried out a few paths outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted out on her own and dropped close to three-quarters behind just inside the
sixteenth-pole, checked off the heels of the unofficial winner while beaten but in a precarious position late and missed but held the place. FANCY STAX
settled off the pace, bobbled outside the five-eighths, angled in towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, dropped to the hedge approaching
the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, gained into the final furlong and finished with good courage for the show. BELLESHAZZA
settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LEXI'S SPIRIT broke in and
bumped with a foe, stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and came up empty. JUST A
SPLASH (IRE) was bumped at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
also came up empty. SOLEVO SPRITZ was taken in hand early then guided in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came off the hedge into upper stretch
and was no factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND RIDER CLAIM OF FOUL, WONDER GIRL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND
PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG.

repair in the paddock, REIGNING CHICK broke a half a beat slow, ranged up to establish the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came
under urging at the five-sixteenths and was displaced from the front inside that station, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, folded, and was eased
home through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
VALENZAN DAY went to the front, was well rated while off the inside, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down into upper
stretch, was given two pops of a right-handed crop between the furlong marker and the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. UNION
LIGHTS settled just off the pace while well off the inside, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground while in hand early on the turn, was asked near the
three-eighths then shifted three wide, chased the winner under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker
and was second best. CUMBERLAND BLUES settled on the outside, passed the five-eighths pole under urging, was roused for more while moving from
three to five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path approaching the quarter-pole, shifted closer to the rail in the stretch and safely secured the show.
BLU GROTTO dropped back while showing no speed then came under urging, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole, raced
between foes into the final furlong and failed to threaten. BERT BERT BERT broke a step slow, settled at the rear, moved closer late on the backstretch,
was asked while dropping from the three path to the rail on the turn, came off the inside in upper stretch and failed to respond. CHEEKY TICO tracked the
pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was given his cue inside the three-eighths pole, chased into the stretch and tired.

DRAKE'S PASSAGE was rated just off the pace, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, made a bid in the three to four path on the turn, took a short lead
while set down into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop
near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. CICCIOBELLO went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two
path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch, fought on well with that foe in the final furlong but missed
while well clear for the place. COLLOQUY was well placed just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was asked late on that bend then driven five
wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SAFALOW'S MISSION settled off the pace, dropped from the two path
to the rail early on the turn then was roused, saved ground into the stretch and failed to rally. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE settled off the pace, was roused three
then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SON OF AN EX moved out while settling towards the rear, moved closer
leaving the backstretch, was roused five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. ACHILLES HEEL settled on the far outside,
was caught six then five wide early on the turn then moved to the three path, reached the two path near the three-eighths and failed to respond.
PINEAPPLE MAN settled just off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BALTASAR six paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the front, tucked four wide through the turn and was patiently handled while advancing to
stack outside the top pair, took over command swinging five wide into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, then edged clear under a drive to
prevail. ICE ROAD broke out at the start bumping LEONIDS in tandem with RED D G P, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got
set down angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. SKYLANDER got bumped at the start by MAGICAL WAYS, who broke
outwards, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, got let out spinning five wide into upper stretch, ran
on to procure the show honors. RED D G P broke in at the start bumping LEONIDS in concert with ICE ROAD, came under coaxing and prompted the pace
four then two wide loosely between foes, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. LEONIDS got bumped between foes who each
broke his way at the start, came under coaxing and established the front soon after and showed the way two to three wide under some pressure from the
aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under pressure from a pair, spun just off the inside into upper stretch yielding
command at that juncture and weakened in the late going. MAGICAL WAYS broke out at the start bumping SKYLANDER, chased two to three wide until
tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. IMPROPER coaxed from the gate,
chased four wide down the backstretch before tucking three then two wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and tired. LIFE AND LIGHT stumbled badly at the start falling to his face before recovering, chased five then four wide down the
backstretch and then four to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact.

Footnotes
DAKOTA GOLD brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, traveled around most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, rallied five wide
into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead near the sixteenth-pole
and proved much the best under strong handling. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN brushed with a foe at the start, settled at the rear, was roused while two then
three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and just got up for the place. JERRY THE NIPPER was rated just off the pace, drafted inside to the
two path on the turn, was asked three wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no
match then was caught for the place while clear for the show. HUSH OF A STORM bobbled nearing the seven-eighths, was reserved towards the back,
saved ground on the turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. RUSE prompted the pace
on the outside then in the two path on the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. CALL ME HARRY
went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival, was asked while along the hedge on the turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths, dropped back
into upper stretch and gave way. COLD HARD CASH was reserved on the outside, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up
empty then collapsed post race and was reported to have suffered a fatal cardiac event.

Footnotes
MAYTHISBETHEONE chased three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch,
offered up a good finish to close stoutly on the outside getting up in the final jumps to the finish to score. CONQUIST established the front shortly after the
start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch set down for the drive,
edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE chased
two to three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up
a mild kick to procure the show honors. ZAPRUDER chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn coming
under coaxing midway, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. BARRY THE BUILDER broke in brushing the near side stall at the
start, rushed up tucking in front of KID EMERALD forcing that rival to steady briefly nearing the seven furlong marker, settled just off the pace just off the
inside, came under coaxing along the inside at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and stayed on one paced to the
end. IN MY SHADOW tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, kept on to the wire but was outfinished
in the late stages. SOCIAL SIDEKICK broke a beat slow and then bobbled slightly and lost his lane, raced three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, made no headway. OVER THE CAP chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. KID EMERALD got steadied off the heels of BARRY THE BUILDER near the
seven-eighths when that rival tucked in front and lost about a length of ground, chased four then three wide to the three-eighths, tucked to the two path at
that station and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BIG BOULDER chased two to three
wide, came under coaxing tucked inside at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.
