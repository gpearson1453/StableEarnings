Footnotes
VICTORY BOULEVARD settled near the back down the backstretch then was asked with three furlongs left and moved out to three wide at the quarter pole
and collared the leader at the top of the stretch and drew off. PODEROSO EQUS tracked the leader around the turn then moved along side VICTORY
BOULEVARD entering the stretch from four wide and held off the inside rival in deep stretch to be second best. KICK IT was off the pace from off the rail
through the turn then moved up inside of PODEROSO EQUS in upper stretch and battled down the stretch with that one but was no match for the winner.
LIL LATIGO went to a clear lead to the quarter pole when he was caught and weakened. GRAND ROYALE trailed early then moved up from four wide on
the backstretch and flattened out. CLIFTON PARK saved ground to the turn then made a mild inside bid on the turn and dropped back entering the stretch.

LOCO LUNA was rushed to the lead from under pressure to set all the pace then pulled away in the stretch to prove best. INCREDIBE MO race in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up on the turn from two or three wide, tipped in to make a rail bid in the stretch to prove to be second
best. LINEARSPEED prompted the pace to the top of the stretch , had no response in the drive and weakened. ORO was off the pace to the top of the
stretch and was empty in the drive but finished evenly. SWAY BACK WHEN raced in the middle of the pack but failed to menace. TIZKANDOIT was allowed
to settle near the back then made a mild bid on the turn and improved position. GOSPEL PIPELINER was close up while saving ground to midway down the
backstretch and retreated. COMFORT KISS was forwardly placed to the turn then had to check at the three furlong marker and dropped back. LUCKY
LIQUOR SHOT was unprepared at the start and remained back.

JUST REMEMBER pressed the pace to the three furlong marker then took the lead, edged away on the turn and held off the late closer for the win. CALL
THE SHOTS tracked the leaders to mid turn then was asked at the five sixteenths pole, made a three wide run and closed the fastest but finish line came
too soon and settled for second best. LA ROSA DRIVE went to a pressured lead to the three furlong marker when she was headed and fought gamely to
mid stretch but was a clear third. KALLINIKI vied for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker and faded. TOTHEMOONANDBACK was off slow
and trailed the field by several lengths and remained back. OUT OF THE SKY was off the pace to the turn while saving ground and dropped back.

Footnotes
TERRACOTTA SOLDIER had no speed to the turn, saved ground around the turn then moved out to the two path in upper stretch and tipped back to the
inside to make a late rail bid to be up in the final jumps. PARTYOFSIXTEEN raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then moved out to four wide in
upper stretch to rally but was out kicked in the final jumps. QUICKTRIP VAN dueled for the lead to the three furlong marker then inched away but was
headed again at the quarter pole and matched strides nearing the eighth pole and inched away again but was nailed by inside and outside closers. JONO
pressed the pace through the turn then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and dueled to the eighth pole and weakened. WHEELER DEALER off pace
through the turn then made a three wide bid but failed to sustain that bid. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST was in the middle of the pack while racing widest of all.
KNIGHTED raced near the back and passed tiring rivals. TOO LATE was forwardly place to the top of the stretch and tired. LEFT THE BAR was last away
then rushed up to take a brief lead and was eclipsed at the three furlong marked and gave way.
