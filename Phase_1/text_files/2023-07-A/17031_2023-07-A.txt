GERARD dueled along the inside in opening strides, battled on around the turn, shook free along the rail turning for home then angled tipped wider in upper
stretch, led the way by a slim margin a furlong out then widened advantage and held firm. TIZHOTNDUSTY raced in striking distance in opening stages,
edged up leaving the backstretch and dueled tree wide around the turn, could not match strides with the eventual winner at the head of the lane but
sustained good response to the wire. LIGHTNING STRUCK tracked the embattled leaders in early stages, saved ground around the turn then tipped three
wide for the drive, responded under steady urging and secured a share. GRAVES MILL ROAD raced off the top flight up the backstretch, hustled along two
wide around the turn, shifted out wider for a clear path in upper stretch and finished with interest. AMERICAIN JOEY vied two wide between foes in the
opening quarter, continued to battle for command around the turn, shifted inside upper stretch, moved up into close contention a furlong out then gave way.
POP'S BISCUIT tracked the embattled top flight through the early going, was ridden along four wide around the turn and failed to respond.

GUIDED ARROW was forwardly placed racing just off the leader in opening stages, let out a notch and took over the lead midway up the backstretch, held
firm along the inside around the turn, saved ground into the lane, had plenty left in the tank, drew off and kept to task while ridden out. SPEEDBAYOU
tracked the pace in early stages, launched a rail bid late on the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on for second best. CONSTITUTION
DAY led the way in opening stages then conceded position to GUIDED ARROW midway up the backstretch, remained forwardly placed behind rival into the
turn, hustled along two to three wide down the lane and stayed on for a share. PANZER PRIDE was not too far back in early stages racing two wide,
flattened after entering the turn, hustled along the inside in the lane and gained on show. SKYFLYER tracked the early pace along the outside, hustled
along three wide around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and flattened out. CLASSY CROWE dwelt at the start and trailed throughout. STEWARDS

Footnotes
BLUESKIESANDANGELS was allowed to settle off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide late on the turn, swung four to five wide into the lane,
responded willingly when called upon and kicked clear in the final furlong. AWESOME FAMILY tracked the pace into the turn, raced two wide then tipped
three to four wide for the drive, responded under pressure, closed with response and captured place. ESKENFORIT took over the lead moving through the
backstretch, vied for command with HOLIDAY TICKET at the quarter pole, battled on into stretch run then flattened late. MAPACHE G raced off the early
pace, hustled along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HOLIDAY TICKET was forwardly placed in opening stages, moved up to challenge
ESKENFORIT at the quarter pole, continued to battle for command into the final furlong then gave way. CAPTAIN DON raced up close in the early going,
chased along the inside around the turn then weakened in the lane. HUNK OF A HIT was off slow at the start and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
DEMIDANU was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, advanced to engage DAMASCUS GATE for the lead entering the turn, battled on through the lane,
dug in gamely in final stages and finished on equal terms with GIRLS IN CHARGE. GIRLS IN CHARGE was nicely rated sitting just off the compact top
flight, let out a notch and picked up the tempo three to four wide approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, advanced into striking
distance, dug in determinedly in final strides and finished on equal terms for the win. PEGGY RULES tracked up close along the rail in early stages, lacked
racing room and waited patiently around the turn, slipped through the inside turning for home, roused forward to challenge rivals for the lead, battled on just
past the sixteenth pole then flattened out. RAISIN RAISIN raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide around the turn and failed to threaten.
DAMASCUS GATE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead around the turn then tired in the drive. FIT AND FAMOUS showed brief speed
then retreated.

Footnotes
ESPE'S GUY held a slim lead around the first turn, took on the challenge from STAR OF MINE and dueled up the backstretch, battled into the far turn,
shook free past the quarter pole, widened to a clear advantage a furlong out and kept clear under steady urging. WELLER ROGUE rated along inside while
never far off the frontend, was ridden along two wide mid-way around the far turn, shifted to the inside then tipped back out two wide upper stretch and
sustained a solid bid. MIDNIGHT RULES was unhurried and raced well off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane, finished strongly and captured
show. JUSTICE ONCE was reserved racing well off the pace, shifted out and given cue in upper stretch, finished with good response and just missed show.
TAP THE BRAKES tracked the pace up the backstretch, loomed a threat at the quarter pole, ran on into upper stretch then flattened out.
DREADPIRATEROBERTS stalked the pace through early stages, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, failed to advance and steadily weakened.
PISTOL PACKIN MAN was off slow at the start and failed to move into contention. STAR OF MINE was forwardly placed around the first turn, dueled with
the eventual winner up the backstretch, batted on around the far turn the tired in the drive.
