KNIGHT COMMANDER got bumped at the start and raced off the pace in the opening quarter, picked up the tempo approaching the quarter pole, swung
four wide into the lane, responded under right handed pressure and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. CHINLEE got bumped between rivals at the start and
settled off the early pace, urged four wide late on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, steadily edged closer and captured place. TOSKA'S RULER sped
to the lead at the start, held firm around the turn, continued to lead the way past the sixteenth pole then got overtaken by the winner. JUSTA STREAK
pressed the pace up the backstretch, remained forwardly positioned into upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. LORD OF THE PALACE raced
three wide in contention in the opening quarter, sustained bid around then gave way. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD broke out at the start, chased the pace along
the inside and never threatened.

BUZZER was away in good order and raced three wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, launched a bid for HUNKA BURNING
LOVE near the quarter pole, could not reach the leader but stayed on gamely, edged back up into striking distance, dug in two wide under firm handling and
got up late. HUNKA BURNING LOVE led the way around the first turn and set a pressured but soft pace up the backstretch, turned back the bid from
BUZZER leaving the far turn, came back under pressure from aforementioned rival a furlong out, fought back holding a slim lead along the inside then got
denied in final strides. CHARMING CHARLIE was forwardly placed around the first turn and applied pace pressure up the backstretch, flattened a bit when
called upon mid-way around the far turn, ran on two wide into stretch run then moved to the inside, sustained bid and cleared the rest. JOHN R was well
reserved racing in the back, swung two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. THREE FOR THREE raced four wide into the first turn and remained
reserved well off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and failed to kick on.

RASSLER was away in good order and vied for the lead along the outside, continued to match strides racing outside of WILD APPEAL midway around the
turn, shook free still unleashed past the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, quickly widened to a clear advantage, tapped a couple times in the final
furlong and kept to task while ridden out. HALLOW POINT rated in good position while never far off the pressured pace, picked up the tempo late on the
turn, swung three to four wide into the lane, steadily gained ground down the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but finished clearly second best.
RING BEARER vied for the lead in the opening quarter then sat just off the top pair, ran on three wide into the lane and secured show. WILD APPEAL vied
for the lead between foes in the opening quarter, battled inside of RASSLER around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner turning for home, ran
on to the eighth pole then came up empty. STROLLN WITH STELA raced in range along the early going, sustained bid around the turn then faded in the
lane. RIVERSPORT raced in contention in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
LAVENDER LIL was allowed to settle and save ground up the backstretch, edged closer along the rail then waited for racing room near the quarter pole,
came tow wide into upper stretch, shifted back to the rail, took over the lead a furlong out and kicked clear. SIMMERING was forwardly placed around the
first turn, stalked the leader up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid late on the far turn, continued in striking distance at the eighth pole, failed to kick on
with the leader and had to settle for second best. KAYLOR bobbled at the start, quickly recovered and was forwardly placed three wide around the first turn,
took over the lead and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, came under attack from both sides in upper stretch, got collared
approaching the eighth pole and weakened to show. RISKY WHISKY stalked the pace up the backstretch, flattened along the inside midway around the far
turn, ran on three then two wide and had a mild regain. THE AWFUL TRUTH settled off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide around the far
turn, briefly edged closer, flattened turning for home then passed a couple faders. KID BIZ rated off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and lacked
a needed rally. NAUTICAL MISS tracked the early pace, hustled along three wide around the far turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR dueled outside of ALYANAABI around the first turn and continued to match strides up the backstretch, remained locked in
battle on the inside around the far turn, shook free turning for home then took on the challenge from rail running AXTON, fought back gamely into final
strides and prevailed under a driving finish. AXTON was unhurried out of the gate and raced five wide entering the first turn, remained settled in the back
going through the backstretch, picked up the pace along the inside late on the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, quickly advanced to challenge
SHOULDABOUGHTABAR for the lead, dueled gamely along the rail and just missed. FINISH UP raced off the early pace, made a move three furlongs from
home, gained ground two wide near the quarter pole then tipped out four wide entering the lane, ranged up into striking distance then evened out late. BIG
PINES SANDY raced in range along the outside through middle stages, hustled up three to four wide around the far turn, drifted five wide and flattened
heading into the lane then had a mild regain without threatening late. RUNNINGFORCASH was forwardly placed along the rail in the first turn, stalked inside
up the backstretch, began to flatten three to four wide nearing the quarter pole came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ALYANAABI dueled
outside of SHOULDABOUGHTABAR around the first turn, continued to battle around the final turn, could not move on with eventual winner entering the
lane, ran on briefly then gave way. AIR JOCK raced in contention around the first turn then rated near mid-pack up the backstretch, flattened a bit entering
the far turn, chased two wide and retreated lane.
