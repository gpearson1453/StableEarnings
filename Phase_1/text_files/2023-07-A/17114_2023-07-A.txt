Footnotes
EVIL INTENTIONS hopped at the start, trailed down the backstretch, moved through the four path through the turn when gaining momentum, came into the
lane from the seven path then drove past and widened. SIX J STARLET was steadied at the start when bothered from outside rival, raced along the inside
through the turn and into the lane and rallied for the place spot. C V SCENIC LEGACY raced in the three or four path through the turn when never far back,
raced into the lane from the six path, was on near even terms for the lead with an eighth to go then weakened. HERE KITTY KITTY chased the pace from
the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path, was looking to split rivals inside the eighth pole, hole closed and was checked
sharply and lost ground. DEPUTY STAR vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane then gave way. HECTORS TROJANWIFE vied
for the lead two wide through the turn, was tiring when steadied near the sixteenth pole. JULEE FOREVER was never a factor while in the three path
through the turn and in the four path through the lane. MAJOR GRACE saved ground through the turn and into the lane and tired. SAHARAN FLEECE
stalked the duel from the three path into the turn and was done mid-turn. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #11 HERE KITTY KITTY AGAINST THE

Footnotes
CABOOSE vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, inched clear outside the eighth pole then was kept to the task to hold. SOLAR
POWER was in the three or four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path, had aim on the leader with an eighth to
go then could only slowly gain to the end. BUTCH'S BEST vied for the lead from the inside from the outset, lost contact with the leader outside the eighth
pole then stayed on to last for the show spot. FRUITCAKE was two wide through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and found energy late.
MARIACHI JUSTICE trailed for half while near the inside, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the six path through the final eighth and was
closing in. COWBOY IMAGE saved ground through the turn and lacked a closing response. DADDYS DREAM raced in the three or four path through the
turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the five path and weakened in the drive. ELUSIVE WARRIOR chased the pace from the two or three path
through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CORNINGSTONE was patiently handled down the backstretch with aim on the dueling leaders, moved to stalk that pair through late turn, swept past into
the lane and quickly cleared, was roused with a hand ride outside the eighth pole, widened until the sixteenth pole then was put in hand and geared down a
bit late. SASSY KATIE vied for the lead along the inside, was inching to the front in late turn when suddenly passed by the winner, stayed on well from the
two path through the lane and settled for second best. CRICKENBERGER was jostled between rivals at the start, settled to the back, angled to the inside
approaching the first turn, trailed for half, came off the inside and into the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path
and moved up for the minor share. RILEYS REDEMPTION vied for the lead while two wide through the turn and into the lane then gave way.
WILDCATJUSTICE dropped back into the far turn, trailed into the lane and passed tired ones. CIERRA EMPIRE never a factor while near the inside.
CHIMES saved ground into the far turn, raced along the rail into the lane, was in the two path for the drive and tired. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE was in the two
or three path through the turn then was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
KING ICE trailed early while off the inside, gained momentum into the far turn, bid four wide through mid-turn, was five wide in upper stretch when full of run,
collared the leader just inside the eighth pole, drove past and widened. CORONA GRANDE was unhurried while off the inside down the backstretch, bid
four wide through the far turn, gained the lead after straightening in the lane, was caught by the winner soon after then stayed on well while drifting to the
inside and finished second best. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE was in the two path through the far turn, brushed by another into the lane, moved closer to the rail
for the drive and was all out to save the show spot. WIN ME OVER vied for the lead from the three path down the backstretch, continued three wide through
the turn and into the lane and gave way. ANCHOR MANNE unhurried off rail, bid three wide and in the four path through the turn then a serious contender
then flattened out after straightening in the lane. BAD BOY GEIST vied for the lead through the first turn while along the inside, settled back down the
backstretch and faded thereafter along the rail. TAILLIGHTS was four wide and in the five path through the first turn, moved up to press the pace from the
four path down the backstretch, continued well off the inside into the turn then was empty nearing the quarter pole. PAYNTER'S CANVAS raced in the four
path through the first turn when close to the lead, continued to press the pace to the half mild pole then steadily faded. BACKYARD JUSTICE was never a
factor while off the rail through the far turn. SPOTONJUSTICE vied for the lead into the first turn while along the rail then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
ME AND MR. C saved ground through the turns and into the lane, tipped into the three path for the drive then reeled in the leader at the wire.
UNDERDRESSED set the pace on a clear lead from the outset, continued clear into the lane, looked to be a winner in the last forty yards but was nailed at
the wire. VERSTAPPEN was unhurried while off the inside, bid four wide through the turn, kept good momentum into the lane from the five path and was
gaining to the end. STRONG TIDE chased the pace from the two path into the lane, got closest to the winner from the two path, had aim on that one but
lacked the needed response. GENTLE SOUL was close early while off the inside, shuffled back down the backstretch and into the turn, continued in the two
path for the drive and offered a belated effort. MAASAI WARRIOR was along the inside through the turns and into the lane, came off the rail for the drive
and offered a mild gain. IN LOVE (BRZ) trailed for half while off the inside, bid five to four wide through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and
was never a serious threat. GALLANT GUY stalked the pace from the two or three path through the turn, was well placed in upper stretch then was done.
MCLOVIN chased the pace from the three path through mid-turn then lacked a response. KENTUCKY GHOST was never a factor while moving into the
three path in late turn.

DEFINING PURPOSE stalked the pace from the two path into the turn, took over just inside the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared into the lane then was
kept to the task left-handed to hold. TAXED brushed at the start, raced in the three path through the turn while last, continued in the three path into the
backstretch, guided to the two path nearing the half-mile pole, gained momentum into the far turn, bid from the four path and four wide in late turn, brushed
with another inside the eighth pole, inched up on the winner while not good enough and settled for second best. LILY POO was unhurried while off the
inside, bid four wide through mid-turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the winner, was brushed by TAXED nearing the sixteenth pole,
could not gain thereafter and was all out to save the show spot. MERLAZZA was in the two path through the turns when not far back, was asked for more in
late turn, came into the lane with good momentum then could not gain on the top ones while losing the show spot late. FLAMAND stalked the pace along
the inside into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn and lacked a response. CLOAK OF MERCY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn,
bid three wide near the five-sixteenth pole, was put in tight while losing her path near the quarter pole and was done. SANDRA D set the pace along the
inside into late turn then was empty into the lane.
