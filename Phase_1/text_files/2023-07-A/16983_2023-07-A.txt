Footnotes
LADY RANGER away well, hustled to clear, established inside position, continued to hold rail on the turn, kicked away late on the turn and won
convincingly. ABBEY OOPS tracked leaders along the rail on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, entered lane in the three path and kept
on to save second. CUTE RENEGADE away cleanly, unhurried early, dropped back on a loose reign, continued to trail on the turn, advanced in the three
path, eased to the rail in the lane and made a mild rally along the rail. HAMPTONRUN broke a touch slow, hustled to try and take command, had to settle
for a chasing two wide position, had to be asked to keep up on the turn and offered little in the lane.
