nearing the sixteenth marker and widened. DEMURELY dueled inside to midstretch, could not match strides with the winner from there but fought on to hold
the place. NOBLE DREAMER stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, vied inside of the winner past the eighth pole,
steadied nearing the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the place. DANCING DOLL broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide, swung widest in
upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. HIALEAH HOTTIE chased the pace from the rail and faded in the stretch. SPONGER dueled two wide and
faltered in the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND REVIEWED AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF NOBLE DREAMER

Footnotes
WARP SPEED BABY rated in the three path, bid from the two path into the far turn, took the lead midway around that turn and was cued from the four path
into the stretch, drifted out in the final sixteenth, but held on. A ROSE FOR RAVEN raced off the pace in the five path, advanced down the backside while
tipping inward and was roused from the three path into the far turn, floated out to the six path into the lane, drifted out in the final furlong, and kept on for
place. XY TIME set the pace in the three path, tipped inside into the far turn, lost the lead along the rail midway around that turn, was stymied briefly turning
into the stretch, but evened out for show. IRWANI (ARG) prompted the pace in the two path but backed up going into the far turn. BOURBON THERAPY
tracked in the four path but was in tight between foes and got shuffled back passing the five-eighths, and did not threaten. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY
THE JOCKEY OF XY TIME AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF WARP SPEED BABY FOR INTERFERENCE TURNING INTO THE STRETCH WAS
DISALLOWED

CINDYLOUWHO tracked inside of foes around the two path, was ridden along the rail rounding the far turn, kept on inside of rivals into the stretch, and
surged late to get up on the wire. CACCIATORE chased in the five path, was under right handed urging rounding the far turn, bid into the stretch, ran on and
stuck a head in front going into the final sixteenth, but hung and was caught by an inner foe on the wire. RED TIARA set the pace in the two path, was
ridden along early around the far turn, cued while tipping out to the four path into the lane, and stayed on but was caught on both sides passing in final
sixteenth to show. GUSTAV stalked in the four path but flattened in the stretch. STARSHIP SKITTLES rated in the three path but made no impact. THE
GREAT CESAR reared at the start and always trailed from the four to six paths. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE START.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY BREEZE set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS stalked the pace two
wide, could not quite keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but kept trying and narrowed the gap late. SHORT CIRCUIT settled off the early pace while
racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn but was one-paced through the lane. RADIANT GEM saved ground in midpack early, steadied late
on the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and finished evenly. KHOSEA steadied along at the rail through the opening five-sixteenths, chased
inside around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. RUBYSA hit the starting gate and never threatened while racing three and four wide. DOMINEERING
was off a bit slowly, chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. TIZ IMPRESSIVE was outrun while racing three wide.
CAPRIDREY trailed throughout.

LOOKING FOR HOPE stalked in the four path, bid under confident handling rounding the turn, took the lead and was roused passing the quarter pole,
opened up from the four path into the final furlong, and held clear. OLGA bobbled and bumped between foes at the start, set the pace inside, was cued
when headed by an outer foe approaching the quarter, lost the lead and tipped out to the two path into the stretch, and kept on to hold place. GREAT
ANALOGY trailed in the four path, was under urging in the two path turning into the stretch, and stayed on while tipping outward in the final furlong for show.
GUARDIAN ANGEL brushed with an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path, shifted out to the six path turning into the lane, but flattened. BLACK
BELT BARBIE brushed with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the two path early but faded entering the stretch. GLORIOUS WAVE raced off the pace in
the six path, drifted out to the center in the stretch, and was no menace.

Footnotes
ALTERNATE ROCK set the pace in the two path, was coaxed from the three path into the lane, lost the lead to an outer foe passing the eighth pole, but dug
in and fought back to get back up in the final strides. PAWKY stalked in the three path, bid under a ride from the four path turning into the stretch, ran on to
take a short lead from an inner foe passing the eighth pole, but hung and was caught by that inner foe to place. LADY HAMILTON tracked in the four path,
floated out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. STARSHIP AURORA was held up off the pace in the four path, cued midway around the far
turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, tipped inwards through the lane, and made no impact. ARTIFACT (GB) rated in the two path but was no
menace.

Footnotes
GEPARD set the pace in the three path, was collared in upper stretch, dueled in the four and five paths through the lane and regained command late. LOST
CITY stalked the pace inside, took the lead in upper stretch, battled at the rail to deep stretch and was outfinished. BUCKMASTER prompted the winner in
the four path, could not match strides with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on to hold clear of the rest. CLASSIC BOURBON lacked early speed,
raced at the rail and improved position in the lane. JAY'S DELIGHT raced off the pace three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and never threatened.
TAPIT'S DIRECTION failed to menace while racing four wide. BLUE SOLDIER was outrun while racing three and four wide. KING D chased the pace three
wide and tired in the drive.
