Footnotes
GRATIA settled off the early going, advanced towards the leaders through the far turn, split rivals two deep into the upper stretch and drew off to be well
clear late under steady handlig. KRABI rated under a firm hold early on from the outside of rivals, ridden along near the five sixteenths pole, raced four to
three wide in the drive and kept on willingly to the wire. I LOVE IRELAND broke to the outside, bumped with rival, raced mid pack early on, moved up to
challenge near the rail into the lane and was outkicked in the drive. INSATIABLE EVA was squeezed at the break, raced near the back early on after the
poor start, raced along the inside past the quarter pole into the lane, angled out and improved position. CASTLE BORN was bumped, squeezed at the start,
rushed with a quick move early down the backstretch, floated out past the quarter pole into the lane and was empty. HEART OF THE BEAST stalked the
pace two deep, ridden along past the half mile pole and faded. FONE YOUR MOM dropped back early off the early going, raced five to six wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. OVERRUN sent inside, was done early and eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
BENTORNATO chased the early pace, racing just off the inside, moved up to take aim four wide into the upper stretch and just got up late under all out
pressure. BIG EFFECT showed good early foot from the inside, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. DEWY'S BEAST was sent along from the
inside, angled the outside of Big Effect, raced off the inside in the drive and weakened. VITO'S BROTHER was hustled along early, raced near the inside
around the far turn, shifted five deep in the stretch run and weakened. HECHICERO was void of early speed and trailed.

HARD TO FATHOM stalked the early going three deep, hard ridden nearing the quarter pole and drew off in the final stages under strong handling racing
three to two wide. TRUTH AND HONESTY settled off the early going under a hold, advanced towards the leaders into the far turn, raced four wide near the
three sixteenths pole and finished second best. RACKET rated two deep just to the outside of Hello Sucker, had full command past the three eighths pole
and weakened along the inside the final furlong. KINISON tracked the early pace setters near the rail down the backstretch, raced two to three wide
between rivals in the stretch run and was even with no closing run. DREAM OF BLESSINGS raced near the back of the pack early, was three to four wide in
the drive and lacked a bid. HELLO SUCKER sent from the inside, was done early and eased up on in the stretch.

EXECUTIVE SEARCH pressed the early leaders from the inside, dug in deep stretch racing four deep and prevailed under all out pressure.
THENORTHREMEMBERS dropped back early near the inside, moved up through the upper stretch racing five deep, shifted in through the drive, surged
late and just missed in a game effort. LUCAGO showed good early foot from the outside of foes three deep, lead near the eighth pole and gave way
grudgingly late. ETERNAL FLAME chased the early pace under steady coaxing, moved up three to four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the
drive while racing from the outside. FRENCHMEN STREET coaxed along from the start, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and had no late
response. NO ANGEL vied for the early lead between rivals and faded. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) dropped back off the early going, raced two to three wide and
lacked a bid. FEDERAL EXCHANGE raced near the back early, saved ground and trailed.

Footnotes
LA RUNA was quick to begin from the outside to the early pace and drew off late to be well clear under steady pressure. MAJOR PRYCE settled off the
early going, moved up along the inside around the far turn, angled through the upper stretch to race off the inside, too aim at the leader but couldn't match
strides to finish second best. GREEK MOJO tracked the early leader from the outside and weakened a bit in the drive. KILLARGUE'S GIRL was bumped
squeezed at the start, raced off the early going after the poor start, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced even late with no closing run.
UPSTREET broke awkwardly, forwardly placed to lay up close, shifted out a bit into the upper stretch to race six deep and had no response. BONNIE
SANDRA was pinched back at the break, raced back after the poor start, raced five wide from the outside of foes and never threatened. LAW MACHINE
broke out, coaxed along from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
UNDALAY showed good early to sprint clear early on and held gamely to prove best under strong handling. JOYFUL SURPRISE chased the early leader
from the outside two deep, took aim nearing the three sixteenth pole and but couldn't get by in game effort racing four deep. FAST FIXER was coaxed
along, raced four to three wide in the lane and kept on to the wire. GRAND VALLEY raced mid pack early on, was near the inside in the stretch run and
showed good late interest. ON JET HEIR dropped back early, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. PLUMA ROJA was off slowly, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and had no late gain. KING OF TRUTH was coaxed along from the outside and faded.
