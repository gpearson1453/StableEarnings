Footnotes
I'M WIDE AWAKE set the pace from the two path, cleared into the turn, continued to widen to the eighth pole while in the four path, was kept to the task to
the end and lasted. HOT PASTRAMI moved up the inside into the turn, continued along the rail through late turn, came into the lane from the two path and
gained momentum while moving into the three path while closing in on the winner. TALE OF FAME stalked the pace from the three path through the turn,
came into the lane from the five path with aim on the winner, stayed on through the final eighth and made up ground as the top one tired. FIRERY TALE
was in the two path throughout and gained belatedly. GOOD SUGAR never a threat while saving ground through the turn and into the lane. LITTLE
KANSAS never a factor while in the three path through the turn. EL ROSILLO raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path
and never was a factor. DAY IN THE COUNTRY chased the pace through the turn while in the three path, asked for more nearing the five-sixteenth pole
and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
BLOCKED was bumped at the start, led inside in the two path, bid at the quarter pole and held sway under mild urging. B ADMAN stalked the pace in the
two path, saved ground around the turn, bid, then couldn't get to the winner. STAYINYOURLANE saved ground, then gained the show late.
HOMERUNHAPPY was bumped at the start, vied between foes, then faded in the stretch. SATURDAY LONG LEGS improved position late.
FOXTROTANNA vied in the three path before fading in the stretch. BE RUTHLESS stalked the pace in the three path before fading. TOTALITARIAN was
not a factor.

Footnotes
TAKE THE CHARGE pressed the pace while two wide into the far turn, moved up to take control and clear in mid-turn, continued in the three path entering
the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was kept to the task to the end. GOLD LUCK was unhurried while in the two path, continued in the two path into
the lane, squeezed through between rivals near the eighth pole to get nearest the winner then slowly gained on that one while saving the place spot. FIRE
BABY unhurried while moving off the rail into the turn, was in the four path in late turn when being asked for more, came into the lane from the five path and
was gaining to the end while clearly best of the rest. HUNTERTOWN set the pace into the backstretch, chased the winner while saving ground into the lane
then faded along the rail. METATRON'S MUSE raced in the two path through the turns when a contender then tired through the final eighth. ROMAN GIANT
was near the lead into the first turn, put under restraint into the backstretch, shuffled back while near the inside, trailed into the turn, came off the inside into
the lane and was not a menace. BOURBON SPIRIT moved three wide through the turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, looked to be a
contender into the lane then faded.

Footnotes
EKATI FLATTER set the pace soon after the start, raced on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was kept to the
task to remain clear. Z ZS RED raced in the three path through the turn when not far back, came into the lane from the four path and offered a mild gain to
get nearest the winner and was clear for the place spot. QUILTER chased the winner from the three path through the turn and into the lane, weakened
inside the eighth pole but remained well clear of the next rival. DASH OF SIMPLICITY trailed through the turn while in the two path, bid into the lane and
moved up while never a threat. ADDICTED TO LOVE raced through the turn from the four path, was asked for more in late turn then weakened in the drive.
FAIRE EXPRESS was along the inside through the turn and tired. HER WAY chased the pace along the inside through the turn then faded along the rail.

Footnotes
COMPASS POINT chased along the inside through mid-turn, angled into the three path and three wide into the lane, gained from the four path inside the
eighth pole, drove past and cleared. FIERCE JUSTICE was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, gained
momentum inside the eighth pole, shifted into the five path late and was just up for the place spot. SHOOTER JUSTICE vied for the lead while in the three
path into the turn, shook clear into the lane, led with a sixteenth to go then yielded to the winner and lost the place spot at the wire. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE
pressed the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane then weakened along the rail. GIMMEFUELGIMMEFIRE raced close up through the
turn while in the two path, came into the lane from the four path and tired. BOLD BIZNESS vied for the lead from between rivals through the turn then gave
way into the lane. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY trailed through the turn while in the five to the four path and never was factor. MIKIE O'PRADO was three wide
through the turn when not far back, asked for more near the five-sixteenths pole and was done soon after.
