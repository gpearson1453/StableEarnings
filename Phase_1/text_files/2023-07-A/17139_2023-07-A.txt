Footnotes
PETE'S INFERNO stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, advanced along the rail entering the lane, roused
in upper stretch and responded well to drive past leader approaching the final sixteenth and won clear. NENE ROMANO brushed at the start by outside
rival, sent to lead and cleared heading into the turn, extended lead on the turn, entered lane clear, headed by rival in the final sixteenth and was no match
while a clear second. FOR MY BROTHER settled well off the pace on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn, entered lane in last and showed solid
rally to get up for third along the inside. TIME TOGETHER chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued to chase on the turn, eased out into
the three path to launch bid, asked and failed to respond, and weakened. AROUSING LOVER broke in and brushed with inside rival at the start, tracked
pace two wide on the turn and into the lane, failed to respond when asked and weakened. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
