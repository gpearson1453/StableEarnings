Footnotes
R T'S GEM close from the start off the inside, pressured the leader from the outside in the run up the backstretch, challenged that one and took over far
turn, clear into the stretch, extended that advantage past the furlong marker, held late under steady handling. ENTITLEMENT off a step slow, continued to
lag the first five furlongs, saved ground through the second turn, shifted out for room, rallied from between foes to finish up willingly to gain the place while
closing the gap on the winner. WORLD OF HURT also lacked any early foot, began to advance after a half, four wide when moving closest to the winner
into the stretch, continued to pursue that one past the furlong marker, was still making slow progress on that one late when nailed for the place in the final
strides while outside the runner up. MOR KISSES five wide into the first turn when with the main body, moved closer after a half, remained within striking
distance into the stretch, flattened out a bit in the late going to finish up evenly. SCARLET STORM raced within striking distance for five furlongs, came up
empty for the stretch run while in the three path. JUST A WIN one paced while saving ground, moved out for the drive, also found lacking in the stretch run.
RIPTIDE ROSE took command from along the inside after the start, showed the way through the first turn and up the backstretch, faltered when headed by
the winner in the far turn. SIKARA SIKARA was never a serious threat. CHICKIETOWN STAR stopped after a half, jogged in far back.

Footnotes
FIELD OF VISION broke with the field, fell back off the pace inside, swung out to be four wide into the lane when moving to challenge, bid, kicked well clear.
OURPERFECTPRINCE prompted the pace outside for three furlongs, three wide bid between horses into the lane, proved no match for the winner the final
furlong, clearly second best. DIAL UNCLE JOEY pressed the issue from between foes, had little for the top two in the drive, lasted for the show. RAZZ off
the pace while racing outside, five wide exiting the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a significant closing kick. SMOOTH RIVER last to leave, lacked
speed of the inside, improved position through the lane without posing a serious threat. STORMIN SUNDAY fell back to trail after the start, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals without making an impact. ALL OF US in mid pack for three furlongs, backed up through the stretch. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE
narrowly set the pace along the inside, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
LOUIS LE GRANDE outrun in the early going despite being ridden along, advanced three wide through the second bend under continued brisk hand urging,
roused when straightened for home, late bid, proved best. BODE'S LIGHT away in good order, moved closer before a half, bid second turn, stretch duel, led
late, nailed by the winner. SCREENPLAY chased the early leader off the inside, took over far turn, dueled through upper stretch and past the furlong
marker, weakened in the late going, finished up best of the rest. TROPHY DADDY underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, last away, four wide first turn,
continued outside, four wide again through the second bend when moving closer, flattened out in the drive. APPLEWOOD void of speed, improved position
the third quarter while racing toward the inside, also failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. TAPPED OUT within striking distance early, had little
left for the drive. HERE COMES MAGIC in the second flight for six furlongs, weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. MATH MAN
lacked speed, continued back while four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. MEAN CRUISER failed to menace while five wide into the stretch.
BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL sprinted clear after the start, showed the way up the backstretch, stopped when headed far turn.

Footnotes
CASHEW unhurried early, continued to be outrun through the turn, came five wide for the drive when beginning to advance, stalled a bit inside the furlong
marker, late surge to be just up at the wire while remaining widest of the first flight. KATIE'S KARAT broke alertly, vied between horses onto the main track,
dueled into and through the turn, between horses again into the lane, second duel past the furlong marker, refused to yield to that rival in the run to the wire
despite being headed, led late, nipped at the wire while proving game for the place. ANGELA'S CELERITY with the pace three wide out of the chute, fell
back to stalk outside, rebid three wide turning into the stretch, dueled outside the runner up past the furlong marker, outgamed at the wire while between the
top two. JERSEY HOTTIE one paced behind the leaders, continued to chase the first flight into the stretch, had little for the top three the final furlong.
GOODNIGHTLOVING off a step slow, moved up to mid pack the middle part then had little for the stretch run. TAYLOR'S SECRET with the pace out of the
chute, dueled into the turn, faltered in the drive. START WELL failed to threaten in remaining back.

Footnotes
UP N GONE last to leave, continued unhurried early, began to move into the far turn, steered out and swept up five wide to challenge into the stretch, put a
head in front when straightened for home, and drove well clear. SYVESTAR moved closer before a half in the three path, maintained a forward position
through the final turn while remaining off the inside, challenged briefly when four wide and inside the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one,
edged clear for the second spot. BEAUDEAN broke very sharp, narrowly set the pace in along the inside, larger lead midway on the second turn, vied into
the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the runner up until late while also proving no match for the winner. RACY BILLE in the second flight along the inside,
continued to save ground while being asked along second turn, briefly lodged a mild bid in upper stretch then weakened. LIKE THIS moved up to press the
pace in the two path for almost six furlongs and faltered. MARVINS' POSSE went one paced outside, had little for the stretch run. MECKES PRIORITY five
wide into the first turn, began to weaken in the far bend. SEA OF LIGHT finished early, well back. UNCLE HUTCH rank while four wide into the first turn,
stopped after a half, jogged in far back.

Footnotes
MIAS MOONBEAM in the second flight while saving ground, angled out late in the final turn to be three wide into the lane, chased the leader past the
furlong marker,late push to be up in time while outside that rival at the wire. COOL INDIVIDUAL lacked any early foot inside, continued to save ground into
the lane, late run up the wire to finish up willingly. MASTERLY away in good order, set or forced the pace three wide, shook off the other speed to be clear
in upper stretch, extended that advantage past the furlong marker then weakened late to be nailed by the top two in the final strides after drifting out a bit.
FLASHING ANGELBABY vied up front along the inside, fell back a bit far turn, went evenly through the lane. SERMONONTHEMOUNT settled in mid pack,
five wide turning for home, lacked a serious rally. INDIMAAJ with the early pace between foes, continued to vie up the backstretch, dueled second turn then
weakened through the lane. DEALIN' STELEN broke out and steadied to be last away, remained back in failing to menace. BET AGAIN tucked in a bit to be
three wide and in the second flight, tired in the drive. FREEDOMFI was finished after half.

Footnotes
SERIOUSLY SAM forwardly placed out of the chute, moved up to duel outside the early leader into the turn, took over entering the stretch, steadily drew off,
ridden out. MARDI GRAS ALARM broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, responded when the winner challenged into the turn, dueled inside that
one, proved no match in the drive, remained clear for the place. ASHLEY'S GIRL fell well back to trail early, continued to lag through the turn inside, made a
late run up the rail to narrowly grab the show spot at the wire. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) also lacked early foot, steered out to be five wide into the lane, late
interest midtrack to narrowly miss the show.l. NAVAGATIONALBEACON chased the top two off the inside, had little for that pair through the lane, nipped
late for the show. CAJUN TWO STEP never seriously menaced. QUALITY BOW forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half.
FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS in mid pack, floated out six wide turning for home, tired in the run to the wire. KAPPA HILL also steadily faded.
