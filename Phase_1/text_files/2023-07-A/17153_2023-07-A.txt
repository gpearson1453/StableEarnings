SHE'S TAKIN OVER was able to get her head in front and get up for second. LOVERS NEVER SAY raced four wide and vied for the lead through the first
turn, settled into a stalking position down the back side, continued to race in the four path through the turn and in the upper stretch, was challenged by an
inside closing rival at the eighth pole, dueled with that one into the furlong ground, relinquished near the wire and came away wit third. KENYA STRIKE
raced three wide and vied for the lead, settled off of the pace and stalked, raced in between rivals and then had no late kick. GIFTED TALENT raced in the

another on the out side, raced as a set, setting the early fractions together, was cued at the quarter pole and pulled away, waws driven down the stretch and
kept on point under hand urging and was able to hold sway. ABBY THE BULL DAWG was off a step slow, was far back off of the pace, was allowed to
settle, found her stride, raced in the three path as she improved position and gained ground, shifted into the two path at the upper stretch, had racing room
and closed, continued to build momentum with every stride, raced in between horses while passing rivals, had her eye on the leader near the wire but had to
much to do to get he win, but ran a very game second. WHAT CAN I SAY raced in the four path and f rom off of the pace, was allowed to settle, moved at
the half mile pole, improved position, shifted into the two path in the upper stretch, closed well getting up for third. MISS DARLENE raced in the two path,
stalked the front runners, saved ground through out, had a clean trip but finished even. CRYSTAL CRESCENT was five wide and gaining ground from the
middle of the pack, circled the field five wide in the turn, shifted down into the three path in the upper stretch, angled back out and had no late kick. PREACH
IT GIRL vied for the early lead, stalked the leader from the three path, chased into the stretch then tired at the eighth pole. MOODY RAFAELA showed little.
