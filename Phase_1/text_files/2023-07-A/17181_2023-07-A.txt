Footnotes
JEAN VALJEAN prompt the top pair three deep from the outside, challenged near the three eighths pole and finished strongly to edge clear under strong
handling. BIG BROWN SHOES dueled early on near the rail early on and kept on willingly to the wire. KISS THEM DEADLY dueled two deep from the
outside of foe, raced between into the far turn and weakened. ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT raced mid pack in the early stages, raced from the inside around the
far turn, angled to raced off the inside in the stretch and flattened out. BUCKS ARE MOVING dropped back off the early going, raced from the outside in the
stretch and had no final winning bid. ZOOMSTER coaxed along early while racing off the inside, raced four to five wide in the stretch and lacked a bid.
BALI'S SHADE was void of early speed, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. NOBLE JON chased early and failed to sustain
a bid.

Footnotes
RUNAHOLIC chased the pace from the inside past the three eighths pole, angled to two to three wide outside of foe into the lane and just got up under all
out pressure. WARRIOR'S CAUSE showed good early foot to cross over to the rail soon after the break to set the early pace, was clear nearing the eighth
pole and gave way grudgingly late to Runaholic. HARBOR OF GOLD coxed along early while racing near the back, raced four wide into the upper stretch
and moved up to improve position. ONE TRUTH raced in a bit tight at the start, was mid pack early on, raced near the rail around the far turn through the
stretch and raced even with no closing run. GOOD FORTUNE was reluctant to load, chased the pace from the outside and weakened in the drive. BLAME B
B was void of early speed, swung five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. BRADY chased early on between rivals and faded. J W
RUNTOTHEBANK dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
P H FACTOR showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely in the drive to be clear under steady handling. CRAZY KATER rated along in
the early stages, raced three to four deep in the stretch run and got up for the place position late. MY FRIEND FRANK stalked the pace, raced near the
inside past the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. JO JO KATZ stalked the top trio early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and raced even
late with no closing run. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER tracked the early leader from the inside and weakened. PANADERO settled off the early going, angled to
race from the far outside in the stretch and lacked a rally. HOLD THE IRISH was unhurried early, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and lacked a
bid. ALWAYS FORGIVEN dropped back off the early pace and failed to respond. WHAT SAY YOU was off slowly and never was a factor.

VIOLENT PASS stalked the top pair down the backstretch, urged two deep past the quarter pole and got up late under all out pressure. FEDERAL CASE
settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled out just past the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire.
ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT bumped with rival at the start, showed good early foot from the inside to set the pace, was clear near the eighth pole and gave way
grudgingly. MAD GENIUS pressed two deep and weakened. I LOVE JAXSON was bumped, shuffled at the break, raced four wide in the lane and had no
rally. CALCULATED THINKIN raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. ROCKET BLAST dropped back early on, angled widest
through the stretch to race from the outside and never menaced.

Footnotes
HOP TO A DECISION settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, angled out just past the eighth pole,
split rivals and just got up under strong handling. MASKED HEROINE stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide in the lane and just missed in a
game effort. UNCAPTURED GRACE dropped back off the early going, raced four to five wide in the lane and closed in well late. SIMPLE JUSTICE void of
early speed, raced from the outside and closed in belatedly in the drive. BUSTIN WIDE OPEN stalked the pace, raced three wide through the stretch run,
checked sharply just past the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. GUSSIE'S NOTION was forwardly placed early on, hard ridden through the far turn, led
near the eighth pole and faltered while racing three wide. SCOREBOARD LILY pressed two deep and faded in the drive. IOANNA showed good early speed
along the inside and stopped.
