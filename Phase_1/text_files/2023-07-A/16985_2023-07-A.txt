Footnotes
RIPITTOTHERIGHT went wire to wire. MR. FOUR SEVENS stalked the front runners, improved position, over came one of the early leaders, but could not
get close to the winner but was second best today. SABER RUN was off in the middle of the field, found his best stride late and closed well. BAYOU
SARGE was racing mid pack early and maintained that position through out. BODEE BODEE was off of te pace and allowed to settle in hands, was moved
att he half, improved position and gained ground, was asked in the stretch and closed well. JUJU NINETEEN had no impact. CARLOS PUNCH flashed
early speed, gave way. COUNTERFEIT was sharp outof the gates, settled into a stalking position, but had no kick. ITS A CITY DAY was never involved.
NOW NOW MAN raced mid pack early then faltered. WISH UPON A STAR was no menace.
