Footnotes
GOODNIGHT ARCHIE stalked the leader from the three path in the second tier, advanced on the outside at the three eighths pole, drew near the front
runner by the quarter pole, was joined by another outside challenger moving into the stretch, these two chased the leader in a set, under urging and
encouragement, in the last few jumps GOODNIGHT ARCHIE had wore the leader down and was able to get tot he wire with a nose in front. RAUL'S
ENCANTO vied for the early lead, took command and raced on the rail, was challenged by another rival to the outside, cut the corner on the inside and
passed the quarter pole front, was chased by an ominous closing pair, dug in and continued to respond well to encouragement, caught in the last jump and
just missed. TRAFFIC CONTROL was racing in the four path on the outside, was mid pack and improved position, launched a bid at the three eighths pole,
gained ground quickly, drew next to another rival and chased the leader down the stretch as a set, was near the wire and still in contention but came up
short in the lst two jumps. DIRECTIONAL stalked the leader from the rail, stayed on the fence and saved ground then faded before the quarter pole.
DRIVER raced on the rail, trailed most of the race and was never involved. DANDY LOU missed the break and showed little.

Footnotes
PAINTBRUSH was off iand edged over to run in mid pack, was in hands and rating until the half mile pole, shifted out into the six path and advanced,
passed rivals on the outside in the turn, shifted out again into the eight path in the upper stretch, was asked and responded well, gaining ground and closing
in on the front runners with each stride, was bale to pass the last of the other runners a few jumps before the wire becoming the winner. EXACTA raced
three wide while stalking the leaders, was asked launched a bid at the half mile pole, improved position and shifted into the five path, circled the field
through the turn in the six path, was encouraged and responded well at the quarter pole, closing in on the leader with every stride, challenged the leader
before the sixteenth marker, battled briefly and took over, led for a few strides but was collared by an outside foe who had followed her around the track and
had to settle fo second place today. MOONLIGHT RAIN was off a bit slow, found herself mid pack and in the three path, advanced at he half moving in
between rivals, maintained her position through the turn, saved ground, then ran flat in the stretch. WATRUGONNADOKAREN stalked the early pace from
the rail, stayed on the rail and saved ground, was tucked inside and behind horses in the turn, waited patiently, had open running room at the quarter pole
and closed well passing the original leader, at the same time was passed by two outside closer, continued to close but was caught late by another rival at
the wire. SAINT KENNEDY was a bit tardy out of the gates, settled off of the pace in hands, raced in the three path, inching closer to the field down the back
side, was given more rein after the half mile marker, moved closer to the pack, stayed in position through the turn, the front runner fanned out a bit giving
SAINT KENNEDY room to close down the stretch but she did not have enough. HURRICANE TIZWAY vied for the lead, set the early fractions under
pressure form another rival, showed the way into the stretch under encouragement and urging, raced in the three path, was caught near the sixteenth pole
and finished flat. FASTED vied for the lead, was strong in her bridle, settled just off of the leaders side in the two path, was rated and stayed in that position
then faded. TOP TEN DUCHESS was off slow, raced on the rail, trailed. TEXAS BLUEBONNET was off a step slow, raced in the two path next to another
rival, improved position slightly, then tired.
