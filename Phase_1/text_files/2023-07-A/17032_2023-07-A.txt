Footnotes
CALVARY KAT broke slowly, breaking in and hitting the gate at the start, was unhurried to the turn, angled out while trying to lug in, then angled widest in
the stretch and drew off while racing greenly. NATURE TRAIL set the pace on the outside, shook clear into the stretch, then was no match for the winner
and held the place safe. KOTYLOS never far back, moved up into the turn, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed late kick. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
weakened the final furlong. BAD AS JOHN mid pack, saved ground moving up through the turn, came through inside and had no stretch rally. DONAHUE
vied for the early lead on the inside, held position through the turn, then faded into the stretch. CHIEF CRAZY MOON was no factor.

Footnotes
WILD IRISH well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. WORLDLY BEAUTY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place. SALIT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. WILL OR WON'T reluctant to load, gained position three wide through the
second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. READY SHE IS unhurried, saved ground on the two path through the second
turn, bid on that path into the lane and passed tiring rivals. JULIETTE FALLS set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
faded the final furlong. LADY ITCH wide through the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn and faded. THAT'S MY CAT well placed and between,
steadied through the second turn and faded. PER RULING FROM HIWU, WILD IRISH WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
