Footnotes
HEY MATE tracked the solid early pace while outside of a rival, gained ground along the backstretch run, was roused three wide along the far turn and
mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, took command into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, drifted out in the lane and had the
margin cut into a bit in the final sixteenth but kept to task under moderate urging and held safely for the win. NIGHT PROOF tracked the solid early pace
while inside of HEY MATE, improved position along the backstretch run, split rivals at the quarter marker and chased HEY MATE into the stretch, closed in
the final sixteenth but could not reel in the winner in the late stages and was outfinished, while holding safely for second. ROARING TIGER settled off of the
solid early pace while inside of rivals, gained ground along the backstretch run, maintained a ground saving trip to the far turn, needed more in the stretch
drive and was outkicked by the top pair, while clear of the rest for third at the finish. TEX HANLEY bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried
while saving ground to the far turn and passed tired rivals in the stretch drive. OH GREAT (IRE) was sent to be prominent in the early running, set solid
fractions while pressed through the backstretch run, maintained a narrow lead to the far turn, was overtaken by the winner heading into upper stretch and
tired in the drive. ROISTER was hustled leaving the break and engaged with OH GREAT to dispute the solid early pace, pressed OH GREAT to the
half-mile marker, raced two then three wide to the quarter marker and dropped back in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHOUT IT OUT was allowed to settle and saved ground through the turn, came in a bit tight nearing the quarter marker and steadied in traffic, made a
sustained inside rally into upper stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker and loomed into deep stretch, took command at the sixteenth-marker and
edged away in the final stages to prevail. LIAM'S SECRET tracked the fast early pace while outside of the leading trio, lost ground on the turn while racing in
the four path, was coaxed along five wide into the stretch, re-rallied in the drive, was outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth and held safely for second
in the final strides. TORREY'S GIRL settled off of the fast early pace while inside of rivals, saved ground into the turn, swung six wide for the drive, found
her best stride late while widest into deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. KITTEN'S KID contested the solid early pace while outside
of rivals, pressed GARDEES WORLD to the quarter marker, battled with that rival into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, could not hold
off oncoming rivals late, weakened in deep stretch and was edged for third. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN lunged at the start and was off slowly, chased the fast
early pace, lost ground on the turn while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the drive, improved position and came within aim at the furlong marker,
raced a bit in traffic in the final stages and was unable to produce the needed response in deep stretch. GARDEES WORLD showed good early speed and
contested the fast early pace while inside of rivals, held a narrow advantage on the turn while carving quick fractions, battled with KITTEN'S KID to the
furlong marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and gave way. PERFECTLY JULIE was prominent in the early running and pressed the fast pace
between rivals, continued to battle for the lead into the turn, was unable to hold her position between rivals and took up midway through the turn, lost
position into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
MADEIRA WINE broke alertly and dictated terms into the first turn, was well handled into the backstretch run while carving moderate fractions, was
prompted into the far turn and shook free nearing the quarter marker, was set down into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, felt late
pressure from oncoming rivals, was kept to task under firm late urging and held in a drive at the end to prevail. TWILIGHT EMPIRE was unhurried while
saving ground in the early running, was coaxed along in the two path into the far turn then slipped to the rail nearing the quarter marker, rallied into upper
stretch, closed well in the final furlong, was able to mild late pressure on MADEIRA WINE but could not reel that one in and was up in the final strides to
secure second. STOIC LUNA was bothered at the start by CALLHERCONTESSA and was off a step slowly, settled just off of the moderate pace while
saving ground, improved position along the backstretch run and raced within aim to the quarter marker, tipped three wide for the stretch run and chased
MADEIRA WINE to the furlong marker, was gaining in the final sixteenth but lacked the needed late response, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch
and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. REV REE settled outside of rivals in the early stages, was well placed while two wide through the
backstretch run, remained within striking distance to the far turn, lost ground into the drive and did not offer a late rally. ASSIGNATION was prominent in the
early stages and attended to the pace into the first turn, advanced to prompt the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, kept attendance to
MADEIRA WINE through the far turn while outside of that rival, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. CALLHERCONTESSA stumbled
badly at the start, bothered a neighboring rival and was off slowly, was asked to be forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the moderate pace into the
backstretch run while outside of rivals, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, lost ground while three wide on the far turn, could not keep pace into
the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

APPLE WARRIOR to the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch, overtook APPLE WARRIOR inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task under
moderate late urging and held safely in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. BALLROOM PRINCE was forwardly placed in the early stages and stalked the
moderate pace while outside of rivals, kept attendance to APPLE WARRIOR along the backstretch run, lost ground to that rival along the far turn, was
steered four wide into the drive and chased the leading pair to the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages
and bested the rest. APPLE WARRIOR broke alertly and set his own pace in the early stages, was well handled through moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, drew to a clear lead along the far turn, came under pressure at mid-stretch and was all out to hold off COACH OTT, was overtaken by the
winner into deep stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for second, while holding clearly for third. FANTASTIC DREAM settled in the
second flight in the early going, raced inside of rivals through the backstretch run, tipped three wide for the drive, ran evenly to the furlong marker and could
not muster a late rally. STOUT settled just off of the moderate early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, maintained his
position while two then three wide along the far turn, lost ground at mid-stretch, lacked a final response and passed a tiring rival in deep stretch. GRACEFUL
MISCHIEF settled inside of rivals while not far back, improved position along the backstretch run, lost ground along the far turn, re-rallied in the drive but
could not sustain that run into the final furlong. NOTCH was well placed in the early stages while outside of rivals, tracked the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, gained ground while five wide on the far turn, could not keep pace in the drive and tired. LIBERTY WOLF settled along the inside and did
not threaten. MR MAKUNOUCHI was away slowly and was slow into stride away from the gate, spotted the field into the first turn and did not factor.

marker, chased from the two path to the quarter marker, improved position and came within aim nearing the furlong pole, could not muster the needed

traveling well, made a big move still wide through the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, engaged a game TAMARA MINE in a battle down the stretch
and got the upper hand in the shadow of the wire. TAMARA MINE broke well, put pressure on NAVY QUEEN until the far turn, took over the lead a the
quarter pole with challengers to the inside and outside, battled BELLEO'S FOREST gamely down the lane and gave way stubbornly in the final yards in a
good effort. BUSKER ALLIE unhurried from the break, settled behind the field through the clubhouse turn, moved a bit closer down the backstretch and
continued to improve through the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and ran on well but was never a threat to the top pair. SHANGHAI MIST broke
well, got good position just behind the pacesetters, saved ground through the far turn, came into the stretch with a big chance but was unable to quicken
when needed. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY got a good inside trip and raced up close to the early pace to the far turn, was unable keep up when the pace
quickened and wilted under pressure in the stretch. DRESS REHEARSAL outrun from the break then prompted to keep contact with the field, was under a
drive with a half mile to run and showed little. NAVY QUEEN hustled for the lead, was three wide into the clubhouse turn, set a moderate pressured pace to
the far turn, gave way before the quarter pole and had nothing left in the stretch.

Footnotes
CUT ACROSS SHORTY broke well but was caught four to five wide into the clubhouse turn, stayed to the outside for the backstretch run, angled in a
couple of paths going into the far turn, then swung to the five path and started to rally from the five-sixteenths pole, responded with a nice turn of foot when
asked a the top of the lane and quickly swept past the field to win in handy fashion. CANELITO raced near the rail on the inside of the trio tracking the two
pacesetters, became boxed in through the turn and to mid-stretch, was able to get clear in the final furlong and finished up well to get the place. DO IT FOR
DAVE outrun to to the stretch, saved some ground to the far turn then swung six wide into the stretch and made a nice rally to get third. JERRY JEFF
WALKER worked over to the inside before the first turn, started a run from the three-sixteenths, slipped inside turning for home, was running on well then
drifted out a bit in deep stretch losing some momentum. JOHNNY DAR broke well, was always close tracking the leading pair, loomed a big threat turning
into the stretch, ran on somewhat but was outfinished by several in the late stages. AZURE STAR (IRE) broke in a tangle, rushed up to get inside position
and a share of the lead going into the first turn, dueled with MACHO CHROME to the stretch, took a brief lead when that foe stopped, then tired near the
furlong marker. SGT POWELL broke outward while being hustled for the lead, got forward position into the first turn but was three wide, continued to race
three to four wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, came under pressure with about three furlongs to run, made a tepid bid five wide into the
stretch but faltered. HOT JOURNEY broke outward at the start, was far behind to the far turn, made up a little bit of ground in the stretch then had to alter
course when MACHO CHROME stopped in his path. MACHO CHROME broke well and was sent to get a share of the early lead, was a little hard to handle
going into the first turn and put AZURE STAR (IRE) in tight quarters briefly, those two raced together down the backstretch and into the far turn, took a brief
lead at the head of the stretch, became erratic and lost action nearing the furlong marker, dropped to the rear in the final sixteenth and was not persevered
with to the finish.
