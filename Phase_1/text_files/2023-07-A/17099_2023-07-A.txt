CHIEF BUCKEYE tracked the early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, angled to the inside through the turn, met the bid of BLAZING BURROUGHS in
mid stretch, dueled with that rival, while drifting out and prevailed for the win. BLAZING BURROUGHS was allowed to settle early, raced five wide through
the turn, made a bid on the winner while drifting out and just missed for the win. RAVEN MOON was unhurried early, advanced six wide through the turn,
passed rivals and was no match late. OL' NED was away awkwardly, was rushed to set the pace from off the rail into the turn, raced between rivals into the
turn, couldn't match strides and faded mid stretch. WILLIE JONES chased the early pace from between rivals and was finished early. MUSTANG WILLIE
hopped at the start, was void of any early speed, went six wide and never fired.

turn, angled out and offered no late rally. WARIS was taken back early, saved ground into the home turn, angled out and never fired. EIDA'S STORM set a

AUTHORITARIAN set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside through the turn, met the bid of SILENT CHAOS, shook clear from that rival and drew
off as an easy winner. CAROM stalked the early pace, raced three wide into the second turn, was no match late and finished second best. SILENT CHAOS
was allowed to settle early, loomed five wide through the second turn, made a bid on the winner, couldn't sustain the run and flattened out in the drive.
WHERE'D THE DAY GO was taken back early, saved ground throughout, angled out in mid stretch and finished belatedly. EL CHEAPO tracked the early
pace, went four wide through the second turn and was empty. TOE TAPPIN LUKE raced in mid pack early, advanced six wide into the turn and never fired.
HEMP HEMP HURRAY was outrun early, raced five wide into the second turn to pass tired rivals. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) was unhurried early, raced four wide
through the second turn and offered no late rally. FULCO pressed the early pace, raced three wide through the second turn and faded. HOLIDAY DANCER
was allowed to settle early, went six wide through the second turn and flattened out. PAYNTED was reserved early, raced three wide into the second turn
and was n factor. DOWN HOME KITTEN was void of any early speed, raced five wide through the second turn and never fired.

Footnotes
SAD CAFE hopped at the start, was rushed to be in contention, loomed four wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy
winner while well in hand to the wire. MAMBA OUT pressed the early pace, raced three wide into the turn, angled out in the drive, was no match late and
finished second best. DIVINE GRACE was outrun early from the inside and finished with a mild rally. CHIP'S LLITTLE SIS tracked the early pace, raced five
wide through the turn, angled in and was empty. KINGMAKING (GB) was allowed to settle, raced along the inside and finished evenly late. ANN KOR raced
in mid pack early, went five wide through the turn and flattened out. YANIRA set a pressured early pace from the inside and faded. DELANEY'S GRACE
was unhurried early while racing four wide and never fired. HOP SNIP ANDA JUMP was squeezed soon after the start, lost best chance, never recovered
and taken back while never a factor.
