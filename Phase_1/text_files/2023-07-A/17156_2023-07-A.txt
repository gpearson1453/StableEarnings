TAKE ME UP BRADY vied inside of DOT COM DREAMIN up the backstretch and took on the added challenge of RED WHITE AND LOUD late on the
backstretch, dueled along the rail around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and kept clear. DOT COM DREAMIN came away in good order and briefly
held a slight edge before taking on the challenge of TAKE ME UP BRADY, took on the added outside challenge of RED WHITE AND LOUD entering the
turn, could not match strides with eventual winner past upper stretch but sustained bid and finished second best. RED WHITE AND LOUD tracked the early
pace then moved up to engage the top pair late on the backstretch, dueled three deep around the turn, failed to match with the top pair entering the lane but
stayed on with response and secured a share. SHUT UP MAN tracked the top trio in early stages, hustled up mid-way around the turn, came four wide into
the lane and had no late kick. MR. SOLO hustled along out of the gate and raced in contention in early stages, flattened out nearing the half mile marker
and continued to steadily weaken through the lane. MILTON STREET raced in the back throughout and never got going.

DREAM in the early backstretch, widened advantage racing in hand past the half mile marker, continued clear still unleashed around the far turn, saved
ground and roused for more entering the stretch run, tapped a few times, sustained a commanding lead and raced in hand late. RUNNINTHESTREETS

lane, sustained a solid bid for the winner but had to settle for second best. MARSHSIDE MAMA raced two wide into the first turn and settled off the early
pace, hustled up along the rail around the far turn, ran on and finished well clear over the rest. SUPER CINDY was forwardly placed around the first turn,
tracked the top pair up the backstretch, flattened out three wide around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. ALMA'S PRINCESS raced off the pace,

CARRY ON pressed the pace along the inside into the early backstretch, took over the lead leaving the half mile marker, widened advantage and hustled up
late on the turn, came two wide into the lane, had plenty left in reserve, pulled away from the field while ridden out and finished much the best. CLAY'S
OPAL INDY stalked the pace along the outside up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, was no match for commanding winner but
kept on and finished second best. SWEET DYNASTY tracked the top pair along the inside, launched a rail bid entering the far turn, saved ground into the
lane and finished well clear over the rest. SWEET LAURA raced off the pace, hustled along three to four wide around the far turn and had no response.
JERI DAWN failed to move into contention. TROPINKA tugged while trying to rate around the first turn, settled and held a slim lead into the backstretch,
go0t collared at the half mile marker and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
FAKE SOLUTION was well reserved and trailed the field, swung four wide and hustled up into the lane, gathered momentum under firm handling, surged to
the wire and edged rival in final stride. HOT STOVE LEAGUE was forwardly placed three wide up the backstretch, given cue turning for home, took a slim
lead upper stretch then angled inside, cleared command then got caught in final stride. AUTOPILOT pressed the pace two wide up the backstretch, moved
up to challenge for the lead midway around the far turn, got headed for the lead in upper stretch and briefly lost path when rival angled in, tipped out wider,
kept on and edged closer late. OPTIMISTIC VALOR raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into the lane, responded in the final furlong and
gained late. APOLLO BAY raced of the top trio up the backstretch, hustled along around the far turn and into the lane but failed to respond. MARQUEE
THUNDER held clear around the far turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared for the lead midway around the far turn and steadily
retreated. COOL CATOMINE failed to move into contention. THE RIDER OF AUTOPILOT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HOT STOVE LEAGUE IN UPPER
STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW STEWARDS RULED NO CHANGE

Footnotes
LAWLESS JOHN broke sharp and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch near the inside, turned back bids around the far turn,
saved ground entering the lane, roused for more upper stretch, responded willingly and kicked clear. MIDNIGHT RULES settled along the inside through
early stages, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, could not reach the clear winner but ran on with good response and cleared second best.
TWIRLING CHIEF was forwardly placed up the backstretch, hustled along two wide entering the far turn then took the inside spot, churned on through the
lane and cleared the rest. ONE LAST CHANT rated off the top trio running through the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn then
weakened in the lane. SOLE SURVIVOR stalked the pace along the inside, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.
SWAMPDRAINER failed to move into contention.

SHY RUNNER vied for the lead up the backstretch and continued to duel with IVY ABAD GIRL into the turn, shook free near the five sixteenths pole,
widened to a commanding margin then just lasted over gaining KID BIZ. KID BIZ rated off the early pace, edged closer late on the turn, swung four wide into
the lane, rallied gamely and just missed. REBA tracked up close along the inside then steadied entering the turn, chased inside then two wide in the stretch
run and held show. RUDY TOOTY sat back off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane, gathered some ground in late stages and just missed show.
REDNECKER was unhurried along the outside, hustled along four wide into the lane and had a mild improve. BIT A BAD NEWS raced off the pace, saved
ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. CATALE raced up close two to three wide in early stages, was ridden three wide around the turn and into
the lane, came up empty in the final furlong. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS showed response inn opening stages then weakened, chased two to three wide
around the turn and had no late response. IVY ABAD GIRL dueled for the lead with the eventual winner, could not match strides past the midway point
around the turn and steadily retreated. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE RUNNING ENTERING THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW
