LOVELY LOLA shared command to the top of the stretch, shook loose and won going away. ANGIE'S REVRAC saved ground from off the pace, slipped
through going into the stretch and proved to be a clear second. EXTRA SAUCE was rushed up to share command to the top of the stretch and tired. NOBLE
PRESENT broke well, vied for the lead from three wide around the turn and gave way in the stretch. CRIMSON T. was forwardly place around the turn but
failed to menace. PRAIRIE FIREBALL had no speed and was not a threat. TALLANDLONG raced near the back and was not a factor. WEST COAST ANDY
raced wide through the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
COLLUSIONIST tracked the leader from the inside to the half pole then moved out to the two path around the turn, took the lead at the three sixteenths pole
and pulled away and proved best. TRUTH SEEKER was off the pace in the three path then moved out to four wide in upper stretch, took aim at the leader
but was no match for the winner. RAMBLIN' MAN raced near the back, made a rail bid on the turn but lacked the late response. PRIME EXAMPLE went to
the front with a clear lead to mid turn then was challenged by an inside and outside rival to top of the stretch when he was collared and tired. WAGER NO
MO broke out at the start, raced four wide through the turn but was never a threat.
