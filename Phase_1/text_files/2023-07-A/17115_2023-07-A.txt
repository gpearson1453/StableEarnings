Footnotes
COVERT KAT , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced inside horses entering the far turn, eased outside approaching the
stretch, took command in upper stretch, lugged in and drew away. PIETRELCINA , a forward factor down the backstretch, chased the pace leaving the far
turn, bid for the led turning for home and weakened. MARYLAND MOON , in the two path between horses around the turn, steadied on the heels of
ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE in upper stretch, angled inside that one and rallied gamely. RECTOR , clear the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail to the
stretch then gave way. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE saved ground the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. ELON hopped at the break, failed to
be a factor and passed tired horses. ENERGY EFFICIENT bore out at the start, steadied in traffic approaching the first turn, attempted to get out entering
the first turn and was not a factor. SWING SAMMY lacked speed, raced inside horses in the stretch and showed some late interest. WILL'S MUSIC , outrun,
raced very wide entering the stretch. ACT LIVELY , along the inner rail down the backstretch and on the far turn, weakened. THEOLOVESAWINNER
chased the pace for six furlongs, circled the far turn three wide and faltered. QUALITY ART was no factor.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE BEAUTY bobbled slightly in behind leaving the gate, rated off the early pace while about five wide, edged up under some hand urging mid turn,
bid four deep soon after, responded when roused soon into the lane and eagerly drew away under a right handed drive. ELLIE VICTORINA broke a step
slow but quickly recovered and edged up to be forward between foes, eased out and bid three wide between horses after a half mile, was no match for the
winner leaving the three sixteenths but continued on with effort to hold down the place. FASHIONATTA stalked inside, briefly waited around the turn, cut the
corner with aim into the lane but lacked a serious finish through the final furlong. SHAKE IT GIRL , off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide for
the drive but came up empty. ICESTORMING , four wide leaving the far turn, faded. LADY CAGE FIGHTER , three wide stalking the pace, failed to kick on
past the five sixteenths, faltered and was eased late. EXCLUSIVE ROSE sped clear, set the pace off the rail, was hooked from both sides into the lane and
faltered.

Footnotes
COMBAT QUEEN stumbled at the break, edged up between foes in the opening furlong then dropped in, tracked patiently to the inside of a rival mid turn,
eased out and had clear sailing past the three sixteenths, responded to firm hand encouragement, sustained a grinding run to take over in deep stretch then
was moving away at the wire. ROCK ROSE set a pressured pace while under some nudging near the rail, shook clear under asking two wide entering the
lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, dug in when confronted from her outside near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. CANOODLE , off
the pace while saving ground, was coaxed along past the five sixteenths, gained some while staying inside in mid stretch but flattened out late. PAPER
MANSION stalked three wide outside the winner leaving the far turn, was put to a drive mid turn, chased into the lane and came up empty. COMPLETE
SURPRISE pressed the pace two wide outside ROCK ROSE, saw that one get away soon into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded on her left lead.

CIRCLING THE DRAIN , two wide the first turn, advanced three wide leaving the backstretch, challenged for the lead outside CRABS N BEER turning for
home, dueled to mid stretch then drew out under brisk urging. RICCIO , patiently handled to the stretch, moved up along the inner rail entering the lane,
angled out near the eighth pole, rallied and drifted out late. CRABS N BEER gained a clear lead entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn,
dueled with the winner to mid stretch and weakened in the drive. MISSION MAN assumed the early lead, lost the advantage on the backstretch, chased the
pace around the far turn, was in the two path turning for home and weakened. SAMUI SUNSET , three deep leaving the far turn, gave way. TRASH TALKIN
LARRY was outrun.

Footnotes
MY LAST MISSION prompted the pace while saving ground, sat patiently just off the leaders mid turn, responded when given his cue near the quarter pole
and cut the corner to join the fray, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, spurted clear under a solid drive then held firm. HEADS OR TAILS broke alertly and
tracked the leader three wide, moved to engage after a half mile, came under firmer asking past the five sixteenths, gained a slim lead dueling outside rivals
in upper stretch, could not quite go with the winner leaving mid stretch but kept on gamely to preserve the place. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN took over between
foes early and set the pace two wide, went clear past the five eighths, dueled to the inside of HEADS OR TAILS past the five sixteenths, fought on between
foes mid stretch, had his rider's whip knocked away inside the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. AMEDEUS MUSIC in a bit tight at the break, chased
between runners exiting the far turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and churned on. HE HATE ME broke a step slow, saved ground heading to the
half mile marker, came out a path and gave hard chase to the inside of a rival mid turn, angled four wide for the drive but came up empty. GALLANT GOLD
broke awkwardly then bore out, corrected to be three deep into the turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, faltered and was eased through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
FERAL'S JOY stalked the pace, raced in the two path around the far turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and narrowly prevailed. SIG sprinted clear soon
after the break, moved to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail, raced on his left lead in the stretch until the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly. HARD TRAVELER lacked speed, moved over to the inner rail, remained along the rail and rallied mildly. KING COVEE , outside horses down the
backstretch, circled five deep leaving the far turn and rallied. SNEAKING SUSPICION , a bit rank entering the first turn, was a forward factor inside horses
and weakened. THE JACKAL , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a factor and raced along the inner rail in the stretch. CINDER HILLS , wide
the far turn, was not a factor. FARINGDON raced between horses in mid pack down the backstretch and gave way leaving the far turn. MO MONEY MO
BETTA , three deep chasing the pace around the far turn, faltered.

Footnotes
YODEL E. A. WHO settled off the early pace, edged up behind foes near the half mile marker, angled out and was put to a hearty ride leaving the three
eighths, rolled up four wide into the lane, engaged ALL THREE from his outside past the three sixteenths, wrested a short lead inside the furlong grounds,
sparred under strong handling and held firm. ALL THREES rated kindly tracking the leader two wide, bid in hand nearing the five sixteenths, spurted clear
when sharply roused past the quarter pole, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, fought gamely inside the winner, switched over to his left lead
late but wasn't quite good enough. GALERIO broke a bit slowly, edged up early and raced in range while three wide, advanced under a ride and between
rivals nearing the stretch, altered out from behind the top pair leaving mid stretch and kept on with interest. WISH FOR PEACE rated in range while saving
ground, took closer order with a half mile remaining, was nudged on pursuing to the inside of rivals leaving the three eighths, steadied when stalled behind a
tiring foe near the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and continued willingly. SOUTHERN DISTRICT , caught between runners from the three quarter
pole to the five sixteenths, dropped back a bit soon after, angled out but lacked a bid. HIGHWAY BOUND cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, was
under asking to remain on top past the three eighths, failed to resist ALL THREES near the quarter pole then tired soon after.

Footnotes
DAREDAVITE lacked speed, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch, closed determinedly outside horses and was up late. BEE MAJOR prompted
the pace outside HONOR MY WORLD, bid for the lead on the far turn, battled through the stretch and finished gamely. SEVILLE ROW , outside horses
down the backstretch, was four wide the far turn and rallied between rivals. UNORTHODOX lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and
rallied mildly. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , up close outside horses backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, moved up outside horses, gained a short lead
near the sixteenth pole and weakened. NICKY BEAR , rank behind horses approaching the first turn, trailed to the far turn, swung to the six path entering
the stretch and passed tired foes. CALLOWAY PEAK lacked speed, saved ground on the far turn, swung out turning for home, raced between horses in the
stretch and steadied lacking room in deep stretch. HONOR MY WORLD set the pace near the inner rail and weakened. SOUTHPAW MIKE saved ground
around the far turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and was checked in tight quarters near the sixteenth pole. TRANSFER THE FUNDS was not a
factor. UNCAPTURED STORM , a forward along the inner rail down the backstretch, faltered on the far turn and was eased.
