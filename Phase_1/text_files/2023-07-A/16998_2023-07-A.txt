COMEDY ACT tucked to track behind the leading pair early on, tugged closer to them approaching the turn, checked subtly at the seven sixteenths pole
before slipping through to offer a rail bid soon after, sparred with an outer GOLDBLOODED at the three furlong pole, forged an advantage from that one in
upper stretch, but failed to kick away in the final furlong, dueled as that foe offered a rebid in the closing stages and held. GOLDBLOODED set the early
pace, raced off the rail into the turn, met a rail challenge approaching the three furlong pole, dueled with that one around the bend, got headed in upper
stretch, yet battled on through the final furlong but just missed regaining even terms. COEXIST prompted outside of the leading pair around the turn, failed
to keep pace with the lane, yet kept on to narrow the gap once more in the closing stages. FAST GAL was unhurried early, saved ground into the turn,
angled out stretch and offered no rally. HOAX was off a bit slow, was void of any early speed, raced four wide into the turn, then angled out five wide and
flattened out.

TRIDENT HIT was sent hard early, raced off the rail through the turns, met the bid of HE'S GOT THIS, shook clear from that rival, then met the bid of
TAPAGE, dueled with that rival to the wire while drifting out late and prevailed. TAPAGE raced in mid pack early, advanced between rivals into the home
turn, angled out to the five path out of the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and finished second best. DIGITAL was allowed to settle early,
was asked for run through the turn, moved up along the inside and was empty late. HE'S GOT THIS was up close early, advanced three wide through the
second turn, made a bid on the winner into the stretch and flattened out. BEAR OAK was reserved early, raced three wide through the second turn and
offered no late rally. WHAT A COUNTRY bobbled slightly at the start, was unhurried early, raced along the inside, angled out and never fired. ZOOMER
was void of any early speed, went three wide into the second turn, raced between rivals late and was no factor. COOL RAGS taken back was taken back
early, went four wide into the second turn and had no impact. PIPES AND DRUMS tracked the early pace, raced four wide into the second turn and gave
way. SHADRACK was outrun early and was finished early.

BRIGHTWORK set a pressured early pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer rivals turning for home, shook clear in upper stretch, dug in to embrace
an outer rival's rebid in the closing stages and held gamely. V V'S DREAM stalked outside the top pair approaching, loomed a danger while ranging up to
them in hand to offer a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but was turned away by her innermost counterpart in upper stretch,
kept on to offer a rebid in the final furlong, but was staved off late. EASY RED trailed the short field, was urged along in the four path around the turn and
surpassed a tiring rival in midstretch without threatening the top pair. CITY GHOST prompted the pace two wide, vied entering the turn, sparred between
horses at the five sixteenths pole, but yielded to them entering the lane and weakened.

that rival to late stretch and held off the closing run of UNINVITED GUEST for the win. UNINVITED GUEST followed the early pace, raced between rivals
into the turn, was eased back through the turn, angled to the rail, couldn't find room. angled out in mid stretch, was closing fast and just missed. BULLSEYE
BUN was away alertly, set an easy pace to the turn, met the bid of UNINVITED GUEST, dueled with that rival to late stretch and finished a game third.
BURNING BRIGHT was reserved early, was rushed through the turn while racing four wide and flattened out. COMMON BOND was unhurried early, was
hard held in the early stages, went five wide into the turn and was empty.

THE WINE STEWARD tracked outside of the top pair, launched a bid leaving the quarter pole, struck the front entering the lane and drove clear
approaching the furlong grounds. WILSON Q broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, advanced between horses soon after, chased along the inside
while a path off of the fence around the turn, awaited racing room behind the leaders at the quarter pole as an outer THE WINE STEWARD got a jump,
altered course four wide nearing midstretch after that foe kicked away, then ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole and prove second best. CALL ME
ANDY prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane, yielded on his left lead nearing the furlong
grounds and lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. GO OTTO GO set the pace inside of a prompting foe into the turn, vied with that one before the
eventual winner joined the fray nearing the lane, got headed by them straightening for home and gave way. MAGICAL MARK broke half a beat slow and
made little impact from the three to four path. UNIFIED POINT took contact from an inner foe at the start and was outrun along the inside.

BILLY JACK set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, inched clear while tipping to the two path leaving the quarter pole, then kicked away in
upper stretch and held sway safely from an outer rival late. CARCANO raced in mid pack early from the inside, angled out three to four wide while launching
a rally turning for home, sustained progress outside of rivals to gain place at the sixteenth pole, then was gaining late but unable to reel in the leader. PASS
LINE tracked along the inside through the turn, gained place from an outer foe at the furlong grounds while chasing the clearing leader, but lost that position
to an outer foe at the sixteenth pole. MR MCGREGOR stalked three wide, pursued from within striking range turning for home, but failed to keep pace with
the leader leaving the three sixteenths pole and yielded between horses in the final furlong. ARRO SMASH broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path
into the turn, tipped inwardly in upper stretch and rallied. MO FIGHT was off slow, was void of any early speed outside of rivals, inched closer in the four
path before fanning to the six path entering the lane, greenly refused a lead change thereafter and moved up outside of foes late. GOOD NEWS ROCKET
was taken back early, raced along the inside, shifted out stretch and never fired. ATTACHE prompted the pace two wide and weakened between horses at
the quarter pole. FOREVER COOL laid off of the pace in the four to five path and faded. FIRST PLAYER raced in mid pack in the three path and between
rivals and was empty late. HONOR GOLD was taken back early from the inside and was no threat.

FAST AS FLIGHT was up close along the inside early on, shifted outside of the pace setter and to the three path around the first turn, stalked before bidding
leaving the three furlong pole, vied before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, inched clear in mid stretch as an outer WHITE FROST took aim, then
shifted across that foe's path in the final furlong and held sway, bled. WHITE FROST was bumped by an inner rival causing her to be squeezed back
between horses at the start, was void of any early speed along the inside, improved inside of foes nearing the lane before angling out in upper stretch to
take aim outside of the new leader, but only managed to chase that one home while edging place in the final sixteenth. LADY HIDEAWAY set the pace in
the two path, met an outer challenge into the far turn, got headed nearing the lane and gave way in the final furlong. NAPA CANDY took contact from an
inner rival at the start, was unhurried four wide and chased evenly. CONTEMPORARY ART broke out and bumped a rival at the start, was hard held while
tracking from the two path around the first turn, settled along the backstretch, but was outmoved by an inner rival leaving the quarter pole and came up
empty, bled.

Footnotes
RYVIT set the pace in the two path from an outer prompting foe, vied with that one turning for home, shook free entering the lane and kicked away.
MULLIKIN tracked along the inside, bid for place inside of a rival at the furlong grounds while chasing the clear leader and gained that position approaching
the final sixteenth. SQUIRE CREEK broke outwardly, prompted the pace outside of the leader and from the three path, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but
was repelled entering the lane and gave way before losing place to an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. DAMON'S MOUND tracked the leaders early on,
chased them from the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, sustained a chase outside of foes thereafter, shifted out slightly at
the sixteenth pole but lacked a bid. FROSTED DEPARTURE laid off of the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. TUMBARUMBA lacked speed despite
steady urging from the rider, failed to respond to pressure in the four path around the turn and faded. GUNFLASH trailed in the five to six path and was
outrun.

Footnotes
ZOZOS set a pressured early pace while racing a bit off the rail, opened up entering the lane and edged clear. WAR CAMPAIGN was allowed to settle early,
pursued from midpack along the inside, improved nearing the lane, gained place approaching midstretch, angled outside of the clear leader passing the
furlong grounds, but failed to make late headway on that one and was second best. WARRIOR JOHNY failed to achieve forward position while lacking room
inside of a rival around the opening bend, shifted out before recovering to track in the three path entering the backstretch, shifted outside of the leading trio
at the quarter pole, then stayed on mildly and held show from an inner rival late. SANTIN lacked speed in the four to three path, retreated between horses to
trail the field at the quarter pole, yet cut the corner entering the lane and moved up inside of foes in midstretch. SEIZE THE NIGHT broke a step slow, raced
at the rear in the three path, got floated from the four to five path while subtly improving around the far turn, but made little impact. STRAVA broke a bit
awkwardly yet towards the front of the field, prompted outside of the leader from the three path, vied around the far turn, but gave way entering the lane and
weakened between horses in the final furlong. COLLABORATE stalked outside of the leading pair and from the four path, chased them while requiring
urging to sustain pressure around the far turn, but faltered between horses entering the lane.
