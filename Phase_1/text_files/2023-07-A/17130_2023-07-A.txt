Footnotes
JAKE THE RAKE raced four to five wide into the opening turn, tracked from the five path through the backstretch, gained the lead at the head of the lane,
and drew clear under handling. BODYMOOR HEATH rated off the pace from the rail, shifted outside then closed steadily to narrowly score the place.
CHESTER SLEW attended the pace from between foes, stalked the pace from the three path, moved up near the three-eighth pole to challenge RUN
ROSSCO RUN, lacked the rally needed in the drive and was nipped at the wire for place. RUN ROSSCO RUN disputed the early pace, showed the way
through the backstretch, was overtaken in the far turn, and faded. AGENT C raced six-wide into the opening turn, and lacked a bid. WIDE EYED WILEY
raced wide through the backstretch and failed to threaten.

IT'S ALEXUS went three-wide into the first turn, pressed the pace while five wide in the backstretch, moved up alongside LITTLE HARPER then match
strides to the stretch drive, continued to battle on outside under steady urging refusing to relinquish control, and prevailed after a long hard drive. LITTLE
HARPER saved ground while setting the pace, responded to pressure from IT'S ALEXUS, dueled inside through the stretch, gained an advantage
midstretch but was narrowly denied after a hard-fought battle to the wire. WHISKARITA hit gate leaving, trailed the field while positioned from along the rail,
responded to handling through the stretch, and finished well for show. SKY DESTINY stalked five wide in the backstretch, asked to quicken in the far turn,
and failed to threaten in the drive. BABS DELIGHT stalked three to four wide, and tired. BABS DELIGHT was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having
bled.

RUNNINFORCOVER reserved off the early pacesetters, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, struck the front into the stretch, remained clear to prove
best, driving. H K MELODY trailed the field, circled into the lane, closed late and got up in time for second. DOC COPE angled inside leaving the
backstretch, lodged a rail bid into the lane, moved up menacingly inside of RUNNINFORCOVER but was unable to get by and was caught late for place.
ANOTHERFORBROOKS chased in the four path, met traffic at the quarter pole, angled out sharply bumping into ABOVE AND BEYOND, and was
outkicked. ICE BOX INDY contested the early pace while in the five path, dueled outside SPOT ON DUDE in the far turn, inherited the lead briefly then gave
way. ABOVE AND BEYOND settled outside, was bumped at the quarter pole, and faded. SPOT ON DUDE contended the pace, was unable to move on
with rival with two furlongs remaining and stopped.

I SAID QUIET hurried inside, waited in the far turn, closed gamely with intermittent reminders and got up just in time. MISS MCBRIDE vied wide outside of
JIG'S DESTINY for the early lead, took pressure through the far turn, disposed of rival then moved clear, and was nailed at the wire. SMOKIN JOY reserved
off the pacesetters from the two path, responded to challenge from SHES A COOL CAT through the stretch, and held rival off for show. SHES A COOL CAT
unhurried early, raced four wide leaving the backstretch, moved up alongside SMOKIN JOY entering the stretch but was unable to get by under steady.
VALENTINO ROSSA trailed from the three path, and passed a tiring foe. JIG'S DESTINY vied hard inside, and left nothing in reserve, tiring.

WANDERING WEST raced four wide in the opening turn, angled inside to the three path into the backstretch, moved up at the three-eighth marker to take
over the lead, drifted out in the final turn, was kept under steady handling, and held. LANNY MAC sat just off the pace under a snug hold, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, and responded to urging early stretch to prove second best. TUCKER TIME raced in close quarters in the opening turn then
dropped back to trail the field, and closed late earning show honors. LONESOME CAT tracked from the rail, roused into the lane, improved position, and
was bested late for show. SPORTSCARR showed some early speed inside, had no response when challenged in the far turn, and faded steadily along the
rail. GIVE EM HECK BECK sat in range while four to five wide, and was through early. CARSON'S LEGACY chased four wide, and faded early.

MI REYNA quickly went to the front, responded gamely to pressure from LIGHT FAST FEET, was set down for a drive at the three-sixteenth pole, and drew
clear. JOY IN GRACE hurried inside, chased into the stretch then rallied in the final sixteenth and was along with time for place. LIGHT FAST FEET showed
early speed inside, disputed the pace inside of MI REYNA, was unable to sustain the bid needed, and weakened late stretch. QUICK DIAL stalked inside,
droved four to five wide at the head of the lane, drifted in midstretch and was unable to improve her position. MAGICAL LADY broke slow then trailed the
field, and offered a late bid. MIDNIGHT GARDEN failed to threaten. DEFINITE PLEASURE sat in striking range while five wide, and lacked a closing
response. SHE LOVES WINNIN reared leaving, chased outside and yielded.

Footnotes
DUKE OF DEWINTON raced from the back of the pack, advanced quickly nearing the final turn, waited for a seam that opened up at the three-sixteenth
pole, took the lead and held safely. ZURI RISASI settled in range, bid three wide in traffic at the head of the lane, rallied between, and held on for the place.
BRODY'S PAL settled off the leaders in the four path, shifted out and closed late just missing out for second. SPIRIT RACER vied inside for the early lead,
dueled inside of REAL JUSTICE in the final turn, was under attack into the stretch, and gave way grudgingly inside. REAL JUSTICE contested the pace
while five to six wide, responded to a challenge from SPIRIT RACER but was unable to move on with rivals and weakened deep stretch. PRENTON chased
throughout. TORQUE READY was outrun throughout.
