Footnotes
SAHM TEQUILA stalked the leaders off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
pulled clear. MATTS FIRE N ICE dueled on the inside racing up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, was caught in
upper stretch and chased the winner home from there. BOTANY trailed the field early, saved ground around the bend, began a bid in upper stretch and
gained ground late. DIAMOND BLITZ raced off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. RAY'S ANGEL dueled
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path coming around the bend and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SAINT SARENA pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, chased the leader from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane.
SUNSHINE FEVER bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, came around
the bend in the two path and improved position on the rail in the stretch. HARLOW'S HARMONY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came
around the turn in the two path and improved position mildly on the outside in the lane. AMARETTO DI AMORE led the field on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to show the way racing in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
DIAMOND MISSY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WHATDOYOUTHINKMARK led the way up the backstretch, expanded his lead from the two path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the
best. GENERAL BATTLE AXE raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path
and improved position in the lane while never threatening the winner. SUPER RENZO tracked the leader off the pace between horses early, navigated the
bend from the three path and kept on in the lane, no match for the winner. MO MO TOWN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the five path and finished evenly. BENZ LAKE THUNDER stumbled leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the
inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. VESTES was reluctant to load, bumped with the horse to his
outside at the start and then veered out in the opening strides, raced at the back of the pack early, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid.
CINCO MAJESTIC bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and faded in the stretch.
