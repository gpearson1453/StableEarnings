in upper stretch and was geared down at the wire. LAST MARTINI raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated
the second turn from the four path and improved position in the lane but was no match for the winner. MISHKO raced in the two path around the first turn,
stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and chased on to the finish. RELEASE THE BEAST saved ground
early, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and kept on in the stretch. FEEDING
FRENZY raced in the four path around the first turn, trailed the field between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and never
threatened. CHEST CANDY was in tight quarters at the break, trailed the field from the three path around the first bend, raced off the pace on the inside up
the backstretch, began a bid from the rail coming around the far bend and flattened out in the lane. PUSH THROUGH raced in the three path around the

Footnotes
SAINT CHARLES was away from the gate sharply, led the way up the backstretch and while saving ground around the turn and drew off while drifting out in
the lane. DIRECT ACTION raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the three path, and improved
position in the stretch. NOTACRY chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the lane. WIND
RIVER raced off the pace on the outside early, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and finished evenly. SUMMER ALL YEAR raced off
the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. SCATAMARAN bobbled and bumped with
the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to track the pace setter up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane.
SCARYATCANTERBURY bumped and was shuffled back at the break, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
RED CENTS dueled on the outside up the backstretch, floated out to the four path coming around the turn and held his lead while drifting out in the stretch.
COMO ESTAS dueled on the inside racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, and could not go with the winner in the lane but kept on to
the finish. SILENT SAILOR tracked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path and improved
position in the lane. RING TAILED TOOTER stalked the leader on the inside early, swung out to the four and five path coming around the turn and chased
on in the stretch. RED'S MR Z hopped up leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was not a
factor.
