Footnotes
NICKY JOLENE cut a pressured pace along the inside through swift splits under prompting from a pair and then LONCHURA to the outside, got set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. LONCHURA got bumped by PLAY FREE BIRD due to pressure from MISS
OMAHA, pressed the pace of the aforementioned foe from the two path between foes early on, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three
wide into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. GRAB THE
GLORY forwardly placed three wide just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late
stages while just securing the show honors. PLAY FREE BIRD lunged at the start and bobbled when bumped between foes and was forced to check out
conceding four lengths to the front, came under coaxing and chased three wide through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, showed good courage
offering up a bid a furlong out then weakened in the late going. FIND YOUR JOY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch, tired. WISE CONVERSATION got away to a hesitant start, then steadied soon after conceding three lengths to the front,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. MISS OMAHA broke in at the start bumping
PLAY FREE BIRD against LONCHURA, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FLAME went to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, shook clear while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well
when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, maintained a clear advantage under the crop until just before the sixteenth-pole then held under a
hand-ride from that point to the finish. JUST A NYQUIST lost her footing some at the start but broke with the field then was hustled, chased the pace on the
outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, swapped back to her inside late and was clear for the place.
SIMPLE SUGAR broke out and brushed the gate, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, remained on her inside lead under a drive in the
stretch and failed to threaten while best of the rest. LA LUISA pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and tired. SWEET AS SUGAR settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and
failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHILI FLAG (FR) tracked the pace along the inside, tipped briefly to the two path near the three-eighths before tucking back to the hedge when placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped three then two wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole and went clear under a drive to
prevail. IDEA GENERATION (IRE) bobbled at the break and was steadied when losing her lane to CHILI FLAG, tracked the pace along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to get up for the place honors in the last jumps. SWEET
DUTCHESS established the front and spurted away on the lead two to three wide down the backstretch through sensible splits, went just off the inside
through the far turn and had the field take closer order and was set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, got collared nearing the eighth pole and
ran on to the finish but was nailed late for the place honors. SHE'S A MIA chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide
into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish. TRIPLE P had the rider apply a firm right hand grip when appearing to want make a left hand turn soon
after the start, grew a bit hard to handle along the hedge out of the dog legged chut and went three wide down the backstretch, head cocked to the inside
briefly before settling into stride, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the spurting away leader, took closer order on that rival and came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LUNA WARRIOR broke a bit slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, moved up then was well placed towards the front, drafted in the two path on the
turn, made a bid between horses into the stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong and edged clear under steady urging. KASIMBA
angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn, was asked nearing the
quarter-pole then spun into the two path into upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner shortly thereafter, battled with that foe under a drive into the final
furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. LAWFUL settled towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three then four wide while
gaining late on that bend, rallied to make a five wide bid at the quarter-pole, battled outside of the top two in upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. FIRE BARON dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, came out into upper
stretch and failed to threaten. THATSMYBOXER tracked the pace on the outside,dropped back two to three wide early on the turn, was carried four wide
near the five-sixteenths then was taken in hand off heels, dropped back to the two path outside the quarter-pole then moved to the rail into the stretch and
had nothing left. BILL OF RIGHTS was hustled from the start, moved out then advanced to press the pace on the outside, tossed his head some inside the
five-eighths, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back between horses in upper stretch and tired. VESELSKY settled off the pace, was asked while
two to three wide early on the turn, moved to four wide later on that bend then was carried five wide, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in
upper stretch and faltered.

left handed crop while edging clear to the finish kept to task. RIDGEWOOD RUNNER coaxed from the start, cut a pressured pace from the two path under
coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch under challenge and was headed for command straightened away, tipped off the
inside as the aforementioned foe came in towards the rail in front, ran on willingly coming outwards towards the finish following the clear out as he drifted in
front while along well clear of the rest and second best. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND was away to a hesitant start when getting away a beat slow, chased three

Footnotes
SPETTRO went to the front in the two path on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace through slow fractions, controlled the action while inside on
the far turn, extended the advantage when set down into upper stretch, responded well under the crop in the drive and held under strong urging.
GHOSTLYPRINCE was taken under a tight hold on the first turn then rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was
asked in the two path into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth and gained with good courage late but missed while clear for the place.
MIGHTY ATLAS was taken under a snug hold while dropping from the two path to the rail on the first turn, raced off the pace under restraint, saved ground
on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. GENERAL'S DUTY came outward after the start, went
four wide around the opening bend, was reserved on the outside but with cover, lost the benefit of cover inside the five-eighths pole, tucked into the two path
while behind horses for the run around the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. NO REGARD was put under tight
restraint in the three path on the first turn, raced off the pace under reserve, was let out in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and also lacked the needed response. PARATUS was reserved at the rear in the two to three path, came four wide into
the stretch then quickly moved further out and failed to threaten. FAST GORDON ducked out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace
on the outside, was given his cue in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. MOST WANTED MAN came outward
after the start and was slow into stride, was caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, was asked in the four path
on the far turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. STRONG LIGHT was hustled from the gate then taken up after the start, checked
while eager in the three to four path on the first turn, tugged rankly on the bit early on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the five path, spun six wide
into the stretch and failed to respond.

three wide, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the clear leader, moved in while gaining into the final furlong and closed well to win going away.

was no factor. UP HER SLEEVE settled towards the front, saved ground while roused on the turn and failed to respond. REDZILLA lugged out significantly
under heavy left-rein pressure outside the seven-eighths pole, settled on the outside, dropped back four then five wide under urging on the turn and faltered.
