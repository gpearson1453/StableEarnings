Footnotes
DAWSON'S STORM drifted out impacting inside foes at the start, tracked the top pair into the turn, moved up three wide at the quarter pole, advanced to
challenge KISSED A CADET for the lead in upper stretch, dueled on the outside with rival holding an edge, dug in determinedly and got a nose up on the
wire. KISSED A CADET dueled for the early lead with STROLLER BOY, began to edge away leaving the turn then took on the challenge of DAWSON'S
STORM, held a slight edge over rival through the lane, battled on gamely and got nipped on the wire. A JUST CAUSE got carried in when the eventual
winner drifted out at the start, tracked the top trio into the turn, launched a rail bid entering the lane, sustained bid and cleared show. JUPITER MISSION got
carried in at the start, raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. STROLLER BOY vied outside of KISSED A
CADET in early stages, could not match strides past the quarter pole and tired in the drive. CAN'T BE CAUGHT got carried in and came away slow at the
start, trailed in the back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
INCA STROLL sped to the lead at the start, cleared and angled inside, set the uncontested pace into the turn, saved ground entering the lane, roused for
more in upper stretch, responded willingly, widened advantage and kept to task under steady encouragement. MORNINGNOONANDNITE was not too far
off the early pace, hustled along near the inside then angled out midway around the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the stretch run and got up late for
place. THAT'S OUR VISION was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, hustled along two wide into stretch run, was no match for clear winner but ran
on and got edged late for place. OLIVIA'S HOPE lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then shifted three wide and improved
positiion. QUIET I'M NOT raced in contention in opening stages, continued in range around the turn then gave way. ESPRIT ROUGE raced off the pace,
swung three to four wide into the lane and never threatened. CEL'S STAR was off to a good start then dropped back and never menaced. CANADIAN JANE
showed response in opening stages then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
CRYPTO MO sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm over close running
pursuers around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened advantage and kept to task under steady encouragement. IMONRA secured inside
position around the first turn and settled nicely tucked in just off the early pace, remained in contention around the far turn, given cue along the rail entering
the lane, tipped two wide for the drive, sustained a solid bid but had to settle for second best. STELLAR LADY was forwardly placed three wide around the
first turn, stalked the pace up the backstretch, launched a bid for command midway around the far turn, sustained a two to three wide bid through the lane
and secured a share. LOVE TANK rated off the early pace three to four wide, edged up closer entering the far turn, prompted three wide midway around the
far turn, raced in close contention then came three wide into stretch run and flattened out. PEACOCK LASS was unhurried and raced in the back, swung
four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FRIENDLYPERSUASION was forwardly placed up the backstretch, failed to keep pace around the far turn
and continued to tire in the drive. BROKEN HEARTS BAY settled nicely while rated three wide in the early going, moved up into closer contention with three
furlongs left to run then failed to sustain bid midway around the far turn and retreated.

GIANT GAME broke on top and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, held clear over pursuers around the far turn, saved
ground into the lane, dug in determinedly in deep stretch and held safe under a driving finish. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING secured inside position around the
first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, hustled up three wide nearing the quarter pole, came two to three wide into the lane, sustained a solid bid
for GIANT GAME and edged closer in final strides. AIN'T LIFE GRAND was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced off the pace up the backstretch,
circled up into contention late on the far turn, swung four to five wide into the lane and finished with good response. CALL ME FAST raced off the early
pace, made a move along the rail late on the far turn then tipped two wide for the drive, moved up into close contention a furlong out the flattened late.
WARRANT raced near midpack through early stages, launched a three wide bid midway around the far turn, moved up into contention, came three wide into
the lane and gave way. FROSTED GRACE raced in range up the backstretch, given cue midway around the far turn, angled in entering the lane and
weakened. PALUXY raced three wide around the first turn and settled off the early pace, hustled up into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. DOUBLE
THUNDER saved ground and never threatened. PROMISE KEEPER was forwardly placed up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued
to tire in the drive. FLEETRIDGE was forwardly placed through early stages, retreated around the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off. THE
FIRST FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED

ONE IN VERMILLION broke on top, led the way and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of HOW DID
HE DO THAT late on the far turn, dueled along the inside through the lane, dug in under left handed urging, drifted out and bumped HOW DID HE DO THAT
in deep stretch and finished on equal terms for the win. HOW DID HE DO THAT secured inside position around the first turn and tucked in nicely just off the
early pace, let out a notch and loomed up three wide near the quarter pole, challenged ONE IN VERMILLION at the head of the lane, battled outside of rival
into the final furlong, got carried out a path and bumped by aforementioned foe in deep stretch then finished on equal terms for the win. HEROIC MOVE
tracked the pace through early stages, waited along the inside around the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive, was forced to go out wider in deep stretch
and closed well. DENINGTON settled off the early pace, cut the corner entering the lane and launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, tipped out four wide
for a clear path and edged closer. WEST COAST COWBOY raced in range, coaxed three to four wide entering the far turn, ran on into upper stretch then
ran on evenly in final furlong. WARREN L was unhurried and raced in the back, hustled along late on the far turn and failed to move into contention. OCEAN
OF STORMS raced off the pace, swung three to four wide into the lane and had no response. BO CRUZ was forwardly placed around the first turn,
continued to stalk up close through the backstretch, sustained bid in close contention around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. BLACK POWDER
settled off the early pace and had no response when called upon. EYEING CLOVER raced near midpack, came up empty entering the far turn and jogged
in. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION, ONE IN VERMILLION WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM A DEAD HEAT FOR THE WIN AND

A J'S RIDE set a pressured pace up the backstretch then held clear around the turn, saved ground into the lane, widened advantage in upper stretch and
kept to task. PRESENT TIME tracked inside up the backstretch then weakened entering the turn, launched a three wide rebid in upper stretch and finished
second best. DIXIE PENNY stalked the pace in the opening quarter, hustled along three wide around the turn, ran on into the lane and held show.
ARRESTED got bumped back at the start, moved up into range along the outside, launched a bid around the turn then evened out in the final furlong. GO
GO GO raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MINNIE'S READY broke in and bumped with rival at the start,
pressed the pace up the backstretch, chased the leader around the turn then tired in the drive.

CHISHOLM TRAIL vied inside of rivals for the lead around the first turn, battled up the backstretch, shook free briefly then took on the challenge of HERZEN
midway around the far turn, shook clear turning for home and pulled away. DARYL'S BOLT was unhurried and raced off the early pace, saved ground then
tipped out three wide near the quarter pole, hustled along into the lane and finished second best. HERZEN tracked the early pace, vied for the lead with the
eventual winner at the quarter pole, could not match strides leaving the turn, kept on and held show. ITWASTHISBIG settled off the top flight in the early
going, hustled along two wide into the lane, angled to the inside and just missed show. CYBERTOWN vied for the lead around the first turn and up the
backstretch then came up empty around the far turn. GO FOR IT failed to move into contention. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD vied three deep up then backstretch
then retreated around the far turn.
