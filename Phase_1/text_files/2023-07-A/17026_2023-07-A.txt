gamely in the stretch and closed fast down the lane and was best for second place. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN chased the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, then bid on the turn to duel for the show prize down the home stretch and was up at the wire. SENORITA BROOKE vied for the lead early then
settled back to stalk the pace down the late backstretch and throughout the turn, then dueled for the show prize down the lane and just missed in the end.
MIZ JAMESON moved up along the inside while chasing the pace mid pack, then made a mild bid while three wide on the turn and was no threat. ELMO'S
SECRET raced along the inside behind the pack and was no threat. BLUEGRASS DIXIE raced behind the field while two wide then faded throughout and

BLAME DAY sped to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a well measured lead, and continued to the wire in a determined drive to hold off the closer.
APPROPRIATED FUNDS unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, steadily made up ground to the turn, circled five wide with her rally and kept on
down the lane to just miss. FEE stalked the pace from between horses, loomed up in the turn to threaten turning for home but failed to sustain her rally
finishing evenly. TAYLORS TAP slow early to trail the field, angled out for the drive and made up some ground in the lane. FAITH ALONE pressed the pace
for the early going and slowly faded. BONNIEVIEW raced prominently through the turn to be in contention three wide and tired turning for home.

MOR VICTORY battled for the lead with an inner rival into the first turn and throughout the backstretch, then dug in gamely leaving the far bend to kick clear
in the late stretch and hold on well to prevail. COWBOY RIDGE dueled from the inside into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive on
the far turn then was outkicked by the outer rival in the late stretch and was second best. CINCO RICHIE was in tight heading into the first turn, then stalked
the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied in the stretch to close evenly in the end. GET WITT GONE chased the pace
while three wide and outside foes down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS was
unhurried early then settled along the inside throughout and was no threat. MORO MAFIA settled back while three wide then faded throughout inside and
had no final bid.

DARYLS TRUMP CARD tracked the pacesetters from the fence through the turn, angled out four wide for the drive and finished willingly to be going away at
the line. GOING TO SANANTONE stalked the pace to the turn, circled three wide to engage the leader in upper stretch, kept coming to wear down the pace
maker but was out-finished in deep stretch. HEZAKOOLKAT sped to the lead shortly away from the gate, shook clear in the turn, responded when
challenged in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. SILVER ASSASSIN chased the leaders from three wide, was put to an early drive, and
failed to close ground finishing one-paced. GHOSTLY TIME pressed the early pace from the rail through the turn and tired turning for home. SONNY BOB
went evenly never posing a threat. MYTURNTODEAL hesitated at the start and trailed throughout as a non-factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY
INVOLVING THE RUNNING ON THE TURN BETWEEN HEZAKOOLKAT AND GHOSTLY TIME AND ..UPON REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH

place prize. SILENT BLING was moving up along the inside to rally while three wide on the turn and into the early stretch, then continued to bid well while
drifting out in late stretch. SPECIAL MEMORY dueled while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, was in a hard drive, was used up and gave
way in the end. CASINO MO chased the pace while two wide, then dropped back on the turn and continued to flattene out in the stretch. BANDERA BLING

Footnotes
OLGA'S GOLD DANCER unhurried early to be well off the pace down the backside, found her best stride entering the far turn, unleashed a six wide
sweeping rally to engage the leaders at the top of the lane and go right on passed and kept on in a drive to the line. MORO NALA tracked the leaders to the
far turn, angled out between horses to rally to the fore-front and finished well a clear second best but no match for the winner. GIRL WITH ATTITUDE
stalked the pace from wide the entire way, loomed up to engage the pacesetter turning for home and was out-finished by the top pair. RIVER'S END dueled
on the early through the first turn, opened a well measured advantage in hand down the backside, responded to challenges in the turn gamely and
weakened in the final sixteenth. MADAME RUE well placed tracking the leaders to the far turn and failed to mount a closing rally. GOLD MEMORIES rated
in mid-pack from three wide to the far turn to be in striking distance and finished evenly. RABBIT HOLE slow early to be near of the back well off the pace,
was set to a drive into the far turn and made a mild gain. RON'S LAVENDER had an erratic start veering out several strides from the gate and veering back
in when gathered up to be near the rear and never menaced from there. S S TURBINIA well placed for three quarters of a mile and faded. ANNA MARIE
trailed most of the journey as a non-factor. HIGINIA rank in the early going through the first turn, continued so while racing on the or near the lead, dropped
back down the backside, brushed the rail several times into the turn and dropped out of contention. THE STEWARD POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
RACING OF HIGINIA IN THE FAR TURN AND RULED NO CHANGE WAS TO BE MADE.

Footnotes
TEO sparred with an inner rival for the lead throughout the backstretch and into the turn, continued to menace gamely in the early stretch then kicked clear
the last sixteenth and held on well to prove best in the end. PITALE dueled from the inside throughout the first three quarters, was in a long drive heading
into the early stretch then gave way grudgingly in the end. ZAP MOTION was rated while three wide down the backstretch and throughout the turn, then
rallied gamely down the stretch and was up for the show prize. CALARI BLUECAT chased the pace while two wide at a moderate pace throughout the first
three quarters of the field then closed fast down the lane but came up empty. SONGWRITER was bumped on both sides then settled along the inside,
rallied in the upper stretch but it was too little too late. PLAIN TAP WATER chased the pace from the inside mid pack then flattened out in the stretch and
was no menace. UPTOWN BIGBADJON broke inwardly and bumped rival then raced behind the field and was no factor. SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE broke
outwardly at the start and bumped rival and was no factor.

KISS PRINCIPAL raced in the middle of the field and outside rivals while four wide down the backstretch, was moving up on the far turn, then dug in gamely
to take command in the early stretch then was kept to task till the end. BIG STORY set the pace while two wide, was in a long drive heading into the far turn,
then vied to keep the lead in the early stretch before giving way and was second best. DENS DEVILLE chased the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive
throughout the far turn to menace in the stretch for the show prize and was up at the wire. GIST was unhurried early throughout the early furlongs then
came out three wide on the far turn to rally in the early stretch, angled in towards the inside and continued to close well. VICTOR VALENTINO chased the
pace while two wide, then rallied from from the five path in the late stretch to close willingly in the end. PERFECT TOM settled in the two path in the early
furlongs, then rallied while four wide on the far turn to vie for the show prize in the stretch then gave way in the end. TREASURE COAST pressed the pace
from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, then moved up to vie for the lead entering the stretch but was used up and tired in the end. CLASSIC
RUNNER raced along the inside towards the back of the field then made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat. SOMEBODY IN TEXAS chased the
pace while three wide then dropped back before heading into the far turn and continued to flatten out. CALIPARI settled in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
HAILEY'S JEWEL unhurried early to be near the rear of the field the first half mile while saving ground along the fence, cut the corner turning for home,
closed well tipping out around the pacesetter and finished with a flurry under strong handling. WICKED SONG tracked the leaders down the backside,
rallied four wide in the turn to be in striking distance and closed well to gain the place. SKY ROCKER took control into the first turn after being a bit erratic,
bobbling briefly down the lane the first time, set a well measured pace down the backside, cleared coming for home, dug-in gamely when challenged but
weakened in deep stretch. MISSINGYOUCRAZY rated off the pace while caught wide in the first turn, moved to contention approaching the far turn, rallied
five wide to be prominent and finished with a grinding close. OLIVIA'S RACE DAY well placed just off the leaders to the head of the lane, loomed in upper
stretch but was out-finished to the wire. SI QUERE slow early to trail to the quarter pole, angled wide in upper stretch and closed well belatedly. KAUSE I'M
DEVINE reserved off the pace to the far turn and made a mild bid down the lane. TRANQUILITY raced near the rear of the field most of the way and passed
tiring rivals down the stretch. COUNTRY JEWEL went evenly never posing a threat. HEAD OVER BOOTS prompted the pace for a half mile and gave way
coming home. LUMBERJACK LESLIE showed brief speed to be prominent in the first turn and was through early. BLING ON THE LIGHT stalked the pace
to the far turn and tired.
