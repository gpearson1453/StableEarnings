Footnotes
SERENADING HALL had a good rail position watching the top two engage throughout the turn, shifted out between horses in the four path for the drive to
the wire, was full of run at the eighth pole and was drawing away nicely for the win at the finish line. GAMBLER'S POSE was off a step slow to co-trail
outside down the back straight, was ridden midpoint on the turn gaining on rivals, angled out widest in the five path for the stretch drive and offered a solid
finish closing in late to just get up for the runners up share at the wire. TOP OF THE MORNIN had a good spot tracking the contesting duo three wide on the
turn, waited to pounce turning for home, cruised to the lead outside around the fading pacesetters in upper stretch but could not find more to hold off the
closers in the late stages of the race and had to settle for third money in the end. I'M PHANTOM was hustled to narrowly lead down the backstretch on the
rail, lost the lead to an outside foe at the three eighths marker, faded inside in mid stretch and held for a minor role in the end. SAY GRACE was away just a
step behind the field to begin, co-trailed inside at the half, had to tap on the brakes briefly entering the turn coming up on a rival, was shuffled back to see
the field at the top of the lane and could not reach contention to the finish. CRIMSON SKY pressed the frontrunner outside down the backside, took
command at the three furlong marker, was collared outside in mid stretch and backed away in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BUCYK stalked from between runners in the second flight, moved out gradually leaving the turn while commencing a bid coming four wide to the top of the
stretch, put to stout urging, struck the lead just past the furlong marker, held under continued encouragement. MIDNIGHT MASCOT shadowed the
pacesetter from just off and outside, lost ground on that one about midway on the turn and was ridden along past the five-sixteenths, travelled two to three
wide, kept on in late stretch but was only second best. BEE ME soon moved to the fore to set the tempo inside on or just off the rail, was in hand and
beginning to edge away midway on the turn, drifted out a bit turning into the stretch, drifted back in soon after, was overtaken in mid-stretch while weakening
despite encouragement, drifted out and in yet again nearing the sixteenth pole. TUNECHI tracked from inside, south a seam along the rail in upper stretch
but had to tap on the brakes as a rival drifted back in front, attempted again to run along inside nearing the sixteenth pole but had to steady once more.
SOUTHERN STYLE bumped the outside rival at the start, was well-positioned stalking from outside mid-division, went three to four wide on the turn, moved
out five wide in upper stretch and ran on. THEFRONTIERSMAN raced between runners at the back lacking early speed, went in the two path through the
turn, ran on mildly in the lane. AWESOME ENTRY was outside runners off the pace heading to the turn, went three wide on that bend coming out a bit
turning into upper stretch, lugged in near the sixteenth pole and was not persevered with in the final stages. MOTSKARI was bumped into a foe and
squeezed back at the start, raced outside three then four wide on the turn while advancing just a bit, came out seven wide in upper stretch, was never near
enough to threaten. ROYAL HUDSON was bumped fairly hard at the start, raced at the back shifting in from four to three wide early on the turn, was never
near enough to threaten. HALCON NEGRO was coaxed along inside racing at the back leaving the backstretch, was not a factor. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH, BEE ME WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND TUNECHI FOR
INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
VERI GIZMO was under a snug hold behind the contesting duo in a tightly bunched field at the half, waited behind a tiring rival throughout the turn to be
shuffled to last two furlongs from the wire, shifted out four deep finally getting running room turning for home and exploded in the final eighth for an eye
catching turn of foot in the late stages. HOLIDAY WITH AMY stalked four deep outside runners at the half, circled challengers four wide at the three eighths
pole to lead two furlongs from the finish, offered no resistance to the fast closing winner in mid stretch and had to settle for second best of this day.
GOLDEN SUZIE prompted the pace outside in the beginning, had a slim lead at the seven sixteenths marker, put away the early speed rivals midturn,
battled the new outside challenger in upper stretch and determinedly finished to hold for third money. SECRET GIZMO settled three wide with runners on
either side with a half mile remaining, was on hold in close quarters in this bunched pack midway on the turn and finished up with energy for a small share in
the end. SMILES FOR DAVID settled in the two path between horses in the back straight, was nudged around the turn trying to keep position, shifted four
deep at the top of the lane and passed weary runners in upper stretch. SANDY GRACE tracked the top two outside down the back straight, took up the
running three wide for the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, could not quicken between horses at the quarter marker and tired at the three sixteenth pole
while drifting inwards. IT'S A BIG SONG took command on the rail leaving the chute to set the pace down the backstretch, started to weaken on the rail
under pressure up front into the turn, was roused for more five sixteenths from the finish, was steadied inside at the top of the lane and was not persevered
with to the finish.

Footnotes
COLLECT DATTT stalked the loose on the lead pacesetter two to three wide into the turn, put to some urging past the five-sixteenths, drifted out a bit
turning for home, took aim in upper stretch, struck the lead past the furlong marker, was soon clear and held safe. SOCIETY'S KAT was allowed to settle
into stride racing just off the leader, dropped back a bit late up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came out five to six wide for the drive, kicked on
belatedly and willingly to get up for second. TIPSY MOON moved to the fore after the opening sixteenth under some coaxing and clear by the opening
furlong, set the pace racing inside and without much encouragement, was put to urging in upper stretch but weakened, held show honors. HELLUVA
HOLIDAY raced outside at the back going four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five to seven deep, improved position late. TRICK AND TREAT
bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, saved ground racing inside, went evenly and made no bid. SHEBATOWN raced between runners at the rear three
wide into the turn, was not a factor. EGBERT J was lightly bumped at the break, raced at the back inside foes but off the fence, was never a threat.

Footnotes
LAST DAWN tracked the top duo travelling in the first turn, was patiently reined back at the half to have a good position watching the front trio engage on
the final turn, was roused with five sixteenths to go, loomed four wide in the drive to the wire and pulled away in deep stretch. HALL OF DREAMS settled
near the rear just outside in the first turn, made an early move sensing the slow pace to to be challenging up front three deep at the half, continued pressing
for the lead on the far turn, took control at the three sixteenths pole but could not find more and was no match for the closing winner in the final sixteenth.
STOWAWAY assumed control on the rail while well in hand in the early going, had a slim lead setting the soft pace at the half, lost some positioning through
the far turn inside to be shuffled on the fence at the top of the stretch and re-rallied on the rail to come on again to capture third money in a close four way
photo. MO TOURIST tracked the top pair two wide in the first turn, was nestled on the rail behind the frontrunners down the back straight, was ridden to go
after the embattled threesome three furlongs from the finish, at the top of the lane was in the mix running behind horses and determinedly between runners
got up for a minor role. QUIET SUNDAY was hard held at the back with three quarters left to run, was checked on the rail at the back when the field
bunched up midway down the backside, was scrubbed on the fence commencing a run on the final turn, angled out to the five path turning for home and
rallied outside to be involved in a close multi horse photo for show in the end. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was content sitting off the frontrunner on the first turn, was
forced to engage to keep position between rivals with a half mile remaining, battled between foes for the lead on the final turn and faded with runners on
either side nearing the wire. DREAM JEREEM trailed the field three wide into the first turn, stalked close to the rear down the backstretch, could not get
involved running outside foes through the far turn and was not a factor six wide driving to the finish.

PROUD SPEAKER moved to the lead soon after the start, set the pace with pressure from an inside foe, began to edge away and clear past the
seven-sixteenths, extended the margin on the turn and upper stretch still racing in the two path, was eased up late when safely in front. ATTABE got away
alertly, pursued the pace from between runners two to three wide, was encouraged along late up the backstretch, put to stronger urging leaving the turn,
was no match for the winner but held the place. BE LIKE LEIGH advanced midway up the backstretch inside foes but off the fence to get closer to the
leaders, came out a bit further turning for home, shifted back nearer the rail near the furlong grounds, ran on inside but missed second. TALKING
WONDERS tossed the head at the start and bumped lightly with a rival soon after, regained contact with the field heading up the backstretch inside foes,
raced in about the two path into the turn at the back, angled five wide coming to the quarter pole, ran on with mild late interest outside in the stretch.
STRATEGERIZED was well-placed stalking from outside three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. GHOST PAINTER bumped lightly with a rival just
after the start, raced toward the back, last but one, kept wide up the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, failed to rally. JULIE'S MIST was fractious in
the gate, moved forward inside to press the eventual winner, came up empty.

Footnotes
DREAM SHAKE was up front comfortably setting the fractions in the early stages, opened up on the chasing rivals two furlongs from the line, was kept to
the task at the furlong marker and held on well at the end. BORDER TOWN broke slow at the start, was under a snug hold outside near the rear down the
backstretch, advanced on the rail through the turn, angled out four wide with three sixteenths to go, had no room in upper stretch, shifted to the rail in the
final sixteenth and came with a run in at the wire. STEP FORWARD settled in mid field on the rail at the half mile marker, took closer order to the frontrunner
running inside on the turn, dug in on the fence in mid stretch and finished up to capture third money at the wire. TOWN CRUISE chased the pace outside in
the beginning, continued to go after the winner throughout the turn, could not gain any ground at the top of the stretch and yielded in the final eighth to settle
for a small piece of the prize. READY FOR A FIGHT stalked three deep outside down the back straight, offered a mild run outside midpoint on the turn,
angled six wide for the stretch run and had no finish to give. SCOOT DADDY tracked three deep in close range of the leader at the half, was coaxed to go
after the pacesetter three wide at the quarter pole, made little impression at the top of the lane and tired while drifted in at the sixteenth pole. BODE'S TIPSY
trailed on the fence down the back straight, was asked for more runner to keep in touch with the field on the turn and could only pass a tired runner in mid
stretch. HICKSY travelled in mid pack between runners down the backside, was hard ridden with five sixteenths from home making little headway on rivals
and was empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
THE GREAT OZ settled unhurriedly dropping back to the rear, went five wide on the turn beginning to pick it up willingly, was under moderate urging
through the lane and drove past inside the final furlong. LORD OF WAR stalked from outside, went four wide on the turn and encouraged along leaving that
bend, bid in mid-stretch in conjunction with the winner, was no match but second best. DOWNY BOY was outpaced early, saved ground on the turn, put to a
drive past the quarter pole, came out four wide at the top of the stretch, put forth good late effort to get show honors. PERFECT CRIME chased from
between runners going three wide on the turn, came out five wide for the drive, ran on. HAVE A SOUPER DAY was between runners to the turn, dropped
back to last four wide on that bend, swung out seven wide turning for home still trailing, drifted out several paths in the stretch but kept on to regain a better
position. OTTAWA broke a step slowly, was in just a hair of traffic early, raced inside on then just off the rail, failed to menace. MAAKWA broke a step
slowly, was coaxed forward inside taking the lead after the opening three-sixteenths, was clear soon after setting the tempo, came up empty for the drive.
MR CROWLEY had the early lead, was overtaken and stalked the new leader up the backstretch travelling two to three wide on the turn, moved out three to
four deep for the stretch run, faded.

FIRST EMPIRE led the field leaving the chute, was headed outside with a half mile to run, began to inch away from challengers on the turn, opened up on
horses in mid stretch and held safe to the wire. SOUPER WATSON was allowed to settle down the backside travelling two deep outside rivals, shifted off
the inside to be five deep outside near the rear at the quarter pole, finally find a seam to run through inside the eighth pole and closed strongly late to get up
for the place share in the end. SECRET RESERVE was bumped by the outside runner at the start, was under hard restraint trying to sit off the co leaders
entering the turn, settled three wide outside just back off the top pair three furlongs from the finish, was gaining slowly to the wire in the four path, ducked in
at the finish and just missed holding for the place award. LAST AMERICAN EXIT picked up the bit to press the pacesetter two wide at the half, chased the
winner on the turn, was still in with a chance three sixteenths from home but could not not find another gear in mid stretch and held for a minor share in the
end. TOLD IT ALL chased inside in the early going, had a good spot on the rail behind the winner through the turn, was asked in the two path turning for
home, could not fire and faded in the final sixteenth of a mile. SILENT RUNNER had a nice position tracking the top three in the two path outside foes at the
half, was roused between runners at the five sixteenth marker in mid pack and was one paced through the lane. COINAGE broke with the field but quickly
was taken back to be near the rear on the fence down the back straight, was ridden on the fence through the turn making little impact and showed little in
the stretch. MASON'S GAMBLE hit the outside gate on the start ,rebounded inwards to bump rival on the break, settled four deep outside runners in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, could not advance four wide around horses on the turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and gave way through
the lane.

Footnotes
MORAL TURPITUDE was in just a hair tight entering the first turn racing inside, settled in the back half of the field, moved out on the far turn, shifted further
to reach the top of the stretch seven wide and full of run, rallied to drive to the front nearing the seventy yard marker and cleared. ONDINE LADY tracked
from inside with decent forward position, came out in upper stretch after saving ground, bid about a furlong out but was outkicked and second best.
PLAYMATE settled at the rear near but off the rail, moved out a bit further on the far turn, was tipped out further in upper stretch for room, once engaged
rallied strongly but too late. PAINTED GLORY was forwardly-positioned four to five deep in the early going appearing to fight the rider's restraint, was still
under a hold early up the backstretch and lost ground and position as rivals advanced outside heading to the far turn, swung out eight wide for the drive and
came again to finish up strongly. ANITA MARGARITA moved to the fore to set the early pace racing off the rail in the two path, was overtaken at the
three-quarter and settled off that rival and inside content to attend, inherited the lead again when that one weakened, was clear into upper stretch,
challenged in mid-stretch, yielded late. ANDROMACHE was checked heading into the first turn when in tight and on heels, raced three to four wide toward
the back on that bend, advanced between runners three wide into and on the far turn, angled nearer the rail for room at the top of the stretch, kicked on
mildly. MONEY BEETS settled off the pace two to three wide, moved out and advanced outside foes five to six wide up the backstretch, was within range on
the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. PRINCESSONAMISSION raced up close in pursuit of the leaders three to four wide, asked for more at the
five-sixteenths but had nothing. LADY XI settled at the rear outside racing three to four wide, swung eight deep into upper stretch, failed to threaten.
QUICKER TREAT was caught six wide through the first turn, moved up to garner more forward position heading up the backstretch, was in range four to five
deep on the far turn but faltered and faded. SUPER SICILY was in tight quarters heading to the first turn, moved forward under encouragement outside foes
five wide on the first turn to take the lead at the three-quarters, set the pace from outside the earlier leader racing three deep up the backstretch, retreated
from the seven-sixteenths.
