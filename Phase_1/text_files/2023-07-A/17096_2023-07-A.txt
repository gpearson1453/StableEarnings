Footnotes
SPANISH PRINCE tracked two wide eyeing the front pair on the first turn, had good position watching the leaders down the backstretch, made an early
move outside for the lead three furlongs to the finish, proved to be the winning one while opening up on rivals throughout the final turn, was kept to the task
to the finish and held safe in the end. BENLION stalked near the back in the early stages, closed the gap on the pacesetter at the half mile marker, offered a
good late run splitting horses in the two path at the top of the lane and closed four wide late to get up for the runners up share in the end. ROOKIE RADAR
prompted the frontrunner into the first turn, took closer order on the rail behind the leader into the far turn, tapped on the brakes for a few strides with three
furlongs to go, shifted off the rail to split runners at the quarter marker, looked the threat turning for home and stalled in mid stretch giving way late losing the
place share. STRONGER TOGETHER rated kindly in mid pack on the rail down the backside, shifted three deep at the half, rallied two wide midway on the
far turn, could not maintain position, was pushed out three wide in upper stretch and finished evenly to the wire. SENSING HOLIDAY took this field into the
first turn, dictated the pace down the backstretch, was collared outside with three furlongs to go, offered no resistance to the fast charging winner and
faltered at the top of the stretch. MISTER MESEEKS was allowed to settle trailing the field on the rail and throughout the back straight, made mild headway
passing a tired runner in upper stretch but could not get into contention driving to the wire. ROBITAILLE stalked near the back three wide into the first turn,
continued close to the rear down the backside making little progress and could not make up any ground on the far turn.

Footnotes
DEFOGGER was caught four to five wide through the first turn racing just off the leaders, advanced early up the backstretch, shifted in to press the leader
while on nearly even terms into the far turn bumping that one and brushing the outer rival lightly at that juncture, dueled through the far turn, drifted out a bit
turning into upper stretch, kept on under steady handling to take command past the furlong marker and edge clear. MANETKA angled in entering the first
turn with forward position, tracked from inside in behind the leaders, put to urging past the three-eighths, angled out past the quarter pole, had aim on the
leaders and loomed a threat, ran on evenly to secure the place. KINZHAL moved forward and clear shifting in to the two path to set the pace, was pressured
up the backstretch, bumped heading into the far turn, dueled inside a rival on the far turn, maintained an advantage in the stretch till past the furlong marker,
yielded grudgingly. OPEECHEE settled into stride, saved ground till leaving the far turn, came out for the top of the stretch then angled out further for room
and aim on the leading trio, kicked on with mild late interest but needed more. DOC FISHMAN rated in behind the leaders off the inside in the three to four
path through the early going, ran on evenly. HEART BOY broke a step slowly and lost the path at the start, settled near but off the inside, failed to rally when
asked. RARE DISCOVERY raced in the back half about three deep through the first turn, continued off the inside through the far turn, was never near
enough to threaten. WIN THE DRAW broke outwardly, was caught wide racing outside foes four to five deep through the first turn in the back half of the
field, advanced rapidly five deep up the backstretch, drew nearly even while shifting in heading into the far turn, was lightly brushed, began to drop back at
that point and faded. DIO BRANDO was forwardly-placed stalking the early leader, edged closer three wide to press, began to retreat from the
nine-sixteenths.

Footnotes
TAQUANYAH was in a good spot tracking two wide outside horses, bid between runners in the four path at the quarter pole to have a narrow lead three
sixteenths from home and stubbornly dug in late to prevail at the finish. SWINGING MANDY settled in mid field on the rail, was well in hand waiting inside
throughout the turn, was looking for room to run straightening out for the drive, found a seam shifting out two deep in upper stretch and closed in on the rail
for second money. HALAGA travelled in mid pack outside foes early on, saved ground inside running on the turn near the rear, was blocked behind runners
until the three sixteenths pole, angled out six wide for clear run and closed in deep stretch to get up for the show money. RETAIL THERAPIST galloped
around horses comfortably on the turn, cruised up to be involved on the lead in the five path with three sixteenths remaining but stalled in deep stretch and
had to settle for a minor role in the end. REMEMBERING RHODA was void of early speed to trail down the backside and through the turn, started to
commence a run behind foes four wide at the top of the stretch, angled out to be seven deep in mid stretch but made little impact running to the finish. LIVIN
ON LUV sat behind the leader inside, shifted just off the fence three furlongs from the finish, could not maintain position with rivals on either side in upper

Footnotes
SWATH stalked just off the leader two to three deep, asked for run outside the quarter pole, advanced on the leader taking over in upper stretch, drifted out
gradually the rest of the way while clear and held. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS exchanged minor contact at the start, was forwardly-positioned into the turn
chasing three wide on that bend, kept on to gain the place. IT WORKED had light contact with the aforementioned, settled at the back and shifted in, saved
ground advancing inside on the turn, shifted five wide leaving that bend, gained some then evened out late. FAST LANE bumped a rival lightly twice soon
after the start, was forwardly-positioned but off the pace racing outside four to five wide into and on the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. EXTRACTION
WILL bumped very lightly with a rival at the start, chased two wide into the turn, lost ground on that bend, kept on evenly in the stretch to regain a better
placing. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY was bumped lightly twice shortly after the start then in a bit tight, was ridden along four to five wide on the turn, failed to
menace. SMART COVERAGE sped clear after breaking alertly, shifted in to dictate terms inside, was still clear past the quarter pole, challenged in upper
stretch and faded. STUBBORN STREAK raced mid-pack two to three wide, continued three to four deep on the turn and asked for more, failed to meance.
LOVE THE GAME chased from inside and asked for more outside the quarter pole, came out in upper stretch, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
GAMBLE'S ORB had a very nice inside tracking trip behind the contesting duo down the backside, shifted out three deep at the seven sixteenths marker,
bid three wide midway on the turn and wore down the stubborn leader through the entire stretch to get up nearing the finish. LANTANA LADY had a short
lead between runners after the start, put away the early pace rival midpoint on the turn, braced for the new challenge from the winner three wide outside at
the top of the lane and fought on determinedly to the wire just missing late in a gutsy rail frontrunning effort. CHERRY GARDENS pressed outside into the
turn, was hard ridden with horses on either side with five sixteenths to go, could not match strides with the top two finishers turning for home but gamely
fought on the fence to hold for the show award in the end. I'M SNOW ANGEL trailed down the backstretch and throughout the turn, angled four wide for the
stretch drive, found her best stride late outside to close widest getting up for a minor role. UNIFIED FRONT stalked in mid field down the back straight,
offered a mild turn of foot three wide around runners three furlongs from the finish, was in with a chance five wide in upper stretch for a piece of the prize
and could only finish evenly in the final eighth. MOUNTAIN SOUND settled near the rear three deep at the half, began picking up runners three wide outside
at the quarter pole, continued her sustained run throughout the stretch and passed tiring runners to the finish. KANTBACKOFF tracked two wide outside in
the second flight, was asked for more four wide at the seven sixteenths pole to keep pace with the eventual winner and yielded late between runners in the
final hundred yards. KILLING TIME stalked outside in the third flight down the back straight, was roused between rivals three eighths from the line, offered
no response and was not a presence running to the wire. LINDA'S OPAL was situated near the rear two deep at the half mile marker, could not make any
gains through the turn and could not get involved for the stretch run. SNOW LAKE travelled in the middle of the pack inside, offered a mild run advancing on
the fence three furlongs from home but gave way in the two path in the final furlong.

Footnotes
STAR SIGN rated in behind early, switched outside the leading pair late up the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn, took aim, struck the lead past
the eighth pole and drew clear. MALIBU SECRET moved to the front readily to set the pace shifting in and racing just off the rail, was challenged by
mid-stretch, outkicked but second best. CHANCEL shadowed the pacesetter from outside going three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. DIXIE
GIANT settled a bit off the pace stalking from outside, went four wide on the turn, ran on. HONEY WON'T angled in heading up the backstretch, tracked
from inside saving ground on the rail, had room to get through along the fence nearing the eighth pole but could only go on evenly. DESOLATOR broke
inwardly, was taken back in the early going, began to advance moderately three wide on the turn, angled eight wide turning for home, ran on. C C'S
KINGDOM stalked in behind about mid-pack racing three wide on the turn and asked for more past the three-eighths, failed to respond and had no rally.
SUNRISE DRIVE bumped lightly with a rival and was in tight clearing the gap early, race outside heading into the turn, fanned four to five wide turning for
home, failed to menace. READY HERO was a bit fractious in the gate, broke just a step slowly, advanced rapidly outside foes early on the turn five then six
wide, could not sustain the effort. FIRST SPRING raced off the rail early then nearer inside through the turn toward the rear, was never near enough to
threaten. WENJACK was bumped lightly early while clearing the gap, raced inside, fanned three to four deep into upper stretch, was not a threat.

Footnotes
LIL BIT GANGSTA was steadied shortly after the break to stalk near the rear, made steady advance inside on the turn, bullied his way through horses in
upper stretch to bid four wide at the furlong marker and was edging away in the end. QUIET INTENT tracked the top three runners between horses with a
half left to run, bid two wide splitting runners at the three furlong marker, took control in upper stretch and was outfinished by the winner in the final
sixteenth. MIDWAY MISCHIEF trailed three wide in the early going, got to the rail saving ground into the turn, shifted three wide at the half, found a lane
eight wide at the the three sixteenths pole and closed belatedly to capture third money. LANGSTAFF ROAD travelled on the rail off the leader into the turn,
was given a reminder to keep up left handed three furlongs from the wire, continued to stay inside on the fence at the top of the stretch to be in the hunt and
willingly chased the leaders to the finish for a small share. GRACEFUL FIGHTER was alone on the rail stalking the front end charge of runners down the
backstretch into the turn, waited behind a wall of tiring runners at the quarter pole, had traffic issues trying to find a path for a clear run throughout the
stretch, finally found a seam at the eighth pole and ran on late gaining on rivals. SPRING MOUNTAIN engaged for the lead in the beginning, took up a
chasing role four wide running on the turn, faded in the six path at the top of the lane and made little impression to the wire. BONGINO won the multi horse
duel for the front end down the backstretch, set the pace inside running on the turn and was swallowed up by the closers at the furlong marker. STORMIN
DAVE travelled six deep outside being a part of the early pace down the backside early, was taken back off the leaders into the turn, continued a wide trip
running outside, angled out eleven wide in upper stretch and could not offer a finish. GROOM LAKE stalked outside four wide in the second flight on the
turn, angled out to the nine path off tiring leaders entering the stretch but could not reach contention running to the wire. STOLEN MONEY battled for the
lead three deep down the backside, chased the leader three wide on the turn, drifted inwards turning for home in the five path and folded in mid stretch.
NIKKI NOOTS settled near the rear two wide in the beginning, was uninterested on the turn losing touch with the field and was not a factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
NONNO'S LITTLE BOY settled off the pace three to four wide through the first turn, advanced up the backstretch four to five deep, bumped with an outside
rival lightly leaving the backstretch, took aim on the leader at the top of the stretch, ground on then surged late to just get up. EL COHETE moved forward
two wide to take the lead early on the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, was clear into upper stretch, all out to the wire and just failed to last.
ENJOYTHESILENT angled in soon after the start, saved ground through the first turn in the back half of the field, angled out and moved two then three wide
while under urging from the three-eighths, came into upper stretch four to five deep, lugged in at the furlong marker, was gaining steadily but too late.
RAPID TEST was well-placed stalking three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. SIR SAMUEL broke a bit awkwardly, switched out and raced wide
outside foes on the first turn then advanced five to six deep heading up the backstretch, was bumped lightly near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back and
faded. SMART SKY stalked three wide, dropped back and faded. GIANT ONE was just a bit restless in the gate but broke on top with the early lead, was
overtaken into the first turn and tracked from inside, steadily dropped back, moved out leaving the far turn, came up empty. GIVE ME MY MONEY was not a
factor racing inside at the back.

Footnotes
QUIET SPEED was unhurried trailing the field down the back straight and throughout the turn, angled six wide driving to the wire, was full of run, split rivals
at the hundred yard marker and was up in time for the eye catching late finish. RIVER OF BABYLON travelled in the middle of the pack four deep at the half,
rallied four wide circling rivals midpoint on the turn, loomed the threat at the top of the lane, got up for second money but could not withstand the fast charge
by the winner nearing the wire. VIDEO VIDA assumed command down the backstretch, dictated a comfortable pace running on the turn, was asking for the
wire holding onto a diminishing lead on the fence at the furlong marker but was caught late nearing the finish. WIKWEMIKONG GHOST stalked near the
rear in the early stages of the race and passed troubled runners in deep stretch. DON'T STOP DREAMIN tracked three wide down the backside, chased the
pacesetter on the turn, drifted inwards while under left handed urging trying to keep a straight path at the sixteenth pole and tired in deep stretch just losing
the minor share at the wire. TAYBO settled in mid pack on the rail, was roused inside early on in the turn but to not avail and was empty in the stretch drive
to the finish line. MIGHTY PELE chased the leader between horses early on, appeared to get out briefly at the three eighth marker, was taken hold for a few
steps losing positioning midway on the turn, re-rallied up the fence in the stretch, was steadied on the rail at the sixteenth pole and could not recover.
MANAGED FOREST wheeled inwards at the break, dumping the rider and walked off. TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #9 MIGHTLY AGAINST #11 DON'T
STOP SCREAMIN IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
