Footnotes
WISECRAKEN was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside with company to his outside, shook clear near the half-mile pole, was asked midway
through the final turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, fought back gamely to get the lead again nearing the sixteenth-pole and narrowly
prevailed under strong handling. ROCKSTAR RED stumbled at the start but broke with the field, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the
pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole, gained in the two path into upper stretch then made a bid between foes, held a
short lead while battling with multiple opponents into the final furlong, lost the advantage back to the winner before the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire
and just missed while able to get the place. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY rounded the first turn in the three path, settled in the middle of the field, drafted behind
horses in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then shifted four wide, lugged in under a left-handed crop while chasing in upper
stretch, pursued the vanguard while continuing to lug in some and finished willingly for the show. COLLECT FROM IKE went four wide while taken under
restraint on the first turn, was reserved under a snug hold on the outside but with some cover, traveled four wide while let out on the far turn then was
roused near the five-sixteenths, gained to make a three wide bid into upper stretch, battled outside of two foes into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his
inside late and was outfinished then lost the show. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, dropped back near the
half-mile pole, was given his cue in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. STEADY SCHEMING stalked the pace on the
outside in the three path, dropped back late on the far turn and came up empty. INTERCHANGER was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn,
settled towards the back, was roused in the two path on the far turn and was no factor. SHAKIN THE BELLE traveled around the first turn in the two path,
settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

FANCY AZTECA coaxed from the gate, settled four then three wide in pursuit from just off the duel up front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. CANDY CARAMEL lunged
slightly at the break, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, floated out eight wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to be along clear for the place honors, second
best. VAX lunged slightly at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved
position to procure the show honors. GIRL AFRAID broke out at the start bumping TRIBAL QUEEN into BABY SOX, dueled from the two path with BABY
SOX to her outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the
front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened. TRIBAL QUEEN got bumped at the start by GIRL AFRAID and in turn bumped BABY SOX getting pinched
back, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. BABY SOX got bumped
at the start by TRIBAL QUEEN due to pressure from GIRL AFRAID while under hustling, dueled three then two wide with GIRL AFRAID to her inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home in the midst of being shaken off and folded in the stretch. LUNA LOCA coaxed from
the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
SHE SLAYS broke a half-step slow and was a bit slow into stride, angled out early, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, rallied
outside under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead coming to the furlong marker, drifted in while kicking clear outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while placed under a hand-ride in the final sixteenth. SOUFFLE broke out and hit the gate, stalked the pace on the
outside, engaged the leader on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and proved
no match for the winner while just able to get the place. BE BEST was hustled from the gate, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe in
the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, fought with the top two into the final furlong and also
proved no match for the winner then just missed the place. UNHOLY was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path and tired. SHOTGUN PATSY broke a bit slow, was carried out early then steadied briefly while taken back then
angled in, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to threaten. LADY FORTUNA came outward while off a half-step slow then dropped back, took
an awkward stride near the five-eighths pole, fell well behind the rest of the field, navigated the turn in the three path and was no factor.

KING OF COMEDY established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand along the inside, widened away briefly five and a half furlongs from
home before continuing along the inside into the far turn allowing the field to advance once more, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, went
clear under a drive to prevail. WHISTLER'S HONOR settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to be along clear of the rest and second best while never threatening the winner. PROVISION tracked the
pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. OPEN TIL
MIDNIGHT just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive and weakened in the late stages. CLEAR CONSCIENCE settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and swung three wide into upper stretch in behind a trio of foes across the track, attempted to lean out on and nudge SELL SOMETHING at the
three-sixteenths and near the eighth pole and was denied the move both times by that rival keeping his proper lane, then got clear once that foe backed
away and offered no kick. BARREL OF QUESTS saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch and got paused behind foes to near the eighth pole tipping briefly to the two path before getting clearance inside, tucked inside and
took that clear lane and offered no response. NOBLE HUNTSMAN settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing along the inside
at the five-sixteenths and began to tip out at that station, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally while passing a pair of foes in the late
stages. BLAME IT ON DADDY forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, settled three wide just off the top pair, continued three wide through the far
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late going. SELL
SOMETHING settled just off the inside tracking the front from near the rear of the field, tipped out three then four wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, had CLEAR CONSCIENCE lean out at the three-sixteenths to take over his lane and
denied the move, got leaned on once more by that same rival nearing the eighth pole and once again denied the nudge keeping his rightful lane, then
backed away and weakened to the finish.

BERNT AGAIN was reserved off the pace under restraint, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused while shifting four wide coming to the
quarter-pole, rallied outside to make a bid into upper stretch, held a short lead into the final furlong, battled outside of three foes into the final sixteenth and
prevailed under strong urging. FROSTY INVASION was taken under a tight hold early, bobbled slightly near the seven-eighths, was rated just off the pace
under tight restraint, drafted behind the leaders on the far turn, made a bid along the hedge in upper stretch, battled inside under a stiff drive into the final
sixteenth, fought on well to the finish but missed while able to get the place. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT was coaxed to the front then taken under a snug hold
after getting the lead, gave up the advantage under tight restraint at the three-quarter pole then was rated just off the pace, made a bid late on the
backstretch, drew even with the leader while inside on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths with a narrow advantage, was given her cue near the
quarter-pole, battled between horses under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. SISTER NELL pulled under
tight restraint on the outside, dragged her way forward to the lead at the three-quarter pole then showed the way, vied in the two to three path on the turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, battled between foes into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. DIVINE WINE bumped with a
foe at the start, was reserved under restraint, came under urging in the three path on the turn, was put to the crop outside the five-sixteenths, moved out in
upper stretch and failed to rally. SUSIE'S SAVER bumped with a rival at the start, bobbled near the seven-eighths pole, settled at the rear, was roused while
saving ground and bobbling a touch on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ROSEMARY POTATOES stalked the pace on the
outside under a hold, was asked in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and faltered.

LOST IN ROME coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside
into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. ALFIO coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. NO MORE TALK chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
five wide into upper stretch, came in slightly brushing with DURKIN'S CALL straightened away, ran on to secure the show honors. FLAMINGO HAWK
hustled from the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, paused from inside
the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole taking a snug hold on the reins as though lugging in although that didn't appear to be the case, got engaged by the
rider once more nearing the sixteenth marker and offered up a mild bid for the last major share. FIRST DEPUTY coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no
headway while making some ground late. DURKIN'S CALL chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch getting brushed by NO MORE TALK straightened away and tired. RAGTIME BLUES led briefly before conceding the front to LOST IN ROME,
prompted that rival from the outside three then two wide, had the rider peer back to the outside and then inside while taking a protective hold, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
HIGH STICK moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch,
responded well when put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. LIBRETTO (IRE) went five then four wide on the
first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied three wide on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a left-handed crop in
the stretch and was outfinished while just able to get the place. TAWARET was taken under a tight hold early, traveled four then three wide on the first turn,
was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path while between foes on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and finished willingly to
just miss the place while clear for the show. WARDEYA was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced near the back under stout restraint, saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, was roused late on that bend then came five
wide into the stretch, lugged in while chasing outside in the stretch and improved position but lacked the needed kick. WAY TOO EARLY went three then
two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch
and tired. JET CITY WOMAN went three wide under restraint on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled three wide under urging on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GEOMETRIQUE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without cover, was given cover
inside the five-eighths, dropped from the three path to the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SETTLING
STORM stumbled awkwardly at the start, was taken under a tight hold early, hit the rail while tight along the inside going around the first turn, was rated just
off the pace, came under urging on the far turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated. TRES CHIC (ARG) bumped with rivals at the start, stumbled in the
two path on the first turn then was taken up and had the rider lose his left iron for a few strides, dropped to the rear onto the backstretch then fell well
behind, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor.
