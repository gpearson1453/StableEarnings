Footnotes
HOME SCHOOL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the stretch, rallied inside, closed willingly on the rail in the final
sixteenth, ran past the leader and drew clear. SUSTENANCE pulled a bit early on while setting the pace, showed the way, dueled inside on the far turn,
shook free, drew clear in the lane, dug in and then yielded. BOYD'S BAND raced three wide early, stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the far turn,
dug in and then finished evenly. REBEL JOKE was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. PRINCIPE raced two
wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally.
