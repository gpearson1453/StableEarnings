IMA DAREDEVIL stalked the leaders from the back of a compact field while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn,
and closed determinedly three out from the rail to get up in the final strides to prevail. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER away well and vied for the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of JERSEY LILLIE in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held a narrow
advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. THE KAT'S BACK stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly
from along the inside entering the final turn while awaiting room, shifted three wide for the drive, and was gaining late to garner a share. JERSEY LILLIE
broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, continued to press the pacesetter one out from the rail entering
the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while being outfinished in the late stages. ANIMA away alertly and pressed the pace three wide entering the
backstretch, chased the leaders two out from the rail in the run to the final turn, but began to weaken entering the turn, and had little to offer late.

B C CHRISTIE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of C C SUNRISE in the run
down the backstretch, took control entering the lane, and was all out to fend off a late surge by CHI CHI'S SONG to prevail. CHI CHI'S SONG was devoid of
early speed and trailed the filed into the backstretch, launched her bid three out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the
drive to just miss. PETERSON LANDING tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, was unable to match strides with the winner entering the lane, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to grab a share. C C SUNRISE broke sharply
and dueled for the lead from the outside of B C CHRISTIE entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, continued to battle
with her pace rival into the turn, but began to fade midway through the turn, and had little to offer late.

PISCO away well and chased the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, and found his best stride in deep stretch while racing two out from
the rail to prove best. DONNA WYN away alertly while bobbling soon after the start, but sprinted to a clear lead in the run to the turn, maintained her
advantage into the lane, bounced off the rail at the sixteenth pole and was quickly overhauled by PIsco, but regained her momentum in time to hold the
place. AUGUST RAIN chased the leader into the turn while saving ground at the rail, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive to garner a share in
a solid debut. HORATIO broke sharply and chased the leaders into the turn while racing one out from the rail, lacked the early speed to contend early, but
finished with some late interest four wide in the drive. ONEMOMENTPLEASE ducked in at the start, but recovered to chase the leaders into the turn from
along the rail, and finished three wide in the drive. LIZZIE'S RAYNE was off awkwardly and raced a bit erratically in the opening strides, chased the pace
three wide into the turn, but failed to make a late impact.

Footnotes
LEGACY SQUARE broke sharply and tracked the leaders from just off the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained a tracking trip one out from the
rail entering the backside, forced the issue two wide from between rivals in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn,
held a narrow advantage into the lane, and held off a late bid by ACCIDENTAL HERO to prevail. ACCIDENTAL HERO tracked the leaders through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, raced in a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly three wide in deep stretch while gaining late to prove clearly second best. LUCKY FORCE away alertly and dueled for the
lead two wide entering the stretch the first time, held a narrow advantage in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, battled from the
outside of LEGACY SQUARE entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival leaving the turn, and gave way grudgingly late while proving
clearly best of the rest. TAPITS CHOICE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, eased into a tracking trip from
along the rail entering the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more late as no match for the top three. TIME TICKER
pressed the pace three wide through the stretch the first time, was unable to keep tabs on the leaders in the run down the backside, and lacked a closing
response when called upon. ARISTOCRACY stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, trailed the field in the
run down the backstretch, and failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

into the final turn, opened a clear lead through the turn and was never seriously threatened late while being ridden out in the stretch drive. KEY TO
SUCCESS away well and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. FORCE TO REKN WITH broke sharply
and settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. MATSQUI settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the
stretch the first time, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND tracked
the leader from along the inside in the run through the stretch the first time, forced the issue from the outside of AIR FORCE in the run down the

PURSUE settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn,
shifted four wide leaving the turn, assumed command in mid stretch and quickly puled clear as much the best. TIZ VICIOUS broke sharply and tracked the
dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, assumed command soon after
entering the lane, but was no match when tackled by PURSUE in mid stretch while proving clearly second best. I'M CORFU away well and dueled for the
lead from the outside of FINDING WAYS entering the backstretch, continued a pace battle from between rivals through the final turn, was overtaken
entering the lane, and finished two wide in the drive to hold the place. FINDING WAYS away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of I'M CORFU in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane,
and was outfinished in the drive. JOCK TALK unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the early stages, dropped down to the rail approaching the first
turn, and briefly lost his action, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed with late interest from along the rail in deep stretch.
ASKMENOQUESTIONS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but faded in the late going.
