IRAZU raced back early on, began a rally along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid three wide in the stretch and cleared the field in
the final stages. THUNDER BUGGY set the pace early with a long lead, was in the three path into the lane, clung to the lead near the eighth pole but
yielded late and held place. MARYNMIKE chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid down the lane from the rail but missed place in
the late stages. ANGELIC STORM was back early on, raced in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. LA
BRODY was unhurried early on, briefly steadied along the backstretch from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and moved up. SUWANNEE
CHICK chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. DRILL'S VALENTINE was never a factor.
UNCAPTURED PRINCES was pulled up and vanned off. PER RULING FROM HIWU, IRAZU WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A
