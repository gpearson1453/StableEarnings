Footnotes
SWANAGE led the way while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming
around the far turn and dug in gamely in the lane to just hold the win. ROLLIN BLACKOUT bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, saved
ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground late too narrowly miss. DREAMING BIZ raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. FAST TO FORTUNE raced in the two path
around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong.
MERLIN'S SISTER bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, saved ground through the opening quarter, raced off the pace coming up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and never threatened. A THOUSAND DREAMS bumped with the horses to both sides at the start,
saved ground early, stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and tired in the lane.
NAUGHTY NELLIE trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DOCTOR OSCAR was sent to an early lead racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best. HOLDEN
THE LUTE raced off the pace on the inside early, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and kept on in the lane while proving to be no
match for the winner. MINISTER OF SOUL chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and finished
evenly. DEFLATER trailed the field through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick. CENTRAL PARK tracked the leader
on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. CITRUS BAY raced off the pace on the outside through
the opening stages, continued around the turn in the two path and was empty in the lane.
