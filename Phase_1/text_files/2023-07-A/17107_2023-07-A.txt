Footnotes
TWO JET broke alertly, allowed the speed to go early, asked along turn, came three wide for the drive, kicked down the dueling leaders late to win going
away. FLOWERS APRIORITY broke forwardly but inward to bother a couple of inner rivals, closest to the leader just off the inside, joined that one late in the
turn from the outside, dueled through upper and midstretch, proved determined for the second position late while unable to contain the winner. CANT
ATTACK ARCH took control after breaking in good order, clear into the turn inside, continued to set the pace into the stretch by a narrow margin, dueled
past the furlong marker, also proved no match for the winner late, outkicked for the place. ROARING QUINN void of speed, split foes when beginning a mild
advance late turn, continued to improve position through the stretch. SHE'S MY LOUIE V. bothered just after the break, went evenly in lacking a closing
response. CALIFORNIA BELLE also bothered just after the start, one paced as well in lacking a closing kick. MY LADY LUNA in mid pack early, cut the
corner into the lane, failed to muster a rally. CHERRY STAR last away, void of speed, four wide into the stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
BLACK ACE broke well despite being brushed, pressed early off the inside, dueled into and through the turn in the two path, drew out steadily through the
lane while only shown the crop to win in handy fashion. LAST PENALTY fell back to trail after the start, asked along off the inside midway on the turn, four
wide upper stretch when roused, closed well to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. HIGHER NOTE broke out to brush the winner, was
straightened to race in mid pack while unhurried, saved ground into the stretch, moved up to be closest to the winner inside the furlong grounds, caught late
for the runner up position. GYPSY JACKPOT went one paced behind the pace off the inside, bid for place, not enough late. PINTORA broke on top, set the
early pace inside, dueled with the winner inside that one through the turn, gave way in the drive. MEAN DREAMER was finished early, well back. HALO'S
SONG off step slow, always outrun.

Footnotes
HONORARY GUEST a bit reluctant to load, bobbled just at the break, void of speed, began to advance far turn, angled four wide into the lane, challenged
on the outside past the furlong marker, proved best in a determined effort. SWEET CHABLIS tracked the leader off the inside, advanced on that one and
took over midway on the final turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker as the winner was challenging, drifted out in front of an idling
ABSOLUTELY then proved stubborn to the finish. ABSOLUTELY within striking distance off the inside, continued to track the pace through the second turn,
came in the two path for the drive, was idling between the top two just inside the furlong grounds when steadied, went evenly to the wire after recovering to
comfortably save the show. LAST OF THE NILE back off the pace, continued to lack speed the middle half, angled out to be five wide into the stretch,
displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position, not a threat to the top three. MAGNA COLORS off a step slow, trailed for over a half,fanned
six wide into the stretch, also bettered her position without posing a serious threat. CARPE HORSESHOE mid pack, fell back in some traffic to trail late in
the final turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LAYLA'S SONG four wide when forwardly placed through the first turn,
tired from those early efforts. DIANNA'S JET broke on top, clear into the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, stopped when headed by
the runner up in the second turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
ABSOLUTELY AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
MANGUM set a soft but pressured pace along the inside, picked the tempo into the far turn, dueled into the lane, headed briefly past the furlong marker,
battled back to retake the advantage then held that same rival safe in the final strides to narrowly prevail. FREE LIKE A GIRL pressed the soft fractions
outside the winner, engaged that one in the far turn, dueled into the stretch, put a head in front past the furlong, fell back a bit the next sixteenth then was
coming again in the final strides to miss. BEHEMAH STAR in the second flight while racing off the inside, raced three wide into the stretch, proved no match
for the top two, held sway late to hold the show. BAYOU JAM lacked speed outside, raced four wide through the final turn, dueled for the show late,
outfinished. HEZA PICKLE last to leave, trailed most of the way, between foes stretch, not enough for the show spot. DOUBLE ON THE RED forwardly
placed along the inside closest to the top two, began to give way second turn, continued to fade down the lane.

Footnotes
CHICKEN TRUCK void of speed, four wide advance into the lane, challenged on the outside, edged clear late under steady handling. BELLO CREEDO
broke well, cleared to the inside to set the pace, firmly rated early backstretch, spurted away when challenged late backstretch, responded once again when
challenged turning for home, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, remained well clear of the others. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT fractious in the gate prior to the
start, in mid pack early, advanced and lodged a bid between horses with less than four furlongs remaining, fell back off the runner up, tried that one again
into the stretch, could not match the top two the final furlong, best of rest. HEY JACKSON in the second flight while racing off the inside, went evenly
through the stretch in lacking a significant closing response. BIG BROTHER last away, devoid of any early foot, was four wide out of the final turn, improved
position while also not a serious threat. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE back off the pace, moved closer while four wide the middle half, had little left for the drive.
ZIPPY TOGA in the main group early off the inside, lodged a middle move three wide to contend into the lane, faltered when the real running began at the
head of the stretch. C. F. CONGRESS chased the runner for a half, moved up inside to lodge a bid with just under a half to run, gave way while continuing
inside soon after. THIRSTY WIND forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE back off the early pace outside, made a steady advance to challenge on the outside late in the turn, floated out five wide into the
stretch, wore down that rival to be clear at the end. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS closest to the early leader off the inside, got out when showing the way late
turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, could not match strides to the wire, clearly second best. ADIEU LE CHAT off the pace and the inside, between
foes through the turn, two path for the drive, could do little with the top pair through the lane, clear of the others. NATE'S REVENGE lacked speed outside,
four wide through the turn, moved a bit closer in upper stretch then flattened out to finish up evenly. TRAELEE went one paced throughout while saving
ground. FLIT N FLOT TIME lacked speed off the rail, improved slightly while never dangerous. COURAGEOUS TIMMY broke back and failed to menace.
MAD GOLD prompted the issue for a half along the inside and gave way. LIAM SKYE last to leave, was always outrun. C'MON VE broke on top, quickly
cleared to the inside, set the pace four over a half then stopped when headed late in the turn by the top two.

Footnotes
GRACIE DIAMOND close from the start after an alert break, pursued the leader into the turn, took over exiting the bend, drew well clear under steady
handling. NODAH in mid pack early toward the inside, roused in the two path late in the bend, saved ground into the lane, switched out with less than a
furlong remaining, finished willingly from between horses to annex the place, not a threat to the winner. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE broke through his gate
prior to the start, last to leave, continued to lag well back for a half, came widest for the drive, staged a belated rally down the middle of the strip and was
going well at the end to be in time for the show. LASSIE MY GIRL within striking distance for three furlongs, lacked a closing punch through the lane.
MYSTIC CREED unruly in the post parade, vied early while three wide, shook briefly clear into the turn, dropped inside, gave way when headed by the
winner nearing midstretch. CRYSTAL D'ORO was never a threat. LUMINOUS FLIGHT flashed brief speed along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
EL DINERO ducked in at the start to be tardy away, moved up to mid pack inside, tipped out three wide nearing mid turn, came five wide into the stretch,
challenged soon after while widest of the first fight, drew clear under steady handling. DEAL WITH IT DADDY with the early pace between horses, fell back
just before four furlongs remained, asked along midway on the turn, improved inside to foes to become prominent into the stretch, bid, could not match
strides with the winner late, held the second spot. GOOD AND STOUT broke back, lacked speed while moving out, five to six wide turning into the stretch,
widest through the lane, finished up willingly to be getting to the runner up. SONOFASHIP broke sharp, showed the way from the three path up the
backstretch, garnered a larger advantage through the turn, appeared relaxed when still showing the way into the stretch then relented when confronted soon
after. CAJUN CYCLONE forwardly placed early while widest, four wide through the turn while still within striking distance, had little left for the stretch run.
SOUNDS LIKE POWER vied up front along the inside early, began a steady retreat after a quarter. CUNIMBUS pressed the issue early four wide, chased
the leader through the turn, gave way in the drive. BOBBY BOY broke back, lacked speed, moved well out, six wide into the lane, ducked to the rail nearing
the furlong grounds, was righted and finished up evenly. HYMN FOR CARLOS in the second flight while off the inside, weakened after three furlongs.
GUS'S DREAM WORLD was finished early. POUND OUT A DEAL bothered, off slowly, was never close.

AGGIE DOCTOR in the second flight four wide and outside up the backstretch, unhurried in idling along through the turn while remaining in the four path,
asked into the lane, accelerated upper stretch, took over inside the furlong marker and continued with good energy to the wire to win going away. MARINA
broke alertly, cleared early, set the pace, offered little resistance to the winner the final sixteenth, remained clear for the place. APRIORITY GIRL back off
the pace well wide, came five wide and outside the winner into the lane when moving closer, flattened out a bit late but managed to be along for the show.
SABERFIGHT lacked early foot, shifted out a bit wider, improved position, gaining for the show late. CRYPTO BRAVE chased the runner up for a half off the
inside, faltered through the stretch. SPLITTING ACES lacked speed off the rail, angled out exiting the turn, picked off some tiring rivals outside. JUST
ANOTHER WIN remained back in lacking a rally. SHO NUFF within striking distance early inside, steadily faded. TALENTS HOT DEAL forwardly placed for
three furlongs, backed up through the stretch. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE last away, trailed throughout in showing little.
