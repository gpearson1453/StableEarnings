Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL MESS contested the early pace inside, came together with PERPETUATE in the backstretch, inherited the lead nearing the quarter pole,
responded to the challenge lodged by ROSE ROSE ROSE, and edged away under mild handling. ROSE ROSE ROSE assumed a tracked position early,
shifted out to the three path in the final turn then moved up alongside BEAUTIFUL MESS, dueled into the stretch and was unable to get by late settling for
place. KEEPMEINPOWER steadied entering the backstretch, gained closer order in the far turn, and lacked a closing response. CHABI steadied leaving the
chute, shifted outside, and was outrun. PERPETUATE was reluctant to load, drifted out leaving the chute, came together with BEAUTIFUL MESS in the
backstretch, and was done early.

through the stretch. SINGING BELL broke into GOLDEN FORTYNINE leaving, tracked three to four wide leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid near the
quarter pole, and faded in the stretch. WOMANONTHEWARPATH vied inside then was brushed while in close quarters from along the rail, pressed the
pace through the far turn, and gave way in the stretch. GOLDEN FORTYNINE bumped leaving the gate, raced in close quarters between foes early, and

WITHIN REASON broke outward brushing VIVIEN'S CHARM then took command under a snug grip, saved ground while showing the way through the final
turn, was kept under steady handling through the stretch, and held on. AMBER PRINCESS rated well off the pace, uncoiled a rail bid entering the lane, was
gaining ground on rival late stretch. VIVIEN'S CHARM jostled away, stalked the pace from the three path, chased the leader into the stretch, and finished
evenly. PONY GIRL jostled leaving the gate, placed a mild bid at the head of the lane was unable to improve the position. BEAUTIFUL BABE was in tight
from along the rail early, and lacked a serious bid. SANDY BEACH chased four wide early, and tired.

SKIP'S ROCK led the way into the backstretch, was given her cue in the final turn, responded to a looming threat from GOLDIE SOCKS, and kicked clear.
GOLDIE SOCKS hustled away then assumed a tracking position inside, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole but was no match for the winner in the
stretch. MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA raced wide in the final turn, and showed little. LADY KALIPA raced in closest pursuit while four wide, and tired early.
VIOLET CITY saved to no avail. HERMANITA ALEX clipped heels leaving the gate then was distanced, and walked off on her own accord. STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving HERMANITA ALEX but made no change.

NEXT JOURNEY stalked from the rail, angled out to the four path at the head of the lane then came under urging, and won driving. EL NOBLE contended
the early pace from the two path, dueled through the final turn inside of RYANWATER, and was rundown midstretch. BARE BACK JACK settled outside,
fanned three wide through the far turn, bid outside at the head of the lane, and flattened out. UPO lagged early, closed late, and missed after a determined
effort. RYANWATER moved up quickly entering the backstretch to contest the early pace, match strides into the far turn outside of EL NOBLE, was unable
to move on in the final furlong, and wilted. MR. KALYPSO showed some early speed from between foes, and faded. CHROME KING hopped leaving and
never reached contention.

BE NAUGHTY WITH ME vied outside early, fanned four wide through the far turn, gained an advantage approaching the quarter pole, and drove clear
under a brisk hand ride. QUEEN RHONDA bumped leaving, tracked four-wide leaving the backstretch, roused at the three-sixteenth pole, rallied between to
score the place finish. DRAMATIC FLAIR settled off the early pacesetters, dropped back in the far turn, angled in sharply to the three path then drove
between lodging a late bid and got by for show. JELLI trailed early, circled into the lane, and improved position late with a mild bid. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN
broke inward then hurried inside, roused inside, and weakened late. SOCIAL CUES broke outward into LILLY'S OF LONDON, pressed the pace in the three
path, and faltered in the stretch. LILLY'S OF LONDON squeezed leaving, then attended the pace from between foes, and yielded deep stretch.
