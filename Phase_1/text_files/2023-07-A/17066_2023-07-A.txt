Footnotes
MUSTANGMAGNA rushed from outset to establish the inside position, was on even terms with a trio of rivals at the midway point, saved ground arond the
turn, and shook clear of all rivals in the homestretch. CAROLS KITTEN contested the early pace from a three wide stance, maintained that three wide pose
through the turn, and responded wel to urging to get up for place in final stride. FLASHY GAIL broke alertly, rated close up along the backstretch, took a two
path journey around the bend, was the lone rival in second flight at the head of the stretch, then was nipped in final stride for the place honors. GODDESS
OF WONDER lacked a needed rally after pressing the early pace and trekking four wide around the turn. EUROBOUTTOGETIT rated close up along the
backstretch but lost ground to rivals by travelling widest of all.

Footnotes
INCA EMPIRE showed reserve in early going, swung to three wide long the backstretch and nearing the quarter pole, gained command in the closing bend,
and drew clear in final sixteenth for a clear score. NEEDABETTERJOCK hustled from the break and established an inside pose, set the pace in tandem as
the inside rival, was headed inside the half pole, and couldnt fend off the late charge of eventual winner in the closing strides. LIARS CLUB broke alertly and
pressed the pace two wide through the opening half, angled out to three wide at upper stretch, then came up empty in final sixteenth. JACKS SPRING
BREAK settled in behind the pacesetting duo while saving ground, was roused inside the half pole, but lacked a needed rally in crucial stages. DEL MOON
was unhurried and failed to threaten while trekking the two path.

LADY ENVOY hustled to share early command from between rivals, trekked three wide early, tucked to inside at upper stretch, and finished under a stiff
drive to procure the victory. BROWN LIAISON established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, rated close up around the opening turn, lost ground
tor rivals nearing the quarter pole, then surged in closing strides to earn the place. BILLIE BABY forced the early pace from a three wide stance, gained a
slight advantage and led the field near the midway point, was within striking distance at upper stretch, then was nailed in final stride for the place. RAINBOW
SMILES broke in concert with rivals and set the early pace in tandem as the widest of four abreast, rated close up at the quarter pole and three wide at
upper stretch before weakening in final sixteenth. ZATANNA Z trailed form outset and failed to threaten while doing so.

STRONG WOMAN trekked the two path early, reeled in the pacesetter along the backstretch, engaged in a stretch duel with a rallying foe, and bested that
rival for the score. DIXIELAND CANDY showed patience and tucked behind early front runners, swung to three wide nearing the quarter pole while under
urging, locked into a duel at head of stretch, and was denied in duel. ACERTIVE MISS came up empty after saving ground early and swinging wide at upper
stretch to advance. COZZOLANI trailed the field from outset and passed tiring foe in closing strides. SHE'S A PLAYER flashed early foot, set the pace
through the opening half, then rapidly eclipsed.

sixteenth pole, but couldnt fend off the rallying rival in closing strides. G'S STORM was unhurried in the early half and trailed the field into the backstretch
before improving placing with late interest. WELDON G rushed form outset to gin first command, led the field along the backstretch, rated on even terms at
upper stretch and faded in closing sixteenth. RECKLESSNESS failed to threaten while on a three path journey. MUCHO BLING tucked to the inside to save
ground shortly after the start and failed to menace.

CON SUERTE was unhurried in early stages, swung to three wide along the backstretch and through the closing bend, then wore down the leader in final
sixteenth for the score. WICKED STREET rushed from outset and established a comfortable margin on the field, led all rivals into the homestretch, but was
unable to sustain the lead in the final sixteenth. CALI settled in behind the speedy pacesetter, trekked the two path throughout, but was no match for top pair
in final furlong. GOSPEL CARLOTTA showed reserve early by trailing the field throught he opening half before angling to three wide at upper stretch and
passing a tiring rival. SHUTUP PLEASE established an inside stance shortly after the start, gave chase to front runner from the second flight along the
backstretch, then tired in late going.

MEGA BOND pressed the early pace from between rivals, tucked to save ground nearing the quarter pole, gained command at head of stretch, and was
inching away at the end. OUR CORNERSTONE settled into mid pack shortly after the start, saved ground around the first bend, advanced on the leaders
inside the quarter pole, was in tight and bumped at upper stretch, and kept on to procure the place. OGA BEAR rushed from outset and led the field while
saving ground, had a slight advantage and was bumped at upper stretch and kept on for the show. WHIP pressed the early pace as the outer most rival of
four abreast through the opening half and finished evenly. CATALE STORM trailed the field early before improving placing with late interest.
LASTCALLFORALCOHOL lacked a needed rally after showing reserve and rating back. HUNTER'S LEGACY lost ground to front runners with a wide trip.
SHIPMAN'S SONG steadily faded after rating close up and three wide around the first turn.
