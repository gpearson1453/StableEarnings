evenly. JAGNESTIMBER broke outward and weakened in the later stages. ULNVME TO away alertly and yielded inside mid stretch. FAVORITE NICKERS
broke inward and lacked a serious bid. OBSESSED WAY retreated between foes. ROYALE RUNAWAY broke poorly leaving the gate and was unable to

Footnotes
MARANGO quickly went to the front then angled in to secure a rail position, lead the way into the lane then turned back challenge from
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR and held safely. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR tracked four wide, launched a bid nearing the three sixteenth pole but was no
match for the winner. BLACK WOLF stalked inside and failed to threaten. BALDY RED rider's stirrup broke away from the gate and was not a factor.
DUNBOW sat in range and was done early.

ROSE sat in striking position inside, shifted out to the three path leaving the backstretch, gained gradually outside and missed. WHISKARITA raced in the
two path from the second flight, swung five wide into the lane, closed determinedly late stretch and missed out. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY raced four to five
wide through the backstretch, fanned wide at the head of the lane and faded in stretch. DAZZLING CHIC chased the pacesetters and came up empty in

EMERALD CANYON vied four wide leaving the chute, drew clear then saved ground through the turn, was kept under steady handling through the stretch
and held. SASK LADY saved ground on rail, swung four to five wide at the head of the lane and gained steadily late. PHINALYWYN reserved off the early
pacesetters, took closer order approaching the quarter pole and flattened in stretch. I TRICKED MY RIDE stumbled at the start, chased outside and passed
tiring rival. CIGARILLO vied inside into the backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, chased and tired. SALTY O'DAY tracked the
pacesetters from the four path, was done early then was eased and walked off.

STORMY ROSE set the pace in the two path, remained unchallenged into the stretch then drew clear, stumbled just before the wire and was vanned off.
SMILE MARY stalked three wide, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole but was no match for winner. SANDY BEACH was under a strong hold inside
and was unable to improve position through the drive. JAMAICAN ME MAD was gapped early, gained closer order into the lane and bid belatedly. NOT
YOUR BIZINESS settled four wide and flattened. OMEGA GAL raced at the back of the pack and faded inside. I'MAMUDDERTOO chased two wide then
was in tight into the far turn and was done early.

CHA CHING trailed the field, took closer order in the final turn, drove three wide then gained outside and nipped the leader. SANGRIA dueled for the early
lead, pressed PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE from rail through the backstretch, inherited the lead at the quarte pole, was kept under vigorous handling through
the stretch and was nipped before the wire. SMART FIX saved ground early, lodged a rail bid late stretch and got by late for show. FLORAL unhurried early,
asked to quicken into the final turn, rallied two wide into the stretch and was bested late. FLORIST passed tiring. INTERESTING TIMES chased the
pacesetters from the four path and lacked a kick. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE vied hard for the early lead, took pressure through the backstretch outside of
SANGRIA, was unable to move on with rival nearing the quarter pole and faded steadily. SHE LIKES TO PARTY sat in range and failed to respond when
called upon.

Footnotes
EL DORADO STORM chased from the four path, fanned three wide through the turn then held clear under a drive. STAPLETON settled inside early, drove
four wide into the lane and improved late. MY LUCKY MARK tracked the early pacesetters, bid outside under encouragement and got by late for show.
THIS TIME LUCKY vied outside, contested the pace from between foes, left little in reserve for the drive and was bested late for show. YORKTOWN sent
for speed inside, pressed through the turn, was unable to move on with rivals and gave way. REGAL CANDY was outrun. DITES MOI hopped leaving and
trailed throughout.
