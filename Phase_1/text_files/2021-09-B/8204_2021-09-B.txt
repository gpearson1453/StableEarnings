CALIFORNIA KITTY just off pace to the half, took over to quarter pole, re-rallied for the win. SWEET TOOTSIE LU never far back to far turn, short lead into
stretch, outkicked. MY HEAD HURTS gained a short lead out of first turn, shuffled back inside, came with a wide belated run in the stretch for the show spot.
REINA DEL BALI close up early, between horses, lost ground from the far turn and faded. LEX K pressed pace to the half, steadily weakened thereafter.
GREEDY ALGORITHM never a factor.

Footnotes
RIVERS OF LITE broke slow from the gate, settled in hand, made a sweeping move through the turn, came to level terms near the furlong marker and
kicked away under stout hand urging. COME SEE ABOUT IT stalked the pace, made his bid between horses, fought on but was unable to match strides
with the winner late. FORBETTERORWORSE opened clear, set the pace off of the inside, angled to the rail into the turn, disputed the issue to inside the
furlong marker and gave in. BUBBA CABALLO came away a step slow, was unhurried, came four wide and finished with a belated improvement.
BOURBON NATIVE was hustled along on the inside, shifted out a bit into the stretch, but lacked a response when called upon. MAJESTIC HERO broke
slow, failed to respond. ROLL CALL was never a factor. FINAL DELIVERY was close up along the inside through the turn and dropped out. CANDY
MOVER broke slow and never recovered.
