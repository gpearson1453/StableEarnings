Footnotes
LADY LYNNE moved easily on the turn, swung wide to secure room and quickly pulled away under mild urging. FRED'S SHEILA saved ground throughout,
bid into the stretch but was no match to the winner. CATIRUSIA closed gap near the inside, angled out in midstretch and was just up for the place.
MASHUGANA broke poorly, raced far behind then offered some late energy. COURAGEOUS GRACE broke a step slowly, saved ground and failed to
menace. PROMISE OF JOY ducked out at the start, raced very wide and faltered. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL flashed speed along the inside then gave way
readily. SHE'S CLASSY prompted the pace three then two wide and stopped in the stretch. KIRBY vied between rivals early, led into the far turn then gave
way on the turn.

Footnotes
A PENN LEGACY dueled outside, led narrowly into the lane and edged clear while kept to his business. BASTIEN LE BROWN stalked the pacesetters
three wide, faded briefly into the stretch then closed well outside. QUAD EIGHTS lacked speed, advanced inside to the stretch and finished willingly.
SAAFEN rushed up along the inside, dueled to midstretch and weakened. KIANG saved ground well behind and failed to menace. RUNNER stumbled at
the start, raced far back then passed faders. MY FREEDOM raced very wide throughout and was never a factor. MISTER MISTER dropped back early and
began stopping on the turn.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE ROSY sprinted away to a long lead, was collared into the stretch but fought back holding off pair of rivals in a tight finish. NEVISIAN SPIRIT
went after the pacesetter on the turn, loomed a serious threat but was outfinished. GHOSTLY BEAUTY settled off the pace, rallied strongly on the turn,
reached even terms but could not get by. NO SNIVELING dropped back inside then closed the gap without menacing. JUMPSTARTMYHEART trailed in
early stages then offered some late energy. SUNDRENCHED chased near midpack and lacked a rally. GLOVANNA lagged far behind between rivals and
was never a factor. PRIDE LEADER dropped back early and failed to menace. BIRD TYCOON gave way readily. ALIN AZUL pursued the loose leader,
stopped abruptly and was eased.

CANOOCHEE stalked the leaders three wide, vied through the final turn, put away inside rival and held outside opponent safe. SPECIAL RISK saved
ground within range, bid on the final turn, angled out and gained late. MORTAL STORM hustled to the front inside, dueled to midstretch and weakened.
AWESOME ALANA settled inside, faded on the final turn then came again mildly. FAIRY WISH broke sluggishly, chased wide and was never a threat.
SQUARE PEG prompted the pace outside then gave way after half a mile. TINK lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

ENTERTAINMENT quickly took control, raced clear all the way and remained safe under a moderate drive. JACK THE UMPIRE settled inside, bid into the
stretch but proved no match for the winner. SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN trailed early, split rivals then angled out advancing in the stretch. SOULMATE was
fanned very wide into the first turn, remained wide and was no threat. SANDY LANE KITTEN prompted the winner outside then flattened out through the
stretch. SUPER DUDE pressed the pace in the two path to the stretch and came up empty. TAXABLE GOODS lacked speed, moved very wide on the final
turn and was no factor. TRIFOR GOLD chased between rivals early and was never in contention. MT SURIBACHI raced wide through the opening half a
mile and faltered.
