Footnotes
EMOJI GUY settled off the pace two wide, advanced between foes down the backstretch, made a quick three move to the front midway around the turn,
quickly cleared, angled into the two path soon after and held clear under a drive. FARM BOY dueled inside of BRETT'S WORLD around the first turn, tipped
two wide when that foe cleared down the backstretch, regained command entering the turn, angled in soon after, could not match strides inside of the
winner around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and stayed on to be clearly second best. BRETT'S WORLD vied two wide around the first turn, cleared
early on the backstretch, was unable to match strides with the top two around the far turn but churned on inside to save the show. BIG CITY RED failed to
menace while racing two wide. FINDING MISCHIEF played no factor while racing two wide. STAR DEPUTY was outrun while racing three wide. JUST LIKE
MIKE stalked the pace three wide in the clear and retreated after six furlongs. HOLY MEISTER was rank at the start, chased the pace inside, stopped and
was eased.

Footnotes
ANNA'S DREAM bumped lightly with RAW HONEY after the start, vied early outside CHESS NOT CHECKERS and ROUGH ENOUGH, cleared to the lead
and moved inward entering the turn, and maintained the advantage through the stretch all out. CHESS NOT CHECKERS vied early inside rivals, came
under a ride to stay on the chase between horses on the turn, could not get to the winner and was clearly second best. ROUGH ENOUGH bumped lightly
with RAW HONEY after the start, raced forwardly to the stretch two then three wide, weakened and remained well clear of the remainder. ICY RAIN was
devoid of speed for three furlongs, angled widest coming off the turn and had a mild response to pass tired rivals. RAW HONEY was bumped lightly
between horses after the start, and tired before reaching the stretch. JUDGE JUDITH showed brief speed, then faded steadily three to four wide.

WOW TAPIT set the pace in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under a drive. DESIGNED TO DAZZLE stalked the winner in
the four path, was unable to gain on that foe but held well clear of the rest. MISS BETH'EL chased the pace from the rail, lacked the needed rally but stayed
on to hold third. NANA FANNY raced off the pace two wide, never threatened and improved position in the lane. PLAYA INCLUSION failed to menace while
racing two wide. WHITEROSE SPIRIT chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. QUEEN'S BEST steadied nearing the turn, was in range
between foes and had no response. IVY WAY was outrun inside. ROMANCE IN HABANA was always far back. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH
FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BION MAGIC pressed the pace outside BIONIC BOTTLE and TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE for a half-mile, wrested command in midstretch and drove clear.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE vied inside BIONIC BATTLE early, got the best of that dispute after a half, and proved no match for the winner leaving the furlong
grounds. BIONIC BOTTLE contested the pace inside TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE to upper stretch, and weakened. CHUTZPAH broke slowly and was far back
for a half, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and passed tired horses. SILVER PACKAGE was ridden along around the turn while in the clear off
the leading trio, and lacked a response. BLESSED BEAST was finished early. MY MASTERPIECE broke slowly, and was always outrun.

SHE NASTY saved ground reserved for a half-mile, moved out getting her cue in upper stretch, bid between CANDYMEISTER and DEL REY DOLLY
leaving the eighth-pole, and edged the latter through a duel to the wire. DEL REY DOLLY advanced three wide approaching the stretch, had aim outside the
leaders turning for home, battled outside SHE NASTY as they overtook CANDYMEISTER in tandem past the furlong marker, and was outdueled to the
finish. CANDYMEISTER set the pace inside, and weakened through the late stages on her left lead. SNEAKY CHEEKY was a step slow at the start, and did
not menace through an even effort. BLUSHING KEYLEN bumped with MOLLIES HOPE twice after the start, pressed the pace outside for a half, and tired.
MOLLIES HOPE bumped with BLUSHING KEYLEN a couple times away from the gate, showed speed to the turn, and was through after three-eighths of a

LIGHT FURY stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the top of the stretch, drew clear in upper stretch and held firm under a steady drive. GO MIKE
settled off the early pace inside, advanced between foes down the backstretch, bumped between and pinched back nearing the far turn, went three wide
around the bend and finished well outside. DUROCHER saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and was along for the show.
CUESTION DE TIEMPO chased the pace two wide, came in and bumped GO MIKE into COLONEL JACKSON nearing the far turn, continued to chase two
wide around that turn and lacked a closing bid. VOW ME NOW set the pace two wide around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, continued
on the left lead in the lane and tired. COLONEL JACKSON led early, chased inside down the backstretch, bumped nearing the far turn and retreated inside.

Footnotes
CHAMPINA hit the right side of the gate and bumped with MARIAHS CHRISTMAS coming out, tracked outside CALIDAD early, came under a ride to keep
pace around the turn, stayed on task through a long drive and gained the upper hand 70 yards out. CALIDAD sprinted clear leaving the chute. rated along
near the inside for six furlongs, drifted out past the eighth-pole and could not hold off the top one. OH NO ITS T B had a ground-saving trip, and finished
one-paced. TRINNI GIRLS raced three to four wide around the turn in range, and lacked the needed bid. ASPROPODIA was no factor two wide. PADDY
KAYE'S WILD bumped with MARIAHS CHRISTMAS at the start, and failed to menace three to four wide. WATER WIZARD saved ground to no avail.
FROST THIS bobbled at the break, showed brief speed outside and tired. MARIAHS CHRISTMAS was bumped between horses at the start, showed speed
to midway up the backstretch, then stopped abruptly.
