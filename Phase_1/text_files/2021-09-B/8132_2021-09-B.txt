Footnotes
EMPEROR'S SONG was bumped between foes soon after the start, steadied near the half-mile pole, advanced inside nearing the turn, angled three wide
near the five-sixteenths marker, came four wide into the lane, continued on the left lead, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MAMA
LONGLEGS set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and held well to preserve the place. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER was bumped soon after
the start, stalked the pace inside, tipped out turning for home, was outkicked by the winner, angled further out leaving the eighth pole and finished evenly to
hold third. SENORITA SALSA saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole, made progress in upper stretch but flattened out. RAIN OF
BLESSING lacked early speed while racing two wide, made progress between foes in upper stretch but was no threat late. FABIOLA PRINCESS failed to
menace while racing two wide. EXAGGERATED MOMENT played no factor while racing three wide. SUNDANCE PEAK saved ground off the pace, moved
up inside in upper stretch then was forced to take up near the eighth pole. TRULY AMBITIOUS pressed the pace two wide, lugged in nearing the eighth pole
and retreated. SHARED MISCHIEF came in and bumped EMPEROR'S SONG into SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER soon after the start, chased the pace three
and four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
AVANT GLORY broke a step slow, then rushed up with a good turn of foot to get the lead, set the pace a bit off the rail, came into the stretch in the two-path
facing challengers from both flanks, and gamely withstood a long drive on his left lead to get the decision. MARKHAMIAN pressed the pace outside AVANT
GLORY throughout, had aim through the stretch and could not get past. MR RUM RUNNER tracked the early pace alone in third, waited inside around the
turn, shifted to the two-path at the top of the stretch, went back inside with a bid along the rail through the furlong grounds, and was edged inside the top
two. POSEIDON'S SON raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not gain late on the far outside. KHOPILOT lacked the needed response when
put to pressure on the turn. HEY HOMBRE was outrun inside. LAST SECOND LOUIE was finished entering the turn. CAJUN BAYOU strode awkwardly
dropping far back through the early going, and jogged in far behind. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

rated off the winner two wide, bid nearing the quarter pole but proved no match in the lane. BAILEY was bumped at the start, tracked the pace three wide
and lacked the needed rally. SEAZAN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. DIMENNA bumped with BAILEY at the start, saved ground and
never threatened. VINNY DREAM had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
LAST LEAF pressed NERVE from outside, came three wide off the turn, reached even terms in midstretch, and gamely prevailed between rivals. NERVE
sprinted clear early, responded when hooked by LAST LEAF after three furlongs, and held on well. BARONE CESCO steadied behind SOUTHERN
BREEZE midway up the backstretch, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, found his best stride late despite remaining on his left lead and finished
fastest outside. SOUTHERN BREEZE was hemmed in behind the leaders entering the turn, moved off the inside near the top of the stretch, moved in and
out through the drive and was one-paced to the finish. PETER D was outsprinted three wide to the stretch, and gained mildly without becoming a factor.
RUN LEA RUN saved ground to no avail. DUKE SKYWALKER broke slowly, and was always outrun. CORPORATE AFFAIR was never close. ASTRAL
RIDE was finished approaching the stretch two wide.

Footnotes
LUPINO (GB) was never far back, went to the far turn alone in third tracking the leaders, slipped through on the rail at the top of the stretch, took over
through the furlong grounds and drove clear under good handling. ROYAL WAR bumped with JOE PHILLIPS at the start, prompted the pace outside the
latter to the far turn, lodged a bid coming to the quarter-pole, was no match for the winner through upper stretch, and ran on to save the place. DOUBLE
BLESSING raced two to three wide in midpack to the stretch, offered a mild response on the far outside and missed the place while clearly best of the
others. BROTHER BRAD lagged well back for a half-mile, and improved mildly without factoring. JOE PHILLIPS bumped with ROYAL WAR at the start, set
an even pace inside to the far turn, and gave way into the stretch. CAPE HEDGE was no factor in and around the two-path. ROUNDABOUTONE was
always far back. PONGO LOUIE broke slowly and was outrun. SWILL MERCHANT had trouble cornering into the first turn five or six wide, and was finished
before reaching the stretch. SPRING CHANNEL retired early.

Footnotes
PRO QUALITY broke a bit awkwardly, raced in in range two wide, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole,
battled outside of SHIVAREE through the final sixteenth and prevailed. SHIVAREE stalked the pace inside, took the lead turning for home, drew clear in
midstretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and gave way grudgingly. NOBLE DRAMA raced off the pace four wide and was along for the show. WELL
DEFINED prompted the pace very wide down the backstretch, moved up three wide around the turn, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led to upper
stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. GARTER AND TIE chased the pace inside and had no response. OLD TIME REVIVAL set the
pace well off the rail and retreated after five furlongs.

Footnotes
JOE BENJAMIN set the pace inside, drifted out while clear in the stretch, and had enough to hang on. MAJORITY RULES saved ground in easy striking
range for six furlongs, shifted out three wide at the top of the stretch, drifted out under heavy pressure past the eighth-pole and could not reach the winner.
NOT SO EASY saved ground advancing after a half-mile, swung five wide rallying off the far turn, and finished willingly while being carried out by
MAJORITY RULES late. SULEMAN spotted the field two or three lengths at the break, lagged far back early, began improving position after six furlongs,
and rallied inside through deep stretch. COLTONSTHEADMIRAL broke slowly despite urging from the gate, raced in the second flight to the stretch, swung
four wide into the lane and went by tired horses. GRRR advanced four wide after six furlongs, then flattened out. BIG TREASURE moved in from the
five-path around the first turn, and made no impact. IN HONOR OF ARTIE tired after a half-mile. POLITICAL RIOT broke slowly and was outrun three wide.
KICKS ON SIXTY SIX faltered after a half. YOUNG FLINT pressed JOE BENJAMIN early from outside, and stopped after six furlongs.

Footnotes
OCTANE bumped FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP at the start, set the pace two wide around that bend, angled in nearing the far turn, drew clear around that turn
and held clear under a drive. CAJUN'S MAGIC stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths marker, had aim outside of the winner but
was unable to significantly gain on that foe. CATTIN bumped FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP at the start, advanced four wide around the first turn and two wide
down the backstretch, could not quite keep pace with the winner while still two wide around the far turn and weakened through the lane. THE SKIPPER
TOO steadied at the start, raced well back two wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. CLAPTON chased the pace two wide and tired after six furlongs.
GOLD SPECIAL played no factor while racing four and five wide. GLOBES broke in a tangle, checked along around the first turn, retreated around the far
turn and was easing through the lane. BIG AND CLASSY had early speed five wide, faltered around the far turn and was easing through the lane. FIVEFIVE
SIX CHAMP was pinched back at the start, raced four to five wide, had no response and was eased in the lane. ONE MORE SCORE steadied along four
wide between foes around the first turn, retreated around the far turn, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off. THIS WAS HAND TIMED WITH
FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MY BEAUTY PRINCESS bumped with TIZOFADEAL at the start, took control early, rated along inside to the stretch and widened under a drive. JAZZY T
moved up steadily outside rivals through the backstretch run, could not kick on with the winner into the lane, and ran on best of the others. SYLLABUS
bumped with THATS ALL SHEWROTE and steadied while in tight between horses on the first turn, steadied along the inside early on the far turn, moved
out three wide approaching the quarter-pole, moved in through the stretch and was up for the show on the rail. THATS ALL SHEWROTE was keyed up
inside and bumped with SYLLABUS on the first turn, settled down through the run up the backstretch in range, moved out two wide at the top of the stretch,
and faded through the late stages. FASTLIFE raced three to four wide throughout, and passed only tired horses. TONALA steadied entering the second turn
near the back, and remained out of contention. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY hit the left side of the gate at the start, checked behind horses entering the far
turn, and remained far back. TIZOFADEAL was bumped between horses at the start, prompted the early pace outside MY BEAUTY PRINCESS, and was
through before completing six furlongs. BLAZINONBAYOU bumped with TIZOFADEAL at the start, raced forwardly early three to four wide, and gave way
into the far turn. JAENT was five wide on the first turn, moved up gradually outside rivals through the middle stages, but was finished approaching the
stretch.
