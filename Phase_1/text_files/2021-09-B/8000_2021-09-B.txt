outside horses. PRINCESS TERUKO stumbled leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, angled out in upper stretch and
failed to rally. NONNA TEE , lightly bumped ty CANDY FABLE leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace two wide around the turn, bid for the lead
approaching the stretch and gave way the final furlong. CANDY FABLE lightly bumped NONNA TEE leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead,
hugged the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch. HELIACAL RISING raced in the two path around the turn and faltered approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
DREAMIN OF SEVILLE settled early, edged up between rivals near the half mile marker, took closer order three wide leaving the three eighths, shifted out
four wide under pressure and had aim into the lane, rallied to command a furlong out then drew out under a drive. SEVILLE ROW broke a step slow,
advanced four wide into the first turn to gain a forward position, worked between runners around the far turn, came three to four wide for the drive and
finished up willingly to gain the place. GLORIOUS WEEKEND was shuffled back soon after the break, quickly gained along the rail near the five eighths,
steadied briefly around the far turn, angled out nearing the lane and rallied between runners. TITRATE , in a bit tight at the break, pulled her way between
foes nearing the three quarter pole and moved up to prompt the pace, took over in hand through the backstretch, shook clear with a half to go, was joined
leaving the three eighths, dueled from the head of the lane to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. GAS MONEY , well placed tracking, bid three
wide outside TITRATE leaving the far turn, pressed the issue into the lane, dueled on near even terms past the three sixteenths then faded in the final
seventy yards. PAT'S FACTOR was checked sharply entering the first turn, regrouped and settled back towards the rail, swung out with some run in mid
stretch but failed to seriously sustain. MONYINTHEBANKSEY cleared early towards the rail, ceded command near the five eighths, stayed on to stalk along
the inside to upper stretch then gave way. CRYING FOR MORE , three wide, pursued to the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
SALAMINA , away alertly, was bumped and shuffled back in the opening sixteenth, regrouped and settled in the clear, moved up off the rail and behind
rivals into the lane, altered out well wide in mid stretch, closed determinedly under pressure and was up between foes. BULLETS LADY was steadied along
the rail near the half mile marker, angled out advancing past the three eighths, came five wide into the lane, rallied under asking and hooked the leader in
mid stretch, went clear inside the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. LOVE DUST , off slowly, lagged back off the rail, raced three wide into the lane,
swung out very wide and finished well to be gaining. SQUARE PENNY prompted from the outside, bid to engage mid turn, dueled into the lane, shook clear
past the three sixteenths, could not resist a challenge leaving the eighth pole and weakened. ZOLA B , bumped and in tight between foes soon after the
break, edged up inside to stalk, waited briefly nearing the lane, was stalled a bit in upper stretch then lacked the needed finish. TRAVEL GIRL stalked the
duel three wide, was under pressure into the lane and faded in the final sixteenth. HEART OF SECRETS , bumped early, moved up between foes, chased
mid turn then faded in the drive. EXPECT THE SUNRISE , three to four wide outside rivals, gave way. SUMMER ODDS lagged well back, came six wide for
the drive and had belated action. EPONINE was shuffled back in the early jam up, saved ground and lacked a bid. DRINKNWHISKEYNRYE , forced in and
bumped soon after the break, was steadied nearing the turn, raced wide and faded. DEW DAT was hard sent and angled in causing a jam up, cleared, was
joined leaving the far turn, sparred into the lane then surrendered.

Footnotes
UNREQUITED LOVE accelerated to the early lead, moved over to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail and was under
urging in the drive. TEQUILA FOG , three deep around the turn, chased the winner in a willing effort. JOYFUL NOISE , four wide on the turn, was well
positioned in upper stretch and weakened. CORN OFF THE COB lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and failed to menace. GOLD AND
STRIKE broke awkwardly, raced along the inner rail and gave way. CAROLINA ICE , a forward factor in the two path between horses down the backstretch,
weakened on the turn.

Footnotes
WHISPURRING KITTEN tracked the leader two wide while under a light hold, responded when set down soon into the lane, moved to command a furlong
out, kicked clear under a drive near the sixteenth marker then dug in late to prove best. MISS MAJORETTE rated off the pace while saving ground, brushed
with MONEY FROMHEAVEN when easing out for room entering the lane, straightened away and closed gamely outside foes. LILACS chased off the rail,
circled three wide into the lane, edged up between runners in mid stretch then flattened out very late. ELLANATION pulled her way clear early on, set the
pace towards the rail, widened a bit past the three eighths, ceded to the winner nearing the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly. TOO MUCH TIP
saved ground and lacked a response. MONEY FROMHEAVEN , off the pace while outside a rival, circled into the lane, brushed with MISS MAJORETTE
soon after and failed to generate a serious run.

Footnotes
WALK AWAY JOE , snugly rated behind horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, gained
command outside horses in mid stretch then drove clear. PUBILIUS SYRUS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on both turns, swung to the five path in
upper stretch for clear sailing and rallied outside rivals. CONTRAFLOW prompted the pace outside BUSTOFF, bid for the lead lead turning for home and
drifted out late when tiring. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep, was fanned four
wide at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. BUSTOFF sprinted to the early lead, angled to the rail on the first turn, set a pressured pace and tired the
final furlong. SILENT MALICE , always near the inner rail, failed to be a factor. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL , three wide both turns, was not a factor. MY GOOD
MAN raced well off the inner rail and weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY , bumped and steadied at the break, regrouped and settled, gathered momentum three wide and within himself mid turn, angled out to be
about seven wide into the lane, rolled up outside rivals and took over in mid stretch, responded to firmer handling, kicked clear and held firm. SHELLY
ISLAND rated off the pace, moved up three to four wide into the lane, advanced between rivals, shifted out leaving mid stretch and finished with good
energy to be clear of the rest. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE rushed up when rank soon after the break break and appeared to clip the heels of STREET
SILENCE, recovered to gain three to four wide past the three eighths, bid to briefly challenge between foes in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly.
DRAGON MOON rated in mid pack off the rail, moved up between foes in the drive then hung late. RISING PERRY , four to five wide, made a decent move
to loom entering the lane then churned on with some interest. SO DIALED IN edged up inside early, checked and was bottled up a long way around the
turn, altered out and came back on late. ROYAL THUNDER rushed up four wide early and stalked, bid mid turn, pressed into the lane then gave way.
BOURBON AND ICE broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, waited nearing the lane then had some late action towards the rail. STREET SILENCE
appeared to have his heels clipped early, tugged three wide and bid between foes, dueled in hand mid turn, was roused clear in upper stretch, shifted in and
weakened. WARM SUNNY BREEZE had speed, dueled inside rivals around the turn, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. ZORB vied inside, steadied
when wanting to get out mid turn, dropped back then checked in mid stretch.

Footnotes
ABUELO PAPS stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the turn, swept to command entering the stretch then drew off under urging.
JACKIE A lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn and rallied outside horses. HEIR PORT bumped with RAD PAISLEY leaving the starting
gate, saved ground around the turn, angled off the rail near the eighth pole and flattened out. DEMO DOCTOR rushed up early, set the pace along the inner
rail and tired after six furlongs. GOING TO THE LEAD , in the two path chasing the pace for a half mile, gave way turning for home. ACE NINE NINE was
never a factor. RAD PAISLEY bumped with HEIR PORT at the start, chased the pace while three wide on the turn and faltered approaching the stretch.
AIN'T DA BEER COLD , a brief early factor between horses, gave way on the turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF CAPS , well placed inside and off of an honest pace, edged up leaving the five sixteenths, angled out into the lane, responded when set down
and went after the leader past mid stretch, kicked clear near the sixteenth pole and held firm while kept alert. GRECIAN PHAROAH , unhurried early while
saving ground, gathered momentum approaching the stretch, swung out soon into the lane, ranged up past the eighth pole and continued gamely to the
wire. DREAMING OF CARATS grabbed command at once, took some early pressure before clearing into the backstretch, widened past the quarter pole
while under asking, could not resist the winner leaving the eighth pole but kept on with some effort to save the show. MR EVERYTHING was sent up early
and entertained the pace outside DREAMING OF CARATS, prompted that one through the backstretch, was called up and threatened near the three
eighths, was turned away but continued willingly chase past mid stretch then hung late. I'VE GOTTA PLAN failed to menace and raced inside through the
drive. PAUPING settled off the rail, made a mild advance three to four wide into the stretch but lacked a further response. MISTER FRANK'S WAY lagged
off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the drive but failed to menace. BUSSTER VON TRAPPE , off the pace and removed from the rail past the
five eighths, lacked a kick.
