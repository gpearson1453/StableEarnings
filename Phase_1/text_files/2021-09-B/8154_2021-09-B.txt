BABY LION stalked the pace three wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole, dueled outside from there to deep stretch and edged ahead late.
AWESOME VIEW set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner, dueled to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. GAGA OH LA LA pressed the
pace two wide between the top two finishers, could not keep pace with those two in the lane but stayed on well enough to hold the show. COZY CAFE
chased the pace inside, angled four wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE trailed in the three path.

SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING stalked outside early, took over from INKOSI at the half-mile marker, drew clear around the turn, and widened through the stretch
under a steady drive. ROD TWO ROD raced two to three wide around the turn, never threatened the winner but was much best of the others. KUHL STAR
stumbled at the start, could not keep up with the leaders approaching the stretch, and tired. DOWN TO BIZZNESS raced two to three wide, and never
factored. EUPHORIA STAR tired after a half. INKOSI led early inside, got headed by the winner approaching the turn, and had nothing left after six furlongs.

Footnotes
YES I'M A BEAST bumped at the start but was still away first, dueled between foes for three furlongs, drew clear near the quarter pole and widened under a
steady drive. ADVENTURE SEEKER disputed the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner approaching the quarter pole and churned on to
regain second. ORIENTAL PARK was bumped at the start, dueled inside for three furlongs and faded. VENEZUELA FIRST had early speed inside, could
not keep up nearing the turn, chased two wide around the bend and lacked a closing bid. ONWARD AUSTIN was bumped at the start and trailed in the
three path.

Footnotes
SWEENEY'S CAT saved ground in easy striking range to the far turn, shifted to the two-path at the top of the stretch, moved back to the rail rallying through
the furlong grounds and prevailed inside rivals in a tight finish. SETTE STELLE was unhurried early inside, angled widest coming off the far turn, rallied
willingly and just missed. HONESTO stalked outside the leaders up the backstretch, lodged a three-wide bid on the far turn, edged away in upper stretch,
then was overhauled from both flanks late. BILLY BONES raced three to four wide on the turns, loomed a threat between horses into the final furlong,
stayed on his left lead and was outfinished. CLAUDE RAY lagged well off the early pace inside, went around the far turn three wide, and could not reach
contention. OVERSTATED vied outside GOT FLOFFY to the far turn, and faded soon after completing six furlongs. GONNA BE EPIC never factored two to
three wide. GOT FLOFFY contested the pace inside OVERSTATED, and tired after six furlongs. QUICK INDY refused to break, and walked off. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
BETWEEN DREAMS crept closer to the leaders inside approaching the turn, came through a large opening rallying into the stretch, switched leads a
sixteenth out and surged on the rail to prevail. LET'S BE HONEST stayed in touch with the early leaders outside, ranged up to challenge VITAEMI past the
three-eighths, got floated out five or six wide by that rival at the top of the stretch, ran on gamely through a long drive and just missed. VITAEMI contested
the pace inside CAT'S N J up the backstretch, drew clear entering the turn, drifted out coming under a ride as LET'S BE HONEST challenged to her outside
approaching the stretch, battled on between rivals past the eighth-pole and was outfinished. CHEZ PAREE saved ground outrun to the stretch, and
improved position without threatening. LADY FIORELLA raced three to four wide in the second flight, and lacked the needed response. CAT'S J N J vied
outside VITAEMI through the second quarter-mile, and gave way entering the turn. GREY JAZMINE was forwardly placed early, and tired after a half-mile.

Footnotes
TORETTO settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, struck the front near the eighth
pole and drove clear. SIGRUN FAST BOY was in range two to three wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, reached even terms in midstretch, was
outkicked by the winner and lasted for the place. CROWN OF HONOR trailed inside early, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled five wide near
the quarter pole, rallied widest and just missed second. PIYPA DE LYNDA was fractious behind the gate, stalked the pace two wide, took the lead leaving
the five-sixteenths, battled to midstretch then weakened. DAISY'S DOC was in range inside and lacked the needed rally. GILDED ASSET set the pace
along the rail, was collared leaving the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LA CHICA LATERAL dueled outside MACKENZIE'S GIRL for a half-mile, gained the upper hand after straightening away for the drive, and drew off through
the final furlong under pressure. MACKENZIE'S GIRL argued the pace inside LA CHICA LATERAL to the stretch, proved no match past the eighth-pole, and
ran on to best the remainder. PLAYERA raced three to four wide around the turn, could not keep up with the top pair in the stretch, but outfinished FRU FRU
ZAN for the show. FRU FRU ZAN lunged at the break spotting the field a couple lengths, moved through between horses midway up the backstretch, stayed
in range to the top of the stretch and had nothing more. VICTORIA'S DANCE was outrun three to four wide. CAUSINGAHULLBALOO raced close up inside
to the turn, and faded before going a half-mile.
