Footnotes
WE NEED A FIVE in the second flight early off the inside, stalked the leaders in the run up the backstretch, began to advance on those two in the three path
turning for home, bid, took over past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up in the final strides. SEEHOSS off a step slow and was
bothered, moved closer in the second turn, shifted out inside the furlong marker, coming late while widest of the first flight at the wire.
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN moved up duel off the inside first turn, continued to alternate in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, briefly clear into
the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late while closest to the inside. ADIEU LE CHAT bothered then steadied in tight at the break, raced back off
the pace, moved closer four wide turning for home, flattened out in the drive. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, void of
early speed, trailed far turn, angled out, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. PERMANENTDETENTION broke out but alertly to bother a
couple of outer rivals, was straightened, dueled closest to the inside for almost six furlongs and then stopped in the drive. OLE STUD MUFFIN forwardly
placed in the early going, began a steady retreat after a half, also stopped in the drive and jogged in. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MADISON'S PLACE away in good order,, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear midway on the turn, slowly expanded that advantage through
the lane under steady handling. MISS NITAP dueled early inside the winner after breaking alertly, fell back off that rival in the turn, continued to chase that
same foe through the stretch, proved stubborn for the place spot. GALAXY THIRTYSIX back off the early pace, began to rally well out in the strip late in the
turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly while remaining widest to be getting to the runner up late. SUZIE'S DREAM chased the top two up the
backstretch and into the turn, challenged for the second spot when straightened for home, flattened out in the late going to lose the show spot in the late
going. LADY RAD mid pack for a half, came up empty for the drive. EXPLOSIVELY HOT last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
GLORY TO ME forwardly placed while racing three wide into and through the first turn, fell back steadily in the run up the backstretch, moved out a bit and
rallied four wide into the lane, closed with good resolve to be up in time. AKIANE'S SOLDIER pulled early off the early pace while saving ground, moved out
and swept to the fore while four wide in the second turn, well clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. FUHR MEO four wide in the first
turn when in the main body, moved to a forward position before a half, challenged in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive to prove no
match for the top two, well clear of the others. CITIZENS REWARD off a step slow, void of early foot in trailing, improved the middle half, went evenly
through the lane to pose no threat to the top three. OAK HILL SENIORITA void of speed for six furlongs off the inside, displayed a mild amount of belated
interest to improve position. LUCKY LINDA remained always back while racing off the inside. PRISSY JADEN pressed the issue for three quarters off the
inside, gave way in the drive. SWEET JACKIELEIGH away well, set or forced the pace for six furlongs along the inside, caved in when headed late in the
final turn. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BEYOND D'ORO a bit restless prestart, with the early pace in the run up the backstretch while between horses, narrowly showed the way into the stretch,
briefly shook clear past the furlong marker, responded when challenged late, came out to brush with MY KIKI late, found more in the final strides to narrowly
prevail in a game effort. KAPPA HILL broke out to be last away, trailed early in lacking any early foot, steered out sharply to be six wide into the stretch,
rallied willingly down the center of the strip to narrowly miss. MY KIKI within striking distance up the backstretch, behind some traffic late in the turn, moved
out to be three wide for the drive, challenged outside the winner with a sixteenth to run, brushed with that rival, outkicked in the late going to miss while
between the top two at the wire. ENOUGH HEART lacked speed for a half, saved some ground through the turn, improved position off the inside through
the lane, not a serious threat to the top three. BRAVE CITY GIRL set the pace in the run up the backstretch inside the winner, dueled with that one turn,
gave way in the drive. TRACK SMART forwardly placed for four furlongs while three wide, also faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane.
KIKI KAT back off the pace, angled out five wide turning for home, remained back in lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
NOT ENOUGH BLING broke with the main body, remained in mid pack on the outside in the run up the backstretch, made a four wide advance into
prominence through the turn, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker, drove clear then held the runner up safe in the late going. SISTER CHLOE
broke back lacked speed off the inside, came five wide out of the turn, rallied willingly down the middle of the strip to be closing the gap on the winner in the
waning strides. SOCIAL GALAXY in mid pack toward the inside for three furlongs, raced in the two path out of the turn, angled out steadily midstretch,
finished well to be up for the show late. VELVET NIGHT lacked speed, roused in the three path turning for home, also rallied late, narrowly missed the
show. LOUISIANA'S HOPE dueled early off the inside, briefly shook clear late in the turn, weakened the final furlong. STOP THE FRIEND forwardly placed
early, fell back through the turn, improved slightly late while never a threat. BOURBON BLUES also raced within striking distance in the early going, had
little left for the drive. MISSBUDLITELIME dueled up front early closest to the inside, chased into the stretch, caved in final furlong. LUKES SECRET
remained always back. ENVOYS LEGACY last away, raced five wide and was also never a threat.

Footnotes
COMERUNNINBOYS back off the early leaders and the inside, crept closer three wide out of the turn, drifted out under a left handed crop nearing
midstretch, came back in soon after, finished with good determination to be up in time. REPOSADO in the second flight in the run up the backstretch
outside, advanced through the turn to take over into the lane, shook clear late, could not contain the winner. AND YET ANOTHER void of speed, began a
steady advance out in the strip before a half, four wide into the lane, along for the show while not a serious threat to the top two. FONZIE SCHEME away in
good order, dueled up front in the two path, shook briefly clear turning for home, faltered when confronted by the winner soon after. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT off
a step slow, trailed for over a half, improved position while finding best stride too late through traffic. HICCUP settled in mid pack, went one paced
throughout in lacking a closing response. SILENT CRY void of speed while racing outside, five wide through the turn, improved position slightly in picking off
a couple of tiring rivals. TEN BUDS forwardly placed for a half, had little left for the drive. LUNDI dueled up front closest to the inside just under a half and
gave way. RICHARDS DREAM void of speed, got out while five wide midway on the turn, remained back in lacking a closing response. BIG BOSS MAN
chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
SEBS PRINCESS last away, outrun early, began a steady gain three wide after a half, roused left handed when straightened for home, outside bid with a
furlong remaining, kicked clear under continued steady handling. AMELIA MADELYN broke back, trailed early, advanced, rallied from between rivals into
the lane, rallied to be up late for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. TOURRISTA settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer to chase the
leader through the final turn and into the lane, bid between foes, no match for the winner late, caught for the place in the final strides. GLANCE settled off
the pace and the inside, raced four wide out of the final turn when within striking distance, lacked a closing punch. GOT GLEE dueled early while off the
inside, shook clear before a half, maintained a daylight advantage through the final turn and into the lane, caved in the final furlong along the inside when
headed. GRILLIN forwardly placed in the early going, weakened after a half. ECLECTIC SOUL dueled early along the inside, fell back off the leader onto the
backstretch, chased that one the middle half while continuing to save ground, gave way in the drive. QUINN MURPHY remained always back in showing
little. RUBY SIOUX also was finished early. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BECCA'S ROCKET in the second flight off the inside, crept a bit closer three wide turning for home, challenged outside the leader past the furlong marker,
spirited duel to the wire, fully extended to prove narrowly best. BOERNE broke on top, clear early, set the pace, continued to be clear through the second
turn, responded when confronted by the winner with a furlong to run, remained stubborn to the end to narrowly miss, well clear of the others.
IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME chased early, fell back before a half, came back with some modest late interest to be far clear of the rest, not a serious threat to the
top pair. ORB'S SOUL in mid pack early, moved closer before a half, chased the runner up into the far turn, gradually weakened in the run to the wire.
CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR forwardly placed while racing outside, tired four wide turning for home. BLESSED ANNA steadied slightly in some traffic late first
turn, fell back, not a threat to the wire. BELLAMY CAY last away, trailed most of the way, never a factor. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
DECEMBER SEVEN in the second flight while four wide through the first turn, moved a bit closer while remaining on the outside in the run up the
backstretch, took over midway on the second turn, clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. MUSCADINE settled off the
pace and the inside, advanced three wide to be closest to the winner turning for home, could do little with that foe in the run to the wire, held sway for the
place late. ARCTIC ROSE broke alertly, set the pace, offered little resistance to the winner when headed by that one in the second turn, dueled for the place
spot past the furlong marker, outkicked for that position, well clear of the others. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN lacked speed, in some traffic while between foes
turning for home, staged a mild rally to improve position a bit down the lane, not a threat to the top three. CALCULATE went one paced throughout in
lacking a closing response. DREWPOWER void of speed, four wide turning into the lane, came up flat late. LOUISIANA MOON chased the pace for a half
and began to give way, continued to fade through the lane. BIG MONEY MACHINE last to leave, remained always back. PRETTY CREATIVE prompted the
issue for four furlongs, gave way, trailed home. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FIESTY FIST broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight outside, three wide turn, lost some ground to the leaders into the lane, late push to be up in
the final strides. TRUE DEAL with the pace from the break after an alert beginning, dueled into and through the turn, shook clear when straightened for
home, nailed late, narrowly held the place. TAMBOURINE STAR forwardly placed while moving off the inside, continued within striking distance into the lane
while inside the winner, made a late run with that one, not enough in the late going while between the top two at the wire. FAMILY CREED fell steadily back
the opening furlong to trail into the turn, swung out five wide turning for home, made a late run down the middle of the strip to improve position. HOME VISIT
reluctant to load, bobbled at the start, recovered to race in mid pack while saving ground, improved inside of several foes into the lane, finished up evenly.
VODKA GIMLET back off the pace and the inside, was five wide into the lane, lacked a significant closing response to also finish up one paced. DUKE OF
BLUE RIDGE broke back, raced cleanly in the two path, lacked a closing kick in the drive. JANET'S DEVIL lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn,
also lacked a closing response. STARSHIP FESTIVAL in the second flight in the early going off the inside, four wide turning for home. BOSTON BENBOW
broke well, dueled up front outside the runner up for three furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
BALKY broke on top, set all the pace off the inside, held sway late under firm handling. MONZZA in the second group up the backstretch while racing
outside, four to five wide turn, rallied well out in the strip, finished willingly to be slowly getting to the winner late. NOSY BANKER pinched at the start, settled
off the pace while between horses, in some traffic late in the turn, mild rally, finished best of the rest. WICKED FITZ back off the early pace, came five wide
into the lane, displayed some mild late interest to improve position slightly. TRAELEE back off the leaders, went one paced into the lane, lacked a significant
closing response. SOUTH AL SPARKY chased the winner for just over three furlongs and gave way. FIRST METAL COUNT broke out to bother and pinch
back NOSY BANKER, quickly straightened, forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the stretch. BIG COUNT fell back to trail after the start, failed to
muster an impact in the drive. ICE CITY GHOST last to leave, was never involved, finished far back.
