LUCKY LOVER BOY tracked close up on the inside, rallied between rivals at the quarter pole, put a head in front at the furlong marker, dueled with
DOUBLE CHUBBLE through the final sixteenth and prevailed determinedly inside. DOUBLE CHUBBLE stalked close up outside a rival, rallied three wide
into the stretch, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and dug in gamely outside of that rival to the wire. MAGICAL JAIME raced two wide off the pace,
advanced on the turn, loomed four wide turning for home, then rallied mildly outside in the stretch. GONE ASTRAY KISS raced off the pace inside,
advanced on the turn and rallied mildly inside in the stretch. ASSAULT WEAPON set the pace, dueled into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. GRAY
LITTLE MEADOW was outrun. ARNOLD ZIFFLE was outrun.

Footnotes
SPEED SALSA raced off the pace between rivals, moved up on the turn, rallied between horses in midstretch, split foes decisively late and kicked in
willingly for the win. SMOOTH PEBBLE moved over to the inside early on, steadied in tight at the half mile marker, made a three wide run at the quarter
pole, dueled with TAPIT'S GIRL past midstretch, dug in gamely and held on for second. TEMPERANCE tracked on the inside, waited for room passing the
quarter pole, angled out for a clear run at the eighth pole, rallied late outside and got up for third at the wire. TAPIT'S GIRL stalked close up two wide, bid on
the turn, dueled into the lane, dug in gamely past midstretch and battled on along the rail to the wire. LADY NOY raced off the pace inside, angled out in the
stretch and closed belatedly outside. BROADWAY PEGGY raced four wide off the pace, continued four wide on the turn and finished evenly. D DAWG
showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled on the turn and faded. SHE BROKE MY HEART raced three wide off the pace, made a four wide run at
the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. EXACT raced off the pace, had an inside trip and tired. PERSPICACIOUS raced off the rail, off the pace and did
not factor. FAN FAN raced off the pace, went three wide on the turn and did not factor. STAR FLARE was off a bit slow and steadied, then outrun.

VALUABLE BREIGH tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide on the turn, took charge under confident handling at the top of the lane, drew clear under
some urging and was in hand the final yards. POOR NO MORE was bumped at the start, stalked close up outside, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the
stretch and dug in late to save the place. SUMMER HELPER raced four wide early, moved up inside on the turn, rallied mildly in the two path in the stretch.
OUR ELECTRA GUITAR was bumped at the start, raced between rivals early, so good speed to take command, dueled inside of the winner passing the
quarter pole and weakened in the lane. JEWEL OF WINTER raced three wide early, settled off the pace and failed to threaten. WI FI steadied on the inside
at the five furlong marker, then did not factor. DIAMOND ROCK was off slowly, raced between horses early on, then gave way.

DUQUESNE raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn, bid four wide at the quarter pole, rallied steadily outside in the stretch drive, dueled with
SURFING and wore down that rival late to prevail. SURFING stalked two wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, then dug in
gamely inside in the stretch run and battled on to the end. BIG LEE'S LEGACY stalked two wide, bid between rivals at the quarter pole, was outkicked by
the top pair and remained clear for the show spot. AGELESS ARTIST raced off the pace between rivals, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly for
fourth. SINGLEBERYLBOURBON inherited the lead at the three quarter pole, then set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and weakened. A
LOOKER raced three wide early, then settled off the pace inside, saved ground and lacked a rally. CASH KID raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. LEMON CREEK LOUIE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace between rivals and did not factor. WILD PRAYER broke open the gate prior, raced
off the pace, three wide and did not factor. NO SYMPATHY tracked inside, chased and gave way. HOLY GUACAMOLE raced three wide early and was
outrun. POGI vied for the early lead, then bolted entering the first turn and interfered with P J'S HIDDEN JEWEL, after that raced wide and was outrun. P J'S
HIDDEN JEWEL broke through the gate prior, reloaded, vied outside for the early lead, then was carried out wide and eliminated entering the first turn. After
a Stewards' Inquiry, POGI was disqualified and placed last for interference at the three quarter pole.

CHARMED (GB) stalked the leaders early on, tracked on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, responded when roused, rallied outside of HIGH LIMIT
ROOM, kicked away and was ridden out. HIGH LIMIT ROOM set the pace on the inside, shook free passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside in the
stretch run and came up second best. BASSO raced off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, closed well late and was along for third. MONTAUK DADDY
chased close up two wide, bid on the turn, dug in and weakened late. POINTER was bumped at the start and steadied, raced off the pace, inside on the
turn, angled out and closed late outside. LATIN CASINO raced three wide off the pace, saved ground entering the stretch and lacked a rally. MILITARY
DRILL chased the leaders and tired. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI raced off the pace between rivals and had no rally. URBAN WARRIOR raced three wide off the
pace and failed to threaten. SPUN AND WON stumbled after the start and dropped far back early. CONSTANT KNIGHT was bumped and steadied at the
start, then dropped far back. CRACK SHOT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
GONE DREAMING stalked the dueling leaders, advanced inside nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the lane, closed outside of JULIE'S
GRACE, dueled, then wore down that rival late to prevail. JULIE'S GRACE dueled inside for the lead, shook free at the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the
stretch run racing inside of the winner and yielded grudgingly late. DARESCA chased two wide, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly inside.
PROMINENT HENNY dueled two wide for the lead, chased on the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX chased inside and tired.
INERTIA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and failed to threaten. NANIE'S TREASURE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and did not
factor. FIRST TO TEA was outrun.
