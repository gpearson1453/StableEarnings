Footnotes
CAMEO SHORES attended to the early pace of BRASTIKA, mounted a bid three wide on the turn, came to terms with the pacesetter leaving the bend and
drew clear in the late stages. BRASTIKA broke on top and set the fractions from a two wide running position, was confronted by the winner leaving the turn
and was outfinished, while holding on for second. BIG GAME PLAN chased the early leaders from the midflight, saved ground on the turn and was
outkicked in the stretch, while applying mild pressure on the runner-up in the final strides. CYCLONE SLEW tracked the early pace, lost ground on the turn
and weakened in the stretch run. SHANGHAI MIST had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. CONSENTIA chased the early
pace, gained ground on the turn while four to five wide and faded in the stretch run.

THE GREAT HAYNES attended to the early pace from OSCAR NOD, confronted that rival leaving the turn to take the lead, was pressured in the final
sixteenth but determinedly kept on to prevail. SUGAR CRUSH stalked the early pace from a three wide running position, vied for the lead leaving the turn
but was outfinished, while holding for second over an oncoming rival. BIG CHICK tracked the early pace from a ground saving position, was closing well in
the stretch but could not reel in the top two and just missed for second. AUSTRIAN NAVY had no early speed, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off
of the turn but was outkicked in the stretch. OSCAR NOD broke alertly and was hustled to set the early pace, saved ground on the turn but weakened in the

Footnotes
SAKE sat off of the quick pace of WINNING VALLE while saving ground on the turn, closed the margin on that foe off of the turn and drew clear in the late
going. RUNNING LUCK settled in the midflight, gained ground while four wide off of the turn and into the stretch and was outkicked, but held second over an
oncoming rival. MANY BANKERS settled near the rear of the field while saving ground, mounted a rally leaving the turn and was outfinished, just missing for
second. WINNING VALLE broke on top and set quick fractions from a ground saving position, was confronted leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch
run. HOT AND A MESS tracked the early pace from the midflight, was three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch. LOOKING AT BO chased the
early lead from the inside and tired in the stretch drive. EARLY RISER (IRE) was erratic leaving the start and was away slowly, had no early speed and was
not a factor.

and gamely prevailed. ROWDYROOSTER had no early speed, was three to four wide on the second turn, gained leaving the bend and while running on the
left lead met the bid of the winner in the final sixteenth but was nipped on the line, while getting up in time for second. DR. HOFFMAN settled in the middle
of the field, was two to three wide on the second turn, vied for the lead off of the turn and led inside of the final sixteenth but was nailed by the top two at the
finish. BROKEN FINGER set the pace from a ground saving position, was confronted on the second turn and was outkicked in the stretch. COLLUSION

MAGIC IS FLYING settled in the midflight, mounted a bid while three wide on the second turn, confronted the leaders inside of the furlong marker while on
the left lead, was pressured inside of the final sixteenth but dug in to hold for the win. WILD WAGER had no early speed, was three to four wide on the
second turn, closed well in the stretch to pressure the winner but could not reel him in while clear of the rest. ADD ON took control of the quick pace on the
backstretch, saved ground on the second turn, was confronted leaving the turn and was outkicked but saved third in the final strides. STORMY THUNDER
tracked the early pace from the midflight, gained ground while three wide on the second turn but was outkicked in the stretch run. SMOKE STACK was
hustled to dispute the early pace, gave way to ADD ON on the backstretch while attending to that one's pace, saved ground on the second turn but
weakened in the stretch run. NO CHIEF TRICKS checked in tight quarters on the first turn, settled near the rear of the field, gained ground while three wide
on the second turn but did not have a late kick in the stretch run. PROOF OF PARANOIA had no early speed, saved ground on the second turn, gained
leaving the turn but flattened out in the stretch run. CLASSIC PRESENCE was away a step slowly and was unhurried, was four wide on the second turn and
was not a factor. CASTLE DONOVAN LAD stalked the early pace from a ground saving position and gave way in the stretch. WHISPERING FLAME was
floated into the four path on the first turn, tracked the early pace, was two wide on the second turn, lost ground off of the turn and faded in the stretch.

TOP HARBOR tracked the early quick pace from the midflight, was two wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn, was urged in the stretch, responded
to that handling and edged clear in the end. WAR GAMES broke sharply and set quick fractions while two wide on the turn, turned away LET"S REJOYCE
inside of the final furlong but could not hold off the oncoming winner, while clear of the rest. LET'S REJOYCE prompted the pace from a three wide running
position, was repelled by WAR GAMES inside of the final furlong and was outfinished in the stretch. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO was away a bit slowly and had
no early speed, gained ground off of the turn and finished willingly in the stretch drive. MISTER BOLD stalked the early pace from a four wide path and gave
way in the stretch. UNION DANCE chased the early leaders from near the rear of the field and was not a factor. LYMEBYRD chased the early fractions from
a ground saving position and gave way in the stretch.

prevail over an oncoming runner-up. REBALATION was away slowly and chased the field from the rear, saved ground on the turn and mounted a bold rally
along the rail in the stretch, closed well and just missed for the win, while getting up for second. CAROLINA MIA took over pace duties on the turn while two
wide, had a clear lead in the stretch but was caught in the final sixteenth and missed for the win and place in the final strides. EMPIRE HOUSE stalked the
early pace from a two wide position and finished willingly in the stretch. TRINA tracked the early pace from a forward position while three wide on the turn
and made a mild late bid in the stretch. STRIKING SERMON veered in at the start and was hustled to chase the early leaders, saved ground on the turn and
was closing well in the stretch run. BLACK DROP had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch. MISS CAROUSEL
sat off of the early pace, was two to three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. BUSY PAYNTER broke quickly and set the pace for the
first-quarter, was challenged by CAROLINA MIA on the turn, lost ground leaving the turn and faded in the stretch run. FOCUS FIRST had no early speed,
