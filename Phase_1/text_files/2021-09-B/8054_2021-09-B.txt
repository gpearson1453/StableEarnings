Footnotes
LOQUACIOUS broke poorly, trailed the field on the turn, rallied late and drew off. KEEP GOING was in touch, roused on the turn and from the six path
through the stretch was up for place. UNION APPRECIATION stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the five path in mid
stretch but failed to hold. A GERSHWIN TUNE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more.
RAPID BEAT set the pace and had the lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch came up empty.

Footnotes
STEPITUPSTEPHANIE was away alertly, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. MI TIA REGIS was
unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. PIPPI stalked the early leaders and had a good
position on the turn but needed more. SIMPLY A ZOOMER was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no
late kick. OUTCLASS showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. WICKEN CENTS
was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. STORY STRAIGHT was in touch and hustled along on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no threat. STELLA UNREAL was hustled early but chased on the turn and flattened out.
SPENDING SPREE was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. SMART N QUICK was well back, showed nothing and was never in
contention.

TRINITY THUNDAH was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. HEEHAA was up close, forced

on the turn and vied from the four path through the stretch but was all out. HOMELANDER was in range, raced evenly on the turn, angled out in mid stretch
and was up for a share. ROYAL FANFARE was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact.
JMR AWESOM SILENCE was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but had nothing left. TEXT ME TOO was in touch and saved ground on the turn

BIG TIME LOUIE set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. TINKER
RING was in touch, moved up on the turn and had a bid from the five path at the top of the stretch but was outgunned. CAUSE FOR ALARM was off the
pace, hustled along on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ZOOMER MUSIC stalked the leaders from the outside and
dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR showed no speed, saved ground on the turn and
angled out in mid stretch but had no impact. WALDORF forced the pace and was a factor from between foes on the turn but had nothing left.

was hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. BOLD ANIMAUX was in touch and roused on the turn but from the
six path at the top of the stretch had no response.
