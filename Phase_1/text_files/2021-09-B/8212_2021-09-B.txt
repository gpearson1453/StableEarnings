Footnotes
ANNIE UP BUCK led in the early going, tracked the pace to the lane, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off the final furlong.
DARK BLUE FLAME allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and
closed well for the place. PEGGY SUE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside, flattened, while gaining show. RICKEY'S
GIRL sprinted to a clear lead by the first call, drew off down the backstretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. PATIENT DIGNA well
placed, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally. SECRET TEMPLE was no factor.

RUNAWAY PHYLLIS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge and lasted under steady pressure. CHARLIV mid pack,
looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. KATIE'S LAST DANCE well placed, gained position
on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. ENLISTED ran evenly. LISTO SHARP steadily lost ground. BROKEN LOVE
lost contact with the field, was eased over the wire and walked off.

COMMODORE BARRY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a
steady gain and drove clear late. SHAKIN IT UP LARRY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, made a steady gain and
edged up for the place. MCQUEEN'S BULLITT allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed
late kick. LEONARD'S LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenged, then weakened late and held a share.
WHATISAY mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and weakened the final furlong. TUDOX IMAGINEER was a brief factor.

ANOTHER SOFTBALL allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear
late. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) set the pace on the inside, shook clear in the stretch, then was no match for the winner late and held the place.
JOEYVILLE tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path, angled out and lacked the needed late kick.
ZOODLES mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, steadied along in the late going and could not gain. HE'S
ON THE FLY well placed, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. MIKADO mid pack, lost some ground
two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and ran evenly. STREET SILENCE vied for the early lead on the outside, held position
on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader and faded in the lane. HICKORY ISLAND was never involved. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY

CLEARLY SMASHING well placed, gained a striking position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain
and drew off late. FEETS OF FEATHER allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch and evened out.
PRINCESS JAVONCIA stalked the early pace on the inside, edged to the lead down the backstretch, held to the furlong marker, then weakened and held
the show. VILLAGE QUEEN led in the early going, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share.
BOURBON BLAST ran evenly. SPIN CLASS ran evenly for a half, moved to position inside through the second turn, came through, then faded the final
furlong. DANCE THE DAY AWAY was no factor.
