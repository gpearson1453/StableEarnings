TAMIAMI chased three wide early on, moved up between rivals on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, dueled with BAHAMA PEARL and wore down
that rival in deep stretch for the win. BAHAMA PEARL was bumped at the start, dueled two wide for the early lead, took over on the turn, dug in gamely
inside in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly late. WICKED JANE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, made a four wide run into contention at
the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and closed well late. SHAKEM chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
DAZZLING SPEED was bumped on both sides and steadied at the start, chased four wide, bid three wide on the turn and weakened. WALL EYE was
bumped at the start, dueled inside for the lead, dropped back on the turn and tired. LADY NORMANDY was bumped at the start, chased inside early,
between rivals on the turn and faded. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS was outrun.

midstretch, dueled with that rival through the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. WILLIAM CROTTY stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled
with TEAM EFFORT turning for home, put a head in front, dueled with that rival in a long stretch drive, dug in gamely outside and just missed. PAINTER'S

the pace, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a winning bid. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced five wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, failed to
threaten and passed tired rivals in deep stretch. K D'S CAT BIRD tracked inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. KALEIDOSCOPE KID raced off
the pace, moved up four wide at the half mile, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. DOHKO raced four wide early, then chased between foes and

RIGHT ON Q cleared off entering the first turn, set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, drifted well off the inside, responded when roused and pulled
away in the final furlong. SUPER SHOES raced three wide early, then stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside rivals into the
stretch and was clearly second best. UNIQUE PATH raced off the pace inside, then moved up between rivals, chased between horses on the far turn and
weakened in the stretch. A FAREWELL YODEL tracked the pacesetter in the early stages, chased on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch and
weakened. POSTINO'S STORY hopped and was off a bit slow, raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. D TACHYON stalked two wide, then
chased and gave way on the far turn. SIR JULIO was bumped at the start and raced far back throughout. LAREDO steadied at the start, raced off the pace
between rivals and did not factor. RAL COPPERHEADROAD was bumped hard at the start and outrun.
