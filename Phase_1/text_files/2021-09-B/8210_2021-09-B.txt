Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT tracked the early pace, made a three wide bid leaving the turn, went on even terms for command by the furlong marker, then drew clear in
the final furlong to prove best under a drive. QUE SERA SERA was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace while in the two path, then was headed by
the furlong marker and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD chased the early pace three to four wide but
lacked the needed rally while getting the nod for the show award. WEIGHTLESSNESS was settled early while two wide by the three eighths pole, then
dropped to the inside by the quarter pole and lacked a rally while just missing the show spot. MYSTICAL JUSTICE was allowed to settle early on the inside
swung out three wide for the derive but had no rally. ABBY'S DESTINY was allowed to settle early while three wide, then came into the drive four wide but
had no response.

to prove much the best. FIRESIDE KITTEN was rated along and made a mild three wide bid leaving the turn but prove no match to the winner while second
best. MALIBU MOIRA was bumped at the start, then was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was up for the show award on the inside. CHOCTAW

reserved early while four wide on the backstretch, then was three wide by the quarter poler but lacked a rally. COMPLETE was allowed to settle early while
three wide on the backstretch, then was four wide into the drive but had no rally. NATIVE CHARM was bumped at the start, then was reserved early, then
split rivals around the three eighths pole and came three wide into the drive but lacked a late response. Due to a timer malfunction the mile fraction was

FRENCH KID stalked the early pace and made a four wide leaving the quarter pole, went on even terms by the furlong marker, then drew clear from there to
prove much the best under right handed crop urging. STAND AND SERVE set a pressured pace early while three wide, then shook clear on the turn, then
was headed by the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival the final furlong while clearly second best. SKY LIBERTY pressed the early pace
in between horses, then dropped to the inside on the turn while dropping back, held show award. EVEN MONEY was reserved early, swung out three wide
for the drive and offered a belated rally for the minor rewards. LITTLE JOHN COLONY chased the early pace four to five wide and came up empty.
SHINPURUNA was settled back early, swung out five wide by the three sixteenths pole and had no rally. JUST DIG IT ducked in leaving the chute, then
showed speed on the inside and weakened.

HUNGARIAN PRINCESS broke inward at the start, then was rated along the inside, then shifted out three wide by the three sixteenths pole for aim at the
front runner, closed well to get up late to prove best under a drive. POSEIDON'S PASSION pressed the early pace and then made a bid to duel for
command by the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was caught in deep stretch to just fail late, second
best. GIRL NAMED PATSY chased the early pace four wide, came into the drive five wide and was up for the show award. FOREIGN EXCHANGE set a
pressured pace and then dueled for the lead on the inside by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. QUEEN BRIDGET was bumped at the start, came
three wide into the drive and had no rally. PUPPYMONKEYBABY stalked the early pace three wide, then was four wide by the three sixteenths and came

FAIR GAME stalked the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, then ranged up and went on even terms for command by the
furlong marker, then was given one right handed pop with the riding crop and responded well to edge away late under mild urging. GRAVITRON was away
alertly and crossed over towards the inside into the first turn while setting the pace, was well handled on the front end, was headed by the furlong marker,
but could not match strides late with the winner while keeping on gamely, second best. PASSO A FRENTE chased the pace three wide throughout but
lacked the needed stretch bid, held show award. HENRIETTA TOPHAM was off a step slow, then was settled back and taken over to the inside, then eased
out on the turn while advancing, then came five wide into the drive and showed some late interest. SIGNADORA was allowed to settle while three wide,
came four wide into the drive but lacked a rally. BICKERMENTS was reserved early, made a inside middle move on the backstretch and weakened.
GRACEFUL CHOICE was four wide down the backstretch and never factored. SUPERVISE was four wide into the first turn, then settled four wide down the
backstretch and stopped.

COMPLICATE set the early pace while clear on the inside and being well rated, then drew out leaving the turn and drew off in the final furlong to prove
much the best under a drive. CONTRACTOR BILL chased the pace from the inside, then rallied well for the place award while no match to the winner.
FREER tracked the winner three wide throughout but came up empty in the drive losing the place award late. WEATHER PRAYER was reserved early on
the inside, then checked repeatedly on the turn, then once clear leaving the three sixteenths pole, finished willingly, angled out late to offer a belated rally.
LOOT THE MOON was allowed to settle three to four wide and had no rally. COTSWOLD'S WAY was bumped and had to checked at the start, then raced
greenly early while hard to handle entering the backstretch, lacked a rally. YANKEE MISCHIEF was allowed to settle two to three wide, came over putting
COTSWORLD'S WAY in tight on the turn and leaving the turn, tired.

Footnotes
MALPAIS stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, drew clear leaving the turn then drew off in the stretch when roused to prove much
the best while being geared down late. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND set the early pace while in the three path, then dueled with the winner by the quarter pole,
;proved to be no match for that rival while lasting for the place award. GAME BOY BENNY was settled early while three wide, then swung out five wide for
the drive and finished evenly while holding on to the show award. D' YANK chased the early pace two wide, then was three wide on the turn, swung out six
wide for the drive and offered no rally. CLOSE THE CASE was well placed early on the inside, then dropped back on the turn, shifted off the rail in the drive
and faded. RAMPAGE was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had no rally. W W CANDY was not a factor while saving ground.
