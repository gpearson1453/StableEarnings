Footnotes
ROSE OF TEXAS broke sharply and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the turn, held a clear advantage leaving the turn, and held off
a determinedly KLOEPATRA late to prevail. KLOEPATRA away alertly and pressed ROSE OF TEXAS two wide entering the turn, was unable to match
strides with that foe leaving the turn, but battled gamely one out from the rail through the stretch to prove easily second best. BOWEN away well, but lacked
the early speed to deal with the top pair, raced one out from the rail through the turn and down the lane in an even effort. A steward's inquiry following this
race into the start, in particular to PERFECT PENNY, resulted in that runner being declared a starter, who caused her own trouble at the break. SOLANDER
was off a step slow, and chased from along the rail entering the turn while devoid of the early speed to contend, and finished from along the rail in the drive
while unable to make a late impact. PERFECT PENNY dwelt at the start to get left well behind the field in the run to the turn, and was never persevered with
while 'deemed' not to have finished.

CERTIFIABLE tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied smartly
one out from the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide to collar the leaders entering the lane, and quickly assumed command and drew clear late.
GOLD POST away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch, battled through the final turn from the inside of SUNGOLD BEAUTY, was no match when tackled by CERTIFIABLE entering the lane, but
finished willingly to prove second best. SUNGOLD BEAUTY broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from
the rail, held her position in the run down the backside, pressed the pacesetter two wide through the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the lane, and
was unable to keep tabs on the top pair while settling for a share. SOUTHERN LASS stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out
from the rail, continued with a three wide trip down the backstretch, struggled to keep within striking distance of the leaders approaching the final turn, and
had little to offer late. MANDY MAGIC unhurried early while dropping back to trail a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first
time, began to lose touch with the field through the second turn, and wasn't persevered with in the latter part of the race while hopelessly beat.

LAUGH WITH ME away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the inside through the second
turn, turned by a challenge from VOLO VELOCE in the run to the final turn, before opening a clear advantage through the turn, and held JOHNNY safely at
bay late to prove best. JOHNNY was shuffled back entering the stretch the first time to trail a compact field while saving ground at the rail, bided his time at
the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the
drive to prove second best. EYE BE SEEING YOU broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail,
maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove
clearly best of the rest. VOLO VELOCE away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the
issue two wide in the run to the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on LAUGH WITH ME entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. TIMELESS

MASTER EWEN moved up through the first turn to gain a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail
entering the final turn, quickly took control leaving the turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. TRUPON ONLINE away well, but was allowed to
settle at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and found his
best stride late to get up for the place in the final strides. TEXAS KID broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of SIR BARCLAY entering the
first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, got the better of his pace rival entering the final turn, was quickly overtaken leaving the
turn, and just failed to hold the place. SIR BARCLAY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with TEXAS KID entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

YOUNG VIGILANTE away well and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering
the final turn, swept to the lead leaving the final turn, and drew clear late as much the best while being ridden out in deep stretch. SECLUDED HARBOR
broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of DAPHNE entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the
backstretch, got the better of his pace rival entering he final turn, but was no match when quickly tackled by YOUNG VIGILANT midway through the turn,
and proved to be clearly second best. DAPHNE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured [ace from along
the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with SECLUDED HARBOR entering he final turn, and finished one out from the rail in
the drive to garner a share. HAPPYTOMAKEYOURDAY ducked in at the start to get away poorly, trailed well behind the field entering the first turn, and was
pulled up in the run to the final turn while hopelessly beaten.
