Footnotes
PAPA CASE made a bid for the lead in the two path on the turn took the lead at the head of the stretch and edged clear while never asked for run to win
handily. OTHER THAN THAT showed the best early speed on the inside was challenged on the turn and could not match strides with the winner through the
stretch. NOT NECESSARILY made a bid three wide on the turn but could not go with the top two in the stretch. BOLD IMPACT trailed from the outset and
was never a serious factor.

Footnotes
SMACKFIRE showed good early speed in the two path and edged clear through the stretch. WILD SAINT was up close to the pace while three wide could
not go with the winner in the stretch but was clearly second best. CLEVER LIL SIS was four wide on the turn and could not make up the needed ground.
O'LORDY LORD raced midpack on the turn while wide and made a mild bid through the stretch. TEQUILA RITA had a perfect rail trip and could not make
up ground. OMAHASETGEAUX raced in the three path while up close for the first quarter and then faded. RUN FOR RANDY showed good early speed on
the inside but gave way on the turn. TRULY CLASSIC was always towards the rear of the pack and had no rally. INDIAN AFFAIR was off a step slow and
always towards the back of the pace. OOGA OOGA MOOSKA was near the rear of the field throughout while showing little.

in the two path but tired in the stretch. WINDI'S MOMENT showed the best early speed and held the rail but tired in the stretch. STELLAR WAY raced wide
