Footnotes
MONGOLIAN PANTHER pressed the pace from inside early, could not keep up entering the turn, angled four wide leaving the bend, came back on outside
the top pair and drove past. OPTIMAS set the pace under pressure from inside, put away that rival into the turn, held a short lead over DORITA'S HAPPY
around the bend and into the lane, drifted out and bumped that runner past the three-sixteenths pole, was overtaken by the winner late but held the place.
DORITA'S HAPPY forwardly placed early on outside the top pair, bid alongside OPTIMAS on the turn, got bumped past the three-sixteenths pole, remained
close into the furlong grounds but lacked the needed late kick. TIZ MY PRINCESS bumped from inside at the start, went three wide into the turn, swung six
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CANDY RUNNER broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased three wide into the turn, angled five wide
leaving the bend, drifted inward in upper stretch, tired and was eased late.

Footnotes
SWAMP'N AIN'T EZ jumped out quickly to take control, sped clear and showed the way four wide into the turn, moved in a bit then came back to the four
path leaving the bend, put to hand urging in the lane and remained clear to the wire. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN stalked the pacesetter from outside, came five
wide into the stretch, failed to threaten the winner in the final furlong and settled for second best. NEUTRINO broke in and bumped rival at the start, went
three deep around the turn, drifted inward in the stretch and finished evenly for the show honors. SHARP WARNING lacked early speed, went two to three
wide into the drive, drifted out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GIT ON YOUR PULPIT got bumped on both sides at the start, traveled between rivals
on the turn, altered out from behind a foe near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. LUCA'S RIDE chased off the inside, drifted out around the turn,
exited the bend six wide and weakened. SURPRISE FASHION bumped leaving the gate, chased along the rail, saving ground to the stretch, and made no
impact.

Footnotes
FUN COUPONS got bumped into rival at the start, chased between foes, went up to vie between runners around the turn, took over nearing the eighth pole,
got brushed by HOT PURSUIT, continued to battle from between to the wire and gamely prevailed. HOT PURSUIT broke in and bumped rival at the start,
chased outside the leader then went up to vie for command three deep on the turn, battled with inside rivals while drifting in and brushing FUN COUPONS,
dug in late and got up to share the top prize. GATES OF LODORE sped to the front from inside, vied for command around the turn, battled down the stretch
and relinquished the lead nearing the furlong grounds, stayed on well from inside and proved a game third. FLYING CHARLIE got bumped from outside at
the start, forwardly placed behind the leader early, angled to the inside at the half-mile pole, saved ground. BRON AND THE BROW tracked the pace off the
rail then angled to the inside, steered out around the turn and went three to four wide into the stretch and could not rally. FISHIN THE RIVER trailed on the
inside into the turn, eased off the rail and came three wide into the drive, moved out in the stretch and could not make an impact. LILI'S BOY traveled four to
five wide into the lane and had little left for the late stages. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL PLACED BY THE RIDER ABOARD FUN COUPONS
AGAINST HOT PURSUIT AND ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH RUN. FOLLOWING A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH HOT PURSUIT DRIFTED IN AND MADE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH FUN COUPONS IN THE STRETCH,
THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

SILVER MOON ROAD staked the top pair up the backstretch, took aim three then four wide around the turn, struck the front past the three-sixteenths pole,
fought with NOTRE DAME in the final furlong then between rivals late and dug in to prevail. NOLO CONTESTO broke in then stumbled sharply, settled off
the pace, angled five wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair in the final sixteenth and got up for second. NOTRE DAME pressed the pace from
outside, headed rival past the three-eighths pole, led three wide into the stretch, was overtaken mid-stretch, fought back from inside into the final sixteenth
and finished gamely inside the to pair. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE bumped with rival leaving the gate, traveled along the inside, came out on the turn and went
four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ZIMBA WARRIOR lost his path at the start, raced outside a rival at the back, angled in on the turn and lacked a
rally. MCWHERTER bumped with inside rival at the start, set the pace under pressure, lost command leaving the turn, stayed on to the three-sixteenths pole
and gave way.

INVICTATATUS settled off the pace, closed in around the far turn while angling six wide into the stretch, struck the front with a furlong to go and inched
ahead in the final sixteenth. T BONES TRICK bumped repeatedly with inside rival at the start, sat well off the pace early on, moved closer then angled four
wide on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, angled to the inside past midstretch, rallied inside the top pair and got up for the place. PAINT ME LUCKY
traveled in mid-pack off the inside through the early stages, came five wide into the stretch, took over past the quarter pole, relinquished the lead at the
eighth pole, stayed on between horses late and got edged for second. TWIRLING DERBY settled off the pace early on, saved ground on the far turn then
bid inside entering the stretch, could not keep up in midstretch and weakened. AWESOME BEACH showed early speed then ceded command around the
first turn, remained closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid with five-sixteenths remaining, led four wide into the lane, became a bit rank at the quarter pole,
lost command soon after and faded. VEGAS MOON bumped repeatedly at the start, tucked inside on the first turn, trailed two wide into the lane and made
no impact. STUDLY PERFECTION sped clear and set the pace to the far turn, clung to the lead with five-sixteenths remaining and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ENBARR settled early off the top pair, went three wide into the turn, steered out entering the stretch, drew alongside MONTEBELLO past the
three-sixteenths pole, took over with a furlong remaining and inched away under right-handed urging. MONTEBELLO set the pace under pressure from
OLYMPIC LEGEND, cleared that rival past the three-eighths pole, came off the rail entering the stretch, drifted out from upper to mid-stretch, lost command
with a furlong remaining, corrected by the rider past the eighth pole and drifted to the inside and stayed on well for a clear second. OLYMPIC LEGEND
prompted the pace from outside, could not keep up with ENBARR past the three-eighths pole, chased four wide into the stretch and weakened. RICHARDS
THE DREAM dropped back early, went three then four wide around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
ON DECK stalked the pace well off the inside, went four then five wide around the turn, drew alongside and headed rival with a furlong remaining, then drew
clear in deep stretch. SWEET SOULMATE raced up close outside the pacesetter, bid alongside around the turn, took over past the three-eighth pole, asked
for her best midstretch, clung to the lead at the eighth pole, yielded to the winner and saved the place. BRITTLE AND YOO went four wide into the bend,
angled down to the two path, moved to the inside in the stretch and put a mild late bid along the fence. TAKE A LEAP raced off the pace in the early going,
went four wide into the turn, six wide into the drive and summoned a mild rally. FLAT OUT JOY chased along the inside then angled four wide into the lane
and never responded when asked. LUXURY LINER sped to the front from inside, went two into the turn, lost command past the three-eighths marker, exited
the bend three wide, then weakened in the lane. VELLA bobbled at the start, angled in and saved ground on the turn and made no impact. BOSSY SOUL
came away a bit slow and awkwardly to start, lacked early speed, went three then four wide around the turn and failed to respond when asked. MISS
ALEGRIA tracked off the inside, drifted out into the turn, drifted further around the bend and came six wide into the stretch and came up empty.
