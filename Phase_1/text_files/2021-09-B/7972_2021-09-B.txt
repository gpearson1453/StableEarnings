Footnotes
RITZY A. P. two to three wide in pursuit, jumped well to keep pace and maintain his position, advanced in the flat nearing the final turn, rallied to take over
command near the eighth pole, then went clear under a light drive to prevail. BOOBY TRAP established the front and showed the way four to five paths off
the inside jumping to the outside of each fence near the center of the course, held a comfortable advantage jumping late only at fence five before rivals
advanced in the flat, got roused midway on the last turn, dug in under growing threat and relented near the eighth pole, ran on and held safe for the place
honors. FRENCH LIGHT (FR) two to three wide in pursuit, got roused nearing the flat and dug in to keep on and procure the show honors. BASSMATCHI
(FR) jumped well in pursuit two to three wide, came under coaxing at fence eight and weakened in the stretch. A SILENT PLAYER (IRE) chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at jump seven and lost ground in the flat and was eased home to the finish, then was reported to have bled. PERFECT
TAPATINO (FR) was in behind BALTIMORE BUCKO when that rival fell at fence three and collided with that foe unable to alter being right in behind him,
fell heavily to the track losing the rider before rising back to his feet, was apprehended by outrider and walked off under his own power. BALTIMORE
BUCKO (GB) forwardly placed tracking the leader three to four paths off the dogs, fell heavily at fence three then collided with PERFECT TAPATINO when
attempting to right himself and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ORB IN THE TOWER dueled inside of SCOTTY from the get go, began to shake off that rival and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive kept to task. GOOD CULTURE three paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along from
the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SCOTTY broke in at the start and forced BREAKING STONES to steady
after the start, dueled from the two path with ORB IN THE TOWER to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, kept
on to preserve the show honors. COACH BAHE veered in at the start and had to be extracted from the crest of the clubhouse turn, chased two to three wide
under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. PAPA JIMMY chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no headway. BREAKING STONES broke in at the start, then got forced to steady off
the heels of rivals after the start, advanced to be just off the top pair five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn,
retreated, got placed to a protective hold and was eased up before being pulled up inside the three-sixteenths and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
O'GOTTEN GIRL went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the tempo while inside on the turn, was asked in the two path into the
stretch, responded well under pursuit by three foes in the drive and held gamely under strong urging. LILAC GIRL tracked the pace on the outside then in
the two path on the turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive while still on her inside lead until outside the
sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point, gained gradually on the winner to the wire and missed while able to get the place. SPLIT THEN
DOUBLE (GB) was reserved under restraint on the outside, tucked in behind horses with nine-sixteenths to run, started the turn in the two path, shifted
three wide then was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner on the outside in the drive and was out-kicked while just able to get the show.
CROWDING OUT broke in at the start, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased the winner along
the hedge in the stretch and was outfinished then just missed the show. INTENSE HONOR stumbled just after the start, settled near the back on the
outside, went three wide on the turn, was asked late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CHALET BEACH (IRE) broke a
half-step slow, was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten.
GOOD TALK broke a half-step slow, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was roused with three furlongs to run and failed to respond.
ARCH OF FIRE broke a half-step slow,. was rated near the middle of the field, went three then four wide while asked on the turn, spun five wide into upper
stretch and came up empty. TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
AMORE FIRE dueled inside of CONSERVATIVE VALUES from the get go patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home, edged away
under a drive kept to task to the finish. SARATOGA KISSES two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went three then four wide through the turn,
angled five wide for home, came in under a drive bumping and leaning on GABRIELA'S MAGIC nearing the eighth pole, then offered up a mild kick to
secure the place honors. GABRIELA'S MIRACLE broke in at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting bumped and leaned on by the aforementioned foe
near the eighth pole, then ran on to procure the show honors. AFILADA lunged at the break, chased five wide down the backstretch and through the turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. AMAZING DREAM broke in at the
start and was hustled, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and offered no response. PRIMA
DELLA chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. LONDON PEARL chased just off the inside until
tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CONSERVATVE VALUES led
early on before engaging in a duel three wide to the outside of AMORE FIRE, swung four wide for home, got steadied when weakening between rivals at the
three-sixteenths, then continued to back away tiring to the finish.

ADELAIDE MISS stalked the pace on the outside of the leader then in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the
runner-up in the stretch, brushed with that foe late and gamely prevailed on the wire. EVVIE JETS angled in while easily going to the front, showed the way
through tepid fractions, vied along the hedge on the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch, brushed with that
foe late, fought gamely to the wire and was denied while just able to get the place. MESSIDOR (IRE) was taken up behind horses as the entire field began
to clutch and grab leaving the initial dogleg then bobbled, was reserved under a tight hold, rounded the turn in the two path while held up behind horses,
waited coming to the quarter-pole and into upper stretch, altered course four wide at the three-sixteenths, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed fast
to just miss while clear for the show. LADY PETROL (GB) was reserved at the rear of the field, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path,
was roused at the quarter-pole, angled out significantly outside the furlong marker and improved position. SPORT MODEL was hard held early then
reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, shifted off the hedge into the stretch and came up empty. MISSPELL
was taken up as the majority of the field slowed down in front leaving the initial dogleg, raced outside under reserve while given cover, went three wide early
on the turn, shifted four wide while asked inside the three-eighths and failed to respond. DESIGNER READY was rated on the outside without cover, went
three wide while let out on the turn, chased into upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
ALCOOLS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from FOX RED to the outside, had that rival up the
pressure through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and held gamely to prevail on
the wire. HAPPY FARM chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and dug in under a drive
steadily gaining to threaten to the outside through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. FREE ENTERPRISE broke open the stall door prior to
the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
ran on to secure the show honors. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and was outkicked. MOJOVATION chased four then three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. FOX RED hustled from the start, prompted the leader from the outside three then
two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TEMPLE was rated just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the two path late on the far turn then was asked, gained to make a bid between horses in upper
stretch, took the advantage outside the furlong marker, disposed of the pacesetter into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. KINENOS was
off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, settled on the inside, brushed with a foe leaving the backstretch, was asked for his best while off the rail in
upper stretch, chased behind foes under the crop to the sixteenth-pole, came between horses while following the winner late and finished with good courage
for the place. VALUE ENGINEERING went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the final turn, was asked for his
best into upper stretch, shied out from a left-handed crop in the drive and finished willingly for the show. SUMMER TO REMEMBER bobbled slightly at the
break, went clear early, showed the way while inside to the two path, was given his cue turning into upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker
and was outfinished. FARMINGTON ROAD followed the clear leader in the two path, was asked on the far turn then driven three wide into the stretch, made
a bid near the three-sixteenths, battled into the final furlong and tired. PERJURY TRAP rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back on the
outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, angled five wide outside the quarter-pole, moved into a reasonable striking position while well out in the
course into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. GUNNISON saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, brushed with an opponent leaving
the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. TIMES WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. ALL
TIMES WERE HAND TIMED.
