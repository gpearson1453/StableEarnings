Footnotes
WELL DONE SALLY sat just off of the early pace, gained ground while four wide on the turn, confronted THUNDER WOMAN inside of the final furlong, had
a late kick and held on over an oncoming runner-up. CLOCHARD STREET was allowed to settle at the rear of the field, closed ground in the stretch and
was coming on late to pressure the winner but just missed for the win while besting the rest. THUNDER WOMAN prompted the early pace from a three wide
running position, put away DESERT FOG off of the turn, led into the final sixteenth but was outfinished by the top two. FLAG SALUTE tracked the early
pace while saving ground and passed tiring foes in the stretch. KEEPINMYPROMISE chased from near the rear of the field in the early going and finished
evenly in the stretch run. DESERT FOG broke sharply and set the early fractions while being prompted, saved ground on the turn and weakened in the
stretch.

LADY DOC hopped at the start and settled near the rear in the early stages, mounted a bid while four then three wide on the second turn, confronted the
pacesetter in the final furlong and wore down that foe to edge clear in the end. PREDETERMINATION set quick fractions from a ground saving running
position, had a clear lead while tiring in the final furlong but was caught and outfinished by the winner and saved the place. LADY MOHICAN sat just off of
the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, closed well in the stretch and just missed for second. ABIGAIL ALDEN tracked the early leaders from a
midflight position, was three wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. SWEET MEG chased the early pace from a ground saving
position and weakened in the late going. IZZY'S INPUT was off a step slowly and settled at the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and did
not rally in the stretch. EVENING AMBITION stalked the quick fractions through the second turn while running in the three path and gave out in the stretch
run.

DAY PLAN prompted the early pace while saving ground on the turn, confronted a stubborn foe in TIP TOP GAL inside of the furlong marker, was urged
firmly under left-handed encouragement and dug in to prevail, holding off an oncoming runner-up. NORTHWEST FACTOR sat just off of the early pace,
saved ground while two wide on the turn, steadied and swung out in tight quarters inside of the final furlong and closed well to get the place. TIP TOP GAL
broke alertly and set the quick pace from a ground saving position, was headed by the winner off of the turn but would not relent and stubbornly stayed on
until the final sixteenth and held for third. DRAW ME chased the early leaders from near the rear, was three wide on the turn, closed well in the stretch and
was outfinished in the late going. WARM SUMMER stalked the early quick pace while three wide and weakened in the stretch run. I'M A ROCKETTE was
unprepared at the start and spotted the field eight lengths in the early going, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ANTARCTIC tracked the early pace from a forward position, mounted a bid while four wide on the second turn to confront the leaders, dug in in the final
sixteenth and held on over an oncoming runner-up to prevail. AIGLE was unhurried in the early stages, was four wide on the second turn, swung out for the
drive, closed well in the final sixteenth and was nipped on the finish by the winner while getting up to claim the place. START A RUNNIN prompted the pace
from KING EDDIE through the second turn while three wide, vied for the lead off of the turn, kept on when confronted by the winner but was outfinished in
the final stages. AGENT ZERO stalked the pace from the midflight, was three wide on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch but was not
pressuring the leaders. KING EDDIE set quick fractions while being prompted on the front end, saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the drive.
TOUGH IT OUT stalked the pace from the middle of the field, saved ground on the second turn and did not offer a final bid in the stretch. ONE EYED
ROBIN was reluctant to load and was away slowly, was outrun along the backstretch, stopped along the second turn, was eased and walked off.
