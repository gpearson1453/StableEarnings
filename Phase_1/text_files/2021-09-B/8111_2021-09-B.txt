Footnotes
SONORA SERMON was away well and set the pace through the turn, was headed by the runner-up on the turn, turned away that effort heading into the
lane and drew clear in the end. LOUIE ZAMPERINI was away slowly and spotted the field six lengths to begin, then was rushed up to challenge the early
pace, was three wide on the turn while vying for the lead but was repelled by the winner and was outkicked in the stretch while running on the left lead.
RUNNING ON EMPTY had no speed in the early stages, saved ground on the turn and made a late bid in the stretch to claim the show, but was not
challenging the top two. LOVER BOY TOM tracked the early pace from a forward position, saved ground on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.
MANAALABOUTDAMONEY settled near the rear of the field, saved ground on the rail on the turn, checked in tight quarters nearing the quarter-pole and
weakened in the late going. STARRY SIERRA tracked the early pace, lost ground on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CONCISE ADVICE settled just off of the early pace, mounted a bid while five wide on the turn, gained ground on the pacesetter leaving the turn, made a
quick rush to collar that foe inside of the furlong marker and pulled clear in the end. TRAFFIC STOPPER tracked the early pace from a forward position
while four wide and was outkicked in the stretch, while clear of the rest. CUTETIP attended to the early pace from a three wide running position and was
outfinished in the stretch. BABE'S GOT APPEAL broke quickly and set the pace through the turn, was confronted leaving the bend by the winner and faded
in the stretch. RUN LIKE KONA chased the early pace while saving ground and gave way in the late going. BIG AWARD veered in at the break and was
away slowly, chased from the rear of the field, was four to five wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. BOWLMAGEDDON had no early speed, was
three wide on the turn and was not a threat. GREY ABBEY was away slowly, was five to six wide on the turn and was not a factor.

C'MON MAN sat off of the early quick fractions, rallied leaving the turn, surged to collar the pacesetter inside of the final sixteenth and held off the oncoming
runner-up to prevail. LOVE CANDY had no speed in the early going, saved ground on the turn, rallied off of the turn to vie for the lead inside of the final
sixteenth while on the left lead, could not reel in the winner in the final strides but bested the rest. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM broke sharply and set quick early
fractions from a two wide running path, had a clear lead into the lane and inside of the final sixteenth but was overhauled by the top two. DR PESCADO
pressed the early pace, lost ground on the turn and into the stretch and gave way in the late going. HIJO GALANTE had no early speed, was two to three
wide on the turn, showed late interest in the stretch to close willingly but was not challenging the leaders.

Footnotes
BOISE sat off of the quick early pace, mounted a bid while two wide on the turn, was skillfully ridden to tip out to the two path to challenge the pacesetter at
the head of the lane and drew clear in the end in a good debut win. IL BELLATOR was away slowly, was hustled to chase the leaders on the turn, was four
to five wide on the turn and was outfinished by the winner in the stretch, while winning the head nod for second. MOB BOSS was away quickly and set fast
fractions from a ground saving position and was outkicked in the stretch, just missing for second. LITTLE CASINO tracked the early leaders from a three
wide path on the turn and weakened in the stretch. VINNIEBOB attended to the early quick pace from a two wide running position and tired in the stretch
drive. AS AMATTER OF FACT had no early speed, was four wide on the turn while at the rear and did not offer a late rally in the stretch. MALIBU GHOST
chased the early pace from the midflight, saved ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

SPEEDY TRIP dueled on the front end with KNOCKOUT BERT, continued that duel into the stretch, dug in in the final sixteenth and gamely won the nod
over that foe to prevail. KNOCKOUT BERT dueled for pace duties with SPEEDY TRIP from a three wide running path on the turn, continued that duel into
the stretch and was nipped for the win, while holding off the oncoming third-place rival. HARBOR KITTY sat off of the dueling pacesetters, was four wide on
the turn and closed well in the stretch, just missing for second. OUR EXPECTATION chased the early leaders from a three wide path and was outkicked in
the stretch. ROCKTILLYOUDROP tracked the early leaders from a two wide running position and was outfinished in the stretch.

the final furlong and got up in time to prevail. OCTAVIUS PRIME attended to the early pace from a ground saving position, took the lead heading into the
stretch, dueled with LUVTHEONEURWITH but could not hold off the winner to his inside and was outfinished, while holding on for second.
LUVTHEONEURWITH stalked the early pace from a forward position, was three wide on the second turn, dueled with OCTAVIUS PRIME and gained
ground in the stretch but missed for the place. EMBRACE AUTISM settled in the middle of the field, mounted a bid while four wide on the second turn and
was outkicked in the stretch. NATIONWIDE PRIDE broke on top and set the pace from a ground saving position and weakened in the stretch. DASHING

Footnotes
CHOSEN MOON was away in good order and sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, angled out for the drive into the three path,
collared SOUTHEAST ASIA inside of the final sixteenth and kicked clear in the end. SOUTHEAST ASIA prompted the early pace from a ground saving
position, passed the pacesetter along the second turn, led into the final furlong but was confronted by the winner and could not hold him off while besting the
rest. DI LAURIAN broke on top and set the pace from a rail position while being prompted by SOUTHEAST ASIA, relinquished the lead to that foe on the
second turn and was outfinished in the stretch. SKY NAVIGATOR stalked the pace from a forward position, was four wide on the second turn and was
outkicked in the stretch. LOOKIN FOR GOLD tracked the early pace, improved position while three wide on the second turn to vie for the lead but weakened
in the stretch run. IMPERATOR settled near the rear of the field, saved ground while two wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. LINGUA
FRANCA had no speed in the early going, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch. PEQUENO MONTE was off a bit slowly and
had no early speed, saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor.
