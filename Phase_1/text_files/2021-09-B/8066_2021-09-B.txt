GIMBALA set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BEAU'S BEAUTY tracked the
early leaders, raced evenly on the turn and was clearly second best. SPROG was up close but checked into the turn and from the six path at the top of the
stretch was all out. KRZ SOCIETY forced the early pace and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. SHAMRUCKUS
was off the pace, showed little and from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

stalked the leader, had a good position on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. STARDUST KITTEN was in touch and
roused on the far turn but needed more. ROMANTIC BLISS was in range and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path through the stretch
leveled off late. LONDONDERRY was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

CALL ME JELLY ROLL was off slow, led on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. DARLING DAAHER was away alertly and a factor
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. EVER SO D'WILD settled off the early leaders and had a mild gain
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MUSICAL FLIGHT was off slow and in tight on the turn but passed tired foes
through the stretch. NEW YORK MINT was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but had no rally. BLONDE ATTITUDE was well back and roused
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. KOZY KAT was hustled early but lost ground on the turn and from the four path
at the top of the stretch had no impact.

BE THE CHANGE tracked the leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. SUMMER
RETREAT was hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. AMNESTY was
off slow and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. SPRINGMEIER showed speed from the inside and had a
slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. DYNAMIC FORCE was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the
six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. TWEET KITTEN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
had no kick. MR CHANGUE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was never in contention.

CAPOEIRA tracked the early leaders, had the lead on the far turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch was much the best. POWER HOUSE was off the
pace, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. BENADETTE'S LADY was away alertly and a factor from the
inside on the far turn but leveled off late. STORMY SUZIE was unhurried early and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch was no real threat. FLECK was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. I HAVE FEELINGS forced the
early pace but lost ground on the far turn and had nothing left. BIG MAMBA set a pressured pace, was headed on the far turn and came up empty.

INTRICATELY stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch proved best. WILBURNRUBBER was in
mid pack and a factor on the far turn but was clearly second best. KEEP YOUR SILENCE tracked the leaders from the inside, raced evenly on the far turn
and was up for show. CHALDEA was in touch and had a good position on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. LILIBET
showed speed from the inside but was headed on the far turn and flattened out. VINYASA was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn but was no real
threat. TWICK was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. OBLIVIOUSLY had no speed and was hustled along on the far
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. UNCLAIMEDTREASURE was in range but chased on the far turn and from the six path at
the top of the stretch came up empty. MACHISIMA was off the pace and roused on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no
