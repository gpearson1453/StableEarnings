SPUNKY ALI CAT came away a bit rank and settled off the rail early, raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, challenged
BUFF N leaving the turn, took the nod inside the sixteenth pole and dug in determinedly to best that one to the wire, while the latter, rated a slim lead inside,
was pressured leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in to the challenge of Spunky Ali Cat at the eighth pole then
reluctantly ceded to that one later yards. MISS MORGANTOWN settled off the pace about the three path on the first turn, started a bid approaching the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and came along for show later yards. WEST VIRGINIA PAM stalked the runner-up two deep early on,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, flattened in the three path of the far turn. NOT FOR GOLD rated close inside, gave chase nearing the
five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. LIL MISS FIBER settled off the rail on the first turn then eased outward
into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, though faded on the far turn.

leaving the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. SUPERSTASIA was never a factor. MS. GUCCI GIRL stalked the winner early
on, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.
