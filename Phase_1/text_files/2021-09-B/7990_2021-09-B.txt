Footnotes
GEORGIE'S WOOLF showed the best early speed opened a good lead in the stretch and held the margin. FROG WALKER raced along the inside came
out for the drive was slowly gaining but had to settle for second best. FOR REEL broke very slow to trail the field early came through along the inside and
was finishing with interest. LANKY LOU was caught four wide on the turn and could not make up the needed ground. FRIENDLY FOE raced mid division
and never mounted arally. THREE FOR THREE was well back in the early staged raced five wide on the turn and could not make up ground. WALKIN
TALKIN BOB was in a good stalking position while four wide but had nothing in the stretch. BAD BOY BILL showed some brief speed along the inside but
stopped going into the turn. BEHOLD HWY FIFTY trailed throughout and was not a factor.

AMERICAN CODE stalked the pace while three wide went to the lead on the turn and drew clear as much the best. GAINER was up close along the inside
and came back again to hold second. OAKES CROSSING showed good early speed along the inside and was able to hold third. MY PAL raced mid pack
and never mounted a rally through the stretch. COLORADO CANDY was well off the pace and lacked the needed rally. DIVINE TASK raced mid pack and
had nothing to offer in the stretch. BOX CANDY was always well back and not a factor. CRUZ'N OLLIE showed some early speed but was through on the
turn.

INDY N ROSES had a ground saving trip angled out for the drive and was best late. EPSOM IMP showed good early speed while three wide but could not
match strides with the winner. MY MEADOW showed good early speed on the inside but was outfinished through the stretch. MISS REVEILLE was well
back along the inside and made a mild bid for fourth. LOOKIN' SWEET was well off the pace and lacked a winning rally while wide. KALLISTE ROSE raced
mid pack while well off the rail and never mounted a rally. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL was well back the entire race and was never a factor. FEELS RIGHT showed
some early speed but dropped back quickly on the turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

HOLD TIGHT stalked the early pace made a big move up the backstretch along the inside came out to engage the leader on the outside and steadily edged
clear in the final yards. RED WES showed good early speed and was in a two horse speed duel responded when challenged by the winner but could not
match strides with that one late. BUDDY NINER raced three wide for much of the race made a mild bid but was never a threat to the top two. CHUCK
NAZTY showed good early speed to hook up in a speed duel but gave way willingly going into the second turn. TUFF WILLY TE chased the pace for much
of the race and had no rally. FANCY GI GI trailed from the outset and was never a serious factor.
