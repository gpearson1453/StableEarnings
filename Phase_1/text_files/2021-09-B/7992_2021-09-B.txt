Footnotes
HEAVY ROLLER showed good speed, disputed the early pace on the outside of MARBLE MOON, moved clear inside the five-eighths pole, drew off in the
two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under solid urging, responded well in the stretch and proved much the best under steady handling.
EKHTIBAAR broke in then brushed the hindquarters of a foe and was a bit slow into stride, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. TAPALIST was brushed in the hindquarters by a rival at the
start, settled at the rear of the field, was urged three then four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and just missed the place while able to
get the show. HAMMERIN AAMER broke a half-step slow, settled comfortably off the pace, raced between horses from the nine-sixteenths to the half-mile
pole, was asked in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the inside, turned into the stretch in the two path while under a drive and came up empty.
KUMAR tracked the pace down the backstretch, was urged along in the three path while between foes on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and
capitulated. MARBLE MOON contested the early pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back passing the five-eighths, was crowded against the rail
while falling back fast early on the turn and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
PROVEN INNOCENT tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the
two path straightened away, rallied to split rivals just inside the eighth pole and seized command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish to
prevail. MEGAYACHT spun three wide into the first turn floating BALTHUS four wide, tracked just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. CONNAGH'S QUAY led early on before being placed in
reserve conceding the lead to track along the inside under rating, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in and was caught a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors on the wire. I AM THE
LAW saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was
outkicked through the final furlong. SUMMER SILENCE tracked the spurting away leader in closest aim along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths taking closer order with the field, angled four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the late stages. BALTHUS (IRE) got spun four
wide into the first turn due to pressure from MEGAYACHT and tucked three then two wide through that bend, tracked just off the inside from near the rear of
the field, came under urging with five-sixteenths to go, cornered three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CANYOUHEARMENOW spurted
away under rating crossing to the inside into the first turn and showed the way isolated in front through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and the field advanced quickly in behind, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and tired.

Footnotes
TRINNI LUCK bumped with PERFECT GRACE early, angled in while going to the front, showed the way through solid fractions, dictated terms while inside
to the two path on the turn, had the rider take a couple confident peeks behind him coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when set down after
straightening for the drive, drew off under strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final seventy yards while much the best.
PRIMACY settled on the inside, moved closer outside the five-eighths, drafted inside on the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, came off the
rail under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. PERFECT GRACE lost her footing at the start, bumped with
TRINNI LUCK early then was carried in by that foe and steadied off heels, moved out then advanced to track the leader, went three wide on the turn, was
asked with three furlongs to run, chased into the stretch then dropped back, drifted out inside the furlong marker and tired but was clear for the show. HALO
CITY broke out and was last to commence, settled at the rear, moved closer outside the five-eighths then was taken under some restraint, came under
urging while two then three wide on the turn and failed to respond. MAOILIN broke in at the start, was switched to the outside early then forwardly placed,
dropped back four wide on the turn and capitulated. MISS DELICIOUS broke in at the start, settled on the outside, dropped well behind while three then four
wide on the turn and faltered. MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
HAUGHTY veered in just after the start bumping GAL IN A RUSH, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack under rating, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, tipped out three wide and floated four wide bumping DIAMOND HANDS to the five path, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, then
edged clear in hand through the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably at the end. GAL IN A RUSH bumped after the start by HAUGHTY who veered out after
the break, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the
winner home while proving no match for that rival. DIAMOND HANDS tracked the pace just off the inside in aim of the leader, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning four wide for home and was bumped five wide as HAUGHTY came out,
dug in under a drive keeping on to miss for the place honors. SPLITSECONDSONNY four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two
path into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home seizing command straightened away, dug in and was collared
near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MISS YOU ELLA just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MIDNIGHT STROLL three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. ALITTLELOVEANDLUCK established the front after the start and showed the way in
hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened
away, then weakened to the finish. OLD SCHOOL (GB) four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came
under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. EARLY GLOW three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, tipped five to six wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. There was an objection by the trainer of DIAMOND HANDS
alleging interference in upper stretch as well as a Stewards' Inquiry into upper stretch focusing on HAUGHTY and DIAMOND HANDS. After review, it was
deemed that HAUGHTY had interfered with DIAMOND HANDS and HAUGHTY was disqualified from victory and placed third for interference before the
race was declared official.

turn, responded well when asked after straightening for the drive, turned back the runner-up under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth, came under a
right-handed crop late and held sway. TIZZARUNNER broke out and bumped with a foe, raced in the three path on the opening turn, prompted the pace
under a tight hold on the outside of the leader and loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under patient
handling, was asked outside the furlong marker, battled outside of the winner to the wire and missed but held the place. ATTENTIVE was rated off the pace
in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out for room before the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the show. SEISMIC
WAVE was bumped at the start then taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, was hard held in the three path on the first turn, raced on the outside under
vigorous restraint while given cover, went three wide early on the far turn, was roused in the four path near the five-sixteenths and failed to rally.
TROUBLING MOON was caught four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased into
the stretch and came up empty. SAND DANCER was bumped at the start then forced into another rival and taken up, saved ground while rated off the pace,
was asked late on the far turn and also came up empty. ARTEMUS BRIDGE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up, traveled
around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, saved ground while roused on the far turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' JAY settled off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path, dropped to the hedge while roused late on that bend, moved out in upper
stretch, was guided out while gaining into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well to get up late.
MOMOS displayed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while still inside of a foe on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, dueled with JAXON TRAVELER into the final sixteenth, gamely bested that foe for the place but was denied by the winner. JAXON
TRAVELER came in while coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole,
dueled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was outfinished late while clear for the show. ARZAK bumped with a rival at the start and was off
a bit slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, settled at the back, saved ground early on the turn, was roused while swinging six wide into the stretch and
improved position. RANGER FOX brushed the outside of the gate at the start, was coaxed along early then settled in third position, saved ground early on
the turn then moved to the two path, came three wide into the stretch, steadied while forced out near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. BIG
EVEREST (GB) broke a half-step slow, was reserved off the pace, went three wide while let out early on the turn, angled five wide while moving closer late
on that bend, was asked for his best in upper stretch and came up empty. SWASHBUCKLE settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. THREE TWO ZONE bumped with a foe at the start, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
failed to respond.

STORMI CAT LADY showed no speed while ridden along, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide inside
the five-sixteenths, gained into upper stretch, moved out into the final furlong and closed fast to win going away. TELLAPERFECTTALE was ridden along on
the far outside, went four wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her
inside lead while being overtaken just inside the sixteenth-pole and held the place. CAPTIVATING CARA was ridden along in third position, saved ground
on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out while chasing the leader in the drive and narrowly earned the show. REELEY PSYCHED was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, steadied outside the five-sixteenths then was put to urging and
just missed the show. KNOW IT ALL RED was ridden along near the middle of the field, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. LITTLE MS
SCARLET was urged along towards the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, shifted out near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. MADAME
ROSE disputed the pace on the outside, moved clear in the two path at the half-mile pole then dropped to the rail, drew off to a sizable advantage, turned
into upper stretch under urging, shortened stride into the final furlong, was collared outside the sixteenth-pole and tired. BONANA FANNA FOE was urged
along off the pace, dropped back in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
IDALISA showed speed and contested the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back along the rail with a half-mile to run then moved to the two path and
