BE LIKE CLINT raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and got by in the final yards, driving. MAD MOCHA
broke outward, stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn, bid past mid turn, dueled into the stretch, edged ahead but was passed in the
late stages. DAY TRIPPER led quickly, set a reserved pace, was engaged late on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, was headed a furlong out, held a
narrow lead but was passed late. MORNING THOUGHTS settled off the pace, hustled from the rail and two-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch
and finished gamely. DANIEL SUN was away slowly and raced from off the pace while three-wide throughout, chased into the stretch and rallied mildly.
BARTICA hopped out of the gate, gained position in mid pack, saved ground on the turns but evened out in the final 16th.

Footnotes
SMART BIRD sat along the rail tracking the leaders, angled out into the stretch and had dead aim in the three path on the pacesetter, drove by at the
seventy yard pole and cleared off. SASSYWITHATTITUDE led quickly, shook off a challenger in upper stretch and opened up but the winner got by at the
seventy yard pole, holding the place spot over a late closer while kept to her task. SHELLY THE ROCKET brushed the gate at the start and had no early
foot, had one rival beat into the turn before advancing two to four wide to the quarter pole, tipped out into the six path turning for home and closed widest,
her run compromised somewhat by lugging in during the final sixteenth. CALL ME KITTY broke out at the start and bumped a foe, chased along the inside
in midpack, was in behind the winner late on the turn and followed that one into the stretch but her run was no match, settling for a minor award.
ALLPAIDUP sat three wide in midpack down the backstretch, came three to four wide on the turn and into the lane, lugged in when passing rivals at the
eighth pole and in tight when squeezed at the sixteenth pole, regrouping and coming again when straightening out. TOPOFTHEGLEN broke out at the start
and chased three wide throughout, loomed up at the quarter pole but could not continue her run, slightly in tight at the sixteenth pole and evenly after that.
THANKS LAURA two wide and in midpack early, tried to rally two to three wide between foes on the turn but could not threaten. DIXIEWISH had an
awkward beginning but quickly recovered to stalk the leader, bid late on the turn but was repulsed, fading and shifting about down the lane when tiring.
ERRATIQUE was sandwiched at the start and dropped back to trail, came rail to four wide on the turn and in behind the eventual third place finisher in the
six path turning for home but that was the end of her run. SILENTANDDISCREET broke in and bumped a rival at the start, settled inside off the pace and
stayed there throughout.

Footnotes
CARL G stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the far turn, closed into the stretch and led 70 yards out under a hand ride. AMMUNITION

taken back to mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but was blocked a furlong out, angled out and closed gamely.
ENGLISH CLASSIC, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. HELL BENT raced in
mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and seemed to be having trouble steering in the stretch. COPINSAY raced in mid pack,

slowly, settled off the pace, raced four-wide on the 1st turn and four to six-wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
HITTERS PARK settled three wide in midpack, drifted out three to five wide on the turn, got settled and straightened out by the three sixteenths pole and
kicked it into high gear, flying by rivals to lead at the sixteenth pole and opening up late. EXECUTIVE SIGHT was steadied out between rivals into the turn
and dropped back, closed in the two path and split foes at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner's late outside charge, holding the place late.
BRASS COMPASS was squeezed back shortly after the break and trailed, closed inside on the turn and came from the rail to the five path inside the eighth
pole, closing very well late to make it close for the place. MAS CHIKILIN broke in at the start and settled along the rail in midpack, came into range turning
for home but his run couldn't match the energy of the top trio in the final furlong. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST chased the duelers early, bid at the quarter pole
and led in upper stretch but was swallowed up by rivals to his outside and inside in the final furlong. THOR'S THUNDER came up inside the early leader to
get the lead, had it to himself when that one drifted badly on the turn but was challenged by another rival on the turn and lost the front turning for home,
calling it a day down the final furlong. WEISSER bumped at the start by a rival and settled off the pace along the inside, tipped out to three wide into the
stretch but no bid was forthcoming. RED FROG led quickly, was pressed to his inside by a rival and drifted out into the turn, taken up while continuing to
bear out down the stretch. JACK BEANSTALK trailed while wide at the rear and was never in contention.

UNLIMITED TALENT settled in mid pack, closed three and four-wide through the turn, rallied and swept by the leader in the final 16th. MR. COOL set a
pressured pace, shook clear upper stretch, was passed in the final 16th and bravely held 2nd. OVER THE HILLS, rated off the pace, was hustled two to
four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. BEYOND MY DREAMS raced in mid pack, chased hard angling from the rail to three-wide
on the turn then closed through the stretch. JOJOMAR stalked early, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. ONE PUNCH
CHARLIE, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. BETTER BOOGIE pressed the early pace, forced the
issue two and three-wide on the turn but gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. MANE SOCIETY, away slowly and off the pace, chased along the rail
through the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
PERSEVERANCIA got away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn, rallied willingly and swept by the leader in the late
stages. NOVEMBER FOG pressed the pace, bid into the far turn, dueled, led at the top of the stretch, was all out but failed to contain the winner in deep
stretch. SARATOGA VISION broke inward and settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and closed
steadily to the end. SANSA'S VOW raced in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turns, chased into the stretch, launched a determined drive but
evened out late. TEACHER'S PET raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. SILENT CAUSEWAY raced in
mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turns, had a clear path in the stretch, rallied and moved to the rail but evened out late. BOSSALINA
settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn then rallied belatedly. SAY HEY (FR) stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far
turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. DICTATE led quickly, set a pressured pace, dueled on the far turn, yielded upper stretch and
faded.
