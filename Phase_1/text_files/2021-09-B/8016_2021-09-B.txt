UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. HEART RIVER
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. NOOSITA chased the
winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. AQUINAS settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed
rally. LADY ELIANA chased the leaders from the inside for three-quarters and weakened. LOVE ON THE FLY lagged early, raced four-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor.

EXECUTIVE ACTION broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and was ridden out to the wire to
be kept to task. RIVER KAT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place.
FOREST ECHO was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. COASTING was
void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STONUS MAXIMUS was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the
turn and weakened in the drive. HASTA LA VISTA lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

PIN UP LADY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off.
ABRAA JABRAA was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with I WANT ONE while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive
but clearly second baest. PERFECT BLOSSOM broke in the air, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy.
I WANT ONE was bumped at the break, dueled for the lead from the inside and weakened after going a half. SUDDENLY AWESOME was forwardly placed

OREO'S DREAM sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off with complete authority.
UNSINKABLE MOLLY B showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. CAMDEN HIGH settled off the
leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. STREET SHADOW broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide
and weakened after going six furlongs. ASEAAWINNER was off a step slow, raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot and did not reach
contention.

GUARDING ELK CAMP lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, bumped with THAT'S MY STORY in mid-stretch, split rivals in the final yards
and was up in time. PRINCESS CAROLINE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, rallied late and just
missed. FOUR SCORE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the three-eighths pole, dropped back and came back to finished
with good courage. SHADY RETREAT broke sharply to chase the leaders from between foes, moved up to offer a bid in mid-stretch, gained a brief lead and
gave way. MAYBEE A DIVA settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. RATIONAL lagged early, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with some late interest. BRITE LILY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while
setting the pace and weakened through the final furlong. THAT'S MY STORY was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn, bumped with
the winner in mid-stretch and weakened. THE RIDER OF THAT'S MY STORY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST GUARDING ELK CAMP CONCERING
THE BUMPING IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED BOTH HORSES HAD CAUSED THE
INFRACTION AND MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PURE PURSUIT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. GRINDER SPARKSAGLO was bumped at the
break, raced just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. OMACHE KID settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. IRON ROB was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn
and failed to gain in the drive. CRACK A COLD ONE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. DREAMER'S REALITY
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GORDY'S RULES was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing
three-wide for three furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
FRANKS FIX IT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held safe late. LONG LANCE
lacked early speed, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out with a sixteenth to run and finished with a late bid. FORTY SMOOCHES chased
the winner while racing four-wide throughout and finished willingly in the drive. AUDACE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and failed
to menace. A GEM IS A GEM lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DEVILS WORKSHOP was of a step slow, raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not menace. LINCHPIN STORM was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SWEETWATER CLYDE was away in good order then hustled along to open a clear margin before going a quarter, responded when challenged by LAGO
DE ORO nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane with complete authority. SECLUDED HARBOR chased the winner from the
inside, could not gain on that rival, angled out approaching the stretch and was up for the place. LAGO DE ORO stalked the winner while racing four-wide,
moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole but failed to sustain his rally in the drive. SHORT CUT settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. OUR HY ROLLER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. CHUKIT
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SALTY DAN hopped at the start, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and
did not reach contention.
