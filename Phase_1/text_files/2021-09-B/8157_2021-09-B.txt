Footnotes
LOVE YOUR LIFE led two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, cleared late on the turn, met bid from closing rival and held to prove
best. LUCKY ROMANO tracked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, angled out midway through the turn to bid
three wide, responded to urging and just missed. WHATWASITHINKING vied inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, unable to
match strides late on the turn and into the stretch, proved no match and managed to just save show. CONEJOS tracked leaders in between on the
backstretch, put in a tight spot midway through the turn and suffered a mild shuffle, re-bid entering the stretch, gained and missed third at the wire.
HARPER'S GEM tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in range, and lacked rally in the three
path. ELITE MOTION off slow and lost path at the start, trailed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and into the stretch within striking distance of
nearest rival, unable to make up ground and tired.

Footnotes
FAMOUS CARMILITA away super, handily. BOONDARBIAN bumped start, willing 2nd. RAYSHAS KIDD TRAX broke out, bumped start, outkicked.
WALKIN AWAY lugged in 1/8, evenly. PS PERFECT ducked out start, bit green. FIRE AN RAIN lacked rally. FABULOUSLY ME off bit slow, no menace.
