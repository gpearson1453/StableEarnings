Footnotes
CARTER'S RUN rated a short lead inside through most of the opening quarter mile, briefly ceded the advantage to Tamaqua nearing the three quarter pole
but recovered the edge nearing the three eighths, drew clear at the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert down the lane.
KATMAN QUICK saved ground off the pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, but couldn't threaten in the
stretch. TAMAQUA stalked the early pace from the two and three paths and took the lead approaching the three quarter pole, but gave up the advantage
toward the three eighths, gave chase from that point, dropped back at the five sixteenths then flattened in the three path of the far turn. MERRY MERRY
MOJO rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more. OWL RUN briefly steadied early on and settled off the pace about the three path, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the five path of the far turn.

dueled to the front past the eighth pole and drew clear of MIDNIGHT REGRET later yards, while the latter chased toward the outside and closed the gap in
the five path of the turn, threatened through deep stretch but relented later yards. I B NASTY chased the earlier pace inside, angled out toward the top of

length at the break and settled off the pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the six path
toward the head of the lane and finished well; outside. BIPARTISAN BROOKE chased through the backstretch, raced close in the three path of the turn then
