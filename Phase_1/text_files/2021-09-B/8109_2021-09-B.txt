Footnotes
ACE OF DIAMONDS took a tracking position early the raced four wide through the backstretch, took closer on the far turn, went in pursuit of LONE
PIONEER nearing the quarter pole, wore down rival and drove clear. LONE PIONEER showed the way under a snug hold, held good margins into the
backstretch but seen those decrease in the far turn, was challenged at the head of the stretch, was unable to hold off rival late and finished best of the
others. RAIDEN settled four wide early, chased leaving the backstretch, continued on under urging through the stretch and inched clear of rival late.
STEELFORCE rated off the pace from the three path, dropped back in the final turn then came under heavy urging, rider lost crop near the sixteenth pole
and was bested. INDICATIVE sat in striking distance inside, chased the leader on the final turn and faded gradually along the rail. DOMENICO saved
ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DARK STORM COMING was urged to the early lead, saved ground while showing the way through the turn, responded to looming threats at the head of the
stretch and edged away. WILDCAT WILLY broke alertly, tracked wide, rallied four wide into the stretch but could not stall the winner. UPTOME was bumped
by THIRSTY EARS in the backstretch, stalked three wide, rallied into the stretch from the rail and weakened in the final sixteenth. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS
chased five wide and passed tiring rivals late stretch. LILBITSPICY broke inward sharply then vied hard inside, sat just of the pace and had nothing left in
reserve for the drive. OSCAR THE GULCH chased outside and was outrun. THIRSTY EARS raced in close quarters then bumped UPTOME repeatedly
racing through the backstretch, chased and was unable to threaten. THIS TIME SWEETIE showed little. NORTHERN GOLD broke inward avoiding outside
rival and never reached contention.

Footnotes
WHEELSUPINTHIRTY dueled outside of CHILLIN WITH CHIP under a strong hold, overtook the lead while still under a hold by the rider, drew clear in the
far turn and was kept to handling while uncovered. PIPPA trailed the field, bid steadily outside and gained late. GOOD TO ME rated well of the pace, took
closer order leaving the backstretch, fanned five wide and lacked the kick needed. WITT NINE angled out to the four path entering the backstretch, fanned
four wide, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and flattened. KENSINGTON MARKET tracked inside and dropped back. CHICKALETTY stalked four wide, went
in pursuit of the leader and faded steadily. CHILLIN WITH CHIP contended the early pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and gave way.

BIG AL'S VISION was allowed to settle early, raced four wide through the backstretch, angled in on the far turn, began his bid at the quarter pole, closed
gradually into the stretch then gained quickly late and got up. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT saved ground early in the three path, advanced quickly outside
nearing the quarter pole, took the lead a furlong out and was caught in the final yards. EZEKIEL contested the early pace from the three path, continued the
battle from the two path in the far turn, was overtaken entering the stretch, kept on inside and was edged out. WHERE'S THE GOLD trailed early, chased
four to five wide into the lane and passed tiring. INTENT TO STRIKE dueled inside of EZEKIEL and yielded in the last furlong. RUCK stalked the dueling
pacesetters and was outrun.

Footnotes
FLY AWAY vied outside then angled in entering the turn, contended the pace from the two path, drew clear on the final turn, was given her cue approaching
the stretch drive and was ridden out. MI REYNA was outsprinted to the turn, stalked from the rail, went in pursuit of the leader at the head of the lane but
was no match for the winner and held place. IT'S ALEXUS raced at the back of the pack early, began bid nearing the quarter pole and was unable to get by
late. IRISH LUNA hurried away then took back entering the backstretch, settled in range and was unable to improve position in the drive. DIXIE MO lacked a
serious bid. FLORIST was under restraint entering the backstretch, pressed the pace racing three to four wide and was unable to keep pace with the field.
EXACTLY trailed throughout. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of MI REYNA against the rider of FLY AWAY alleging interference
into the first turn. After review of the Board of Stewards there was no change.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET BOBBY unhurried early, chased through the final turn, drove three wide into the stretch grabbing the lead and won going away. RED
CHOCOLATE reserved early, swung out in the lane, closed outside quickly and got by late. DENSE FOG hustled away the pressed from between foes
through the backstretch, gained a slim advantage over inside rival and just held on for show. FINALLY GOTTCHA vied inside for the early lead, dueled
inside of DENSE FOG through the final turn, continued to battle on inside through the stretch but was out finished for show. SIR BRONX chased three wide
into the opening turn, swung out at the head of the lane and improved late. PROOF IT lagged early, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and lacked running
room late in traffic. STRIDERS RING chased the pacesetters early, shifted out to the three path and yielded late stretch. DOC'S CLASS ACT stumbled
leaving, hustled outside through the backstretch and failed to threaten. RAINY BAY was not a factor. SHOOTIN MONEY sent for speed outside, pressed the
pace while three wide and tired with two furlongs remaining.
