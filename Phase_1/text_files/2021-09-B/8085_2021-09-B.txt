clear late. CHARLIE CHARLIE stalked the pace on the outside, angled in into the turn, came through inside into the stretch, then angled out late for clear
racing room and edged up for the place. BIRDSNEST PARTY tracked the pace in the early going, angled out to looped up three wide through the turn, bid
on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. DONALD sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held sway to the late going, weakened and
held a share. SWEET N SILVER ran evenly. SOURCESANDMETHODS mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and flattened out.

NICE ACE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. GOOD ON YA
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that one, while clearly best of
the rest. VALENTINE BUG allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, angled in and came through inside into the stretch, then
flattened out. LIKE A SALTSHAKER stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and
weakened. JEN'S SONG was no factor.
