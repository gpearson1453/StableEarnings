Footnotes
SPY A STAR bumped an inner foe soon after the start, stalked the clear leader two wide and from between horses into the turn, chased turning for home
before progressing in upper stretch to bid passing the three sixteenths pole, drove clear through the furlong grounds, and widened under a steady urging.
SPEED ZONE chased three wide into the turn, got outkicked by an inner foe in upper stretch, kept on to reach place from the tiring pace setter at the
sixteenth pole, and held that position from a oncharging SHIRLEY GREENE late. SHIRLEY GREENE settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted
three wide into the turn before swinging six wide in upper stretch, then rallied outside of foes through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reach place.
TRIBORD tracked three wide, shifted four, then five, wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. BLONDE ON TAP bobbled at the start, recovered to clear
the field early on, but met SPY A STAR's bid in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds, and weakened. MINI DRESS saved ground off of the
pace, chased through upper stretch, but subtly lacked room to split horses in the late stages. ANNA'S MOONLIGHT got bumped by an outer foe soon after
the start, lied forwardly placed along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with an outer pair of chasing foes into the turn, shifted four wide, but lacked
a kick to produce a bid. EIDA'S STORM lied off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. FANTASTIC RIVA was outrun. VALLEJO lied off of the pace four
wide around the turn, and faded.

Footnotes
RIGHT TRAPPE stumbled significantly at the start, recovered to stalk the pace along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the clear leader entering the
lane, bid for the lead between horses in upper stretch, inched clear of her outer bidding counterpart at the furlong grounds, and held sway. COINMAKER
prompted the pace two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane by an inner RIGHT TRAPPE, bid along with that foe approaching the furlong grounds,
but failed to keep pace with that rival in midstretch, and proved second best. GRACIANA lagged behind the field into the turn, improved in the four path
around the bend, and rallied outside of foes through the lane while lugging in hand hanging on her left lead. BERTRADA chased from the two path while off
of the pace around the turn, and failed to factor. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids passing the quarter pole, got
headed at the three sixteenths marker, and weakened thereafter. PAULAS GAME stalked three wide, but weakened turning for home. PRINCESS D'ORO
got outrun.

Footnotes
FAMILY MAN pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, assumed command passing the five sixteenths pole, drew off under driving pressure in
upper stretch, and was kept busy under vigorous hand urging through the final furlong. NIETZSCHE stalked along the inside, shifted two wide to claim place
at the quarter pole, and determinedly held that position from his entrymate through the lane while chasing the clear leader home. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER
tracked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, battled for place outside of his stablemate through the
lane, but was denied. ALLEN saved ground off of the pace, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor share. BROTHER AARON set the
pace along the inside, vied inside of the eventual winner into the far turn, but proved no match for that for at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way through
the lane. COPPER KING saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. JACK'S ADVANTAGE brushed an inner foe a the start, lied off of the pace in the
three path around the turns, and never got involved. RISKY TOWN stalked three wide, but came under a drive at the half mile pole, and weakened around
the far turn. HESABULLY was brushed by an outer foe at the start, got rank between horses early on before steadying into the first turn, and was outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE settled off of the pace, shifted four wide to commence a gain into the turn, floated to the five path to stay outside of the leading
pair entering the lane, exchanged bumps and brushes with an inner PRESELI'S TALE while keeping that foe hemmed in through midstretch, then drove
past the leading duo at the sixteenth pole, and cleared. PRESELI'S TALE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide before shifting three
wide into the turn to track the leading pair, tipped to the four path entering the lane while inside of PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE, exchanged bumps and
brushes with that rival through midstretch while failing to create racing room, got outkicked by that foe leaving the furlong grounds, then stayed on the final
stages once clear to reach place just before the wire. CHARGER pressed three wide before vying outside of the SUPPRESSOR around the turn, got floated
to the four path by that foe entering the lane while sparking a duel, battled through midstretch, but was overhauled by an outer rival a sixteenth out, then lost
place late. SUPPRESSOR set the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane while meeting CHARGER's bid, dueled with that foe
through midstretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole. CENTURION stumbled viciously at the start and lost all chance, then trailed along the inside around
the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, and stayed on. AERONAUT tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide into the turn, but lacked a
kick along the rail to produce a bid through a wide opening in upper stretch, then chased before tiring. HONKY TONK HERO lied far off of the pace in the
tow path around the turn, and failed to factor. SEMINOLE BEACH lied off of the pace five wide around the turn, and faded. POLSAR bumped an outer foe at
the start, then stalked along the inside, but weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
COGBURN set the pace early from the inside, was in the three path into the lane and widened down the lane under a steady drive. ALTUS was bothered at
the start, stalked the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run.
CYCLONE broke slowly and raced back early on, was in the four path along the turn, in the seven path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive.
ALMANZO raced back early on, was in the three path along the turn, in the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch. JEGO was in the four
path into the lane and improved position down the lane. INBOUND hugged the rail throughout to no avail. ZIPPIN GIGI chased the pace early, was in the
three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. SUTHERLAND chased pace early, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the six path into the
lane and empty down the lane. ANDY CANT was bothered at the start and never a factor. CELESTIAL FINISH had early speed then folded up. OFFICER
NICK was done early. AIN'T THAT A KICK was through early.
