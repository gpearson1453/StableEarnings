Footnotes
WHO KNOWS WHAT , three wide stalking the pace around the turn, took command inside the sixteenth pole and was kept to a drive. LOOKS DON'T LIE
sped to the early lead, set the pace off the rail and gave way grudgingly. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR saved ground on the turn, worked between horses in the
stretch and had a slight rally. RONA lacked speed, was behind a wall off horses in upper stretch, swung to the seven path near the eighth pole and closed
outside rivals. BROADWAY MELODY , along the inner rail most of the trip, was well positioned in mid stretch and weakened. OUR SWEET PEA , steadied
in close quarters along the inner rail in upper stretch, finished willingly inside foes. PEACE OUT , steadied when breaking inward, circled the turn four deep,
floated to the five path turning for home and flattened out. MISS BOSCONOVITCH , in the four path between horses turning for home, failed to rally.
CHICAGO RIVER , in the two path inside horses, chased the pace to mid stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
SACRED LADY cleared early and dropped in towards the rail to set the pace, was joined from her outside after a half mile, handled pressure into the lane,
kicked clear after being set down past the three sixteenths, was guided off the inside and held firm under constant encouragement. AWFULLY FOXY , four
wide outside foes early on, chased three wide between rivals mid turn, altered out in upper stretch, moved up while on her left lead nearing the sixteenth
pole and earned the place. SUPREME BLESSING stalked the winner, moved up to threaten near the three eighths, forced the pace into the lane, wandered
outward heading towards mid stretch, was corrected and gave way grudgnigly. IMAGINE VICTORY , five wide outside foes nearing the half mile marker,
chased four wide mid turn, shifted in a bit soon into the lane but lacked a bid. LONG POINT BEACH , between rivals near the half mile pole, angled six wide
into the stretch, straightened and closed steadily. LAMBEAU LADY broke a step slow, edged up while saving ground heading towards the five eighths pole,
was put to pressure around the turn, swung five wide but came up empty. ARBUTUS lacked speed, raced two wide into the lane but failed to rally. WIN

Footnotes
STILL MY BABE , three deep stalking the pace under confident handling around the turn, responded when set down, closed outside horses and was up
near the wire. QUALY stalked the pace racing in the two path around the turn and rallied nicely inside horses. VERGARA , four wide turning for home,
angled in near the eighth pole and rallied between rivals. SENSON , two wide around the turn, chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened. TWO SIDES
OF LOVE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and tired in the drive. DETERMINED HOPE , very wide in the stretch, failed to menace.
QUALITY CONTROL lunged at the break, worked between horses in the stretch, lacked the needed late effort and raced on her left lead in the driveq.
HOLY BERRIES was no factor. GOSSIPING saved ground around the turn and gave way. PEARLY GHOST weakened inside horses. FELONS ONLY was
no factor. BOAT MONEY was outrun.

Footnotes
BIG RINNE , three wide advancing under a ride mid turn, angled five wide into the lane, shifted further out while sustaining a run past mid stretch, kept on
under a drive to bid near the sixteenth pole, took over soon after and drew clear. THREETHEHARDWAY edged up three wide to a stalking spot after a half
mile, chased five wide into the lane, was herded out a bit by the drifting leader near mid stretch, gained a slim lead between runners with a sixteenth to go
then gave way grudgingly. MANICOMIO prompted the pace under some rating, moved to command leaving the half mile marker, spurted clear then was
guided four wide into the lane, drifted out under left handed asking near mid stretch, was corrected with right handed rousing, switched leads a couple of
times and gave way. GOLAZO rated off the pace, steadied briefly when attempting to advance between runners near the five eighths, regrouped and moved
closer between rivals mid turn, angled in with some run in upper stretch then flattened out. SEMI EXCITED , sluggish from the gate, drafted back off the
pace nearing the turn, circled four wide into the stretch, moved up between foes in mid stretch and churned on. HAYNE'S FEVER , between foes early,
dropped back mid turn, angled five wide and had a slight comeback. FIND YOUR BOAZ broke a step slow, made a four wide run leaving the far turn,
chased but failed to sustain. TALENTED DR. B sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was headed leaving the half mile marker, pursued to the lane
then tired. BOZZINI rushed up inside leaving the chute, stayed in range to the turn then retreated. SHAKA STYLE pulled his way forward early and stalked
the early pace, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered.

POLISHED GAL , unhurried early, raced near the inner rail in upper stretch, was taken to the five path near the eighth pole, closed determinedly outside
horses and was up at the wire. GRAND SKYLARK saved ground on the turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed, gained the lead late and was nipped at the
wire. EPIC IDEA stalked the pace around the turn and rallied between horses. GOLDEN CAN set the pace near the inner rail and weakened late.
RAPIDASHQUEEN lacked speed, was inside horses late and passed tired ones. TEA IN CHINA , five wide leaving the turn, lacked a rally. MIRANDA'S
DESMOND hugged the inner rail, had a mild advance entering the stretch and gave way. BETCHA BY GOLLY , six deep turning for home, weakened.
RESPONSE TIME chased the pace, gave way and was eased late. UNREQUITED LOVE , a forward factor in the three path for three furlongs, faltered.

FIONNBHARR settled back off of a contested early pace while in about the two path, edged up behind rivals nearing the far turn, angled out and advanced
under asking approaching the stretch, rolled up outside foes to bid in mid stretch, took command soon after, shifted in a bit and drove clear. VIBRANCY ,
well placed while saving ground and tracking the leaders, eased out under coaxing into the lane, bid between runners to challenge with a furlong to go,
moved in towards the rail and stayed on willingly to narrowly save the place. VOLADOR rated off the pace, moved up between foes while in hand into the far
turn, shifted in and was hemmed in a bit past the five sixteenths, altered out for room leaving the eighth pole and closed willingly. LINE DANCING moved up
to the inside of NO ORDINARY TIME entering the first turn and disputed the pace, held a short advantage through the backstretch run, edged clear after six
furlongs, had her rider's left rein break in upper stretch, failed to hold off bids past the eighth pole and faded. LISHEEN , three wide outside a rival, angled
four wide to make progress outside foes past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on upper stretch and faded. NO ORDINARY TIME , keyed up early while
taking command, dueled outside LINE DANCING, stayed on to about the five sixteenths then gave way. UNSHAKABLE U hopped at the break and was
away awkwardly, regrouped to angled out and pulled her way towards the front, stalked three wide, was under asking past the five sixteenths, failed to go on
in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ROBIN SPARKLES vied outside CAN THE QUEEN while confidently handled, moved to a slim lead into the lane, was roused clear near the three
sixteenths, kept on under strong handling past the sixteenth pole and held firm. QUIET COMPANY , four wide outside foes early on, edged up and stalked
the dueling leaders three wide, was under pressure into the lane, raced in closest pursuit past the furlong grounds and kept on gamely to cut back into the
gap. SPUN GLASS saved ground stalking the pace, eased out for room leaving mid stretch and continued on with interest. DENDROBIA dropped well back,
angled four to five wide for the drive and had a belated gain without threatening. BEAUTIFUL GRACE , brushed at the break, raced three wide between foes
early, steadied when bumped and in tight into the turn, regrouped to chase but failed to make a late impact. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) , two wide between
horses early, was bumped then steadied nearing the turn, recovered but lacked a stretch response. CAN THE QUEEN , brushed at the start, disputed the
pace inside the winner, ceded to that one into the lane, faltered through the final furlong and was reported by the stewards to have bled.

INDIAN NICHOLS stalked the pace racing inside horses, saved ground around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, took command near the sixteenth pole
and drove clear. SALLY'S MUSTANG , quickly clear, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. AMPLIO ESQUEMA bumped ALONG THE
WAY when bearing out at the break, steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the far turn, remained inside horses and rallied. PERFUME
RIVER , four deep the far turn, passed tired horses. ROONEY , two wide down the backstretch chasing the pace, weakened approaching the eighth pole.
FOX FORCE FIVE , well placed inside horses on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and weakened. ALONG THE WAY , bumped leaving the starting
gate, chased the pace three wide the far turn and weakened. SMART ENTRY was not a factor. CHELSEA WALL , in the three path between horses on the
far turn, dropped back through the stretch.
