Footnotes
UNUSUAL CODE was well placed off the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then rallied inside of PRETTY LOUD to take over in mid
stretch and pushed clear. BRANNIGAN never far back to the far turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner but held the place.
HANDSOME HUSSAR broke awkwardly then was to settle for a half, got fanned four wide on the second turn and lacked the needed late response.
NORWESTER trailed to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then also did not rally. PRETTY LOUD hustled to the front, set the pace for six
furlongs while off the rail then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
UNIVERSALLY was chasing to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, took the lead nearing the sixteenth marker then
held determinedly. COASTARANDO was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished in a rally. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) had no
speed, bid three wide to the stretch and was closing well late. SARSAPARILLA (GB) was used to show speed, dueled inside to the stretch, stayed to mid
stretch then weakened. BIG PASSION had no speed, shifted off the rail into the stretch then closed the gap without seriously menacing. POINT BREAK was
settled early, saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed late response. LAGATHA attended the pace outside SARSAPARILLA(GB), was two wide to
the stretch then tired. LAUREN SQUARED also chased the leaders to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then gave way.

IMISSBAYMEADOWS zipped to the front, set the pace from the rail then edged away under urging and was in hand late. UNION BLISS was chasing the
winner from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but dug in stubbornly to get the place. PAY TAVASCO RENT pressed the winner while two
wide to the stretch, was also outrun to mid stretch and could not hold off UNION BLISS for second. ALARMING MOMENT had no speed, raced two wide to
the stretch then was in the mix for second but bested. SAL MAGLIE also chased the pace, raced three wide to the stretch then weakened. BUHM'S CANDY
BOY had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NAVY QUEEN stalked the leader to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, took the lead in mid stretch and pushed away driving. LA PULCINELA
had no speed, settled for a half mile, shifted three wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner but got up for second. LIAM'S SECRET was
chasing the pace, got fanned four wide on the second turn then lacked the needed late response. BLUEGRASS SKY set the pace inside to the second turn,
responded to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. SUMMER APPARITION trailed while saving ground to the stretch and was not a threat. SUNSET
STAR chased the pace from the rail for six furlongs then faded.

Footnotes
RED HOT CAT pressed the pace to the turn, was put to a drive mid turn, raced three wide to the stretch then dug in gamely to get the lead, could not shake
loose but held on. COJO set the pace in the two path, met the winner's bid in upper stretch then battled stubbornly to the line. HANDSOME ACCOUNT
tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then could not impact the top two. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the
stretch but failed to threaten late. SLEEP OVER chased the leader to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response.
SEVERIN pressed the pace in the early stages, got outkicked on the turn and weakened in the drive. LASTBESTHOPE broke in a tangle, had no speed and
was not a factor. WYNNVILLE broke slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
SHERILINDA prompted the early pace, mounted a bid along the second turn while three wide to quickly confront the pacesetter, had a quick turn of foot to
get by that rival and drew clear in the final sixteenth. ODESSA was four wide on the first turn, settled in the midflight, was four wide on the second turn,
closed well into the stretch and held sway over an oncoming rival to claim the place. MAD GRACE settled off of the early pace while saving ground,
mounted a rally leaving the second turn and pressured the runner-up but could not reel her in, while holding for the show. WHOA NESSIE stalked the early
pace from a three wide position, gained a bit of ground leaving the second turn but was outkicked in the stretch. MISS INDEFATIGABLE broke alertly and
set all of the pace from a ground saving position, was confronted leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch. GOING TO SHABOOMS had no early
speed, was two to three wide on the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch. JAN JAN CAN was away slowly and settled at the rear of the
field, saved ground along the second turn and did not rally in the late going.

Footnotes
SHE'S A LIL FLIRT settled in the midflight, was three to four wide on the second turn, rallied leaving the turn, was urged and all out in the final sixteenth and
got up just in time to prevail. SONG OF FIRE stalked the early fractions from an inside position, pushed up to take the lead inside of the final furlong, was
urged on while running on the left lead and was nailed in the final stride by the winner, while holding for second. LA REINE'S LEGACY contested the early
pace, saved ground on the second turn, was confronted by the top two in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final strides. MISS EVER READY was
away last of the field and had no early speed, was three wide on the second turn, made a bold late rally in the stretch but could not reel in the top three.
LAST INNING settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the second turn, closed well in the stretch but missed for the minor awards. KERRALIA
tracked the early pace from a forward position, was three wide on the second turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch. B J'S SPIRIT was first away from the
gate and set all of the pace while saving ground, had a clear lead into the lane but tired in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
TEN THE SMART WAY set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded in the drive and dug in gamely to hold by a nostril. BUYBACK pressed the
winner throughout while two wide then finished willingly but lost the nod. IMPERIAL CREED was settled for a half mile, saved ground to the stretch and
closed but was too late. IDA CLAIRE was chasing to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. FABRIANA tracked the
leaders to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then came up empty. LET'S GO NOW lunged from the gate and lost four lengths and did not
threaten. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) had no speed and was always outrun.

Footnotes
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY pressed the leader to the second turn, responded two wide to the stretch, rallied to the lead in mid stretch and held driving.
FREEPORT JOE was outrun for a half mile, raced four wide on the second turn then swung out and closed steadily to the line. ENOS SLAUGHTER tracked
the pace for a half mile, was three wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but was bested. LOAFERS BOY trailed to the second turn, was two wide then
swung out widest for the drive and closed belatedly. UNCLE ADDOUMA stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, made a bid to mid stretch then stayed
on to deep stretch but was outkicked late. SEA OF LIBERTY settled mid pack to the second turn, raced four wide while gaining to the stretch, loomed a
threat to mid stretch but lost his punch late. HOLY GHOST had no speed, also was pushed out to the four wide on the second turn and got outrun in the
final furlong. GALLANT WARREN tracked the pace in the two path for five furlongs, advanced two wide to be a factor to mid stretch then was outfinished.
BARBARONI was settled early, saved ground on both turns but weakened after six furlongs. BRONZE WARRIOR hustled to the front, set the pace to the
stretch then was overtaken and gave out.
