Footnotes
BORN TO BE KING tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best.
WORKING THE TABLE set the pace, had the lead on the turn and vied from the three path through the stretch in a good effort. PUT A HEMI IN HER
stalked the early leader, had a good position on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held show. LILLZ NOT CRYING was in touch and
saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. THY KINGDOM was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
had no response. TARA CITIZEN showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.
OPTIMYSTICAL was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was never in contention.

WHERES MY HALTER was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. MONEY MATTERS stalked
the early leader from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SAVVY LAYLA
was in touch and had a good position on the turn but finished evenly. GOLD VENTURE had no speed and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at
