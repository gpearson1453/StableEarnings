Footnotes
THAT'S HISTORY took the lead nearing the half mile pole and angled to the inside to set a clear pace, came under pressure at the quarter pole, raced near
the rail on the turn then dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted. KYLE steadied at the inside flank of the winner shortly after leaving the
chute, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane but dug in under steady handling to duel for
second while gaining on the winner. WON DOZEN BANKS chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, and while outfinished for second,
finished well. RULING steadied at the inside flank of That's History shortly after leaving the chute then picked up the chase, rounded the turn off the rail then
flattened the final sixteenth. EPIC WEST angled to the outside to give chase, ran in the six path of the turn, entered the stretch wide then flattened. WIZARD
OF ODDS gave chase toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn then flattened. The Stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of That's
History, lodged by the riders of Ruling and Kyle, though, determined there was no infraction. In addition, this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
LAVELLO accelerated through the front stretch while tapering in and took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure
toward the three eighths, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, briefly gave up the nod past the eighth pole but dug in determinedly to recover the
advantage later yards. RAISED WRONG had the early lead inside then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths and
contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, took a slim lead inside the eighth pole but reluctantly ceded in later yards. DAMISELA
saved ground close to the pace on the opening turn then eased out and stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the quarter pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail then flattened the final furlong. RAINBOW RIVER saved ground into the first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn but showed little further. RACHEL'S WISH rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a
bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. LINEAGE saved ground. SHARP'S MISSION settled off the early pace in
the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch.

WESTERN MOVIES dueled for the lead inside past the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, drew away at the rail on the turn and was steadily
handled through the lane. WHO'S YOUR DADDY pressured the pace leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail past the quarter, drifted
toward the head of the stretch and settled for second best. MS. GUCCI GIRL steadied leaving the gate then eased to the outside to give chase, rounded the
turn off the rail and steadily closed to take third later yards. BURNISHED BRIGHT chased toward the outside, ran in the four path of the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for third. JANIESSWEETMELISSA pressured the early pace then dropped back toward the quarter pole, flattened in the four
path of the turn and was carried out into the lane. BRONX PRINCESS chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. BETTER BOAT saved
ground. CROOKED WAYS stumbled a stride out of the gate and lost her rider.

Footnotes
FIGHTRESS rated a short lead, contested the advantage off the rail on the turn and was steadily encouraged to hold off the stretch challenge of BELLA
GIANNA, who engaged in close chase through the backstretch and factored three wide on the turn, dueled for second inside the eighth pole and was
gaining late on the winner. STYLISH PAINT chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, gave up second inside the eighth pole then flattened later yards.
WARFRONT PEACE RVF chased, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. SECRET AFFIRMATION chased through the backstretch,
raced in the four path on the turn and finished evenly. UNCANNY appeared to be unprepared at the start then rushed up outside, ran in the five path of the
turn then flattened.

KADESH stalked inside then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in for the
nod mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced well off the pace leaving the
turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and dug in to take second the final yards. WIDGET
FACTORY tapered to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead
mid-stretch then weakened later yards. CHARITABLE VISIT raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, eased to the six path rounding the far turn and finished well. TIZEZZY saved ground well off the pace, showed little response through the backstretch,
rounded the far turn about the seven path and passed rivals outside. TOM TERRIFIC rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the far turn. ABSALOM settled just off the early pace in the three path, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole but weakened at the rail rounding the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
POWER FORWARD saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and circled rivals in the five path of the far turn, dueled to
the lead mid-stretch and dug in to inch further ahead later yards. BOUNDTOBEBAD settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed the gap in the four path of the far turn, dueled gamely through the stretch, though, grudgingly ceded later
yards. SHE FIGURES saved ground off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, eased outward mid-stretch
and got up for third the final yards. ALPINE MOON settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
challenged nearing the quarter pole and took the lead at the pole, rounded the turn off the rail but was caught mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth.
THE BETTER ONE raced well off the pace about the three path then eased outward into the backstretch, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path and showed little further. COACH RUBE angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole,
was caught approaching the quarter, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. LADY STORM angled in to stalk two deep, challenged nearing the
three eighths pole then faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
RIVER WARRIOR RVF took a quick lead inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn
and was kept alert through the lane. C R'S MANDATE stalked off the rail then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back on the far turn,
drifted toward the head of the lane then dueled through the stretch for second. FREEDOM RIDER ran in the three path the first turn then settled off the pace
into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. STRONG LIL
KOKORO ran in the five path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path
then finished evenly to pass rivals. MADDEYE MOODY rounded the opening turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. ROCK FILE dropped well back from early
contention, showed little response through the backstretch and entered the stretch widest. WARRIOR'S ESTATE settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. HERCULES HARBOR showed little response through the backstretch.
