Footnotes
IZA ONE settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out on the final turn, drew clear and remained safe under mild urging. PARTY IN THE SAND lacked
speed, advanced on the final turn and closed well wide. SILVER EXCESS dueled outside, led on the final turn then weakened. CHANCEE vied along the
rail then was finished after five furlongs. SERIOUS HAPPINESS dropped back early and was always outrun. FROSTY FRIEND chased inside and stopped
losing contact with her field. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, IZA ONE HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR A POSITIVE
TEST.

WISHES AND DREAMS outrun racing wide, bid on the turn then held foe safe through the final furlong. POSSEINEFFECTTOO trailed briefly, advanced
inside, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. EMPRESS IRENE broke a step slowly, rushed to a clear lead, widened on the turn and tired.
SECUENCIA pursued the loose pacesetter inside and faded badly. VISITING ANGEL raced within range outside and was never a factor. PRESTO
CHANGE O dropped back after the start and passed fading rival. DESERTED was urged off the pace inside and began fading on the turn.
