LOVELY HEIR took over at the half to go clear while the rider was sneaking peeks back from the quarter pole to inside the final furlong with complete
authority to wire in handy fashion. NOT AGAIN JACKIE never far back to the stretch, rallied for place while no match for the winner. CACAHUETE brief
speed to the half but faded back for the show spot. ROSE'S GALAXY raced along evenly and never untracked. ANIMAL KRACKERS always trailed.
