Footnotes
TALKTOEACHOTHER soon led, set the pace while pressured by COWBOYS FEATHER down the backstretch and while racing in the three path on the
turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, edged clear of his nearest pursuer, and held steadfastly. COWBOYS FEATHER pressed the pace outside of
TALKTOEACHOTHER down the back straight and in the four path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch while still outside that foe, proved no match
approaching midstretch, but chased on willingly to hold the place. NUMERO PRIMO chased two wide midpack, was driven between horses while swinging
four wide into the lane, drifted out slightly but continued to gain gradually to the wire. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE settled at the rear of the main group early, raced
last into the turn, continued patiently in the two path around the bend, swung five wide into the lane, drifted further out while racing under a drive, and rallied
belatedly for a minor award. PINBALLER was reluctant to load, was bumped by LAGRUE in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the
backstretch and in the four path on the turn, was driven inside of foes to the lane, but was outfinished in the final furlong. SINGER MCGEE chased inside of
NUMERO PRIMO early, was driven past the seven sixteenths in the two path, continued into the lane under a drive, and lacked the needed rally. LAGRUE
broke in and bumped PINBALLER in the opening strides, was slow to gather back into stride after that, was urged for a bid in the five path past the seven
sixteenths, improved to midfield, raced four wide into upper stretch, and lacked the needed finishing kick. GOVERNORS WRAITH raced toward the rear of
the main pack early, continued toward the rear in the four path around the turn, and offered no bid in the lane.

Footnotes
QUIET PRAYER stumbled slightly and then bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, dropped back to trail the field from the rail around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground between horses in
upper stretch, swung to the outside with a furlong to go and continued to gain to the wire, getting up for the win in the final strides. SON OF GRACE bumped
with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead while saving ground around the first turn, maintained a slight lead while racing
inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from rail around the far turn, ran out several lanes entering the stretch, was straightened out and raced gamely
down the lane, just missing the win. KIT KOWALESKI chased the leaders while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far
turn from the two path, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, drifting out late while finishing evenly. OFF TO THE BEACH
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began to improve position slightly while racing in the three path
around the far turn and continued to gain ground between horses late. BELLS OF JOY dueled for the lead on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn, gave way in upper stretch and faded between horses from there. BEHAVIN MYSELF
raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path
and weakened in the final furlong. POINT OF DIRECTION saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, made a mild improvement of position in upper stretch and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
SENORITA AURORA was bumped by CREAL ANGEL in the opening strides, raced near the rear between horses early, began to rally in the two path past
the seven sixteenths, split horses past the five sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, angled in shortly thereafter while continuing her rally, led at
the furlong pole and cleared. RULER DAENERYS tracked the leader inside of SHE'S SO CALI early, encroached inside of DARE TO HOPE near the half,
attended the pace while saving ground around the turn, headed DARE TO HOPE into the lane, led in upper stretch, was headed at the furlong mark when
SENORITA AURORA rallied past to her outside but kept on second best. CREAL ANGEL was bumped by FOX ABLE CHARLIE in the opening strides and
bumped SENORITA AURORA as a result, settled three wide near the rear early, was pushed along in the four to five path near the seven sixteenths, floated
six wide into upper stretch, and improved mildly between horses late. FOX ABLE CHARLIE broke out and bumped CREAL ANGEL in the opening strides,
settled toward the rear inside, raced in the two path at the rear of the main pack around the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, drifted further out,
and rallied mildly past tiring horses. COUGER chased well behind the leading trio, hugged the rail around the turn, continued inside into the lane, and lacked
the needed kick while driven all out in the lane. SHE'S SO CALI tracked the pace two wide early, encroached outside of DARE TO HOPE past the nine
sixteenths, attended the pace in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch but proved no match for RULER DAENERYS, and
weakened. DARE TO HOPE soon led, was engaged by SHE'S SO CALI to her outside near the nine sixteenths, was engaged as well by RULER
DAENERYS to her inside approaching the half, carried a narrow lead between horses around the turn while racing in the three path, was headed by RULER
DANERYS into the stretch and faded. TIKA TOY settled at the rear, soon trailed, continued to lose ground in the four to five path on the turn and was
allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
BEEALEA chased outside of BABA'S BOY early, began to improve in the six path near the three eighths, was driven three wide past the five sixteenths and
four wide into the lane, sustained his rally into the lane, led at the furlong mark, drove clear and stayed on well. Z U SOON broke sharply but soon settled
back to track the leading pair while racing outside of DEMAND RANSOM, was patient in the five path around the turn, raced four wide into the lane, and
rallied outside late to prove a clear second best. DEMAND RANSOM tracked the leading pair inside of Z U SOON early, tracked the leading pair in the four
path on the turn, raced into the lane three wide in range, took closer order in upper stretch, but was outfinished in the final furlong. FLASHY RICHIE broke
outward and bumped MON AMI FUZZIE in the opening strides, settled near the rear of the main group, began to edge closer in the three path near the three
eighths, raced two wide into the lane, shifted to the inside midstretch and offered a belated gain inside. SIMPLE LOGIC vied two wide down the backstretch,
took over a defined lead past the seven sixteenths in the three path, led two wide into the lane, was headed by BEEALEA approaching the furlong mark,
and flattened out between horses. MON AMI FUZZIE was bumped by FLASHY RICHIE in the opening strides, soon trailed, raced at the rear in the three to
four path on the turn, floated into the lane eight wide, and passed tiring horses. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY vied inside of SIMPLE LOGIC to the half mile mark,
tracked that leader in the two path around the bend, raced inside to the lane while proving no match for the leader, and weakened. BABA'S BOY chased
inside early, saved ground around the turn, was driven into the lane, and had no response.

Footnotes
PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) sprinted to a clear early lead, angled over to race on the rail up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn,
kicked clear entering the stretch and was in command down the lane. BASEBALL POLITICS brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
recovered to press the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, couldn't go with the winner in the
stretch and chased that rival home gamely, the best of the rest. COCO BRAVADO raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the two path, began a bid approaching the eighth pole and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. MEDAL OF FACT hopped up leaving
the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and finished evenly
in the final furlong. MAC PANDOWDY tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung wide in upper stretch, and
passed tiring horses from there. NAVY PIER stalked the frontrunners on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two
path and weakened between horses in the final furlong. MAXIMILIANO chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. ON THE MUSCLE trailed the field on the outside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.
RULE FOLLOWER bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a mild bid
from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
TEMPER TANTRUM tracked the leading pair while a bit keen early, chased the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path around the far turn,
kicked on sharply under a hand ride in upper stretch, caught the leader past the three sixteenths, opened up while shown the crop, and held command
through the final furlong. EPIMYTHIUM chased midpack through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took closer order two wide on the far turn,
swung three wide into upper stretch, showed good interest past the three sixteenths, never threatened TEMPER TANTRUM but came home well clear for
the place. SMOKEY HARBOR settled two wide in the rear flight early, continued at the rear of a spread-out field down the back straight, was pushed along
while saving ground around the far turn and began to improve, angled out approaching the quarter, was driven into upper stretch, shifted five wide past the
three sixteenths, and rallied outside for the show. CLARESTOWN chased toward the rear of midpack, took closer order past the half, saved ground around
the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, improved mildly under a drive but was outfinished for the show. NIP N TUCK tracked the leading trio
through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase the leading trio as the field stretched out into the back straight, continued in pursuit in the two path on the far
turn, and lacked the needed kick inside in the lane. KOBLA MAS was bumped by AGENT PETER GRAVES in the opening strides, settled near the rear of a
strung-out field, raced in the three path on the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. AGENT PETER GRAVES broke inward
and bumped KOBLA MAS in the opening strides, soon cleared, took pressure from CLEMSON TIGER around the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch,
cleared past the half mile mark, remained clear while saving ground around the far turn, was driven in upper stretch but had no answer as TEMPER
TANTRUM kicked past him inside the three sixteenths, and weakened. W W CRAZY raced at the inside of the rear flight early, continued toward the rear of
a stretched-out field down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and offered no rally. CLEMSON TIGER stalked the pacesetter into the
clubhouse turn, prompted outside the pacesetter around the first turn and into the back straight, did not go with the leader past the half, tracked in the four
path on the far turn, and emptied out between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid four wide nearing the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside
and pulled clear while drifting out late under a drive. DEORA STORE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a
bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, gained ground in upper stretch, could not go with the eventual winner and chased that rival home, the
best of the rest. DASTARDLY DEEDS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three
eighths pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and gained ground mildly between horses in the final furlong to save third. GOOD YEGG raced off the pace on
the outside in the early going, began to move up while racing around the turn, entered the stretch in the four path and gained ground mildly from there.
LOOK AWAY bobbled leaving the gate, dropped back to trail far behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn while still in last place,
and passed tiring horses in late stretch. MOMMAS BOY OTIS set fast fractions while dueling for the lead on the outside through the opening three furlong,
began to edge ahead racing into the turn, showed the way from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, was caught with a furlong to
go and weakened late. DASH TO THE CASH raced outside at the back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the two path, improved position slightly
coming off the turn and was empty from there. THE LAST FACT veered in leaving the gate, dueled for the lead up the backstretch, began to drop back while
saving ground around the turn and tired further in the stretch.
