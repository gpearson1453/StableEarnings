TACKSON was well off the pace up the backstretch had to come six wide turning for home and rallied in the center of the track for the win.
HARDWORKCLEANLIVIN was on the outside in a three horse speed duel took a clear lead into the stretch but could not hold off the winner while second
best. SEELEY was allowed to settle on the inside in the early stages came five wide entering the stretch and was gaining late. HOLIDAY MAN was three to
four wide the entire trip and lacked the needed rally. GREEN CARD chased the pace on the inside came off the rail in the stretch and made little headway.
I'M LUCKY showed good early speed in the two path but was first to give way on the turn. ORDAINED CAT showed good early speed on the inside was up
close until the top of the stretch and dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
UNPLUCKED GEM popped the gate and had the lead from the outset and was never asked to run while pulling clear to win easily. JUST LUCK was away in
good order to chase the pace on the inside was no match for the winner while clearly second best. DANCING LIKE DONNA raced along the inside while
well back came on the inside through the stretch for third. TAKARA QUEEN broke towards the inside and bumped Kissa Donna de Buy at the break was up
close but tired. There was a stewards inquiry involving the bumping at the start but the Stewards ruled there would be no change. KISSA DONNA DE BUY
was bumped at the start while up close to the pace but faded on the turn. THE HENRIETTA was off slow then raced three wide on the turn but was never a
serious factor. ROSARITA'S DANCE was quickly in the back of the pack and trailed while no factor. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED
