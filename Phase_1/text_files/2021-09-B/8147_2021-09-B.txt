IS THERE A FOREST forced the pace, raced three-wide through the turn, bid a furlong out and drove clear. I'M NOT PERFECT, away slowly, stalked the
pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn and lodged a determined drive along the fence. NINJA PRINCESS, off slowly, moved up quickly to take the
lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch but could not fend off the winner a furlong out, chased, but lost the place position in the final
furlong. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS broke slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out mid stretch and finished gamely.
SHISHKA forced the pace two-wide, was hustled through the turn, chased into the stretch but leveled out in the final 16th. GOLDEN WORLD broke slowly
and settled well off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
YA MAR sprinted clear, was under restraint down the backside, allowed two rivals to loom late turn, re-broke and opened up, the rider up in the saddle the
final seventy yards. VERDEJO chased the leader down the backstretch, bid inside a rival approaching the quarter pole but could not match the winner's
energy, repelling her place challenger down the stretch, a clear second best. OLYMPIC FENCER hit the side of the gate at the break, rushed up on the turn
to chase the winner outside the eventual place finisher, loomed late turn and was into the second spot but tired down the lane, holding onto the show
position. CULATELLO off the pace and four wide early, rallied two to three wide on the turn and into a minor award down the lane while shifting into the two
path in the final furlong. MOON POOL trailed into the turn and rallied between rivals late on the bend, found her best stride late and was noticed going well
after the finish. AT THE LYRIC was devoid of early foot, closed two to three wide on the turn and came mildly down the lane while outside rivals. LAILA'S
CHARM was three wide chasing the leader early, shuffled back slightly when a rival moved up on her outside before the turn and was still in range at the
quarter pole but failed to respond. FORESTERS PRINCESS brushed with a rival after breaking a little off stride, got over to the fence while off the pace and
her slight run stalled midway on the turn.

DREIDEL raced in mid pack, chased hard angling from two to four-wide through the turn, rallied outside, led near mid stretch and finished under a hand ride.
HARD EDGE led quickly, was joined in a duel on the main track, was headed at the top of the stretch, launched an all out drive but was outkicked by the
winner. RED FUJI moved up to contest the lead, dueled, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was passed well into the final furlong and chased to the end.
TWISTER ALERT go away slowly and settled off the pace, closed on the backstretch, stalked two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was
contentious but did not challenge and leveled out. HARVEST stalked the pace, was blocked late turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and finish gamely
in vain. BIG GINGER stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. ALLURING MEG settled off the pace,
was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SHEZ A SEALY settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide on the turn but lacked
a closing response. STENCIL broke inward, settled in mid pack early, chased from the back on the turn but failed to menace.

PINK LLOYD led quickly, set a reserved pace although under pressure from LUCKY CURLIN late backstretch, entertained a challenge from that rival mid
way through the turn, dueled, moved clear in the final furlong and held under a drive. LUCKY CURLIN was always contentious, forced the issue into the
turn, challenged PINK LLOYD mid way through the turn, dueled into the stretch, was headed a furlong out and dug in but couldn't run him down. LOOKIN
TO STRIKE stalked the pace, chased from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. CASH DIVIDEND stalked the pace,
came two and three-wide on the turn then chased to the wire. MAGICAL MAN steadied leaving the gate and was rated off the pace, was hustled hard late
turn but failed to menace.

Footnotes
HIT THE POINT settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide from the back of the pack on the far turn, tipped out entering the stretch, rallied outside and
was up on the wire, driving. SHANGASSAH raced from off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide through the far turn, bid a 16th out, gained a short lead
but was nailed on the wire. BROADWAY stalked the pace, was blocked late turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and rallied smartly but was outkicked.
COURT BATTLE forced the pace, drew even entering the far turn, edged ahead mid turn, shook clear of rivals at the top of the stretch but was swallowed
up in the final yards. DANI'S VICTORY raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, poked his nose in front briefly in the final furlong but
evened out late. JUAN PABLO settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn and chased gamely in the stretch. PERFECT
CRIME stalked the pace, bid three-wide late turn, dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch but chased to the end. MUCHOKOVA was pinched back just
out of the gate, was rated in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. OUR ZUMA broke outward, set a reserved pace, dueled
into the far turn, gave way grudgingly approaching the stretch then retreated in the stretch.
