Footnotes
WHERE'S NEAL broke alertly, set a pressured pace from the rail, quickened on the far turn then held under a drive. CHAIRMAN BOB stalked the pace,
rode the rail through both turns, closed approaching the stretch, moved off the fence at the furlong marker and rallied gamely. SPRING MOUNTAIN hopped
out of the gate and settled off the pace, saved ground, chased hard on the far turn and was gaining quickly in the late stages. BOSSY HOLIDAY broke
outward, pressed the pace, forced the issue late backstretch, chased on the turn and kept after the pacesetter in the stretch but hung in the late stages.
ROMANTIC GAMBLE raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then evened out with a 16th to run.

Footnotes
VICTOR'S DYNASTY stalked the pace from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, led a furlong out and widened under a hand ride. SUNSPEAR was
always prominent, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch bur was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. BACHELOR PAD was off slowly,
stalked the pace three-wide, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. CANADIAN SECRET, in range, chased three to five-wide on the turn, was
unable to menace but did show some interest in the stretch. TORAH'S BLESSING came in early and settled off the pace, was hustled five then four-wide on
the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and tendered a mild rally. WE TAKE CHECKS, pinched back early, settled off the pace, was roused and closed
quickly between horses on the turn but encountered traffic upper stretch and evened out. YZERMAN raced forwardly, forced the pace two-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch but had no closing response. SUNDANCE HIT set a pressured pace, dropped back nearing the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ITMAKESMEWONDER tracked the two leaders along the inside, tipped out to the three path into the far turn and had the lead midway on that bend, cleared
off by the turn for home and maintained a safe advantage to the wire. MAYITO settled in midpack while three to two wide on the first turn, rallied two to three
wide into contention on the second turn, gained the place spot at the eighth pole and held it gamely over a stubborn rival to his inside. SAMUEL H sat
midpack on the inside, rallied around tiring foes midway on the far turn and in midstretch, outgamed along the fence for place by a rival late. THE NEWFIE
EXPRESS broke out at the start and brushed a rival, was off the pace along the inside, followed the eventual third place finisher on the far turn before
tipping out into the five path turning for home, but could only inch up in the later stages to best the balance. JEGOS FIRE began sluggishly from his outside
post and trailed the field in the three path through the first turn, circled around three to four wide on the far turn and was widest down the lane before
levelling off in the final sixteenth. CONQUER HIM along the inside and off the pace, came two to four wide on the far turn before angling out into the stretch
but a mild run is all he could come up with. SOCIETY JOE tracked outside the two leaders, moved up inside the winner to bid midway on the far turn and
hung in until the three sixteenths pole but faded from there. POLYDEUCES pressed the leader around the first turn, took over on the backside and held until
challenged midway on the far turn, retreating down the stretch when tiring. SUPPLICATION sat along the rail and off the pace, trailed on the far turn and
never put in a run. NORTH BATTLEFORD brushed with a rival at the start, led under pressure on the first turn, dropped back to track the pacesetter along
the inside and retreated from midway far turn to the wire.

Footnotes
SWINGING MANDY raced in midpack in the two and three-paths with cover down the backstretch, angled out to be widest at the 1/4 pole, rallied in the
stretch and was up in time. THATSITTHATSALL broke alertly, stalked the pacesetter while racing three-wide on the opening turn, commenced a duel
nearing the half-mile pole, took a short lead with 3/8ths left to race, dueled hard down the stretch and was very game to the wire. LOIS LEN got out to set
the pace, dueled from the half-mile pole while saving ground into the stretch and fought hard in vain. KEEP IT NEAT dropped back to trail the field on the
opening turn, saved ground throughout and finished gamely on the inside. STREGA stalked the pace while racing a bit rank early, tracked the dueling trio
down the backstretch, raced in the two-path on the far turn and chased down the stretch. SILENT RESENT was taken back early but grabbed a hold and
pulled the ride while rushing up four-wide, dueled down the backstretch, remained in contention to the top of the stretch but weakened down the lane.

ST. PADDY'S DADDY raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, launched a determined stretch drive and was just up. I
HAVE HOPE stalked the pace from the rail, angled three-wide late on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, posted a strong drive but just missed
at the wire. UNDEFILED stalked the pace racing two-wide throughout, forced the issue on the second bend, challenged mid turn, shook clear into the
stretch, was under an all out drive to the wire but failed to contain the top two finishers in the final yards. COUSIN ROB was pinched back leaving the gate,
stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late on the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. SON OF MY FATHER
settled in mid pack, raced four-wide throughout, closed on the far turn but leveled off mid stretch. KING OF GYPSIES was steadied at the outset and settled
off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. KOMUNIST raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn, chased
into the stretch and while unable to threaten did showed some interest. PAPERBACK HERO was steadied at the start and settled off the pace, angled from
the rail to three-wide on the first turn, was hustled four-wide on the far turn, tipped out further at the top of the stretch and closed a gap. DR. JEWEL led
quickly, set a pressured pace, was engaged midway through the far turn, was all out to the stretch but gave way. DOC FISHMAN bumped with
PATERNOSTER leaving the gate, raced from off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the final turn but never reached contention.
PATERNOSTER was bumped at the break and settled off the pace, rode the rail throughout but never reached contention. SOUPER BEST BET, in range
early, raced three-wide on both turn, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally. JUSTALITTLEHYPER raced two-wide in mid pack, dropped back on
the final turn and lacked a closing response.
