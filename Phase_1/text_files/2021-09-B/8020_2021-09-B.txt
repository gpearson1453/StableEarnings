Footnotes
AZURE FIRE settled back toward the inside, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the six path nearing the top of the stretch, dug in for
the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND broke awkwardly then drifted to the four path into the first turn, bid leaving the
half mile pole, closed the gap in the four path of the far turn and dueled for second mid-stretch, then flattened later yards. SALTY J J took the lead at the rail
into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from that point and contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn, drew clear into the stretch but was caught mid-stretch and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. GHOST MINE saved early
ground, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE raced with the
pace two deep and challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from that point and contested at a close disadvantage still two deep on
the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and gave way. SASSY RICK was carried to the five path into the first turn and made an outside bid past the
half mile pole, then saved ground on the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MISS WAVE stalked two deep and raced at even terms with ETERNAL HEART leaving the half mile pole, contested the edge toward the three eighths pole,
dueled clear midway on the far turn then drew off under steady stretch encouragement, while the latter, set the pace inside, was met into the backstretch
and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. HERETODAYGONMANANA
saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the turn at the rail then ran evenly in the stretch. THELADYISTRUE rated close
to the early pace inside, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. KATALIMA settled
back off the rail on the opening turn and entered the backstretch outside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four path then weakened. JAMESTOWN ROAD stalked in the three path the first turn then setteled close into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, though, faded in the three path of the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
AMIDSHIPS tapered to the inside to set the pace, came under a little pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole to edge away from JUNGLE BEAST toward
the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was in hand most of the stretch, while the latter rounded the opening turn about the four path then stalked
into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, but dropped back toward the quarter, ran at the rail on the far turn and settled for second
best. MOVED BY JUBA settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further.
SUGAR LIPS entered the first turn in the five path and raced outside leaving the turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail and showed little more. STORMIN ROCKET raced boxed in through the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then
flattened in the four path of the far turn. JUBA'S MONEY HONEY came through the first turn in the three path and never factored. OWEN'S MAGIC saved
ground. BOUGHT BY DIVA stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened approaching the far
turn. ROCKING TO HOME rounded the first turn about the five path and showed little response through the backstretch. This race was hand timed.

C V'S POWERPAK settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, closed to the lead two deep midway
on the far turn, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER was bumped leaving the gate then saved
ground racing well back from early contention, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the four path of the far turn and took over
second mid-stretch, but was vanned off post race. CHEESE LOUISE stalked two deep then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod
approaching the five sixteenths, raced clear past the quarter but was caught at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and flattened. C
V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn near the rail, angled to the four path approaching
the top of the stretch and finished evenly. ARROWWOOD stalked from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far
turn. VINTAGE GIN rated the early pace inside, was pressured at the seven sixteenths pole then headed nearing the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on

Footnotes
HANDSOME JOANIE settled off the early pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran two deep on the turn, rallied to the front in later yards and was
drawing off toward the wire. SPLIT THE CHECK cleared rivals to her inside and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the eighth
pole but was caught in later yards. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and came along
to take third the final strides. MARY BOPPINS TOO chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the eighth pole
but was nipped from third the final strides. COOK THE BOOKS gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn then flattened in the lane. LILBITSOFDRAMA
chased, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened. DAFFYDILL saved ground.
