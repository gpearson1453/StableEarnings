Footnotes
CONCRETE GLORY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. C C'S
KITTEN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader, into the stretch, then drifted in, could not threaten the winner
and closed well for the place. OVERTHOUGHT well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and edged up for
the show. STUDYLONGSTDYWRONG well placed and between rivals, angled in to save ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, angled out for clear racing room and weakened late. TITANIC ROSE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest
into the stretch and had no rally. MASTER stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader
and had no rally.

well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and flattened out. JESSE JONES chassed the pace,
moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. BUSCH LATTE allowed to settle, saved ground through
the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and improved his position. KID RUSSELL ran evenly. HARD TARGET stalked the pace on the
outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong. DIAMANT was no

SO MOXIE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. STARSHIP
PRANKSTER mid pack, moved up into the turn, gained position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, edged up for the place and held.
SIDE ACTION well placed and between, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
missed the place. MATCHA allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and evened out. BLUEBERRY
DUDETTE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and weakened the final furlong. DUPLICATED mid pack, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and ran evenly in the lane. SOK FURY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn,
angled widest in the stretch and flattened out. KATIE'S LAST DANCE well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into
the stretch and faded the final furlong. THIS LITTLE KITTY improved her position. LISTO SHARP was a brief factor. SMART SALSITA drifted out into the
stretch and was outrun.

WATCH ME TANGO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear and held under steady pressure. KEYPIT
stalked the pace on the outside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no match for that
one and held the place safe. ON A TOUR allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled
out, made a steady gain and missed the place. CRAZY DELIGHT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and evened out. MOMS LOVE tracked the pace well back, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch and
had a mild gain. MAGIC FINNISH ran evenly, outside. PRAIRIE CITIZEN was never involved.
