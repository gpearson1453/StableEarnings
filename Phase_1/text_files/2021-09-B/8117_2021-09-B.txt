Footnotes
LILLY BABE bumped with HALF PAST TWELVE at the start, tracked at the back off the inside went four wide into the lane, rallied outside the leader and
collared that foe with a sixteenth remaining and won going away. SALLY STANFORD sped clear quickly to take control, led two wide into the turn, eased
out to the four path around the bend, put to right-handed urging in the final furlong, was collared at the sixteenth pole and stayed on for second. HALF PAST
TWELVE bumped with LILLY BABE at the start, chased three then four wide on the turn, lacked a late bid but held the show. ALLWINEDUP chased two to
three wide around the bend and could not offer the needed response when called upon.

Footnotes
PERFECTO AMOR away quickly from outside, pressed the pace early, lost contact briefly nearing the five-eighths then went up to challenge again,
challenged and took the lead on the turn, cleared approaching the five-sixteenths, drew away in upper stretch and remained clear under urging. MAYHEM
AND CHAOS sat off the pace early on, advanced four then five wide around the turn and bested the rest. ME MACHO was bothered by SHARDIAL drifting
out a bit early then dropped to the back, went three wide into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the stretch, summoned a mild response and
finished a clear third. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP drifted in and bumped a rival early, stalked the top pair outside a rival, navigated the turn three then four
wide and weakened. MARINO HEAT got bumped from outside early, chased along the inside through the turn and weakened. HERE'S MY POINT got
bumped on both sides early, chased off the inside, driven three wide into the stretch, came up empty in the lane and was eased late. SHARDIAL showed
speed along the inside and drifted out a bit early, set the pace with a rival alongside, lost contact with the winner approaching the five-sixteenths pole, tired
in the drive and was eased late.

Footnotes
NICE ICE jumped out to an early lead from inside, showed the way to the far turn, remained confidently handled to the stretch, put to a mild hand urging in
the lane and drew off to win easily in hand. KRISTI'S TIGER broke out and bumped rival at the start, saved ground through both turns and rallied for the
place. WARRIOR'S MOON got bumped between foes at the start, chased four wide into the lane and lacked a late bid. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH settled off
the pace outside a rival, angled five wide on the second bend and could not rally. LITTLE MISS ELLIE got brushed from inside at the start, traveled three
deep into the first turn then chased the speed outside a rival, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. STARSHIP DEFIANT veered out in the
beginning, angled back to the inside around the clubhouse turn, went two wide into the second bend, eased out to the four path and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CRASH CORRIGAN raced in range while widest early on, chased four then five wide around the turn, rallied from outside and battled outside the top pair in
deep stretch and got up late. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER stalked behind the top pair up the backstretch, waited for room around the turn, found a seam at the
top of the stretch and bid between runners, fought into the final furlong inside the leader, took over at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner.
HEAD FOR BUSINESS dueled outside PICK YOUR BID for the lead, led three wide into the stretch, maintained a short advantage into the furlong grounds,
relinquished control with a sixteenth to go and stayed on between runners late. ZERO DOWN was forwardly placed early on outside a rival, stayed within
striking distance four wide into the stretch, lost his path behind the leader nearing the eighth pole and flattened to a minor award. SOTTOCAPO chased off
the inside, exited the bend four wide, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked further response. PICK YOUR BID dueled for command from inside into and
around the turn, fought into the lane then weakened in the drive. DEVIL BE ME came away slow in the beginning, angled out and came four wide into the
stretch and failed to menace. MOON CIRCUMFERENCE sat off the pace in the early going, went two then three wide around the turn, moved out at the top
of the stretch and was never a factor.

lead over MISS FIA in the drive but yielded in the late stages. QUEENGOL tracked three wide around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and went evenly
late for the show. REV RITA angled to the inside then was sent to press the pace, lost contact with the pacesetter into the turn, chased along the inside then
two wide into the stretch and weakened. MALIBU MISTRESS tracked widest up the backstretch, took the turn four wide and weakened. LIV AND LET LIV

Footnotes
SALAH showed early speed three deep into the first turn, moved back to a stalking position while outside a rival, pursued the leader three wide through the
far turn, drew alongside in upper stretch and took over near the three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear of CIBERTRUCK and drew away in the final furlong.
FULL DRAW dropped back early, advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch, rallied in the stretch run but was not enough
to threaten the winner. SILENT MUSKETIER got bumped from inside at the start, settled off the rail, went three to four wide on the second turn, tipped out in
upper stretch and gained the show. CIBERTRUCK broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, went four deep into the first turn then cleared into the
backstretch, inched away in the middle stages, showed the way two wide into the drive, was overtaken near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. HE
BE DANGEROUS raced between foes into the first turn, dropped back off the pace to stalk out of range, chased in the two path to the drive and failed to
rally. CAPPER vied for command from the rail into the first turn, ceded control leaving the that bend, tracked along the inside to the stretch, moved out in the
lane and weakened. W. WHITEHOUSE angled in for the first turn, moved to the two path for the second bend, trailed into the lane and made no impact.

Footnotes
LIVINGMYBESTLIFE sprinted to the front from inside to establish the front, led two to three wide around the turn, held a comfortable advantage into the
furlong grounds, roused inside the eighth pole and remained clear. STELLA NOIR chased off the inside, four to five wide around the bend, finished willingly
through the final furlong and whittle the gap late. GINJA was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, took aim four wide leaving
the bend, could not summon the needed response and kept on to save the show honors. FOREST CARAWAY tracked off the inside, outside a rival on the
turn, angled six wide into the lane and lacked a bid. PIZZAZZ raced in range two wide into the turn, trailed three wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
STRADARI chased the speed outside a rival, bid alongside into the turn, grabbed the lead midway around the turn, fought with BACK BEAUTY in the drive,
put away that rival approaching the furlong grounds and staved off the late kick from DURGA in deep stretch. DURGA chased along the inside then steered
out to the three path leaving the bend, lacked room in upper stretch and angled quickly to the inside, finished well inside the top pair and gained the place.
BACK BEAUTY tracked outside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, went four into the turn, exited five wide while putting in a bid, fought to the eighth pole
and flattened to third. DARLING DEMON was moving around as the gate opened and came away a step slow, tracked off the rail, went two wide around the
turn, moved out in the stretch and kept on for a minor award. THANKS got forced in and bumped ISLAND LIFE early, angled to the rail around the turn and
passed tired rivals. MAGGIE'S MAGIC cleared from outside and crossed over, challenged from outside into the turn, relinquished the lead midway around
the bend, fought into the lane and weakened. STREET FLYER trailed early while widest, came six wide into the stretch and was not a factor. ISLAND LIFE
got bumped by THANKS early, raced between rivals then three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend and weakened.
