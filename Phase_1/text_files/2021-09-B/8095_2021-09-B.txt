GRACE'S DRAMA was outrun early, cut the corner rallying through a huge opening at the top of the stretch, drifted out wresting command inside REAL
DOOZIE late and edged away. REAL DOOZIE set the pace well off the rail, drifted out weakening in deep stretch and could not withstand the winner. SHE
TAKES HEART pursued REAL DOOZIE from outside to the stretch, and could not gain late. LEVY LAND saved ground outsprinted to the turn, moved out
five wide approaching the stretch, and made no impact on the far outside. JOST SAYIN never reached contention while racing wide. DANA GRACE was
finished early three wide.

ALECKA STAR set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and widened under a drive. HIGH SPEED STEF pressed the winner two wide, could not
keep pace with that foe nearing the lane but held well enough to save second. GRAND AVE GIRL chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in
the lane and lacked a rally. MAGNA COLORS was well back inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. FUTURE FLAY had
brief speed inside. HAPPY SUCCESS played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
WORLD GONE WILD was unhurried early inside, moved out coming off the turn, finished determinedly and collared R LOVE ON THE RUN from outside in
time. R LOVE ON THE RUN popped clear out of the gate, sailed along well in front to the stretch, remained clear 70 yards out but could not hang on.
PRETZEL broke a step slowly, raced four to five wide around the turn, and was along for the show. PIPER was a step slow to begin and outsprinted to the
turn outside, moved in around the turn, and improved mildly for the last major share. VIVI'S DREAM'S chased two to three wide to the top of the stretch, and
weakened. GREGS POSSE never factored three to four wide. VIVA LA REINA pursed the pacesetter to the turn, and tired after three-eighths of a mile.
THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LOVE HER LOTS bobbled at the break, stalked the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch, steadily gained outside of the pacesetter and was up and clear
late. PERFECT PROVISION set a clear pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. MADEFORSUMMER prompted the pace in the three path and was
one-paced through the lane. WANDERING checked nearing the five-eighths pole, raced four wide and had a mild rally. VINTAGE GIRL was outrun inside.
KELLY BAG played no factor while racing two wide. THATAINT TOOSHABBY broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace four wide and faded through the
lane.

Footnotes
LORD DARNLEY raced close up early, took over around the turn in the two-path, and widened through the stretch kept to pressure. HILLBILLY advanced
after six furlongs in the four-path, could not menace the winner into the stretch, and saved the place. BYE BYE DAVID shifted out five wide coming off the
turn, and ran through the stretch one-paced outside. SUPER TRIPLE argued the early pace outside, and gave way around the turn. JOHNNIE GOT JETS
dropped far back inside before reaching the stretch, and jogged in. HIGH PRESS veered in sharply, crashed into the temporary rail and unseated the rider
leaving the chute, galloped around the course, was apprehended and escorted off. HE AIN'T NO SAINT became fractious in the chute prior to the start,
veered in sharply and unseated the rider shortly after the start, galloped around the course, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO BOTH INCIDENTS DURING THE EARLY RUNNING BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

RACE DAY SPEED settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, kicked in outside, took over
near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. MIZZEN saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole, rallied inside of the winner, bid between
foes near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. SWEET PENELOPE set as clear pace inside, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. APPOINTED was
reluctant to load, tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. BATTLE CRY failed to menace while racing three wide. PERFECT KIMBERLY S was
fractious in gate, raced four wide and never threatened. KARATBARS chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. HIGH GLORY was fractious
in the gate and had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
ABHAR vied early inside BIG RED STYLE, disposed of that rival after three furlongs, and widened through the stretch under pressure. BRONX saved
ground outsprinted early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied to go clear for the place. LUCA DREW THE ACE bumped with
FORTIFIED at the start, got out steadily past the quarter-pole to be seven or eight wide, straightened out through the lane and finished with some interest to
best the others. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES chased after the leaders three wide to the stretch, and tired. FORTIFIED bumped with LUCA DREW THE ACE at the
start, and faded two wide after three-eighths of a mile. BIG RED STYLE hustled up and vied early outside ABHAR, could not keep pace with that one on the
turn, and tired. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
