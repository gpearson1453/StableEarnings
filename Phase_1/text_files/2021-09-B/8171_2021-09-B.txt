PURPLE SHIRT was five wide into the first turn, then was reserved early on the backstretch, made a five wide move on the far turn, hit the front leaving the
turn and had a long drive with PARKER in the stretch and prevailed late. PARKER stalked the pace three to four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and
vied for command leaving the turn but was outfinished in a game effort. JINGLE was rated along early on the inside, shifted off the rail nearing the quarter
pole and came six wide into the drive and finished willingly. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. ASTROMAN
was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive but lacked a rally. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY vied for the lead two wide and weakened. IT'S THE
SUNRISE was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and tired. SUNDAY DRIVE was being handled at the start causing him to be off slowly,
then rushed up on the inside and tired, was declared a non starter. The stewards posted the Inquiry concerning the start, after reviewing the replays

Footnotes
NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS set a unchallenged pace while racing in the two path, then drew out leaving the quarter pole and was kept to mild pressure to
prove much the best. DRINKATTHECREEK chased the early pace then tracked the pace three wide, made a mild bid entering the far turn but proved to be
no match for the winner while clearly second best. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace five wide and came into
the drive five wide but offered no rally while besting the rest. RUSSIAN INFLUENCE was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn but offered no
late rally while saving ground. TO FAT TO FISH was void of early speed, passed the tiring rivals. BREWSKY stalked the pace two wide and tired.
SOUTHERN SMILE was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the drive and had no response. The six furlong fractional time was not available

LEAVE IT TO KITTEN set the early pressured pace three wide, then went on to be clear at the nine sixteenths pole while still in the three path, then dueled
for command on the turn and made another bid leaving the turn to gain a short advantage by the furlong marker, then was kept to right handed crop urging
to prove best. BRIAR JUMPER was well placed early and then made a inside bid on the turn to duel for command with the winner but was outfinished in the
stretch while saving the place. EL CHEAPO was well rated along the inside to past the quarter pole, then tipped out three wide when leaving the turn for aim
at the front runners, then was gaining late between rivals. MARV'S MAGIC was allowed to settle and was five wide on the backstretch, came six wide into
the drive, drifted out in the lane while having a mild late gain. TEXAS GANO was reserved early, then was four wide by the quarter pole, then had to angle in
late for room and offered some late gain but needed more. NOT VERY GENTLE lacked a rally. WILSHIRE DIAMOND pressed the pace three to four wide
and weakened.

Footnotes
DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was bumped at the start, then was well placed early in the pocket two to three wide, shifted out and made a four wide bid
leaving the quarter pole, then edged clear late to prove best under a drive. MANUELITO was allowed to settle early, then was three wide by the quarter pole
while unwinding, then angled in by the furlong marker and closed well on the inside. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY dueled for the early lead and made a three
wide bid on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn and was still clear by the furlong marker but was caught in deep stretch, bested rest. CIELO BLU chased
the early pace on the inside, then was shuffled back on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and had a belated rally while under heavy crop urging.
GOOD SUGAR chased the early pace in between horses and weakened. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE was rated along early and then made a five wide move on
the turn but came up empty in the drive. COLONEL HUBERT dueled for the early lead two wide and weakened. ROYAL ICING was not a factor.

Footnotes
NORTH COUNTY was bumped at the start, then was well rated while three wide throughout, then waited for racing room leaving the turn, then once found
room split rivals leaving the three sixteenths and quickly responded and hit the front leaving the furlong marker, then drew out smartly to prove much the
best under hand urging. SWIZZLECITY vied for the lead and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole and shook clear leaving the turn, but proved to
be no match for the winner while second best. PARIS KENTUCKY stalked the slow pace four wide, made a five wide bid leaving the quarter pole but
flattened out, held show award. ZIPSY ROSE LEE broke inward at the start, then was reserved three wide early, came five wide into the drive and offered a
belated rally. TUNNEL was well placed on the inside, then was boxed in on the rail by the quarter pole, swung out three wide for the drive but had no rally.
DIRTY NELLIE lacked a rally. ULTIMATE MISSION vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. SCARTINI MARTINI was taken back early and dropped to
the inside early, then had no response.
