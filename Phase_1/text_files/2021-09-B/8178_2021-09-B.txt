Footnotes
MS PENELOPEPITSTOP set the pace along the three path, two path into the turn, took the rail leaving it, opened up a lengthy lead and was under the whip
to the late stages while drifting out. RED PRIESTESS well placed, gained along the three path into the lane, chased and then held the place.
BOOMKITTYBYEBYE never far back along the rail, eased out into the lane and rallied. MULIMBIMBY unhurried four wide, continued four wide into lane and
made a mild late bid. COMING STORM unhurried two from the rail into the turn, three path out of if and made a mild bid. PALS SARATOGA GAL tracked
five wide, three path on the turn and weakened. KASTANYAS broke a step slow, saved ground, was outrun. CAROLS WAY tracked early, saved ground on
the turn and tired. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE four wide on the turn and tired.
