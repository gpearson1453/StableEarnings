NOT ORBINARY allowed to settle, moved to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off the
final furlong, jumping shadows late and holding. LACEE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the
stretch, then could not threaten the winner and closed well for the place. TULA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. SECRET OR NOT well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came
through inside and weakened in the stretch. LIL H was a brief factor, inside. AT LEAST tracked the pace and faded inside through the turn.

TACTICAL PAJAMAS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
NURSE JUDY tracked the pace, ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, then could not gain the final furlong and held the
pace safe. RED VENUS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and edged up for the
show. GRAND MAMOO stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. MIDSHIP LADY well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had
no rally. LIMONATA ran evenly. COURTED was no factor.

Footnotes
SIDE ACTION tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain, shook clear
late, then lasted under steady pressure. SATCH allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out
for clear racing room, made a steady gain and missed. NOT SHY well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside
the leader into the stretch, weakened late and held the show. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE sprinted to a clear lead while pulling, held sway to the furlong
marker, then weakened late and held a share. MATCHA mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened
out. SOK FURY ran evenly. TAP SOLO well placed, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch and
weakened. DAYLIGHTS AWASTIN hesitated at the start, tired inside. THIS LITTLE KITTY showed little, insdie. EMPIRE TROLLEY was never involved.
