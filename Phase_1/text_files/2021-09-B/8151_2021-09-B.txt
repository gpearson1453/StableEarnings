the lane and gained show. WHYNOTGEORGIA advanced late on the backstretch and took over a slim lead, vied around the turn then steadily weakened
through the lane. VANORA sped to the lead at the start, got collared near the seven-sixteenths pole and steadily faded.

STARZAN rated off the pressured pace in the opening quarter, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn, took closer order then accelerated in the
furlong grounds, poked a head in front approaching the sixteenth pole and edged away. DISCREET DEMONS lacked speed and raced in the back,
continued well off the pace and rode the rail around the turn, shifted out at the eighth pole then closed with response. MINEHUNTER dueled for the early
lead racing between foes, battled gamely outside of MR. ATLANTICO into final furlong, failed to move on with winner in late stages and weakened to show.
MR. ATLANTICO vied inside of rivals in opening stages, battled on gamely for the lead with MINEHUNTER into the lane then failed to keep pace in the final
sixteenth. NEW EVERY MORNING vied three deep in opening stages, remained forwardly placed around then turn then faded in the lane. IOWA KID raced
in range and chased after the top trio around the turn then tired in the drive.

four wide through the lane and finished second best. PERFECT D tracked the top two early leaders, was ridden along three wide into the lane then
sustained a steady bid for to prevail for a share. MOJAVE saved ground through early stages then tipped out a path midway around the turn, got in tight
when LOCHNESS came in a path approaching the eighth pole, steadied and chased on evenly. LOCHNESS vied with the winner for the early lead, could
not maintain equal terms mid-way around the turn, went three wide into the lane then drifted in a path causing things to tighten up approaching the eighth
pole and weakened. MIDNIGHT LUCK raced in the back, was ridden along two wide into the lane and failed to move on. TIZ MANNY chased three wide
around the turn, came out wider for the drive and had no late response. SHARK HARBOR chased in range on the inside, saved ground into the lane then

HOUSE OF LORDS was allowed to settle through the backstretch then picked up the pace leaving the three eighths pole, circled up closer four wide near
the quarter pole, launched a bid for CHRISTINE'S JACK at the head of the lane, dug in two wide under pressure, gained the edge at the sixteenth pole then
kicked clear. CHRISTINE'S JACK vied for the early lead with RINGS OF SATURN, shook free midway through the backstretch, kept clear around the far
turn, fought back when challenged by HOUSE OF LORDS past the furlong marker then failed to kick on for the win. AUDACE tracked the top two early
leaders, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out a path wider entering the lane then churned on for show. RATE FOR ME raced in the last flight on the
inside, waited for a clear path late on the far turn then given cue two wide in the upper stretch and chased on evenly. MUNCEY raced in the second flight
outside a foe, was ridden along three wide around the turn and failed to kick on under pressure. R B EYE raced between rivals in the last flight and had no
response when called upon. RINGS OF SATURN vied for the early lead with CHRISTINE'S JACK, could not match strides midway through the backstretch
but remained forwardly placed then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
COASTAL KID raced three wide around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, prompted to go after SPITTIN IMAGE at the three
eighths pole, vied for the lead around the far turn, accelerated once clear past the furlong marker and stayed sharp under steady urging. STAY FANTASTIC
tracked the leader through early stages, launched a three wide near the quarter pole, stayed on four wide into the lane and finished with response to gain
place. SPITTIN IMAGE sped to the lead at the start and continued on top through the backstretch, took on the challenge from COASTAL KID with three
furlongs left to run, vied around the far turn, could not move on with eventual winner past upper stretch and weakened to show. UNMACHABLE raced three
wide around the first turn then settled off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. STAND TO settled nicely and
tracked the top trio through the backstretch, prompted to pick up the pace on the far turn and failed to respond. SHERM saved ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
BAYAKOAS IMAGE sped to the lead at the start then quickly took on the challenge from BRILLIANT BIRD, vied for the lead through the backstretch and
battled on into the lane, dug in gamely under pressure and held a slight edge at the furlong marker, stayed on gamely from the inside and refused to let
BRILLIANT BIRD by. BRILLIANT BIRD came out three to four wide heading into the first turn then moved up to engage BAYAKOAS IMAGE for the early
lead, dueled outside of rival through the backstretch and battled on into the lane, dug in gamely but could not get by the winner. MS LYNN tracked then
embattled pair through the backstretch then hustled up two wide around the far turn, sustained a steady bid near the inside through the lane and prevailed
for a share. BLAZINGBELLABLU raced in the second flight outside a foe through early stages then launched a bid around the far turn, hustled along three
wide into the lane and lacked the needed kick for serious impact. DONTKISSNTELL settled through early stages near the inside, angled out and ridden
along around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. REA MEA rated off the second flight, hustled up four wide around the far
turn and failed to move on. JACANA saved ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
LT. BULLITT sped to the lead out of the gate, showed the way through the opening quarter and held firm around the turn, was set down three wide for the
drive, had more left in reserve and held clear. SENOR FABULOSO raced off the early pace, advanced along the outside around the turn, sustained a steady
bid for the leader into the lane, could not reach the winner but finished clearly second best. JAZZ STORY was forwardly placed through early stages and
remained up close around the turn, went three wide into the lane and churned on for a share. RAISE THE STAKES raced off the pace, came four wide into
the lane then angled in a couple paths and passed tiring foes. HE'S BANDIDO raced in early contention, lost position around the turn then had no late
response. CHUKIT failed to move into close contention. SALTY DAN was briefly fractious in the gate then came away slowly, saved ground into the lane
and never threatened. R N' R ATTHE BEACH was placed forwardly along the rail around the turn then came up empty in the lane.
