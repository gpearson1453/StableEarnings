DERBYS MONEYMAKER shifted outside shortly after leaving the chute, circled rivals on the turn, made the lead three wide near the furlong marker and
finished full of run to win going away. LONESOME PHIL made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch in the two path and held on for
second. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER close up from the start, inched closer along the inside into the stretch, struck the rail past the three sixteenths pole,
checked and altered course to the three path at the furlong marker and just missed getting up for second. O'HAIRE pressed the pace two wide and faded in
the stretch. BUBBA checked leaving chute then was no threat. TOP BOMB stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half.

IDOWHATIDO never far back, closed willingly in the four path into the stretch, made the lead past the furlong maker and drew off under a strong hand ride.
MAKING ME CRAZY trailed, swung wide, closed fast in the middle of the racetrack and got up for second. THECHROMEWEKNOW bore in at the start
bumping a rival, stalked the pace and went evenly three wide. LADY'S BOY made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until mid stretch, drifted in late
and weakened. KING RICHIE was bumped at the start, advanced along the rail into the stretch then lacked room nearing the wire. HURRICANE NATION
had brief speed. DIAMOND PATRIOT wouldn't load, pressed the pace two wide for a half then stopped abruptly.
