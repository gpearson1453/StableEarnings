Footnotes
WILD TEXAS TOM advanced along the inside after a half-mile, moved out between horses to challenge five-sixteenths out, battled outside BILLY YANK
through upper stretch and edged clear through the late stages. BILLY YANK set the pace in the two-path, fought back when hooked by WILD TEXAS TOM
turning for home, yielded in deep stretch and was clearly second best. MR. EINSTEIN tracked outside the leaders early, loomed a threat four wide on the
turn, but flattened out into the lane. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE bumped with SANDY DUDE at the start, saved ground and lacked the needed closing response.
SANDY DUDE bumped with HIGHJUMP CHARLIE at the start, and raced in midpack throughout while two to three wide. NEVERENOUGHCOCO was no
factor inside. OVERSTATED was always outrun. TEXAS PLAYBOY prompted the pace for a half-mile, and retreated on the turn. FROZEN ASSETS was
finished early outside.

Footnotes
ALADO set a clear pace along the rail, held clear past the sixteenth pole then just lasted. TRIPLE JEOPARDY stalked the winner two wide in the clear, kept
trying while unable to initially gain and was closing fast late. MISTER LEONARDO saved ground off the early pace, advanced outside down the backstretch,
bid three wide nearing the lane but was unable to keep pace with the top two in the stretch. CARAMEL CHIP broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two
wide early, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a rally. PALEMMA chased the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. BRACCIO DI FERRO
had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
CREATE AGAIN took control after the start, rated along inside to the stretch and widened under a drive. MO HAWK chased outside the winner around the
turn, had aim into the stretch but could not threaten while staying on his left lead. MAGIC ECLIPSE raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not
gain on his left lead in the stretch. ANOTHER DUKE broke out into OCEAN RIDE, saved ground outrun for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and had
only a mild response. FUEGO CALIENTE raced two wide on the turn, and was one-paced through the stretch inside. REBELDE broke awkwardly, moved
off the inside to the four-path around the turn, and never menaced. OCEAN RIDE was bumped and bothered by ANOTHER DUKE at the start, showed
speed for a half-mile three wide, and tired.

Footnotes
SCIENCE was ridden along through the turn, swung five wide beginning to advance coming to the top of the stretch, rallied steadily to catch BRIGHT AND
SHINY from outside in deep stretch and drew clear. J D'S VISTA stumbled at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, moved out rallying in the stretch and
finished with good energy on her left lead. BRIGHT AND SHINY vied outside rivals early, drew clear after a half and shifted inward, stayed on her left lead
through the lane and shortened stride late. BELLA SOFI contested the early pace between horses, and gave way after a half. MARIMBA eyed the battling
threesome up front entering the turn, had aim four wide at the top of the stretch, but could not gain. TRINNI GIRLS broke slowly and was outrun early inside,
moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and passed tired horses. MAVI raced outside in the second flight throughout. LUNA AMARILLA vied early
inside two rivals, and was through after a half. CRESTA CELERINA brushed with UNDERCOVER OUTLAW at the start, and was always outrun. PALOMA
MIA raced three to four wide, and tired after a half. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW brushed with CRESTA CELERINA at the start, and was far back throughout.
TRINNI BEAUTY broke a step slow, rushed up and steadied soon after that, stopped after a half, and was easing up through the stretch.

Footnotes
KRAMDEN stalked the pace two wide, gained steadily through the final furlong and was up late. SASSY BUT SMART set the pace along the rail, drifted out
a bit nearing the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. EASY STRIDE was bumped at the start then shuffled back soon after, raced off the pace three wide,
angled in midway around the far turn, angled back out in upper stretch and closed strongly. MARISA'S MISSION saved ground in range, angled out near the
quarter pole, stayed on but was outkicked in the lane. EXPRESS PHAROAH stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, angled in to save ground in
range around the far turn, had a clear path through the lane and lacked the needed rally. BUFFALO MAX bumped with EASY STRIDE at the start, saved
ground off the pace and never threatened. FARM STRONG chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. POWER (BRZ) raced four wide and was
through early.

Footnotes
MENELIK set the early pace near the inside, shook away on the turn, and was driving to remain in command. REDJACK chased outside the winner to the
stretch, stayed on his left lead and saved the place. GIVE ME TWO STEPS broke inward, saved ground close up to the stretch, and weakened on the rail.
CREATIVE CHOICE raced between horses entering the turn, had the three-path approaching the lane and made no headway. SUPER SNIPER bumped
with CAPTAIN at the start, lagged well back inside for a half-mile, cut the corner putting in a run turning for home, then flattened out staying on his left lead.
LINE OF HONOR bumped with SMILING TEUFLES at the break, then steadied between that one and GIVE ME TWO STEPS, raced far back to the stretch,
and passed tired horses. SMILING TEUFLES delayed the start difficult to load, bumped with LINE OF HONOR coming out, and retired early. CAPTAIN
bumped with SUPER SNIPER at the start, raced four wide around the turn, and never menaced. ZIGGY showed little three to four wide. DOS VAQUEROS
chased outside early, and tired on the turn three wide.

LOUDER THAN BOMBS tracked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead.
FREEDOM MATTERS set the pace along the rail, kicked clear nearing the lane, led to midstretch and battled on inside of the winner from there. NEW
YEAR was squeezed back nearing the first turn, saved ground off the pace, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, continued on the left lead
in the lane and gained the show. CAUSALISTIC raced off the early pace three wide, advanced inside around the far turn but was one-paced in the lane.
GEMONTEER chased the pace three and four wide and never threatened. SHANANIES PAYNTER chased the pace two wide, came up empty in the lane,
and was vanned off after the finish. ROBINTAKINCHARGE prompted the pace three wide and tired after a half. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR pressed the pace
two wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SMALL HOPE tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide turning for home, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. GOLDEN DECISION raced off the
early pace two wide, advanced inside around the far turn and rallied inside of foes in the lane to gain the place late. GRAN MALBEC stalked the pace two
wide, took the lead turning for home, led through most of the stretch and yielded between the top two late. SOUPER JAGUAR set the pace along the rail,
was collared turning for home, battled on past the eighth pole and weakened a bit late. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground off the
pace and had a mild belated rally. TIMMY M. failed to menace while racing three wide. FARLEY tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the
lane. ITALIAN CHARM was outrun inside.
