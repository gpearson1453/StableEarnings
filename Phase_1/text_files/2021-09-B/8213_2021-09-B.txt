stretch. WOO HOO chased the early pace while three wide on the turn, made a bid but came up empty in late stretch. GOOD LIQUOR was inside then shut
off and steadied off heels on backstretch when AUNT JOIE crowded her into the rail, dropped back and was no menace in the stretch. PHARME'S
PHINALE was inside and faltered. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN raced five wide into the turn making a bid then flattened out in the stretch. SIP was through
early and stopped. A steward's inquiry was held concerning the run down the backstretch. After reviewing the film's, the steward's disqualified AUNT JOIE
