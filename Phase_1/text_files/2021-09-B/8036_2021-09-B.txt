DEBATABLE trailed the field early, took closer order then commenced his bid after the quarter pole, gained steadily outside and drove clear. GRADY'S
SONG loaded without rider, sat just off the pace in the three path, moved up alongside AMIGO QUERIDO with two and a half furlongs remaining, dueled
into the stretch, inched clear of inside rival and was caught late. AMIGO QUERIDO set the pace from off the rail, took pressure through the final turn, dueled
inside of GRADY'S SONG and was out finished. REMAIN CALM saved ground inside, chased the pacesetters, gained late but was unable to improve
position. LORD STANLEY raced four to five wide and faded in the final turn. DRAYTON sat mid pack and tired. ROUGIE BOY tracked while four wide and
was done early.

Footnotes
DANZA UNBRIDLED sandwiched leaving the gate then hustled inside, tracked through the turn, found inside seam at the head of the lane, moved to the
front under urging, and held. DRAGON WING bumped away, chased inside, missed the opportunity to take advantage of the opening when presented at
head of the lane, shifted out to the four path and gained late. LIVING SKY broke in, chased the pacesetters through the turn and improved late under steady
urging. BLINK'S ROCKET vied inside then contested the pace through the far turn, dueled into the lane inside of NICKYGEORGE and weakened late.
YNOTGIVEITAGO chased and showed interest late. NICKYGEORGE vied between foes racing to the turn, dueled into the stretch and gave way with a
furlong remaining. KNOWENTOHOLDUM took back early then hustled four wide leaving the backstretch and passed faders. I AM AN EMPRESS failed to
menace. BIG Z vied four wide for the early lead, was unable to keep pace with the field and tired. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of
DRAGON WING against the rider of DANZA UNBRIDLED alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed after review of the Stewards.

took pressure through the final turn, was overtaken into the stretch and gave way grudgingly inside. AWESOME KNIGHT saved inside and failed to threaten
in drive. BRIOSO unhurried early and passed tiring. RISING REVOLUTION attended the pace while four wide, pressed the issue outside of
PADDSDAYCHARM and wilted abruptly at the head of the stretch. STUMPANATOR vied outside early and faltered.

Footnotes
SPORTSCARR quickly went to the front to secure a rail position, then settled just off the pace from the three path, moved to the front at the quarter pole and
drove clear late. SMILEY set for speed outside then emerged the leader into the backstretch, lead the field to the final turn then was overtaken, continued on
inside and was able to just hold on for place. SMALL TOWN DUDE unhurried early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, bid steadily inside into the
stretch and missed out for place. OUR MONEY CAT fanned five wide into the opening turn, rated off the pace, chased four wide and evened out late.
BLAZING CHANNING tracked inside and lacked a kick. SOCRATES dropped back leaving the opening turn and failed to produce a bid. TANGERINE TAXI
jostled away, was never far back and tired early. KICKEN WEST G. lacked a clear path after leaving the gate and failed to be a factor. PREDESTINED
broke in bumping TANGERINE TAXI, chased outside through the backstretch and faded steadily.
