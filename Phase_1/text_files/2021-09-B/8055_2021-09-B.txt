HIGH SPEED CHASE broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage LORD VADER nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with
that rival and was up in time. LORD VADER pressed the pace from between foes, moved up to take command nearing the seven-sixteenths pole,
responded when challenged by the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with that rival and just missed. NORTH OF THORP was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. GOLDEN FLAME lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. MISTER G. Q. was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.
MEGGY'S AMAZING was off a step slow and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
PULPITS POWER broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by SHOCKAZULU nearing the sixteenth pole, vied
with that rival and proved best in a stiff drive. SHOCKAZULU drifted out through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide through
the second turn to offer a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with the winner but could not get by that foe. FORT YORK was off a step slow, steadied
nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. STREET MOXIE was forwardly placed from the inside
throughout and lacked the needed closing response. MOONLIGHT BLUE was off a step slow, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened
after going a half. DIECI lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. TETON showed brief speed and weakened.

sway to the wire. GEE STREET lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the third turn and finished with a steady bid. TEASPOON OF PEPPER showed
no early speed, saved ground through the turns, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and failed to sustain her rally in the drive. EMMA'S A BEAST
pressed the pace from the inside and gradually gave way. CHIEFS LIL PEARL set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the half
