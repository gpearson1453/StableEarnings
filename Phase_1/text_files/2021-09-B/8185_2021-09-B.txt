Footnotes
WYE MUMBO vied through the opening quarter, took over into the far turn and pulled away while kept to his task. REFI dropped far behind then closed well
along the inside too late. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) broke a step slowly, hustled to the front then weakened. MARTIAL EAGLE trailed early then closed the
gap without menacing. SLEW TANG CLAN lacked speed inside and was never in contention. COMFORTABLY COOL prompted the pace four wide down
the backstretch and faded. J WASS rated close up between rivals and gave way. EL DULZURA forced the leaders to the final turn and stopped.
