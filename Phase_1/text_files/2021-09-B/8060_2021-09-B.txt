TILSA settled behind the loose leader, bid on the final turn then drew off handily in the late stages. LIGHT UP NIGHT dropped far behind then closed well
along the inside through the stretch. AEGEAN SEA quickly took control and widened then came up empty in the stretch. WALK ME HOME saved ground
early, rallied then drifted out badly in the stretch. CHOOSE HAPPINESS trailed for half a mile outside and was never in contention. KERIK dropped back
inside and lacked a response. GINGERS WISH flashed speed then stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

was briefly clear in midstretch but weakened. GOLDENLINEOF prompted the pace outside and yielded through the stretch. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged
far behind then advanced inside closing the gap. COBBLE HILL was urged close up outside then began faltering on the turn. GLACIER EXPRESS raced
wide throughout and lacked a response. SPEED SYNDROME was put to urging on the turn but gave way readily.

the backstretch and was never in contention. STRUM AND PLUCK lagged far back then passed a fading rival. NOBLE ENDEAVOR prompted the winner for

PLAMEN settled close inside, angled out on the final turn, bid, rallied clear then held on gamely winning the tight finish. IRISH RIVIERA lacked speed inside,
moved out in the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by. FAST BOB raced outside off the leaders, moved very wide on the final turn and lane.
MIDLANER stalked the pace outside, led midway on the final turn and weakened in the stretch. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE hustled to a clear advantage early,
stopped on the final turn. EXIT RIGHT moved close up outside for half a mile and faded. MR THRIFTY dropped far behind before half a mile and never a
factor. LUCKY HERO dropped back outside and stopped abruptly.

wide into the stretch, loomed dangerous and continued willingly. TIDDLY WINK lacked speed, moved strongly inside, angled out and offered a mild bid. A
GRAY FOR CAROLYN moved closer inside after half a mile then went evenly late. FACTUM LOVE STYLE trailed far behind then, moved wide with late
energy. CRUISE CONTROL raced far behind then passed rivals without menacing. PREFONTAINE quickly sprinted away, held a long lead by the half but
proved empty in the stretch. MISSED THE BUS broke alertly and chased inside then faded on the final turn. CROSSOVER raced within range briefly then
gave way. SUNSHINE TOMMY prompted the pacesetter in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.
