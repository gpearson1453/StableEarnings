Footnotes
PINK CHANNEL broke out at the start bumping with rival, dropped in to settle on the rail just off the leader through the opening bend, continued to track
inside into the far turn then shifted out three wide while advancing into striking position at the top of the lane and wore down pacesetter to edge foe in the
final yards. K B'S MINT broke well from the inside to dictate the early pace through the opening bend, continued to lead on a minimal margin down the
backstretch, opened up to take a clear lead off the far turn, held a clear lead at the sixteenth pole but failed to match strides with aforementioned winner late
and was caught in the final yards. SMOKING BOSSA NOVA was reserved far back through the opening half, commenced a bid while angling four wide on
the far turn and rallied belatedly through the lane to get up for show. LEFT OF CENTER was unhurried on the inside well back early, shifted out on the far
turn and gained mildly to earn a minor share. METAPHAR was allowed to settle midpack through the opening stages but had no late impact. BRIAR
THICKET tracked the early pace three wide but failed to sustain that speed and weakened in the lane. CHARMING FURY lacked early speed then passed
tiring rivals late. JUST PLAIN PRETTY was allowed to settle three wide through the opening half then failed to menace late. PILOTS STAR was off a bit
slow, settled far back and proved no threat. SHE APPEALS HOLY chased the pace on the inside then faded. HOLY SOUL was bumped at the break, far
back throughout and proved no factor. MAJESTIC STRIDE chased the early pace between foes then gave way past the half mile pole.

Footnotes
CINCO STAR was off well from the outside then attended the early pace set by rival TIN BADGE, commenced a bid nearing the quarter pole and drove
clear of the pacesetter while being much the best. TIN BADGE broke well, sent clear from the outside into the opening bend, led the field into the far turn,
roused at the top of the lane but failed to match strides with CINCO STAR and was clearly second best. TWO BY TWO was unhurried out of the gate while
getting caught three wide into the first bend, moved over to the inside on the backstretch then angled out three wide on the far turn and finished evenly for
show. DERBY CODE tracked the pace on the outside while three wide and failed to kick on in the lane. SONNY SMACK tracked the pace on the rail
through the opening half, continued inside through the far turn and had no rally late. BEAT THE HEAT was well back throughout and proved no threat.
TAPAGE was unhurried early dropping well back and failed to menace late. TWOKO BAY dropped back to trail early, angled four wide far turn and proved
no factor. J P WARRIOR chased the early pace three wide and gave way past the quarter pole.

MINISTER OF SOUL broke well then disputed the early pace of rival MARKET KING down the backstretch, took over when roused just past the five
sixteenths pole and extended the advantage through the lane with mild encouragement. SAMURAI CAUSE tracked the early pace on the rail, shifted out
nearing the top of the stretch and edged foe late for second. MARKET ANALYSIS was allowed to settle well back early, swung out four wide off the far turn
and passed tiring foes late for show. BAYOU GEM was allowed to settle three wide down the backstretch, failed to respond when asked at the quarter pole
and held on for a minor share. MARKET KING forced the pace on the rail down the backstretch and gave way past the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BIG FALCON ROCKET broke well then moved forward quickly to dictate the pace on the inside, continued on a measured advantage into the far turn then
kicked to a clear lead at the furlong marker while under steady right-handed pressure and dug in during the final sixteenth to prevail on the wire. JOHAN
ZOFFANI (IRE) was caught three wide in the first flight on the opening bend, continued just off the early pacesetters down the backstretch then commenced
a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, altered course nearing the furlong marker to avoid DAIGLE and finished willingly late but just missed. EDGIE
REGGIE broke well then attended the pace three wide early, continued just off the leader into the far turn, roused at the three eighths and finished willingly
late to hold third place. ROBINSON was far back in the early going, angled out eight wide at the three sixteenths pole and rallied belatedly in the lane to get
up for fourth. WHERE'S JORDAN was reserved in the early stages, roused to improve past the three eighths pole, angled out six wide off the far turn, forced
out nearing the eighth pole and was outkicked late. TRADE DEADLINE tracked the early pace between foes, well positioned entering the far turn but had no
late kick. TRI SPOT was reserved inside throughout, saved ground to the top of the stretch and had no late rally. SOUL READY was unhurried well back
through the half, angled out on the far turn and passed tiring foes. DAIGLE attended the early pace on the outside, asked for run nearing the three eighths
and had no bid in the lane while weakening to the wire. YAK chased the pace on the rail and gave way in the lane. CAPTAIN DRAKE pressed the pace
three wide through the opening half then tired when asked on the far turn and continued to weaken through the lane. GLASS EATER chased the pace
between foes in the second flight early and failed to respond when asked and leveled off in the lane. EBONY BAY settled outside early, made a brief
attempt to get into contention into the far turn and had no late bid past the quarter pole. WACO KID showed brief foot, dropped to the rear and was eased in
the lane.

Footnotes
COUSVINNYSACANUCK was off a step slow, tracked the pace on the inside, angled out at the top of the lane and drove clear under steady urging. EYES
FLYING BYE was off slow then sent for the lead on the inside, battled to the top of the lane but had no late response when confronted by eventual winner
and was clearly second best. RED WAVE broke well from the gate, tracked the pace between foes, lost ground between foes at the five sixteenths, dropped
in to save ground and came on again late to get show. ROAD TRIP was off slowly from the gate, rushed up between foes, continued three wide into the lane
and finished evenly. DYNAMOMETER broke well out of the gate, chased four wide into the bend and weakened late. LL'S CLASSY DUDE lacked early
speed, dropped to the rear, angled out at the top of the lane and passed tiring foes. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL dwelt at the start then was unhurried early,
dropped near the rear and failed to menace. DARK LEOPARD showed brief early foot between foes and gave way.

Footnotes
DEFEND THE ROSE was hustled up the rail contesting the pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage after the opening three sixteenths, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, drifted out under pressure but gamely held GOTHAM CITY QUEEN to the end under firm left handed
encouragement. The latter caught four wide in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, advanced to challenge the leader three
deep nearing upper stretch, was floated out while shying a bit leaving midstretch and couldn't quite match the winner. DIVA DE KELA tracked just off the
first flight three wide between foes, switched out nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, was fanned five wide leaving midstretch but
continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. DOUBLE BEE STING settled off the second flight while angling to the inside nearing the turn, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued with interest along the rail to gain some position late. CELTICS WILDCAT was rated off the second flight along the
inside racing into the turn, switched out four wide racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. BINDING TIME angled to the inside racing into the turn
tracking off the first flight but steadily faded nearing the lane. KNIGHT'S HONOR broke readily, prompted the pacesetter racing to the turn and gave way
into the lane. MISS BROOKSIDE proved no factor. MADISONIAN hopped at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SAINT CHARLES broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn, drifted out while being roused to resist several
challengers nearing midstretch but continued grudgingly under pressure to maintain the advantage to the end. JUAN BRAVO tracked the pacesetter three
wide between foes racing to the turn, was carried out leaving midstretch but continued with a steady bid to edge a rival for second on the wire. KISS AWAY
tracked the pacesetter between rivals as part of the second flight racing to the turn, bid between foes nearing midstretch, was caught in tight quarters in late
stages and just lost the nod for second. TEST PILOT angled to the inside while being rated off the second flight racing into the turn, tipped out in upper
stretch and continued with a mild bid. THIRSTY KISS tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned six wide into the lane
and finished evenly late. GEAUX YOSHKA broke outwards bumping MAGOO, was reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn and made an
effort to gain some position five deep late. MAGOO, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, was prompted to regain some position between foes into the
turn and continued evenly to late stages. DRIVENMYLIFEAWAY settled between foes in early stages and proved no threat. TIGER HUNTER settled while
angling to the inside early and never menaced. INDY LEAD, under pressure five wide in early stages, soon retreated. CAKE STOMPER, urged along inside
rivals pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, emptied out abruptly racing into upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE TRAINER OF KISS AWAY
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

SAILING ALONG was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late
response to narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. SHE BEGAN AGAIN, off slowly, was settled last along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground
to upper stretch and was going well inside rivals in the closing stages to just miss. BIRDIE BE GONE, bumped at the start, was urged three deep between
foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, moved to terms challenging for command between foes in that path midstretch but proved no match for the top
pair late. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR, raced unhurried between foes in the second flight in early stages, angled out five wide racing into the lane and continued
with a mild bid. A ROZE AND WINE, urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in early stages, pressed the issue outside a rival through
the turn and gave out once headed leaving midstretch. ORNAMENTAL IRON, urged inside foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled for
command to upper stretch and gave out. BAILDON, bumped at the start, settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. PRETTY SWEET,
restless in the gate in an incident that required the field to be reloaded, proved no factor. H'RAYFORCABERNEIGH made brief pursuit of the leaders four
wide on the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the turn and soon retreated. THE RACE WAS DELAYED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WHEN A ROZE AND
WINE REQUIRED A SUBSTITUTE RIDER AFTER THE ORIGINALLY NAMED RIDER SUFFERED AN INJURY IN A GATE MISHAP.

Footnotes
BLAME BISHOP, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, tipped outside that rival racing into upper stretch while advancing
between foes to challenge, took over in late stages and went clear under pressure. DARE FELIX broke readily, dictated the pace in the three path in early
stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn maintaining a safe advantage to upper stretch but faltered in late stages while just holding a rival for second.
STONE SECRET, reserved well off the inside dropping off the leaders on the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued to
make steady progress late while just missing for second. SIDE STREET DAVE tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes racing into the turn, was
fanned four wide into the stretch and continued evenly. GREATER CAIRO, off slowly, settled along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. DIGITAL STAR, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, emptied out in the drive. SEEK N JUSTICE tracked off the second
flight five wide racing to the turn, was forced wide racing into the lane and quickly emptied out. NEVERBLINK tracked the leaders along the rail, was taken
up entering the lane dropping well back but walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
OLD INDIAN TRICK, forwardly placed along the rail, pressed the issue inside the pacesetter nearing the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and
widened under pressure. TAPSOLUTE tracked just off the leaders four wide in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper
stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while lasting for second. PAROLEE, caught in close quarters at the start, settled last racing to the turn, swung
out seven wide entering the lane and found his best stride late to gain a share. DEVIL'S TEETH tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to
upper stretch and continued evenly late. FENDER BENDER was rated off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch
but offered no rally. CALCULATING KING settled between foes, angled six wide entering upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position while no
real threat. TWO THE PUNCH settled along the inside early and failed to menace. AWESOME EMMIT, forwardly placed three wide between foes tracking
just off the leaders, gave way into the lane. FLORIDA TWO STEP sped to the lead in the three path through the backstretch, angled inwards disputing the
pace outside a rival and gave out racing into upper stretch. SHARP ART dropped out early.

Footnotes
MISYNEEDSACOCKTAIL was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under firm
encouragement. SIMPLY WICKED tracked off the first flight inside rivals, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the
others. BIT COINER tracked off the first flight three deep between foes, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a
share. SUMMER LIGHTNING bobbled at the start, was quickly righted to join the pace four wide racing into the turn and gave way into the lane. RUNNIN
HAPPY tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, was caught in close quarters nearing upper stretch, then angled to the inside but had no
final response. CITRUS BAY tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and continued in that path to late stages while never gaining
contention. WILL THE THRILL, urged three wide between foes pressing the pace racing to the turn, gave way into the lane. CAUSE I'M LEAVIN, urged
between foes pressing the pace racing into the bend, gave way after a half. SING N SPURS, caught in tight quarters, then shuffled back at the start, trailed

Footnotes
RAY'S ANGEL joined the pace outside foes racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards pressing the issue in the two path racing into the turn, gained a
narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and responded to firm encouragement to maintain the advantage to the end. WESTONS WILDCAT, urged
inside foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, switched outside the leader once losing even terms with that foe racing into upper
stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for second. MAY WE ALL, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, was eased off the pace
to track the leaders between foes, angled to the inside in the stretch and just missed for second. PUBLIC SAFETY, off slowly, was reserved last early,
steadily gathered momentum outside foes racing into the bend, swung out five wide entering the lane and continued with a solid late response to close the
gap. GOT EVEN SMARTER, caught in tight quarters between foes while held up off the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch while gaining striking distance but had no final kick. WATER PATROL settled last racing through the backstretch, split foes three
wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. SAHM TEQUILA settled inside foes early and failed to menace. GABRIEL'S
LEGEND proved no factor. GOLDEN GULLEY, urged inside foes tracking just off the leaders in the opening quarter, retreated early. FIRE EXTINGUISHER
tracked off the first flight outside foes racing through the backstretch and gave way between foes into upper stretch. MYNAMEIS PRINCE dropped out early.

Footnotes
REDOUX broke inwards bumping WHATA SHOW OFF, was caught four wide racing into the first turn while prompted to a position just off the first flight,
continued with a steady three wide advance racing into upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in late stages in a protracted skirmish under strong handling.
OUTERBANKS angled inwards while being urged between foes disputing the pace racing to the backstretch, dispatched a rival racing past midstretch, then
grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. MISCHIEVOUS MO, bumped, then shuffled out of tight quarters just after the start, settled between
foes to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and made some solid late progress to gain a share. PRICE TO PAY, off slowly, then
reserved avoiding some traffic along the inside racing to the backstretch, gradually gathered momentum inside foes on the far turn, swung out five wide in
upper stretch and continued with a belated rally. GRAPHYTE was rated off the firs flight between foes just off the inside racing to the far turn, continued
evenly to late stages. NATURAL CHILL angled to the inside early, prompting the pace inside foes, dueled for command to the far turn and gave way.
WHATA SHOW OFF, bumped from both sides at the start, was righted, then urged three deep between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch and
faded early. DIDJADOIT worked his way to the inside tracking off the first flight to the backstretch but offered no rally. UNBRIDLED SHOES broke outwards
bumping WHATA SHOW OFF, was caught wide racing off the second flight to the backstretch and proved no threat. MUSKYMAN, bumped at the start,
settled between foes and faded from contention early.
