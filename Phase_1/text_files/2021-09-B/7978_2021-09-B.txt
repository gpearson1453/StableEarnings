Footnotes
SHOP AROUND raced in the second flight in the two path, behind traffic midway on the second turn, remained within striking distance, split foes, bit of tight
quarters past the furlong marker, put a head in front soon after and drove well clear. CALIFORNIA KATIE settled off the pace and the inside, advanced and
challenged four wide late in the final turn, came in to tighten up the winner as that one was challenging between horses approaching the furlong marker,
proved no match for that one, clearly second best. COMMERCIAL FLASH broke alertly, set or forced the pace inside, continued to vie into the lane could
not keep pace with the top two the final furlong, saved the show. STAR FASHION broke back, raced outside through the first turn, continued well out in the
strip, came four wide when making a mild advance into the lane, continued to improve position to be slowly gaining for the show. LUCKY HARBORAGE fell
back off the pace and the inside, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat. ABIGAIL G lacked speed outside, came five wide out of the final
turn, made little impact in the run to the wire. FASHION MERIT forwardly placed off the inside, advanced with the runner up and lodged a brief bid three
wide and inside that one late in the final turn, gave way in the drive. TEMPLE QUEST dueled up front in the two path for five furlongs, faltered from between
horses into the lane. BABY MAYBE finished after a half, well beaten, jogged in late. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MATT'S PRIDE broke with the leaders, fell back off the pace exiting the chute, stalked up the backstretch and into the turn off the inside, ranged up in the
three path to challenge turning for home, took over, drew well clear, enough left to withstand the runner up at the wire. HANDSOME GIRL void of speed well
out in the strip, began to rally four out to five wide into the lane, finished up willingly to be rapidly getting to the winner late, well clear of the others.
ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) broke on top, dueled up front while closest to the inside for over a half, proved no match for the top pair in the drive, far clear
of the others. BLUE DARTER in the second flight, went one paced through the turn, came up empty for the drive. MISS UNDERRATED away in good order,
alternated up front off the the inside, first to blink up front late in the turn, continued to weaken stretch. AGIRLNAMEDSYD last away, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
VIV VIV VIV away in good order narrowly show the way up the backstretch, shook off the other speed turning for home, drew off through the lane under
steady handling. SANGRIA CITY forwardly placed outside, closer four wide turning into the lane, could not keep up in the drive, clear for the place. CLARA
BELLE void of speed off the inside, bothered slightly by a drifting SMOKE IN YOUR EYES when rallying well out in the strip inside the furlong marker, rallied
for the show. I'M ALL SHOOK UP behind the first flight, continued to chase the leaders while being asked exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch run
to lose the show lae. WHIMSICAL LADY in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing
punch. CUPIE CUTIE veered to the inside just after the start forcing her rider to steady, fell back to trail and never menaced. SMOKE IN YOUR EYES
pressured the winner up the backstretch from the outside, briefly dueled late in the turn then gave way in the drive while drifting out in midstretch. PAT'S
EMPYREAN was finished early, well beaten.

STEALING APRIORITY broke with the field, raced in the second flight on the outside up the backstretch, began to advance while four wide early in the turn,
challenged three wide exiting the bend, dueled upper stretch, pulled away the final furlong under steady pressure. IMA SUNNY SONG with the pace out of
the chute, continued to vie into and through the turn, dueled inside the winner upper stretch then could not keep up. TOE BANDIT in the second flight in the
run up the backstretch, angled out to be three wide turning into the stretch, drifted out, no match for the top two. CONQUISTADOR GOLD broke in,
bothered TOE BANDIT forcing that one in, was used to move up steadily along the inside to join the leaders out of the chute, held a narrow advantage
midway up the backstretch, headed far turn, weakened in the drive while drifting out then in. UNBRIDLED HOPE one one paced outside in lacking a closing
response. UNBRIDLED PULPIT devoid of early foot while far out in the strip, raced six wide through the turn, improved position in the drive with some
belated interest. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT broke back, lacked speed, improved by picking off tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CRESCENT
CITY CAT broke alertly, raced with the early pace three wide, gave way in the drive. COLE'S SENSATION in mid pack early, tired. JUSTA SABER well off
the pace while five wide through the turn, also faded through the lane.. IDE LIKE HAWAII finished after a half, far back, jogged in.

WAITA MINUTE HAYES carried out at the start, moved up to vie for the lead on the outside through the first turn, shook clear before a half, continued to
lead by daylight through the final turn, held the runnerup comfortably at bay through the lane under steady handling. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS broke well, vied
up front closest to the inside, fell back off the winner midway up the backstretch, chased far turn and into the lane, drifted out, well clear of the rest, no late
gain. CHIEF KIMOSABI broke back and to the outside to help pinch back, BLAZE OF GRAY, lacked speed inside, moved out, came four wide into the lane,
finished up best of the rest while no threat to the top two. COUNTRY CUT broke in to bump BLAZE OF GRAY, settled well off the pace and the inside, five
wide exiting the final turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late punch. BLAZE OF GRAY pinched back hard at the break, trailed for five furlongs,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. MO CREDO broke out carrying the winner well to the outside, settled within striking distance early,
gave way in the drive. BIG SESSY broke up, raced forwardly in the early going, began to fade before a half. FRACTIONAL TIMES ARE HAND TIMED DUE
