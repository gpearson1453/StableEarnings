handling. PEACEARELLA stalked the early going, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole, continued to race near the rail in the drive and finished
second best. KARMA IS GOLDEN was quick to begin to set the early pace and weakened through the stretch run. HIT A HOMER HONEY was reluctant to
load, raced two to three deep and had not enough in the drive. BLUEGRASS ON TAP was allowed to settle early, raced near the rail near the quarter pole
and had no late response. HOLIDAY CONNECTION dropped back early on, raced seven wide into the upper lane and never was a serious threat. MISS
ARTSY NOUVEAU was off a step slow, raced in tight quarters near the half mile pole, was near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had
no response. BALBOA'S SMILE stalked the early going and failed to sustain a bid. MISSPOKEN dropped back early on, raced towards the inside and never
was a factor.. RUBY DOOBY DOO was reluctant to load, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
STREET LUTE stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the stretch run and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. MALIBU
BEAUTY pressed the early leader, raced three deep through the lane and finished second best. PLANE DRUNK showed good early speed from the inside
and weakened a bit in the final stages. DANCER'S MELODY was allowed to settle to the middle of the pace, raced towards the inside and finished willingly
to the wire. MADAM MEENA took up sharply at the break losing a considerable amount to ground and never was a factor. DULCE KIARA hopped at the
break and never threatened.

Footnotes
TAPPIN CAT showed good early speed, raced two to three wide through the drive and prevailed under all out pressure. SENIOR INVESTMENT stalked the
early pace, raced four to three wide in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. BAL HARBOUR stalked the early pace, lacked room near the eighth pole,
angled out and finished willingly to the wire. Jockey of Bal Harbour claimed objection for interference against Tappin Cat and Senior Investment for
interference through the stretch run and stewards ruled no change. MISCHIEF AFOOT settled off the early pace, raced near the rail in the drive, raced in
tight near the sixteenth pole and kept on to the wire. SUBSTANTIAL was unhurried early on, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough
in the drive. SHANE'S JEWEL vied for the early lead and gave way. HONOR THE FLEET dropped back early and failed to respond.

CENTERFOLDPROSPECT stalked the early pace, moved up through the far turn, waited near the quarter pole, split rivals through the upper lane and
finished well to be clear under strong handling. KRATOS was unhurried early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up
for the place position. RIDE EM was allowed to settle early, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. FOLE'S NOTION was
unhurried early on, moved up while racing near the inside around the far turn through the stretch run and showed good late interest. WHERE PARADISE
LAY settled to the middle of the pack early, made a five wide bid and had not enough. I AM THAT I AM pressed the pace and weakened while racing three
wide. POLTERER raced in tight quarters nearing the eighth pole and had no final winning bid while racing five deep. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO settled off
the early going, raced three wide in the lane and had no rally. DR. FERBER was forced to take up at the break, dropped back early and failed to respond.
SINGLINO showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and gave way. ROCKET BLAST raced widest into the lane and had no rally.
ARRIVEDERLA failed to sustain a bid. LORD EDDARD STARK was squeezed back at the break and trailed.

going, moved up six deep into the upper lane and made a good late gain. TIGHTLY TWISTED stalked the early pace, raced near the inside and had no final

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ACT was unhurried early, moved up four the far turn, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, made a good rail bid in the stretch and just got up
under all out pressure. SOUPER FLY OVER stalked the early going, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and finished gamely to just miss. MOON GATE
WARRIOR settled off the early pace, made a steady advance around the far turn, raced two to three wide while racing between rivals and finished willingly
to the wire. BOLD PAYNTER was slow early, moved up along the inside through the drive and showed late interest. AULD LANGE SYNE was unhurried in
the early going, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. MARCO ISLAND was quick to begin to set all the pace and gave way
the final eighth of a mile. RED AGAIN raced up close early on, raced four wide around the first turn and tired in the stretch run. YABBA DABBA DUDE raced
up close down the backstretch while racing between rivals and tired. MICE AND MEN dropped back early and failed to respond. DELIGHTFULLYWICKED
failed to sustain a bid.

TAP DANCE FEVER stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside to take command into the far turn, continued to race near the inside in the drive and
proved best under steady handling. STRIKING CHROME was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide through the stretch run and closed in well late.
TEXAS REWARD stalked the early going, raced near the rail at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. BABY GUNDIN stalked the pace while
racing between rivals, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and made a good late gain. DR. ANN showed good early speed to set the pace and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. LOVE IN HER EYES was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper lane and had no response. MIZZEN AIR was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on and tired readily.
