Footnotes
INDIMAAJ was off a beat slowly, recovered to vie for the lead outside of MARKITOFF around the first turn, forged an advantage from that foe into the
backstretch, showed the way in the three path from a bidding ALKHAATAM around the far turn, but responded when roused passing the quarter pole, drew
off under driving pressure in upper stretch, and was kept busy to the wire. LORD DRAGON tracked along the inside, shifted two wide into the far turn, then
chased the clear leader along the rail through the lane, claimed place passing the furlong pole, and held that position to the wire. THE STIFF broke a step
slowly, checked between horses at the seven furlong pole to trail the field, then stayed on through the lane to bid for place between horses in the final
sixteenth, but was denied that position while gaining show. ALKHAATAM stalked three wide, ranged up to the leader around the far turn, but quickly failed to
keep pace in upper stretch, wandered about through the final furlong while faltering, and lost show late. MARKITOFF vied for the lead inside of the eventual
winner, but gave way to that foe into the far turn, and weakened thereafter. PIT BOSS hopped at the start and was off slowly, settled at the rear of the field
three wide around both turns, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TOCCATA dueled for the lead outside of CONGRADULATED, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch as LATTE DOLCE menaced, but repelled that foe
passing the furlong pole, and gamely held a margin to the wire. FLASH MAGIC chased the dueling leaders from the two path around the turn, got outmoved
by LATTE DOLCE for place entering the lane, altered course outside of that foe at the furlong pole, tipped further out to counter that foe's drift approaching
the sixteenth pole, then produced a late kick to reach that foe for place on the wire. LATTE DOLCE tracked three wide, ranged up to the leaders turning for
home to attempt a bid in upper stretch, but was repelled at the furlong pole, drifted outwards leaving that station, straightened and sustained his chase
through the late stages, but was nailed on the wire for place. AMUSING ANTICS settled off of the pace, took the turn in the two path, shifted outside of
leading rivals in upper stretch, got flaoted five wide in midstretch, then stayed on through the late stages, but failed to menace. SWEET QUEEN BEE trailed
by a distance around the turn, and was outrun. CONGRATULATED dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET DANI GIRL settled off of the pace, commenced a grinding advance on the leading pair from the two path into the turn, shifted three wide to take aim
on FAMED as that foe assumed command entering the lane, chased that foe through upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, but changed leads while
producing a bid approaching the furlong pole, forged an advantage at that marker, then determinedly drew clear approaching the wire. FAMED prompted
the pace three to two wide, bid for the lead while well in hand turning for home, drew clear when set down passing the quarter pole as SWEET DANI GIRL
menaced, maintained a margin from that foe through upper stretch, but was tested approaching the furlong grounds, got headed at that marker, fought on
into the final sixteenth, but yielded late. MOMMASGOTTARUN settled off of the pace, took the turn three wide, and stayed on through the lane for a minor
share. BEAUTIFUL EMPIRE set the pace along the inside, but proved no match for a pair of outer foes passing the quarter pole, and tired through the lane.
SPRING MAGIC lied far off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turn, and moved up without menacing. HIGH SPEED trailed along the inside
into the lane, shifted five wide passing the three sixteenths pole, and passed tired foes. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES as brushed by an outer foe at the start,
stalked two wide, cleared to the rail into the turn, but weakened passing the three furlong pole. WINTER LOVE lied close up two wide, but got rank between
horses passing the five furlong pole, and faded.

Footnotes
TRIDENT HIT tucked into the first turn to settle off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide into the far turn, gained under his own power around that
bend, tipped four wide turning for home while ranging up outside of the leaders, got floated six wide while bidding entering the lane, drove clear of inner foes
approaching the furlong grounds before meeting CORE BELIEFS' bid at the sixteenth pole, and gamely held to the wire. CORE BELIEFS trailed, shifted to
the four path around the far turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of rivals to take aim on the leader a sixteenth from home, but was
denied. BOURBON CALLING tracked two wide, awaited racing room turning for home while getting outmoved by the eventual winner, found a seem
passing the quarter pole and split foes three wide to produce a bid, but was outkicked by outer foe at the furlong grounds, then kept on to secure show. SPA
CITY prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane to resist outer foes, but yielded between
horses passing the sixteenth pole. ROYAL MESA pressed the pace three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, got floated five wide entering the lane, vied
between horses through upper stretch, but faltered at the furlong grounds. BEAVER HAT stalked along the inside, got briefly shuffled back behind the early
pace setter before shifting inside of that rival entering the lane, but lacked a rail rally. FACT FINDING set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a
pair of vying rivals around the far turn, but yielded inside of foes entering the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
SARAH HARPER prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead in hand turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off under vigorous
hand urging before being geared down passing the sixteenth pole. SMARMY stalked three wide, but proved no match for the clear leader in upper stretch,
chased him home, and saved place. ANNA VOLANTE broke slowly but avoided severe trouble by doing so, took the turn in the three path while well off of
the pace, was green to switch leads while shifting outwards in upper stretch, tipped outside of foes approaching the furlong pole, but drifted further out in the
process, then straightened and rallied willingly through the late stages, but missed reaching show. UPANDCOMINGSTAR took the turn in midpack two
wide, then stayed on for a minor share without threatening. MISS MCBRIDE saved ground in midpack inside of UPANDCOMINGSTAR, then stayed on
inside of that foe through the lane. LADY CLEMENTINE broke slowly, shifted to the four path into the turn while far off of the pace, then improved outside of
foes through the lane. MAKE HER DAY lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. MUSIC APP set the pace inside of the
eventual winner into the turn, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, gave way in upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. DALIDA
took a solid bump from an outer foe at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide, and failed to make an impact. BITTER VIXEN hopped slightly at the start
and was off slowly, then trailed and got outrun. CATALAN broke inwards and squarely bumped DALIDA at the start, chased early on, but lost position into
the turn, and steadily faded thereafter. AIDANIKE was outrun along the inside.
