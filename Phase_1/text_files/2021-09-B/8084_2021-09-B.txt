unhurried early, made a four wide run around the final turn but lacked the needed closing. JESSE THE GREAT settled, rallied four wide around the final turn
then flattened out in the lane. HAY BUCK was caught wide while showing speed around the first turn, moved to the front before a half, cleared then angled
to the rail nearing the far turn and stopped in the lane. FAVORITE DOLL had early position inside, came out two wide on the final turn then stopped in the
lane. PRIDE IN THE BIZ made the early pace three wide between rivals, remained prominent to the far turn then stopped. FOUR SEASONS GIRL steadily
