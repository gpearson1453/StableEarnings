Footnotes
SLIPSTREAM established the front and showed the way four paths off the hedge down the backstretch under some pressure inside through the presence of
JAVA BUZZ, had that rival advance and dueled from the nine-sixteenths tucking three wide through the turn, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole,
spun three wide for home, shook off his main pace rival nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive to prevail. GRAND SONATA four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, proved no match
for the top one while running on clear for the place honors. SMOKIN' T broke in at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside with nine-sixteenths
remaining, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and improved position for the show honors. JAVA BUZZ prompted the
leader from the inside in the two path down the backstretch before advancing nine-sixteenths from home to duel through the turn, cornered three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was shaken off nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. DR BROWNES MIRACLE coaxed from
the gate, chased three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. NECROMANCER two to three
wide in pursuit, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.
SKYLANDER broke in and was forced to steady at the start getting away last, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and tired. FIGLIO DEL RE (IRE) four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing three furlongs from home and faded
through the latter portion of the turn, went just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SUMMER BOURBON bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the inside of a rival, moved in late on the backstretch, raced inside
to the two path on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch, took over outside the three-sixteenths, shook clear under a right-handed crop coming to the
furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. BABY I'M PERFECT disputed the pace on the outside, vied two then three wide on the turn, was asked
while in front outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished but kept on for the place. WINNING DRIVE settled on
the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position to safely secure the
show. BLEWITT was ridden along in the front half of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response while just able to get the last spot in the superfecta. MANIFEST DESTINY was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and failed to rally. REGAL QUALITY settled off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. VICAR'S
LEGEND broke a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. BIG MOUNTAIN was hustled from the break, disputed
the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. TALE OF MIST was grabbed with the right
rein at the start and off a bit slow, angled in towards the rear, raced in hand late on the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn then angled five wide at
the seven-sixteenths and never reached contention. HUSHION bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back three then
four wide on the turn and retreated. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, moved out inside the
three-sixteenths and faltered. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
SO ENCHANTING tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to
engage the leader and dueled from the eighth pole through to the finish taking narrow command near the sixteenth marker and gamely prevailed on the
wire. MISS BONNIE T showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled lightly coaxed taking the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in roused for the initial time nearing the eighth pole and knocked heads with the aforementioned foe getting narrowly overtaken near the
sixteenth pole, fought on gamely inside but was ultimately bested at the finish. BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) got steadied at the start when losing her lane to
RHOMBIQUE, who broke outwards, saved ground near the rear of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. MEZCAL tracked the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. INVESTMENT INCOME broke out at the start bumping INGRESS, settled well held just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. RHOMBIQUE
broke out at the start forcing BIPARTISANSHIP to steadied in behind, tracked the pace just off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide
through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and made no impact. INGRESS bumped at the start by

the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, gained through a rail opening to take the lead outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a
right-handed crop, came out when switched to a left-handed crop approaching the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and prevailed under strong
urging. LONE ROCK bumped with a foe at the start, went around the first turn in the four path, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead from the
eleven-sixteenths to near the nine-sixteenths then gave up the advantage, vied in the three path while let out on the far turn, was asked for more when the
winner came through on the rail approaching the quarter-pole, chased that foe while outside in the stretch and finished with good courage but missed while
clear for the place. MO GOTCHA broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in his stall, went to the front, showed the way in the two
path with company to his outside, lost the lead outside the five-eighths then regained the front near the nine-sixteenths, was asked on the far turn, lost the
advantage outside the quarter-pole and weakened but was far clear for third. CHRIS AND DAVE was taken under a strong hold early then rated just off the
pace in the two path, shifted four wide under urging at the three-eighths, dropped back to the two path while losing ground outside the quarter-pole and
tired. EMPTY TOMB broke out then bobbled and bumped with a foe, went around the first turn in the four then five path, stalked the pace on the outside,
chased four then five wide on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. MILE AND A HALF FRACTION WAS

OCALA DREAM broke in at the start brushing ONENIGHTSTANDARDS, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, tipped out two then three wide through the
far turn coming under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying in concert with a pair to his
inside through the final furlong to overwhelm the leader inside the final sixteenth knocking heads late and was up in the very last jump to the wire. HIDDEN
ENEMY (IRE) three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying through the final furlong in tandem with a pair and just lost the nod on the line. SPACE LAUNCH tracked the pace along the inside from just off the
pace, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, lugged in briefly pausing in behind EYES ON TARGET
straightened away before tipping back out roused, rallied under a drive to issue a challenge through the final furlong latched on a trio to the finish but missed
at the end. HOT BLOODED under a light rating hold showing the way along the inside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down taking
the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under challenge from a trio and was overwhelmed inside the final
sixteenth, battled on but was outfinished in the final strides. NEVER EXPLAIN broke in at the start bumping SOUTHERN DISTRICT, settled just off the
inside unhurried near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
OMATI tracked the front just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the
corner into upper stretch and paused briefly straightened away, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS got brushed at the start
by OCALA DREAM, who broke inwards, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and offered up late foot while unable to threaten to the finish. SOUTHERN DISTRICT bumped at the start by NEVER EXPLAIN, who broke
inwards, settled unhurried three then two wide at the tail of the field, remained on hold until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch and never got
involved. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY coaxed from the gate, settled tracking from the two path in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. EYES ON TARGET three wide in range of the front, came
under a ride five-sixteenths from home, continued three wide at the top of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL KAREN set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch,
extended the advantage into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth and was fully extended to last. OUT FIRST broke a bit awkwardly,
checked behind foes early, settled at the rear, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path around the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, rallied in the final furlong and closed with a rush to just miss while able to get the place. PRETTY CLEVER was well placed just off the pace,
chased inside on the turn, came out under a drive into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. VIENNA
CODE settled towards the rear, raced in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the rail at the three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch, moved
out inside the furlong marker and finished with good energy. SHE'S DANCING was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, traveled around the
turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SNICKET pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. ESOTICA was last to commence then reserved towards the back, saved ground early on the turn,
shifted two then three wide later on that bend, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OK HONEY settled on the inside of a rival, was roused
three wide on the turn and failed to respond. LOT OF HONEY settled off the pace, was asked while saving ground on the turn and also failed to respond.
HANDLE THE TRUTH settled on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
SHANTISARA (IRE) attended the leader under a firm hold from the outside in the two path, remained on hold and patiently handled until set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, got leaned on straightened away by HIGHER TRUTH briefly before that rival was corrected, dug in dueling through the
stretch to the finish taking a narrow advantage inside the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed shaking away in the shadow of the wire. HIGHER TRUTH
(IRE) established the front and showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, came out briefly leaning on her main threat straightened away until pulled off, dug in knocking heads
through to the finish stubbornly clinging to the lead until inside the final sixteenth, then grudgingly gave way in the final jumps to the finish. HARAJUKU (IRE)
veered out at the start and was corrected, settled tracking the pace along the inside from the tail of the field on hold until set down spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, tipped to the three path straightened away, offered up a mild bid a furlong out, then kept on one paced to the finish to secure the show
honors safely on the line. CREATIVE FLAIR (IRE) lightly coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket until tipped to the two path
through the far turn, got placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, weakened in the late going.
MADONE bobbled at the start, recovered to tracked the front just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tipped three wide near the three-eighths, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and weakened. BABY BLYTHE came under rating restraint soon after the start
and grew rank two then three wide past the stands the initial time skygazing in protest, went three wide through the opening bend before settling better once
given some rein three wide down the backstretch, continued three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four wide at
the head of the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
YIBIR (GB) was slow into stride then coaxed along to keep up with the rest of the field early, saved ground on the opening bend, settled at the back, was
urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead before the three-sixteenths, drifted in under
a right-handed crop while shaking clear into the final furlong then dropped to the hedge, was switched to a left-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under vigorous handling. SOLDIER RISING (GB) was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind horses on the final turn, was asked
while shifting three wide for room at the top of the stretch, chased the winner in the drive, brushed with a foe near the furlong marker and narrowly earned
the place. SLICKED BACK prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked with five-sixteenths to run, battled under a drive into upper stretch,
brushed with a foe while dropping back into the final furlong and just missed the place while clear for the show. BOLSHOI BALLET (IRE) went three wide on
the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn then was driven four wide into the stretch and came
up empty. TOKYO GOLD (FR) settled on the inside, moved to the two path midway through the far turn, raced behind foes while three wide into the stretch,
was put to a drive around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. STEP DANCER was rated just off the pace in the two path, spun five wide
into the stretch and also came up empty. TANGO TANGO TANGO went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole then lost
the lead shortly thereafter and faded.

RISK PROFILE got bumped between foes when CLEAR HUMOR broke outwards and AIR SHOW broke inwards sawing off ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE and
was pinched back being forced to steady out and conceding four to five lengths to the front, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking to the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied tipping out a path to
circle the backing away former leader AMERICAN GENTLEMAN a furlong out, closed well through the final furlong showing good courage after a rough
start to get up in the final jump and score. REPO ROCKS three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three
wide into upper stretch taking over command straightened away, dug in under threat to the outside before coming under pressure from flanking challengers
and was nailed on the wire. MANOLITO broke out at the start bumping and pinching COLORMEPAZZI in tandem with ADVANCE NOTICE, chased along
the inside from mid pack, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive willingly to close in and missed at the end. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE lunged at the break and was forced to steady and alter in
as AIR SHOW took over his lane and conceded five lengths to the front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along at
the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and kept on to the finish. TRASH TALKER chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside

five wide for home and offered no response. HOOPLA brushed the off side stall when breaking outwards at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride
from three furlongs out, cornered three wide into upper stretch and weakened. COLORMEPAZZI bobbled at the start recovering outwards and bumped
ADVANCE NOTICE, then got pinched out against that rival due to pressure from MANOLITO, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping
out four wide through the turn, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN coaxed from the gate, crossed to
the inside showing the way through swift splits, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away, then backed away through the
final furlong. CLEAR HUMOR broke out at the start pinching back RISK PROFILE in tandem with AIR SHOW, chased three to four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. AIR SHOW broke in at the start forcing ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE to steady when taking over his lane
then bumped and pinched back RISK PROFILE forcing that rival to steady in concert with pressure from CLEAR HUMOR, chased five to six paths off the
