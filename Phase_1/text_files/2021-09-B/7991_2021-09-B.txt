Footnotes
HALF OF MANHATTAN chased the leading pair down the chute, took closer order past the three quarters, went to a drive in the three to four path past the
three eighths, was driven three wide in upper stretch, chased CROCE D'ORO through upper stretch, engaged outside of CROCE D'ORO past the furlong
mark, brushed with CROCHE D'ORO as he bore down, led at the sixteenth pole and cleared. CROCE D'ORO stalked outside of CHAPEL BARN down the
back straight, was pushed along for a bid two wide near the seven sixteenths, led near the five sixteenths, shook clear two wide in upper stretch, was
engaged by HALF OF MANHATTAN past the furlong mark, brushed with that foe, was headed near the sixteenth and chased on second best. EDISON
FIRE settled toward the rear, took closer order inside past the three quarters, chased while saving ground around the turn, swung out into the lane and was
driven in the four path, and chased on best of the rest between horses. MAXIMUS IMAGE settled at the rear, took closer order past the five eighths while
still racing at the rear of a compact group, went to a drive in the four path past the three eighths, improved mildly, continued under a drive in the six path in
upper stretch, and flattened out. CHAPEL BARN was keen to the early lead, set the pace inside while pressured by CROCE D'ORO, was engaged by that
foe near the three eighths and headed by him near the five sixteenths, proved no match into the lane and weakened inside.

Footnotes
DRINKS ON ME trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung out to began a bid four wide nearing the
quarter pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, and pulled clear in the final furlong. FIRST SQUADRON dueled for the lead on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, took over the lead entering the stretch, was caught with a
furlong to go and chased the winner home from there, the best of the rest. FLYING BUSINESS tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, raced in
the two path around the turn, began a bid between horses entering the stretch and gained ground mildly down the lane. LADY MAGNA brushed with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. SATIATE brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
raced between horses in the two path around the turn, dropped back entering the stretch and finished evenly. WINNING QUALITY chased the leaders from
the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening half mile, made a mild bid while racing three wide around the turn and into upper stretch, and was
outkicked on the outside in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF PARIS was sent for speed, set the pace while pressured down the backstretch and in the two path around the bend, dueled inside of NICE
AND TRUE in upper stretch while drifting out, continued to drift out after being confronted by GO STORMIN GIRL in the final furlong, and kept finding
enough to deny that foe. GO STORMIN GIRL tracked the leading flight down the backstretch and in the two path around the turn, tipped three wide into the
lane, rallied, engaged outside of DREAMING OF PARIS past the furlong mark, loomed while being carried out and was ultimately held at bay. HOOSIER
GOLD CASE chased near the rear of the main group early, saved ground midpack around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, and found her best
stride in the final furlong despite drifting out. NICE AND TRUE raced three deep in the leading flight early, pressed outside of DREAMING OF PARIS in the
three path around the far turn, dueled inside that foe into upper stretch, was carried out by DREAMING OF PARIS in upper stretch, and flattened out
between horses from near the furlong mark. ME TOO MO was hemmed in by SONG AND A KISS in the opening strides, settled toward the rear well behind
the main group early, chased in the three path on the turn just behind the main group, swung four wide into the lane and was outfinished. OZETTE raced
between horses in the leading flight early, settled back into the stalking flight outside of GO STORMIN GIRL into the turn, gradually lost ground in the three
path on the turn, and had no kick under a drive in the lane. SONG AND A KISS came in on ME TOO MO in the opening strides, settled at the rear, lost
further ground while saving ground around the bend and made no bid in the lane. THE RIDER OF GO STORMIN GIRL LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE RIDER OF DREAMING OF PARIS, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE LANE. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

MORRISTON dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leader from the two path around the turn, launched a second
challenge approaching the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. PACHI dueled for the lead on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, angled in to save ground around the turn while showing the way around the turn, battled gamely in upper stretch and gave way
with a furlong to go. Z U AT THE RACES was forced to check in the opening furlong when his path was blocked by both MR ELEVENTH HOUR and
MORRISTON, settled on the inside in the middle of the pack for what remained of the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground in late
stretch. MISTER CHARMING raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the opening stages, began a bid from the three path passing the three
eighths pole, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly. CHANGE DIRECTION raced off the pace up the backstretch, began to move up while
racing four wide around the turn and continued to pass tiring horses from there. GRAND HIDEAWAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. DICK THE BRUISER trailed
the field on the outside in the early going, moved up on the outside headed into the turn, entered the stretch five wide, gained some ground in upper stretch
and flattened out on the outside from there. MR. ELEVENTH HOUR chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back with a half
mile left to run, and tired further down the lane. A RIDERS OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE JOCKEY OF THE HORSE THAT FINISHED THIRD
CLAIMING INTEFERENCE BY THE WINNER JUST AFTER THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
POPPY'S BOYS was rank into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader inside of BOURBON TAN around that bend, tracked the leading pair down the
backstretch, raced in the pocket through most of the far turn, advanced to engage outside of PACKED HOUSE past the quarter, was driven to the lead near
the three sixteenths, and cleared. POLICY OPTION chased two wide, took closer order in the three path on the far turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch,
went to a drive, could not match the winner but kept on willingly to prove clearly second best. CAMPIONI chased midfield inside of POLICY OPTION, took
closer order in the two path on the far turn, was driven up the inside in range into the lane, proved no match for POLICY OPTION into the final furlong but
chased on well enough to hold off the rallying DANVILLE for show. DANVILLE settled behind the chasing flight, kept on unhurried in the three path on the
far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied mildly late and missed the show. HONEST TO GOODNESS settled near the rear, began to improve
position in the three or four path around the second bend, swung out six wide into the lane, but could not sustain his rally through the final furlong. PACKED
HOUSE cleared into the clubhouse turn, set the pace inside, was confronted by POPPY'S BOYS past the quarter and headed by that foe near the three
sixteenths, and weakened. WAR LANCE soon trailed, took mildly closer order in the three path on the far turn, and ultimately lacked the needed rally.
BOURBON TAN tracked the leader outside of POPPY'S BOYS around the clubhouse turn, stalked the leader down the backstretch and while two wide on
the far turn, and emptied out between horses into the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, NO QUARTER MILE TIME IS AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GET HAMMERED set fast fractions while dueling for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held off the late closers to the wire under a drive. AGGRESSIVITY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three
path, swung wide entering the stretch, was forced out further when WILD WES drifted into his lane, and gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire.
MERLIN'S SONG trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch, was forced to
steady when LOCAMOTOR came into his path while tiring, switched to the inside and continued to gain ground from there. WILD WES broke well and was
taken hold off in the early going, rated off the pace on the inside through the next quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, swung wide
entering the stretch, gained ground while drifting out in upper stretch and was outkicked while continuing to drift late. HIDE THE DEMON chased the leaders
from the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, gained ground
entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LOCAMOTOR dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two
path around the turn, gave way with three sixteenths of a mile to go, and tired between horse from there.

UPBEAT MELODY broke sharply and was soon clear, took mild pressure from CHOPPER while racing in the two path on the turn, kicked clear into the
lane, was shown the crop midstretch, and won ridden out. JUNIOR BUG settled toward the rear inside, improved position in the two path on the turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch, and rallied to prove a clear second best. MOON FLASH tracked the leading pair inside of TOUSSAINT early, chased the
leading pair while hugging the rail on the turn, and chased on evenly in the lane. SKIP THE SMALLTALK chased midpack down the backstretch and in the
three path on the turn, swung out seven wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses while lacking the needed kick to threaten the top three. CACHACO
raced two wide near the rear early, was pushed along near the rear in the two path on the turn, went to a drive inside into the lane, and showed belated
interest to pass inside of tiring horses. CHOPPER tracked the leader early, prompted the pace while racing in the three path around the turn, proved no
match for UPBEAT MELODY into the lane, chased between horses through midstretch, and weakened late. TOUSSAINT tracked the leading pair outside of
MOON FLASH, chased the leading pair in the three path around the bend, swung five wide into the lane and weakened. MACHO CLASSIC steadied slightly
early, settled at the rear, was urged in the four path on the turn and lacked the needed rally in the lane.

Footnotes
ELEGANT JOY tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole,
gained ground on the outside and pulled clear in the final furlong. ONYOURMARKGETSETGO raced inside off the pace in the early going, saved ground
around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, got rolling with a furlong to go and gained ground quickly on the outside to the wire. STONEVICIOUS
raced between horses in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid from the rail nearing the
quarter pole and gained ground between horses down the lane. STRINGS dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn,
continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened late. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle
while saving ground around the turn and into the stretch and gave way with a furlong to go. TRIPLE CHROME raced outside in the middle of the pack in the
early going, came around the turn in the four path and faded in the stretch. HARD COMPANY pressed the pace on the outside in the opening stages, raced
in the two path around the turn, and tired down the lane while drifting out late. MASQUERADE BALL hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field up the
backstretch, saved ground while still racing in last place around the turn, and made up some ground in the stretch while never threatening.
