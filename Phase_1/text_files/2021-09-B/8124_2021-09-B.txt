Footnotes
SPLASH FOR GOLD chased at the middle of a strung-out field, was patient in the three path on the turn, began to take closer order swinging three wide into
the stretch, found his best past the furlong pole under a drive and caught the leader in time. STORMINSIDE was asked for pace inside, attended the pace
inside of ONE PUTT RICHIE in the opening furlong, settled back to track the leader after the eleven sixteenths, tracked the pace in the two path on the turn,
bid outside of ONE PUTT RICHIE approaching the quarter, led at the three sixteenths, drove clear, but was caught late. PRESIDENT ELECT settled toward
the rear outside of POCKET PLAYER, was pushed along into the turn, continued in the three path near the rear around the bend, was driven four wide into
the lane, began to improve, hit his best stride in the final sixteenth and was gaining well late. BULLION tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in
the three to four path on the turn, and chased evenly in the lane. GALAHAD KID settled near the rear, raced in the four to five path on the turn while
between horses in the rear flight, was driven three wide between horses into the lane, drifted out in the lane and passed tiring horses. ONE PUTT RICHIE
broke sharply, cleared past the eleven sixteenths, set a fast pace while uncontested, saved ground on the turn, was headed at the three sixteenths, chased
STORMINSIDE to the furlong mark under a drive, and emptied out. TALIS PARK GRAD was slow into stride, settled at the rear, raced in the five to six path
with the rear flight around the turn, came five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. POCKET PLAYER settled toward the rear, was driven along
the rail with the rear flight around the bend, continued under a drive inside in the lane, and offered no bid.

Footnotes
ANDREAS raced outside in the three path the first time by the stands and around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and pulled clear
in the final furlong while drifting out late. FRANKINCENSE saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the two and three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late.
DOLLAR BLUE raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in middle of the pack on the inside, continued around the far turn still in
the two path and gained ground between horses in late stretch. REMEMBER THE MAINE pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and finished evenly. HALF OF MANHATTAN raced in the three path around the first
turn, stalked the frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, gained some mild ground in upper stretch and
was outkicked from there. TAP THE MOJO chased the leaders between horses through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path racing into the
far turn, dueled from there and into upper stretch and weakened late. JUST THE FACTS led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dueled for the lead while continuing to save ground around the far turn, and faded on the rail in the final furlong. HANNITY broke slowly, trailed
the field from the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three
path, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. FLEETWAY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the
inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
STOPSHOPPINGAMY tracked the leader inside of GHAALEB'S APPEAL early, switched two wide to prompt outside of U. S. CURRENCY past the eleven
sixteenths, pressed two wide on the turn, headed the leader near the five sixteenths, drove to a narrow lead in upper stretch, and continued to hold off
FIELD LETTERS while urged to the wire. FIELD LETTERS broke in and bumped SENSE OF SELF in the opening strides, settled at the rear, began to
improve in the six path past the seven sixteenths, was driven four wide into the lane, loomed outside of STOPSHOPPINGAMY from the three sixteenths,
chased on with interest under a drive but was unable to reel the leader in. SENSE OF SELF was bumped by FIELD LETTERS in the opening strides, settled
toward the rear outside of FLYING BUSINESS, raced between horses past the five eighths as GHAALEB'S APPEAL settled back to join their flight, was
pushed along to track the leading pair in the four path on the turn, bid in the six path into the lane, proved no match for STOPSHOPPINGAMY and FIELD
LETTERS from upper stretch, but chased on best of the rest. U. S. CURRENCY soon led inside, was engaged by STOPSHOPPINGAMY to her outside
near the five eighths, took more pressure from that foe while racing in the two path on the turn, was headed at the five sixteenths, was driven inside into the
lane but proved no match for the new leader in upper stretch, and weakened. GHAALEB'S APPEAL tracked the leader outside of STOPSHOPPINGAMY in
the opening furlongs, settled back to join the chasing flight inside SENSE OF SELF near the five eighths, hugged the rail around the turn, was driven in the
two path into the lane and lacked the needed rally. FLYING BUSINESS settled toward the rear outside of SENSE OF SELF, continued near the rear in the
five path on the turn, and mustered no bid in the lane.

Footnotes
MAID OF HONOR saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching
the three eights pole, raced between horses into the lane, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off to the
wire. WICKED INTENT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn,
launched a bid nearing the quarter pole, gained ground between horses down the stretch and was the best of the rest. BONKERS stalked the leaders from
the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge with half a mile to go, dueled from the two path around the far turn, could
not go with the eventual winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, finishing evenly. MORRIE'S JOY raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, ran into some traffic entering the stretch, found room
and gained ground late between horses to the wire. BLARNEY GIRL saved ground around the firs turn, chased the frontrunners up the backstretch on the
inside, continued to save ground around the far turn, and weakened in late stretch while finishing evenly. BELLA UNION was reluctant to load, broke well
and led the field from the rail through the opening half mile, dueled from the inside around the far turn and in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.
STACY ATTACK raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, moved up slightly while
racing in the three path around the far turn and was outkicked from there. KYLEIGH'S CANDY raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the
frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and flattened out in the stretch. EDEN raced in the four
path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the far outside, began an outside bid four wide approaching the three
eighths pole and faded down the lane. GOSHEN GIRL hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and was never a threat. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and tired further from
there.

Footnotes
WILL KNOWS tracked the leader outside of RIDE INTO THE SKY down the back straight, tracked the leader in the two path on the turn, bid outside of
SHANGHAI POINT in upper stretch, took the lead with a furlong remaining, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. SHANGHAI POINT was soon clear, saved
ground on the turn, was engaged by WILL KNOWS in upper stretch, dug in, was headed with a furlong remaining, and was no match in the final sixteenth.
NYOMAN chased the tracking flight early, tracked the leading pair in the three path outside of FORT RIDGE on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane,
chased on willingly between horses down the lane and offered a mild late gain. FORT RIDGE raced at the inside of the chasing flight early, continued to
chase in range two wide on the turn and into upper stretch, kept on with interest between horses and proved narrowly best of the rest. RIDE INTO THE SKY
tracked the leader inside of WILL KNOWS early, continued to track the leading pair inside of NYOMAN around the bend, was no match for the leading pair
while racing inside into the lane, and flattened out late. TALE OF THE NILE chased between horses early and in the four path on the turn, was driven four
wide in upper stretch, chased on but was ultimately outkicked. DEANO settled at the rear of the main group early, raced in the four path on the turn while
still near the rear, drifted out in upper stretch, but nonetheless rallied between horses too late for a minor award. OFFLEE FUN raced three wide in the
chasing flight early, took the turn in the five path, bid five wide past the five sixteenths and into the lane, but lacked the needed kick in the final furlong.
MAXIMUS IMAGE soon trailed, raced in the five path on the turn, floated six wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. DIDDLEY settled near the rear,
made slight improvement in the six path on the turn, raced four deep into upper stretch, and proved empty. DUMBMARK raced between horses near the
rear early, continued toward the rear in the two to three path on the turn, and offered no response in the lane. SOUTHSIDER settled near the rear inside,
lost position while saving ground around the turn, and had no bid in the lane.

Footnotes
SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE broke sharply inward, tracked the leader outside of LOST IN MANHATTAN early, was grazed by that foe approaching the half,
encroached outside of GET HAMMERED into the turn, dueled two wide from the three eighths to the sixteenth, and edged past under strong handling late.
GET HAMMERED broke inward and bumped FINNEGAN in the opening strides, was sent to the lead, was engaged by SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE into the
turn, dueled inside of that foe from the three eighths to the sixteenth while being in tight between that foe and the rail at times, and was outfinished in the
final sixteenth. LOST IN MANHATTAN tracked the leader inside of SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE early, came out and grazed that foe near the half, raced in the
two path on the turn while tracking the leading pair, chased the leading pair while proving no match in upper stretch, and kept on well enough to hold the
show. YOU SPLIT TENS chased inside early, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, and chased on willingly to
the finish. MORRISTON chased between horses down the backstretch, chased in the four path between horses on the turn, continued between horses into
the lane, dropped to the inside approaching the furlong pole, and improved. TRAPPE VALLEY was bumped by FOLLOW THE SIGNS early as a result of
SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE coming inward in the opening strides, settled outside of HURRICANE HIGHWAY in the rear flight, improved in the five to six path
past the three eighths, swung seven wide into the lane, and rallied belatedly outside. HURRICANE HIGHWAY settled at the inside of the rear flight, saved
ground at the rear around the turn, improved when urged two wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked late. FINNEGAN (IRE) was bumped by GET
HAMMERED in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, took closer order while saving ground through the turn, came into the lane along the inside, and
improved mildly. FOLLOW THE SIGNS was herded in by SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE in the opening strides and bumped TRAPPE VALLEY was hustled for
position outside, continued to improve to track the leading pair in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, and weakened. MKAR THE
FAST chased three wide between horses early, raced in the five path midfield around the bend, and came up empty for the drive. OLSON settled near the
rear, was urged three wide on the turn and into the lane, and mustered no bid. THE RIDER OF GET HAMMERED LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
THE RIDER OF SOUPERHIGH VOLTAGE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

COSMIC TREASURE opened up a clear early lead while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way from the rail up the backstretch and
around the far turn, drifted out entering the stretch and raced in command down the lane, while continuing to drift to the wire. MISTER CHARMING raced in
the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to pursue that rival from the two path around the far turn, could not go
with the winner in the stretch and chased them home gamely, holding second. CLOUD TO GROUND saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began his bid nearing the quarter pole, raced into traffic in upper
stretch, split horses midway down the lane and continued a weaving bid through the final furlong, gaining ground to the wire. UPHAM raced off the pace in
the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch between horses, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside in
late stretch. CONVICT PIKE bumped hard with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced four wide around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path, gained ground in upper stretch and finished evenly. OVERPRAISE raced
in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, came around the far turn in the three path and
passed tiring horses on the outside down the lane. GRAND HIDEAWAY was bumped hard by the horses to either side of him leaving the gate, was forced
out to the nine path when YALIKEANYTHING ran out headed into the first turn, straightened out to race in the three path for what remained of that bend,
came up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and managed to gain ground between horses
late despite his early troubles. DRAMATIC KITTEN saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn, and faded on the rail in the final furlong. COWBOYS DREAM raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path, raced between horses in upper stretch and weakened late.
YALIKEANYTHING bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, ran out to the eight path, carrying GRAND HIDEAWAY with him, headed into the
first turn, was pulled back in by his rider to race in the two path, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the inside, began to drop back while
saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch. GAGOOTS trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and was never involved.

Footnotes
SISTER RULER set the pace inside while prompted by GOLDEN COMMAND, shook clear into the stretch, and held stubbornly under a drive. DAWN'S
DANCER tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and three wide on the turn, bid three wide under a drive into the lane, edged closer to SISTER
RULER in the final furlong but could not reel her in. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL chased inside of BELLE BREZING early, saved ground around the turn, raced
into the lane in range inside, and chased the leading pair evenly late. SAVVY ALLY chased three wide toward the rear, improved five wide around the bend,
swung seven wide into the lane under a drive, and ran on well belatedly. COWGIRL KIMMIE chased midfield inside of MANHATTAN LEGACY, hugged the
rail around the turn, came two wide into the stretch to get around FOX FREY, shifted four wide midstretch, and continued to improve under a drive. BELLE
BREZING broke inward, chased two wide, swung four wide into the lane under a drive, and was outfinished. CHROME ATTACK broke inward and lightly
bumped LUSCIOUS in the opening strides, settled near the rear, began to improve three wide around the bend, swung six wide into the lane and passed
tiring horses. MARY OF BETHANY was pinched back in the opening strides, trailed in the five path on the turn, swung out seven wide into the drive, and
passed tiring horses. FOX FREY raced inside at the rear of the main group, hugged the rail around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and lacked the
needed kick in the lane. MANHATTAN LEGACY chased outside of COWGIRL KIMMIE early, chased four wide around the bend, was driven five wide
toward the rear into the lane, and proved empty. GOLDEN COMMAND prompted the pace outside of SISTER RULER down the backstretch and around the
turn, began to flatten from the five sixteenths, raced into the lane between horses and emptied out. LUSCIOUS was lightly bumped by CHROME ATTACK in
the opening strides, settled between horses at the rear of the main group, raced three wide between foes into the lane, and offered no bid.
