later yards. THUNDER KITTEN pressured the winner early but dropped back off the rail through the turn and had to settle for second best. WINDSORS
TAIL chased, raced near the rail on the turn then dueled later yards to retain third. WHAT AN OX chased and rounded the turn off the rail, drifted a bit into
the lane then outfinished in a later duel for third. WITH SECRET ENERGY gave chase outside then flattened in the three path of the turn.

Footnotes
MOODY WOMAN had a short early lead inside then stalked toward the nine sixteenths pole, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths, raced at a close
disadvantage in the three path of the far turn, was forced outward past the eighth pole but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched further ahead later
yards. TIMEISGOLDEN rated close toward the inside on the first turn then eased out with a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide
nearing the quarter, drifted outward leaving the turn and yielded the advantage mid-stretch, then relented later yards. STACIAS RUBY rounded the opening
turn in the three and four paths then closed to the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, was headed toward the three eighths, dueled at near even terms
from that point to the quarter pole, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. JACK'S RUCA entered the
first turn in the five path then stalked three wide from the nine sixteenths pole, took the nod nearing the three eighths, dueled at even terms from that point
but was caught at the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. WICKED WISDOM became fractious and laid down in the gate,
settled back toward the inside early, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened. UPTOWN BELLE settled off the rail on
the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. CALIFORNIA SUZY
broke a step slow and was never a factor. LOVE CALIFORNIA bobbled leaving the gate and never factored.

COASTAL MISSION settled off the pace through most of the backstretch then bid toward the five sixteenths pole, took over two deep approaching the top of
the stretch, ran clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled in the upper stretch, then taken in hand later yards. CHANGE YOUR LUCK set a
pressured early pace and dueled clear past the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail toward the eighth pole, proved no match in the lane, though, held
on for second. ONE NIGHT MIKE engaged in close early chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in from the head of the lane and was gaining on the
runner-up. FELICIAS CASTLE gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little further. WITNESS THE ENERGY pressured the early pace
but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and faded off the rail on the turn. LEG UP chased, raced off the rail on the turn then drifted into the lane.

HAPPY CHAMP stalked from the four path then challenged at the three eighths pole, took over leaving the five sixteenths, dueled clear two deep
approaching the top of the lane and was steadily handled to hold on well. ELEVATED FOREVER took the lead between horses into the first turn and rated
the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths and gave chase from that point, dropped back at the rail
nearing the head of the lane, though, finished evenly. GOOFY BOY settled back off the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. DESTINY'S CHARGE stalked in the three path then gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, but dropped back at the three eighths, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. LOOKIN' SMART came away a bit awkwardly then
mostly saved ground. SWING YOUR SWORD ran in the three path the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid only mildly leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path. FLAMING HOT had a slim brief early lead inside but dropped back at the rail at the nine
sixteenths pole and showed little after a half mile.
