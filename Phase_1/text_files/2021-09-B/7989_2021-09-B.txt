Footnotes
DIXIE JEN settled toward the rear, advanced four wide on the turn, moved out seven wide turning into upper stretch, engaged the new leader, dueled
outside that one and edged past late. SWEET REGARDS switched out heading up the backstretch stalking the leaders, advanced three to four wide outside
two rivals late on the turn to take a narrow lead at the top of the stretch, was engaged by a foe, dueled but was outfinished. MAX A MILLION RSS was
mid-pack inside foes but off the fence, went four to five wide on the turn, swung nine deep into upper stretch and ran on mildly. PARTYATTHECAPITAL was
unhurried early, went two to three wide on the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and gained some. BETTER DIALHOMME was lightly brushed at the
break, raced in the back half of the field, was forced five to six wide on the turn, moved out eight wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit but ran on.
DIVALICIOUS saved ground on the turn, failed to rally. WONTONTOMATO tracked from inside, shifted out three wide on the turn in pursuit of the leaders,
angled out for room in mid-stretch. INDIAN AFFAIR broke outwardly brushing a rival and forced to steady when in tight quarters, raced outside foes going
seven wide on the turn, was not a threat. SPANKEY THUNDER dueled outside, went three wide, came up empty. PREMEDITATED LILY dueled inside a
foe but in the two path, faded. Due to a timer malfunction the five furlong time was unavailable.

the backstretch, edged closer four wide on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch and chased the winner home. GRANDPA A. C. was unhurried early,
went three wide on the turn in last, came out in upper stretch and rallied. BUMBLEBEE was well back last but one early, began to advance two then three
wide on the turn, ran on. RINESHAFT chased the leaders five wide, weakened. SWEET BEAU ROLL was up close early, went three wide on the turn,
drifted in and bumped a rival causing a chain reaction about the three-sixteenths. FULL SUN raced in the back half of the field, went four to seven wide on
the turn, shifted in at the top of the stretch then veered back out to avoid the incident, ran on. W F RIP TIDE chased briefly, steadily dropped back five wide
and faded. LESTER'S MEMORY dueled inside a foe but off the rail, came up empty. CATABILITY tracked inside, was bumped into the rail in upper stretch
and fell, walked off. WAYLAY was mid-pack off the leaders, went two wide on the turn, was bumped into a rival in upper stretch and fell, walked off.
LINCOLN COUNTY KID was outpaced early, raced near or just off the rail, fell over stricken foes in upper stretch, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY, SWEET BEAU ROLL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH AND ORDERED UNPLACED FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE RESULTING IN A
CHAIN REACTION. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION FRACTIONAL SPLIT TIMES UNAVAILABLE, FINISH WAS HAND TIMED.
