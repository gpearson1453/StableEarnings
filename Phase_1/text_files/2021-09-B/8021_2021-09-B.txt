Footnotes
CAPSTONE GIRL lacked speed, swung to the seven path turning for home, drifted in lightly bumping LOOKS DON'T LIE near the three sixteenths pole,
continued closing and led late. I LOVE MAGEL sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. LOOKS DON'T LIE , wide
turning for home, raced between horses in upper stretch, was lightly bumped near the three sixteenths pole and rallied. BELLA BETTINA raced inside
horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary late effort. ISLAND PHILO bore in bumping MEXICALI ROSE at the start, saved ground on the turn chasing
the pace and weakened. LOOK WHAT I FOUND , checked in traffic entering the turn, circled foes, drifted extremely wide in the stretch and was gaining late.
MEXICALI ROSE , bumped at the start, worked between horses in the stretch and was steadied in close quarters near the three sixteenths pole. LONG
DISTANCE LOVE raced along the inner rail and was no factor. ZELDABORNE , steadied along entering the turn, circled foes and was in the seven path
turning for home. TIDAL WATERS , three deep chasing the pace on the turn, weakened. MOON BIZ , four deep leaving the turn, gave way. DISCREET
DOMINIQUE gave way and was eased late. An objection by the rider of LOOKS DON'T LIE against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not
allowed.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN sped clear early towards the rail, was joined near the five eighths and dueled with SICK PACK SARA past the three eighths, moved
clear under some coaxing leaving the five sixteenths, opened up a long lead under some right handed asking in mid stretch then continued well in front
while solidly hand ridden the final seventy yards. A GIRL NAMED JAC , bumped at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, was under asking
around the turn, stayed inside through the lane and finished up willingly. FACTORINTHEHEAT , between rivals mid turn, angled five wide into the lane and
offered a mild response. ASSUME , off slowly when bobbling inward and bumping with A GIRL NAMED JAC, raced well back into the turn, saved ground
nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and finished with decent energy between rivals. SICK PACK SARA moved up outside the winner near the five eighths
and poked a head in front, sparred to the three eighths, chased after failed to match strides then weakened through the drive. ALWAYS SOMETHING
stalked the dueling leaders, raced four wide under pressure into the lane and gave way. HASHTAG LUCKY , off slowly when breaking outward, straightened
and raced four wide into the turn, failed to kick on soon after and retreated.

Footnotes
HELLO BEAUTIFUL , a bit fractious in the gate, was brushed at the start, accelerated clear soon after, set the pace two wide under a light hold, came a bit
wider into the lane, increased her advantage after being shaken up near the three sixteenths and was kept to steady hand encouragement until the final
yards. COCONUT CAKE chased outside a rival, came three wide into the lane and finished up willingly to be clear for the place. NEVER ENOUGH TIME ,
off last after stumbling, recovered and edged up three wide into the turn, circled four wide under pressure into the lane but failed to seriously kick on.
PRAISE AND HONOR , urged along off the pace, raced two to three wide into the lane, shifted in late and had a mild response. FIFTEEN ROYALS came
out at the break and brushed with the winner, saved ground pursuing to upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
FERMAT lacked speed, steadied on a rival's heels entering the far turn, eased out on the bend, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed determinedly
outside horses and was up at the finish. ROBERT'S LUXURY , shuffled back at the start, raced between horses on the far turn, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and closed gamely. GATOR BITE saved ground on the turns stalking the pace, moved up along the rail to gain a short lead in mid stretch and
gave way grudgingly. LIGHTNING ROD saved ground on the turns, eased out to the two path for the stretch and weakened late. THIS ILL DEFEND , well
placed outside horses on the backstretch, raced four wide the far turn and flattened out. ESPECIALLEA raced along the inner the far turn and offer a mild
gain. POINT OF GRACE , inside horses most of the trip, was not a factor. STROLLED ON BY was no factor. JACK GAVE BACK was outrun. ELUSIVE
JESTER stalked the pace, raced in the three path on the far turn, failed to keep pace in upper stretch and was caught in traffic in mid stretch. MALIBU
HEAVEN stumbled at the break, set the pace in the two path and tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
DREAMALILDREAMOFU came away well and took up a stalking position off the rail, advanced two to three wide into the lane while under coaxing, was put
to stout right handed encouragement leaving the three sixteenths, sustained a grinding run while drifting out and got up in the final jumps. ARTFUL
SPLATTER sped clear early and dropped in to set a rated pace, widened the advantage around the far turn, responded when set down past the quarter
pole, switched over to her left lead while maintaining a clear lead near the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but just failed to hold. JOSIE edged up leaving the
chute and stalked outside the winner, advanced four wide outside that one into the lane, gave hard pursuit past the furlong grounds, was floated out some
inside the sixteenth marker and continued on with interest. MISS LESLIE , unhurried early while off the rail, came under a ride around the turn, circled five
wide into the stretch and closed steadily. SO DARN HOT drafted back after an alert break, raced removed from the inside and under asking around the turn,
moved up four wide into the stretch, kept on to about the sixteenth marker then flattened out late. LOOKIN DYNAMIC saved ground off the pace, eased out
in the drive but failed to rally. OFF TOPIC saved ground chasing the pace, angled three wide into the stretch and weakened. VILLANELLE dropped back
early, saved ground into the turn and lacked a response.

Footnotes
WONDRWHERECRAIGIS broke a bit awkwardly, quickly recovered and prompted the pace three wide outside KALU, moved to apply more pressure past
the five sixteenths, gained a slim lead while four wide into the lane, shook clear under a drive past mid stretch, wandered out a bit under left handed asking
near the sixteenth pole, was corrected with right handed encouragement and dug in gamely to prevail. JALEN JOURNEY rushed up between foes early,
eased back to stalk, shifted four wide with pursuit into the lane, drifted out from left handed rousing in mid stretch, drifted back in behind the winner near the
sixteenth pole, altered out, switched to his left lead in deep stretch and finished well to gain. KALU accelerated to the front soon after the start, set the pace
about two wide while being shadowed by WONDRWHERECRAIGIS, dug in past the five sixteenths and dueled in the three path into the lane, continued the
battle past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. WAR TOCSIN broke slowly, settled off the pace, circled four wide into the stretch and offered a mild kick.
WHISKEY AND YOU chased while saving ground and faded. LAKI broke outward, stalked outside a rival, failed to kick on while three wide into the stretch
and faded. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of JALEN JOURNEY against the winner alleging interference near the sixteenth pole,
WONDRWHERECRAIGIS was disqualified from first and placed second.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC , sent up along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, gained a short lead entering the turn, dueled inside ROADSTER around the
turn and in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and held sway under urging. CORDMAKER stalked the pace behind horses around the turn,
eased out at the head of the stretch, shut off ALWAYSMINING when drifting out inside the three sixteenths pole and rallie. PHAT MAN , unhurried outside
horses down the backstretch, circled foes four wide around the turn, floated to the five path turning for home and passed tired rivals. ROADSTER showed
speed outside the winner, dueled with that one to mid stretch and weakened the final furlong. MCELMORE AVENUE hugged the inner rail, offered a mild
move to the three sixteenths pole then weakened late. ALWAYSMINING , three wide in a forward position on the turn, floated out turning for home and was
checked when shut off by CORDMAKER near the three sixteenths pole. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of ALWAYSMINING,
CORDMAKER was disqualified and placed sixth.

Footnotes
SPARKLE SPRINKLE burst clear early, rated kindly while setting the pace towards the rail, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, was kept to a
solid drive to the sixteenth pole then cruised home from there. SWEET GRACIE bore out at the break, was straightened and edged up four wide outside
rivals, stalked four wide around the turn and into the lane, failed to make headway on the winner from the three sixteenths but stayed willingly enough for the
place. LUNA BELLE ran off a bit with her rider pre race, was rated off the pace three wide outside rivals, came four wide for the drive and had late interest
between rivals. MAESTRIA bobbled outward at the break and bumped with SHE'S MO BETTER, regrouped and tracked the winner two to three wide, failed
to seriously kick on under pressure past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. BENEATH THE STARS stumbled badly at the break spotting the
field several lengths, recovered and settled well back, angled out with some momentum mid turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and came on late. SHE'S
MO BETTER , bumped at the break, moved up and stalked three wide, dropped in around the turn and faded. HAPPY TAPPY TIM , off the pace, raced
between rivals leaving the far turn, shifted out some and came up empty. TOY TIGER saved ground, checked sharply near the three eighths and gave way.

Footnotes
SKY'S NOT FALLING saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, split horses inside the eighth pole and
drove clear. SUE LOVES BARBADOS bumped with ALL THREES at the break, patiently rated behind horses around the turn and closed strongly between
rivals. ROCK THE BOAT , a forward factor three deep around the turn, drifted to the five path in mid stretch and flattened out. RAILMASTER set a
pressured pace along the inner rail and gradually weakened in the drive. POWER BACK , four wide on the turn, drifted to the six path in mid stretch and
lacked the needed rally. ALL THREES bumped with SUE LOVES BARBADOS leaving the starting gate and was not a factor. JOSEPH prompted the pace
two wide, drifted to the three path when taking a short lead in mid stretch and weakened.
