Footnotes
SHIMMERING DREAM settled well, commenced a bid on the turn and rallied strongly in the stretch. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO outrun early, entered the
stretch three wide and managed a belated bid. GIRLS IN CHARGE forced the pace between foes, lost her position on the turn and kept on in the stretch.
BLUSHING SCARLETT forwardly placed, took over leaving the turn and was worn down late. CALL THE SHOTS never menaced. GOLD MAKER led early
and retreated.

advanced on the turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. MOLLECK stalked the pace, got outpaced leaving the turn and kept on in the stretch. HE'S
SO ZAZZY passed tired ones. EAST MOON LAKE chased outside and lacked a rally. EPIC (ARG) bothered at the start, was outpaced while four wide and
made no impact. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP raced forwardly along the inside and weakened. RONNIE CLOUD took no part.
