Footnotes
RB BAMER broke slowly, was hard sent ridden from inside down the backstretch, waited near the three eighths pole, split rivals at the quarter pole and
finished determined late to get up under strong handling. JODYMAN AA vied for the early lead from the inside, led late but couldn't hold off the winner to
finish second best. RB RICH RATH was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced four deep into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. RB
RATH was hustled along while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. HIGHH
DEMAND dropped back early on, raced along the inside around the far turn and showed late interest. GAILSMASQUERADE was slow early on, raced six
deep near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. RECKLESS LOVE MHF was off step slow, drifted out to the seven or eight path around the far
turn into the upper stretch and never threatened. VAZS GONNA BURN SV was hustled early on, raced four wide at the three eighths pole and tired. The
quarter mile fractional time was unavailable.
