Footnotes
RAPUNZEL'S DREAM raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the far turn, launched a determined stretch drive and was up just in time.
GEA settled off the pace, was steadied behind rivals mid turn, chased four-wide into the stretch, rallied gamely but was outkicked. JILL bumped with
BOBBI'S LEGACY at the start, led into the first turn, set the pace, dueled on the far turn, shook clear upper stretchy but was caught on the wire. BOBBI'S
LEGACY, bumped with her rival leaving the gate, stalked the pace, dueled on the far turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and finished under a
determined drive. FOR KICKS, in range, was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn but was lugging in through the stretch and evened out late. FLAT
OUT VIXEN settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn then rallied along the fence. STORMY DERBY DAY raced in mid pack, chased angling
from the rail to three-wide late turn, rallied, but evened out late. CALAIS COVE, in range, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but had no response in
deep stretch. WILBURNRUBBER raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the final turn but flattened out in the final furlong. SECRET ARCHANGEL
stalked the pace, dropped back on the far turn but lacked a rally. NAKED ILLUSION settled in mid pack, dropped to the rear on the far turn but lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
COURTLY MANNER chased the open length leader throughout, had dead aim in upper stretch and got by at the seventy yard marker despite being herded
out by that rival. O'KRATOS quickly opened a clear lead, maintained that advantage until midstretch, drifted out at the sixteenth pole and was caught by the
winner at the seventy yard marker, continuing to come out on that rival to the wire. EPILOGUE trailed into the far turn, split rivals early on that bend and
tipped out three to four wide before angling out inside a rival turning for home, came best of all down the stretch with a nice rally. GORGEOUS KITTEN
midpack and along the rail throughout, still in range inside into the stretch but was all out to hold the show late. CERRADO midpack and along the inside
early and down the backside, came three wide on the far turn and closed widest outside the show horse down the lane. ARTISTICO had his head in the air
at the start and trailed four to two wide on the first turn, advanced three wide down the backside into midapck, was two to three wide on the far turn but his
rally stalled in the final sixteenth. SUITEDCONNECTED off the pace and three to two wide on the first turn, advanced inside on the far turn but stalled inside
the final seventy yards. LEONARD'S BAY was four to three wide on the first turn in midpack, came two to three wide still in range on the far turn but ran out
of run in the final sixteenth of a mile. AM PREPARED hesitated at the start and was well back, came up the inside and caught the rear runners down the
backside, was steadied behind a tiring foe before the far turn and evened out down the lane in the final furlong while in tight along the rail. SPA JAZZ
chased the top pair in third until midway on the far turn but could not carry on, passed by numerous rivals in the final sixteenth. PERLARANA sat in midpack
along the rail, began to lose ground into the far turn and retreated from there.

Footnotes
BABY DRIVER under a hold and eased into a rail position in midpack late on the turn, steadied in behind rivals waiting for room early on the bend, got up
inside into the stretch and angled out to the four path, drove by the embattled leader at the eighth pole and opened up, holding a clear margin to the wire.
DELIGHTFUL DREAMER had one rival beat into the turn, followed the winner's path along the inside and angled out at the eighth pole, clearly second best
but the winner was gone. DEVINE DANCING led quickly, was stalked and pressed by a rival and headed late on the turn, repulsed that one and had a clear
lead in upper stretch but caught by the winner at the eighth pole, tiring but game for show. ELFIN FOREST was off the pace, circled two to four wide on the
turn and fanned out into the nine path turning for home, closing well outside and just missing the show spot late. MIA'S AUTHORITY sat three wide in
midpack down the backside, in range when two to three wide on the turn and appeared to be losing ground by the quarter pole, but regrouped down the
lane to inch up for a minor award. THE TWELFTH stalked the leader under a hold early, pressed that one on the turn and had her nose in front briefly after
the quarter pole, but the leader was too tough and she dropped back in upper stretch, losing ground late. DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE off the pace and five
wide early, was in contention while four wide on the turn and into the eight path turning for home, evening out in the final furlong. PAPA'S SILVER was
bumped by a rival at the start and four wide in midpack, still in the three path on the turn and dropping back but was resurgent when dropping inside in
upper stretch only to stall in the final sixteenth. PARABLE chased along the inside, angled out to take dead aim into the stretch but had no bid, the rider up
in the saddle when dropping back in the final sixteenth. YOU THRILL ME trailed into the stretch, tipped out between rivals in upper stretch and showed
some late interest, striding past tiring foes. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ broke out and bumped a rival at the start, stalked in the three path throughout and
fanned into the six path turning for home but her bid stalled in the final furlong. AUDITION off the pace, had two rivals beat while three wide on the turn and
was never in contention. MY DAD ROCKS sat between rivals and chasing the top pair, began to leak oil midway on the turn and retreated from there.
