Footnotes
POPPY'S C NOTE tracked the top two early leaders then hustled inside around the turn, cut the corner and slipped through the inside of FREESTONE near
the sixteenth pole, gained a slim lead and held firm under a driving finish. FREESTONE quickly cleared on top and saved ground on the first turn, showed
the way through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, hustled up two wide heading into the lane, fought back when challenged by rail running
winner in late stages but could not get back by. LOOSE BALL raced in the last flight through early stages then picked up the pace around the far turn,
hustled along three wide through the lane and cleared show. LIBERTY'S FINALE was forwardly placed behind the pacesetter through the backstretch, was
ridden along around the far turn, went three wide into the lane then flattened in the final furlong. PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE raced in the last flight, went
three to four wide into the lane and had no response. PREMIER LEAGUE tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch, failed to progress under
pressure around the far turn then steadily weakened.

AWESOME DAZE sped to the lead out of the gate, held on top by a comfortable margin while racing in hand leaving the turn, tapped on the shoulder a
couple times in the stretch, responded willingly, accelerated to a commanding lead and finished ridden out. DANCE BALLERINA was a step slow at the start
and raced off the early pace, took closer order while ridden inside on the turn, tipped out three wide for the drive, was no match for the clear winner but
stayed on with solid response and finished clearly second best. CALLIOPE SONG was forwardly placed behind the leader in early stages, stayed in pursuit
three to four wide through the lane and secured a share. PERCY'S SIS chased inside around the turn then went two wide into the lane and had no late
response. MIST OONA B broke in at the start, raced in range around the turn, went five wide turning for home then drifted inside under right handed
pressure near the furlong marker and faded. GET IT GIRL was declared a non-starter for not receiving a fair start. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY
LOOKING INTO THE START, AFTER REVIEW STEWARDS DETERMINED GET IT GIRL DID NOT RECIEVE A FAIR START AND WAS DECLARED A

Footnotes
QUEEN BREEZY was confidently piloted racing well off the early pace, swung five wide entering the lane, gathered sharp momentum under right handed
pressure in the upper stretch and swept by in final strides. YOU GO GIRL was off to a good start and advanced to engage JUDICIAL for the early lead,
dueled outside of rival into stretch run, battled on gamely and edged away to a slim lead then got denied when the winner swept by late. IN THE WIND
raced off the embattled duo through early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane, ranged up to race in striking distance in the final sixteenth then
finished evenly. JUDICIAL broke on top and quickly came under attack from YOU GO GIRL, dueled inside rival into stretch run, stayed on gamely past the
furlong marker then had no late response left in reserve. OUR LYLA GRACE raced in contention off the top flight, failed to progress under pressure around
the turn and gave way.

DEEPINGREEN raced three to four wide around the first turn and tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch, responded willingly when called upon
and moved up four wide leaving the turn, advanced to command and held clear under a driving finish. REMEMBERTOBREATHE was allowed to settle in
opening stages and rated off the clear top trio, saved ground and took closer order late on the far turn, stayed after DEEPINGREEN with solid response but
could not reach the winner and had to settle for second best. CITY STEEL was unhurried in the back, swung five wide turning for home and gained a share.
FAR WEST was forwardly placed behind the pacesetter, made a move near the three eighths pole, dueled outside of FATS DOMINUS on the far turn then
faded in the lane. FATS DOMINUS showed the way through the backstretch, dueled inside of FAR WEST around the far turn then retreated in the lane.

DIEM NOW bumped with rival at the start, tracked the leaders racing outside foes in the second flight, took closer then launched a bid for command near the
quarter pole, advanced to challenge A FILLY CAN DREAM entering the top stretch, responded under right handed pressure, accelerated to the lead and
finished going away. A FILLY CAN DREAM was forwardly placed around the first turn then dueled with LINDAS BALLET through the backstretch, shook
free nearing the far turn, fought back when challenged by the winner at the head of the lane then failed to be a match past the furlong marker. LOOKOUT
TAYLOR rated off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane, stayed on with response between foes at the eighth pole and prevailed for a
share. SMASHING SUCCESS was unhurried and saved ground, angled out and urged three wide into the lane then finished evenly. AVILLES raced
between foes off the top flight, swung five wide into the lane then gave way. LINDA'S BALLET held a slim lead around the first turn, vied inside of A FILLY
CAN DREAM through the backstretch then steadily weakened. SECRETS OF MY SOUL raced inside of foes in the second flight then had no response
when called upon. LAKER JET raced off the pace, went five wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

PRINCE OF LUCK sped to the lead and angled inside in opening stages, held firm around the turn then saved ground into the lane, had more left in reserve
and kept clear under steady encouragement. MORE HONOR tracked the leader into the turn, launched a two wide bid at the quarter pole then sustained a
steady bid through the lane for second best. DOCTOR BRUCE S. broke in and brushed with foes at the start, chased near midrange around the turn, swung
five to six wide into the lane and finished with response to gain show. OFFICER OF WAR raced in range up the inside, drifted out wider late on the turn,
kept on four wide in stretch run then finished evenly. ROCKET POWER chased inside then two wide into the lane and had no late kick. MR BINGLEY saved
ground and never threatened. NORSKI got bumped at the start, raced off the pace then two to three wide into the lane and failed to move on. BENNY THE
JET raced in range then weakened late on the turn.

SUNSHINE BEACH raced in pursuit for the leader around the turn, was set down three to four wide in the lane, took command from COASTAL RUN near
mid-stretch and pulled away. COASTAL RUN sprinted to a commanding lead in early stages, went two wide into the lane, got collared by the winner near
mid-stretch and just lasted for place. FOR YOU ONLY chased the pace along inside on the turn, saved ground into the lane and just missed place.
SUDDENLY WINNING raced off the pace, saved ground and lacked a needed rally. IT'S CURLIN TIME raced in the back then three wide into the lane and
never threatened. LUTES LIL GIFT chased the pace around the turn then faded. SACAGEWEA raced three to four wide around the turn and never
menaced.

Footnotes
WILSON TO LOCKETT rated off the clear top trio through the backstretch, was ridden along around the far turn, was set down three to four wide in the
upper stretch, swept to the lead past the furlong marker then held late under a driving finish. PERFECT COME BACK raced off the pace, responded five
wide at the head of the lane, rallied and cleared second best. TURNAROUND raced three wide around the first turn then advanced to challenge MIKE
MAN"S GOLD for the early lead, dueled through the backstretch, was no match when the winner took over past the furlong marker but stayed on and
captured show. MIKE MAN'S GOLD sped to the lead at the start, came under attack from TURNAROUND leaving the first turn, dueled through the
backstretch, battled on and held as slim lead at the eighth pole then got collared by the winner and gave way. DAVID NOSE BEST tracked the top two
leaders through early stages then roused three to four wide and had no response. CHOTEAU saved ground and never threatened.
