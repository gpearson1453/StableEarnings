BEVERLY'S CHARGE stalked the pace early, made a three wide bid into the lane, drove past the leaders three wide while lugging in and cleared the field in
the final stages. TRIPLE P was a bit slow at the start, tracked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid from between horses down
the lane and was up for place in the final stages. SWEET ANNABELLA set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run.
SLUSHY raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. LEGALLY LUCKY was slow at the start and trailed the
field early on, raced in the three path into the lane and improved position down the lane. VINEGAR VEGGIES was a bit rank early on, chased the pace, was
in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. CURBS AND CONES was a bit slow at the start, chased the pace early, made a four wide bit
into the lane but was empty down the lane. WITH CAUSE was never a factor. LOLA FLO was a bit slow at the start and done early.

GIGGING raced back early on, was in the three path along the far turn, in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the drifting out leader
from the inside and cleared the field in the final stages. EXULTING came out at the start, raced three wide along the first turn, was in the three path along
the far turn, took over command near the five sixteenths pole, cleared the field into the lane from the five path, drifted out down the lane and faltered late in
the drive. ZANESVILLE was bumped and bothered at the start, raced in the three path along the first turn, was in the seven path into the lane with a mild
gain late in the stretch run. ALTITO was bumped and bothered at the start, raced in the two to three path along the first turn, was in the seven path into the
lane and moved up in the stretch run. POSITIVE VIBES raced in the four path along the far turn, was in the six path into the lane and no threat. RANSACK
chased the pace early, raced in the two to three path along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. JAMMERS JUSTICE
tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and empty down the lane. HUGH B. set the pace for a half then folded up.

Footnotes
JESUIT prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane sparking a duel with the early pace setter, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong
grounds, and maintained an advantage to the wire. FIREMAN DAN set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist JESUIT's bid entering the lane, dueled
before being headed at the furlong grounds, then fought on gamely thereafter, but was bested. DEALMEINBUD stalked three wide, then from between
horses turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair in upper stretch, and chased them home well. WILLIE HAS HART stalked along the
inside, chased from the two path entering the lane, and faded late. CACHIRULO tracked two wide, but failed to produce a bid. DECLARE THE MOON was
off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. RITHMICALLEA tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the leaders turning for home, but
flattened out entering the lane, and tired. WAR ALLY failed to factor while two wide and far off of the pace, and hung on his left lead through the lane.
GREAT NORTH lied at the rear of the field four wide around the turn, and never got involved. DELTA NINE was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BEST OF GREELEY set the pace along the inside, met a pair of outer bids turning for home, shook clear approaching the furlong grounds, and safely held
sway with good energy through the late stages. IDENTITY POLITICS broke a step slowly, saved ground off of the pace, trailed entering the lane, but rallied
along the rail in upper stretch, slipped inside of outer foes to claim place a sixteenth out, and continued to gain on the clear leader late. MOUNT TRAVERS
stalked along the inside and in the two path around the turn, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader
thereafter, and was outkicked by an inner foe for place at the sixteenth pole. SUPER SOL trailed early on, took the turn in the four path, and stayed on
mildly through the lane without menacing. MY MAN FLINTSTONE stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, vied outside of BEST OF GREELEY
in upper stretch, but was repelled approaching the furlong grounds, and faltered between horses leaving that junction. CENTRIFUGE lied off of the pace in
the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. BELLE TAPISSERIE prompted the pace two wide, but yielded between horses entering the lane, and
weakened.

Footnotes
PENNY SAVER managed a loose and uncontested lead in to the far turn, met GOLEN SIGHTS's bid around that bend, but responded when let loose
passing the quarter pole, then drew off and widened under driving pressure through midstretch before being ridden out through the late stages. GOLDEN
SIGHTS stalked two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but was swiftly repelled passing the quarter pole, and proved second best.
BLAMETHECHAMPAGNE tracked the pace from the two path, chased the clear leader while under urging around the far turn, but failed to keep pace in
upper stretch, greenly delayed his lead change to the furlong grounds, and kept on to secure show thereafter. CHOPIN DRIVE stalked along the inside, but
failed to produce a bid. BUNDUKI settled off of the pace three wide, gained turning for home, but ducked out in upper stretch from left handed urging,
straightened temporarily before lugging out through the final sixteenth, and failed to factor. TONE IT UP broke a step slowly, lied at the rear of the field two
wide, and made no impact. LUCKYWISE was outrun. EMERALD saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
SIR ALFRED JAMES set the pace outside of a vying DRENA'S STAR, drew off when let out passing the quarter pole, and widened under driving pressure
through the lane. COLTONATOR stalked along the inside from the two path into the turn, shifted outside of the dueling leaders in an attempt to produce a
bid, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch while bidding for place, then edged away from an inner foe for that position through the final
sixteenth. DRENA'S STAR vied for the lead inside of SIR ALFRED JAMES, but proved no match for that foe passing the quarter pole, chased while inside
of a place-bidding COLTONATOR through the lane, but was bested for that position a sixteenth from home. VERB saved ground off of the pace, then kept
on for a minor share while not threatening the leaders. LONG TERM THINKING bumped an outer foe at the start, then saved ground far off of the pace
around the turn, but made little impact. DEAN MARTINI got bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied at the rear of the field in the three path into the turn,
altered course five wide out from behind rivals in midstretch, but lacked a true rally. SHOPLIFTED lied off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. TOP
GUNNER pressed the pace three wide, but faded after being floated four wide entering the lane. ABSOLUTE CHAOS lied forwardly placed four wide,
chased into the turn, then faded turning for home.

Footnotes
UNIFIED REPORT stalked three wide, bid entering the lane, cleared passing the furlong grounds as REWIRE took aim, but safely held to the wire. REWIRE
stalked four wide, chased through midstretch before gaining on the leader late, but did not have enough to catch that foe. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE vied two
wide, briefly cleared at the five sixteenths pole before meeting UNIFIED REPORT's bid entering the lane, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, and
yielded passing the furlong pole. HELAIRE tracked from midpack in the two path, swung five wide turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share.
LITTLE MAN CAN lied far back in the three path into the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and improved. MONEY LENDER bumped with inner
foes leaving the chute, saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. HEFFNER rushed to vie for the lead along the
inside, but yielded at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. COUNTRIFIED took bumps from both sides while in tight between rivals
leaving the chute, lied at the rear of the field two wide into the turn, then passed tired foes late. SIDE BET was bumped by an outer foe at the start, then
bumped with outer stacking rivals leaving the chute, and was outrun along the inside. MAMANEEDSNEWSHOES settled far off of the pace in the four path
around the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. MR LOOOCH was very reluctant to load, then chased from the two path
around the turn before weakening. FATHER PATRICK broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, then got pinched between horses leaving the chute,
and was outrun.
