Footnotes
EKATI CHAMPAGNE made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace off the rail, dropped inside on the turn, drifted from the two wide to the six
path when put to a left handed whip, brushed the runner up near the wire and just lasted. BANDERAS bumped at the start, was in tight nearing the turn,
dropped to the rail, shifted back outside the winner past the quarter pole, was carried out through deep stretch, brushed nearing the wire and just missed.
UNCLE KEVIN never far back, surged four wide through the turn, drew on near even terms for the lead in the seven path nearing the furlong maker and was
outfinished despite a game effort. BAR CAT bumped at the start then failed to menace. FLEET RUN was bumped then in tight between rivals at the start
then failed to reach contention. OUR TIME had speed four wide into the turn then weakened. SCOOP THE CASH pressed the early pace three wide then
faltered in the stretch. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF BANDERAS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGNAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

CHOCOLATE SOLDIER was hustled along the gain a narrow lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear under right handed
urging, was put to a left handed whip late and just lasted. BO RHAPSODY never far back, swung wide and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage
late in the six path. ONLY ONE WAY BACK pressed the pace between horses two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. KRAZY HAWK trailed into the
stretch and found his best stride late in the four path. REACHNFORASIXPACK pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. ANGEL'S
SOUPERSTAR was no factor. OUR MAGICAL GIRL had speed into the turn, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off.
