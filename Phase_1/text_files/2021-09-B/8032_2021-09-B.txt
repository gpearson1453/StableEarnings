Footnotes
MARAIS stumbled a bit leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, circled five-wide late turn, veered in and bumped SIMPLE SOUVENIR upper stretch then rallied
and was just up under a drive. TRADING BAY stalked the pace, chased into the stretch, shifted out to gain a clear path, gained command in deep stretch
but was caught on the wire. NERO DAVOLA settled in mid pack, closed into the stretch, angled out and rallied outside the field. RIDE THE WIND stalked
the pace, closed late turn, bid a 16th out but failed to capitalize and weakened late. FOURTEEN DAYS led quickly but briefly and forced the new pacesetter,
chased into the stretch, led a furlong out but gave way late. OLD SECRETS, steadied at the start, raced in mid pack along the rail and chased through the
stretch. SIMPLE SOUVENIR settled in mid pack, chased four-wide into the stretch, was bumped then finished gamely in vain. FRAME THIS, away slowly
and off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, showed some run but did not menace. SEAMIALAUGH raced in
mid pack, was hustled on the turn then finished evenly. LOADED QUESTION gained a short early lead, set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong out and
retreated.

Footnotes
FOREST DRIFT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, recovered quickly to lead, was stalked and pressed by an eager foe until the turn for home,
opened up a clear lead by the eighth pole and held a diminishing margin of victory to the wire. SILVER DAHLIA was four wide and in midpack down the
backside, dropped back a bit while three wide until midturn, regained momentum late on the bend and tipped out into the five path into the stretch, closing
resolutely but running out of real estate. ASHA IRONBORN tracked the two leaders along the inside, still in behind the winner turning for home and stayed
game between rivals to garner the show spot. IMA BEAST stalked the leader down the backside, moved up to press that one on the turn and stayed on in
second until the final seventy yards, giving up positions at that stage. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL ducked in at the start, sat between rivals and off the pace
down the backstretch, got on the rail on the turn and squeezed up inside tiring rivals down the lane while glued to the fence to get a small share.
STARLIGHT RIDGE trailed early, came from near the rear two to four wide on the turn and swung widest into the stretch, closing well outside them all in the
final furlong. WINYAH BAY was bumped at the start and trailed, rallied inside on the turn into midpack but her mild rally stalled in the later stages of the
stretch. MRS. DEL chased the leaders while three wide, loomed outside turning for home but did not change leads down the lane and tired in the final
sixteenth. SHE'S GOT MOVES was five wide in midpack early, off the pace and three to four wide on the turn and on the flank of the eventual place finisher
by the quarter pole, but her rally was mild and not effective. HAI BOBBI steadied when in behind rivals down the backside, near the rear on the turn and
could only inch up down the lane without threatening. TAKOTA sat in midpack and hard held early, advanced between rivals on the turn but was outrun in
the final sixteenth. SPEEDY LYNN along the rail and off the pace, rallied into midpack on the turn but couldn't sustain her momentum down the lane after
angling out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MUSICAL RIDE settled in mid pack, came two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied and swept by the leader in the late
stages. PLEDGE, in range, came two to four-wide through the turn, rallied gamely, led in the final furlong but was passed late. BODACIOUS MISS raced in
mid pack, rode the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out between rivals. ANTIGONE, settled off the pace, chased
three-wide late turn then closed gamely. PILOT EPISODE, in range, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn then gained gradually through the stretch.
GLORIANNIA had brief speed, angled out in the stretch then finished evenly. HELLO FRIENDS settled in mid pack, closed four-wide into the stretch but
failed to menace. SPEIGHTSTOWN SHIRL stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn then evened out in the final 16th. FAIRYWREN, in
range, chased three-wide into the stretch, was blocked a 16th out then closed late. GREY SEAL set the early pace, dueled on the turn, shook clear into the
stretch but was passed in the final furlong. TEACHER'S PET raced from off the pace, saved ground on the turn then posted a mild rally and did not threaten.
QUEEN'S SPEED was rated off the pace, angled five-wide closing late turn but never reached contention. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD moved up to press the
pace, dueled on the turn, yielded approaching the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FAST FEET cleared from his outside post with purpose, throttled down around the first turn while confusion reigned supreme in behind him, held a length
advantage until midway on the far turn and then sprinted clear, maintaining his advantage to the wire. BRUTALITY hopped at the start and was pinched
back soon after, trailed by open lengths, advanced in between rivals on the far turn and had to tap on the brakes, three wide on that bend and out into the
five path in upper stretch, closing resolutely while widest to get by all except the winner whose advantage was too great to overcome. RAPPER ZAPPER
was three wide chasing into the first turn before being fanned out five or six wide by a drifting out rival, settled in to chase the winner three wide down the
backside, bid outside a rival while still three wide on the far turn but the winner sprinted away, besting his stalking rival but caught for place in the later
stages by a closing foe. LAMENT broke in at the start, was fanned out between runners when a rival to his inside tried to bolt into the first turn, settled in to
stalk the winner inside a rival down the backstretch, bid on the far turn but the winner ran away, then lost the show spot late to his stalker companion.
HAGEMEISTER PARK three wide and off the pace through the first turn, hustled two to three wide on the far turn, drifted in to the rail in upper stretch before
running evenly down to the wire in the three path. LITHUANIAN KING sat in midpack early, rallied two to five wide on the far turn and was fanned out by the
eventual second place finisher into the six path at the top of the lane, running evenly to the wire outside. INNUENDO chased along the inside and stayed out
of the traffic problem on the first turn, in behind the stalkers on the far turn but had no response when angled out in the stretch. THRILL OF THE DAY was
rank and erratic trying to get out into the first turn starting a chain reaction bumping incident, settled down along the rail on the backside but faded down the
stretch. ETHNIC SOUL broke out at the start, sat off the pace along the rail and never put in a bid despite the relatively safe journey.

STORMY SOUL led early, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch then held bravely under a drive. THERE'S NO JOE stalked the pace,
chased two-wide into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. MIRACLE SILVER stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide late turn then rallied
gamely. TORONTOTORO showed brief speed then forced the pace, was cleared by the leader at the top of the stretch, chased, but evened out late.
SACRED OATH settled off the pace, came three-wide late turn, angled out mid stretch and finished gamely. DESOLATOR settled off the pace, came
four-wide late turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch and chased once clear. SPEEDY BOLT stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch but
leveled off in the final furlong. READY HERO got away slowly and settled off the pace, angled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and did
not menace but closed a gap. TAKE A CHANCE raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was blocked in mid stretch, moved off the wood and rallied late.
SEE FOREVER settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, encountered traffic upper stretch and offered no closing response. JUST LIKE LARRY was
herded at the start, settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn then failed to menace in the stretch. GOSPEL WAY settled off the pace,
was hustled five-wide late turn but never reached contention. THREEFIFTYSEVEN, in mid pack early, chased four-wide into the stretch but tired a furlong
out. LOMAKI'S GEM broke outward, stalked on the turn, chased four-wide into the stretch and tired upper stretch.

Footnotes
CLOUD PLAY came up inside the early leader when that one seemed indifferent to be on top, dueled with that foe throughout, exchanging the advantage
several times, eventually edging away in the final seventy yards. STYLISH GENT had the front but allowed the eventual winner up his inside, dueled with
that one until being outgamed in the final stages. HIDDEN HONOR off the pace early, began picking off rivals around the turn and continued to close down
the lane, ending up on the flank of the two embattled duelers but the wire came too soon for him to finish them off. MIDNIGHT ARKLE chased the duelers
along the inside, was still in behind them turning for home but could not match their energy and lost the show late to a closing rival. REPEAT THE HEAT
settled outside a rival chasing the duelers, oufinished by that rival and unable to match the top trio's energy as well. WINSTON BLUE leapt up at the start
and was well off the pace, came rail to three wide on the turn and out into the five path in upper stretch, continuing to pass rivals in the stretch without too
much urging. COO BIRD off the pace early, came three wide on the turn into range but was outkicked when levelling off in the final sixteenth. BROADWAY
SKY sat in midpack while two wide early, came up between rivals on the turn but levelled off in the final furlong. SHAMBO midpack and along the inside on
the turn but did not respond when asked for his best from there and down the stretch. SIR ALFREDTHEFIRST trailed into the turn and passed a few
stragglers down the stretch. ANSELMO outside and off the pace, trailed at the quarter and never in contention. BIG BAD BEAST broke in at the start, sat in
midpack on the rail and retreated from mid turn.

approaching the wire. DESERT ENCOUNTER (IRE) bumped with BLUEGRASS PARKWAYS leaving the gate, settled off the pace, chased two-wide into
the stretch, angled out upper stretch and rallied gamely. PRIMO TOUCH led quickly, drew off a comfortable margin, set a reserved pace, drifted out at the
top of the stretch, was quickly passed and chased to the end and held show. ENGLISH CONQUEROR settled in mid pack, began his rally late turn and
chased through the stretch. BELICHICK raced in mid pack, chased three-wide late turn but flattened out in the final furlong. CORELLI raced in mid pack,
was hustled along the rail on the far turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY bumped with a rival at the break, settled off
the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the final turn but never reached contention. FANTASIOSO (ARG) raced from off the pace, came two to

Footnotes
EMBOLDEN sat three wide in midpack early, came three to four wide on the turn to loom outside the leaders, seemed to stall in midstretch but regrouped
under strong handling and surged late to grab the top prize with a fortuitous head bob on the money. WESTERN TROUBLE drifted in at the start and
brushed a rival, sat outside the leaders while under restraint, advanced two to four wide on the turn and exchanged the lead with the eventual fourth place
finisher late on the turn and in early stretch, getting the best of that foe in the shadow of the wire only to be caught by the winner right on the money.
SOLIDIFY chased the leaders along the inside, found a big hole to drive through down the stretch and surged late to be one of four in a line at the wire.
RECONFIGURE led early, was allowed to stalk the early leader, moved with a rival and exchanged the front with that one late on the turn and in upper
stretch, hung late when on the shortest end of a four horse finish. SOUPER SUCCESS led while under stalking and pressing pressure throughout, gave up
the front and appeared done at the quarter pole but battled back on gamely and stayed on until the final stages, within a length of the top four finishers.
SPEEDY HANS bothered by a drifting in rival at the start, rallied three to four wide on the turn but was outkicked down the lane when the late pace heated
up. SILENT JIMMIE trailed early, came with a visually pleasing rally in the final furlong when the pace heated up and room opened up. IKERRIN ROAD
(IRE) was off the pace early and along the inside, closed on the fence but the late pace was too quick to allow a effective rally. DIXIE'S GAMBLE advanced
between rivals on the turn but was no match for the energy of the top finishers in the stretch. FORESTER'S TURN brushed the side of the gate and lost the
rider just out of the gate.
