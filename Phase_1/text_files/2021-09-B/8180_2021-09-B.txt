Footnotes
MILORDS OATHKEEPER broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with GENERAL THAYER, vied with that rival into deep stretch, drifted out
slightly, edged away from that rival and was fully extended to hold STONUS MAXIMUS late. STONUS MAXIMUS was bumped at the start then was
reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. GENERAL THAYER drifted out through the first
turn, dueled for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way thereafter. RAISED A REDHEAD was
bumped at the break, settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly. NOW SAY SO lagged early, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and did not
menace. TAZEETI drifted out through the first turn, raced off the leaders throughout and was not a factor. THE RIDER OF GENERAL THAYER LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST MILORDS OATHKEEPER CONCNERING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT IT DID NOT EFFECT THE OUTCOME AND MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MORNING BLURS was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with TEASPOON OF PEPPER while racing from the inside, opened a clear
margin nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off with complete authority. TEASPOON OF PEPPER drifted out through the first turn, disputed the pace with
the winner while racing four-wide and yielded to that rival through the final sixteenth. COSMIC TRIPSTER chased the dueling leaders while racing four-wide
and failed to gain in the drive. SHE FLYS FOREVER lacked early speed, saved ground throughout and did not menace. SLIGHTLY lagged far back
throughout and was eased through the lane.

SPEEDY TOM was away in good order, opened a clear margin and veered in towards the gap, was quickly straightened away, remained in control
throughout and held sway to wire. EQUIVOCATOR chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout, could not reach that rival in the drive but finished
willingly. GABBY TOM was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed late response. PACKRAT BRANT settled off the
leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. DUTCH COLONEL was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second
turn and was not a factor. LONGFORD showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention.

BRETT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole, came in
nearing the furlong marker and quickly drew off. SIZZLING GRACE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with
a steady bid. BOSS HUGO set a pressured pace from the inside, steadied nearing the furlong marker, angled out and finished willingly to gain the show.
MISTER G. Q. was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. I'M NOT GABBY pressed
the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. KEEN JAMES settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened.
KIJANI was off slow, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. THE RIDER OF BOSS HUGO LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST BRETT CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE EIGHTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS
CONCLUDED THAT BRETT HAD CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUILIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD.

DUTCH MAMA stalked the pace of THECHAMPISFLORING while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive, was up in the final yards and
going away late. THECHAMPISFLORING sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, increased her advantage through the
back-stretch but could not resist the winner late. BIG ENOUGH was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. BARBELLO (NZ) showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending
position but failed to sustain her bid. PARKERS ROSE settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. SHEZ A GRINDER
showed brief speed, was carried out through the first turn and did not contend thereafter.
