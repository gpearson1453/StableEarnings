leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole. RUN ON ENERGY settled
back toward the inside on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far
turn then dug in through the lane to take third later yards. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW stalked off the rail then bid toward the three eighths pole, but, dropped
back into the far turn and flattened stride the final furlong. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure

JUBA'S HOUSE engaged in close chase and took the nod past the five sixteenths pole, drew clear leaving the quarter and held well under steady stretch
handling. MY PRETTY EYES gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. DEREKA'S BLUFF broke outward to make contact with
Got Any and was jostled from the inside a short stride later, chased through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals in
the lane. CARSON CASTLE was bumped outward and into Dereka's Bluff at the break then picked up the chase through the backstretch, ran in the three
path of the turn, angled to the outside entering the stretch and passed rivals. FIFTY GRAY SHADES broke outward to make contact with Carson Castle,
gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, then flattened inside the eighth pole. MADDY MACHEN rated a slim lead
toward the inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole and gave up the lead past the pole, dropped back at the rail into the far turn then
weakened. GOT ANY was bumped at the break and never factored.

SINGING HARMONY chased toward the outside then took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane, dueled briefly clear mid-stretch, dug in
under steady encouragement and just lasted. MOJO MATTERS broke in to make contact with Corky Cowgirl then picked up the chase toward the outside,
rounded the turn four wide, dug in from the head of the lane, was closing fast late yards and just missed. SISTER JOANN became fractious and sat down in
the gate, was eased toward mid track to give chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path, raced outside entering the stretch and
finished well in a later duel for third. SHESAUPTOWNGIRL chased the pace inside, was steadied leaving the five sixteenths pole, was ridden
apprehensively at the rail to the mid point of the turn, angled out and recovered stride into the stretch and finished well. LADY SPARROW was shuffled back
on the chute then gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, eased outward into the lane and finished evenly to pass rivals. CEDAR
RUN'S FIRE took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, was headed toward the top of the lane then
weakened nearing mid-stretch. CORKY COWGIRL was bumped at the break, engaged in close early chase, dropped back at the rail through the turn then
weakened.
