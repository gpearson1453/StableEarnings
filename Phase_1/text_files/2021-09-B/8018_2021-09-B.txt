TIZ A TIGER sat off of the early fractions, mounted a bid while three then four wide on the turn, headed ALESHA inside of the final furlong, battled with that
foe and gamely won the nod on the wire. ALESHA prompted the early pace from a three wide position on the turn, vied for the lead leaving the bend, was
confronted by the winner inside of the eighth pole, battled with TIZ A TIGER and was nipped on the wire while clear of the rest. ASCENDANCY set the early
pace while being prompted, saved ground two wide on the turn, vied for the lead off of the turn but tired in the late going. SKY MAKER was shuffled back
soon after the start, chased the early leaders from the rear of the field, saved ground while two wide on the turn and did not offer a late bid in the stretch.

ANITANEWMERCEDES prompted the pace by SHOT OF A LIFETIME, mounted a bid while two wide on the second turn to vie for the lead, had a clear
lead into the lane, felt pressure in the final sixteenth from the runner-up but dug in and held to prevail. RESPECT THE HUSTLE was allowed to settle in the
early going, saved ground on the second turn, closed well in the stretch to put pressure on the winner in the final sixteenth but could not reel him in while
holding for second. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was hustled to set the early fractions, was pressured by the winner on the second turn, relinquished the lead
leaving the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch, while holding on for third. MANILA MISCHIEF settled at the rear of the field while still close to the
early pace, saved ground on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch to challenge for third. GOING AWAY PARTY stalked the early pace,
saved ground on the second turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch.

Footnotes
NOT BY MIGHT broke alertly and set quick fractions from a ground saving position, was pressured on the turn but shook off that challenge and kicked clear
in the end in a good debut. LYING GHOST chased the early pace from the midflight, was three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch, while a
clear second over the rest. COUNTRY DUDE veered out at the start and was hustled to track the early pace, was three wide on the turn and was outkicked
in the stretch. FANTASTIC DREAM brushed STANWOOD WARRIOR leaving the gate, chased the early quick fractions, was two wide between foes on the
turn and tired in the late stages. IOWA HAWKEYE pressed the early quick pace while two wide between horses and gave way in the stretch run.
STANWOOD WARRIOR was bumped at the start by FANTASTIC DREAM, had no speed in the early stages, saved ground on the turn and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
SCRATCHY APACHE sat just off of the early quick fractions while saving ground, checked nearing the quarter-pole while in tight quarters, swung out off of
the turn and made a quick move to collar AMITY HARBOR inside of the final furlong and drew clear in the end to prevail. AMITY HARBOR attended to the
early pace, was four wide on the turn, led leaving the bend but was caught and quickly passed by the winner inside of the final sixteenth while clear of the
rest. BIG DISCOUNT settled near the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn and then was fanned to six wide by PERSEVERANCE nearing the
quarter-pole, gained ground off of the turn but was outfinished in the stretch run. PERSEVERANCE chased the early fractions while two wide between foes,
ducked out nearing the quarter-pole and fanned a rival out two paths in doing so and weakened in the stretch run. TAMARANDO'S MINE broke sharply and
set quick fractions from a two wide running position, was confronted leaving the bend and tired in the stretch run. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT had no early speed,
was two wide on the turn and was not a threat.

COOL MOUNTAIN LAD sat just off of the early fractions, was asked for run on the turn while in the two path, struck the front at the top of the stretch and
drew clear in the late going. EXHALTING was off well and set the quick pace from a ground saving position, was confronted leaving the turn and was
outkicked by the winner while saving second. PHANTOM DROP tracked the early leaders from the rail, mounted a bid leaving the turn while saving ground
and was outfinished in the stretch, just missing for second. SPACE ODESSEY had no early speed, was three wide while still at the rear of the field on the
turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. HANDR'SDREAM prompted the quick pace from a two wide running position, lost ground off of the turn and gave

Footnotes
POUR ON THE COLE settled off of the early pace, mounted a bid while five wide on the second turn to take the lead entering the stretch and had a late kick
to draw clear in the end. RIVER ROSE stalked the early pace from the midflight while saving ground and was outfinished in the stretch, while holding for
second. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY settled in the middle of the field, gained ground while five wide on the second turn and continued that run into the stretch but
was outkicked in the late going. DUB TOWN had no speed in the early stages, improved position along the second turn and into the stretch while saving
ground but finished evenly in the stretch drive. ARCH PRINCE settled toward the rear of the field, was four to five wide on the second turn and did not
mount a late rally in the stretch. OF GOOD REPORT was unhurried in the early stages, was six to seven wide on the second turn and was not a factor.
THISMUSTBETHEPLACE was hustled to set the early fractions while being pressed through the second turn, vied for the lead leaving the turn but faded in
the stretch run. MUGARITZ tracked the pace from a four wide running position on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. RUNKERRY pressed the
early pace, was three wide on the second turn and gave out in the stretch run.
