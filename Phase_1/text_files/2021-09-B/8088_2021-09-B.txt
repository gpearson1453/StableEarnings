Footnotes
PANIC BUTTON was allowed to settle well off the pace came with a big run along the inside in the second turn and through the lane to prevail.
MASTERPIECE DAY sprinted to a long lead on the second turn and at the top of the stretch but tired in the final sixteenth. UNBROKEN SONG made a
move in the three path on the second turn and could not make up all the needed ground while clearly third best. GASPERGOU was wide at the top of the
stretch and lacked the needed rally. ASTUTE WARRIOR was well off the pace and never mounted a serious rally. SADDLE IN COMMANDO was up close
until the second turn and stopped suddenly.
