GENERAL GINNY good position to the half, outside run to far turn and edged clear in the final sixteenth. VOW SAVER well placed, never far back, off rail
run for place late. POSH PRINCESS prompted pace to deep stretch, weakened grudgingly to wire. RUN AWAY HIDEN speed to the front inside, dueled
stretch, outfinished late. SHE'S FLASHY no speed to far turn, circled field to improve position late. KHOZYS CROWN raced evenly from inside. TWO
MORE TIMES steadied inside out of first turn close to pace for three quarters, gave way readily. EQUALLY EVEN through early and dropped far back
galloping past the wire.

Footnotes
ACE DESTROYER dueled early on, spurted clear and widened in the stretch run. JAMMING CAMERON dueled winner to turn, could not keep up in the
stretch. CATES SWOOSH raced evenly with no response for the top pair in the stretch. DREW off a bit tardy from inside, passed a couple in the stretch run.
AYE SKIPPER never a factor. DANZO good position early, steadily lost ground into the stretch.
