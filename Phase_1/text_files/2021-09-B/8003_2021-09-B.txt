U. S. STEEL set the pace racing between rivals at the half mile marker, dueled inside on the turn, responded when roused and edged away in the final
furlong. FAR AWAY LOOK checked after the start, raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and got up for
second. WILL TOO SHY chased close up outside rivals, bid on the turn, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and lost second at the
wire. WICKED REBEL was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and closed belatedly on the rail. AKTHAM chased on the inside, raced inside on the
turn, angled out and lacked a bid. STREET PRAYER stalked in the early stages, chased two wide on the turn and weakened. BEAU BRIDGE chased close
up early between rivals and gave way on the turn.

to draw clear. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced off the pace with a three wide trip, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, dug in
gamely but second best. CHASE RUNNER stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the turn, gained a short lead, dueled into the stretch and weakened.

went six wide at the quarter pole and had no rally. HOUSE ARREST tracked close up on the inside, waited for room on the far turn, lacked a bid and tired.

Footnotes
SHORE MAGIC settled off the pacesetter, moved up midway on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside, collared the leader in
deep stretch and was clear under the wire. WHISTLE PLAYER opened up a long lead, showed the way into the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run,
battled to the finished and held on for second. FATIMA'S BLESSING was in tight early and checked leaving the chute, settled off the pace three wide,
moved up on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied late outside and finished well for third. FIGHTING HEART settled off the pacesetter,
advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied and was outkicked. IT'S MANDATORY raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and
rallied mildly. CANDY KINGDOM raced off the pace, moved up between rivals entering the stretch, then failed to rally. WINTER'S WONDER did not factor.
UNCLE ARMANDO was outrun. LINNS BOY raced off the rail, off the pace, gave way on the far turn and dropped back.
