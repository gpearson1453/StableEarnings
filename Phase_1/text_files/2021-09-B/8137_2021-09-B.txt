entering the turn, entered stretch in the lead and quickly overtaken while proving no match for winner, stayed on to be a clear second. JOURNEY CAKE

leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to launch needed bid to improve position in the stretch. NUTTY SIERRA

throughout and failed to threaten.

TRUTH PREVAILS dueled inside of rival on the backstretch, continued to duel into the turn and inched away late in the turn, improved advantage in the
stretch to win going away. LA CROIX dueled outside of rival on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and into the stretch, unable to keep up with
TRUTH PREVAILS, and saved second in the last sixteenth. DAIRY KID chased duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued to chase in the second
flight on the turn, entered stretch along the rail and had a mild rally to earn third. AT THE MARGIN chased leaders in between rivals, continued in between
on the turn, drifted out a couple paths into stretch and kept on to hold fourth. EXPENSIVE DEVON chased leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued
three wide on the turn, floated out by rival into the four path in the stretch and edged out for fourth. SURPRISE PARTY settled well off the pace on the
backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and failed to threaten in the stretch.
