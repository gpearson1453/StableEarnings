PLUM GOOD pressed the pace, moved up inside around the turn, drove clear leaving the turn, pulled away and won handily. MADISON JOY bumped at the
start, racing near the back, moved up within contention, came around the turn three wide, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. DREAM
TOWN raced within striking distance, eased back, made a late gain, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. SCRAPBOOK stumbled at the
start, racing in the back, improved position, but was no factor. EBBI BLU pressed the early pace, dropped back and was no threat late. MO STYLISH shot to
the front, drove clear and stopped. TAPPIN'TIME broke in, bumped and never raced near the front. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
