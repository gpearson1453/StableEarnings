Footnotes
RAVEN MOON was brushed entering the clubhouse turn, stalked the pace, rallied three wide into the stretch, made the lead past the furlong maker and
proved best under right handed urging. WOLFINE angled out brushing the winner entering the first turn, prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, gained
a slight advantage in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner late. BISCUITS AND GRITS never far back, finished with good courage in the five path.
JUST TAPIT IN trailed into the stretch then closed some ground late outside. FLASHY KING GEORGE never far back, moved closer along the inside in the
second turn then failed to sustain that bid. IT'S A MANS WORLD away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened.
