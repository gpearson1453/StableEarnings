Footnotes
TAPIT'S SPIRIT was reluctant to load, then pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained a short lead by the quarter pole and drew
clear by the furlong marker, then maintained that clear advantage to the wire to prove best under a drive. SAG HARBOR chased the early pace two wide,
then eased out midway on the turn and came four wide into the drive, finished willingly but could not get to the winner, good effort. AMERICAN UNITY was
bumped at the start, then was reserved early, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the drive, rallied well late. RIDE RICHIE RIDE broke outward at
the start bumping a rival, then was on the inside on the turn and offered a belated rally on the inside. KOSHER COWBOY set a pressured pace on the
inside and weakened. HARD NIGHT was settled back early, swung out five wide for the drive and offered no rally. LONESOME SOUND chased the early
pace four wide and weakened.

on the turn but could not sustain that bid while saving the place late. VERRY AMELIA chased the early pace on the inside, then moved off the rail to split
rivals leaving the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch to finish with interest to just miss the place award. SHY MONEY chased the early pace three

Footnotes
SUGAR DOG FOX was four wide into the first turn, then was reserved behind the fast pace, advanced three wide on the turn and came four wide into the
drive, closed well and hit the front leaving the sixteenths pole and then held SKY TEMPLE safe under a drive. SKY TEMPLE was allowed to settle early,
advanced two wide on the turn and angled out in deep stretch and was gaining late under mild pressure. GRAND DESIGN vied for the early lead three wide,
made a bid at the nine sixteenths pole and drew off by the three eighths pole while moving to the inside, then was still well clear by the quarter pole, then
began to tire when straightened and was caught at the sixteenths pole while saving the show award. IMTHEPRINCE was allowed to settle early on the
inside, angled out by the three sixteenths pole and offered a mild late rally. MR. SARCASTIC was void of early speed and came four wide into the drive and
offered no late rally. CLEVELAND SIMPSON vied for the early lead on the inside while setting fast fractions, stopped after a half mile and was pulled up
leaving the quarter pole, walked off.

Footnotes
WILDCARD PRADO stalked the pace three to four wide throughout, then made a four wide bid in hand to take over, drew clear by the quarter pole and
widened past the furlong marker, then kept YOU'RE KILLIN ME safe late under mild urging. YOU'RE KILLIN ME was rated along three to four wide, made a
mild bid four wide on the turn by the quarter pole, then angled in leaving the furlong marker and finished well towards the inside. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY set
the pace while racing off the rail and was headed on the turn and weakened, bested rest. NOT VERY GENTLE was reserved early, came six wide into the
drive and had no rally. BOLD PROPHET chased the early pace and made a mild bid on the inside but came up empty in the drive. DOWN HOME KITTEN
dropped back.
