Footnotes
FOXY GATOR stalked the pace through the turn looming at mid track in upper stretch rallying clear late. SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS went evenly through the
turn angling out to upper stretch vying willingly late six wide. LOW TIRE fractious as the gate opened missed the break, saved ground to upper stretch
gaining some there. FRECKLES KAN away alertly set the pace holding daylight through the turn, engaged in mid stretch would weaken to outside pressure.
SHIPMANS MAGIC played no factor. VICTORY ICE was never involved. PINK RUBANS had brief speed then gave way on the turn.
