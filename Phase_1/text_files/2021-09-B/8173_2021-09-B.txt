THOROVER pursued the loose pacesetter inside, took over at the quarter pole and drew off with moderate coaxing. SAILOR AGAIN advanced three wide
on the turn, continued well but was no threat to the winner. I SAW IT ALL bumped at the start, lagged far behind then rallied for the show. COMBAT
RIBBON dropped back between rivals and lacked a rally. POP POP'S BOY quickly sprinted clear then gave way through the stretch. DREAMING
THOUSAND saved ground off the pace and weakened steadily.

NURTURING stalked the pacesetters, bid outside on the final turn then drew away under wraps. YOURINDENIAL picked off rivals inside on the final turn,
angled out in the stretch and closed well. GET HER READYEDDIE set the pace inside then proved empty in the stretch. OUR WEST INDY alternated for
the advantage outside then faded on the final turn. SHES EUPHORIC trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. SAME MOON lacked speed saving
ground and was never a factor. HAPPYCREST was urged outside within range for half a mile and stopped.

early, moved inside on the turn and faded. TOUCH ME NOT dropped back inside and weakened steadily. LULINDA'S HEART lacked speed outside and

LET'S CELEBRATE took control inside, remained clear throughout while kept to a steady drive. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT settled well back, advanced inside
and made a gradual late gain. LA PANZANELLA chased the winner outside, loomed a stretch threat but went evenly late. TREASURE SEEKER lagged far
behind then offered some late energy while no factor. BOHEMIA BABE pursued the pacesetter inside then gave way on the final turn. CREATIVE JOY
made a menacing wide rally on the final turn then stopped. MISBEHAVING LADY saved ground off the leaders and stopped abruptly. Due to a timing issue
the six furlong fraction was omitted.

Footnotes
PUTTHEGLASSDOWN rushed to front wide into the far turn then drew away driving. STAR SIGN chased close up between foes, moved wide in the stretch
and was up to dead heat for the place. BARINGER SPRING settled inside off the leaders, rallied in the stretch and finished in a dead heat for the place.
NAUGHTY PRINCE moved strongly wide into the far turn, chased and tired late. STORM ADVISORY rated off the pace, bid wide on the turn then was
outfinished. DIRECT ORDER lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and was no factor. ARRECIFE lagged far behind, angled wide and failed to menace.
APPEALING FUTURE was in tight twice inside on the turn and faltered. SPIKES SHIRL led briefly inside then stopped abruptly.
