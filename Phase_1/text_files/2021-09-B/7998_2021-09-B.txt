Footnotes
OPALINA led early inside, deferred to ROYAL ROCKER into the backstretch and moved outside to stalk that one, rebid after six furlongs and regained
command with little difficulty, and drew away while kept mildly busy. ROYAL ROCKER took over outside OPALINA soon after completing a quarter-mile,
moved in showing the way through the middle fractions, proved no match when challenged past the quarter-pole, and ran on to hold the place. CAPETOWN
CANDY raced evenly near the inside, could not keep pace with the leaders coming off the far turn, and remained well clear of the others. RACHEL DREAM
stayed in range for a half-mile, and tired inside. FISH MOONEY raced far back throughout. GRAND VENUS raced three wide early, and dropped far back
before reaching the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SNEAKY CHEEKY bobbled at the start, was outrun early toward the inside, fanned wide coming off the turn, rallied between rivals through the late stages
and outfinished ARETE'S CHALICE for the decision. ARETE'S CHALICE brushed the right side of the gate coming out, swung four wide approaching the
stretch, rallied outside SNEAKY CHEEKY and narrowly missed. ROUGH ENOUGH pursued the pacesetter around the turn and into the stretch, and was
outfinished inside the top two. MISS BLUEBIRD set the pace inside, remained clear leaving the furlong grounds, then weakened. BRASS BAND went along
in the second flight outside, and had no closing response. MIAMI SOUVENIRS was a step slow at the start, and never got close. VERONICUS was outrun
three wide. LIBERTALIA showed early speed outside, and tired after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
SCAR stalked the pace three wide, edged closer in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip leaving the eighth pole, took the lead near the sixteenth pole
and edged clear under a strong hand ride. EYE OF A JEDI vied outside of SQUEEZADIOS early, inherited a clear lead nearing the half-mile pole, set the
pace in the two path around the turn, led past the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner in the final sixteenth. COOL ARROW raced off the pace two
wide, edged closer in upper stretch but failed to sustain the bid. QUENANE disputed the early pace, chased inside around the turn and retreated through the
lane. GLORY OF FLORIDA stumbled over a fallen rival near the nine-sixteenths marker, unseated the rider, kept to his feet, galloped around riderless and
walked off. SQUEEZADIOS dueled early, suffered a catastrophic injury near the nine-sixteenths marker and was euthanized. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE BACKSTRETCH AND TOOK NO ACTION. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE
SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

DROP A HINT raced close up behind the leaders for three furlongs, bid three wide between horses turning for home, reached the front in midstretch and
drove clear. PALOMITA vied outside NIKEE KAN early, edged away briefly coming to the quarter-pole, got hooked from outside by DROP A HINT after
straightening away for the drive, could not go with that rival but held well for the place. NIKEE KAN contested the pace inside PALOMITA, yielded to that
one after three furlongs, and weakened through the drive. ROMANTIC TALE broke a step slow, raced four wide around the turn, and faded through the
stretch. MIGHTY ELECTRICA moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and could not reach contention. SILVER TUNES was finished early inside.

SAMARONTI raced off the pace on the extreme outside down the backstretch, advanced five wide around the turn, made a steady gain through the lane
and edged ahead in the later yards. GODS BLESSING vied in the two path, drifted out in the lane and led until deep stretch. MACHO REAL bumped with
EASTERN SYMPHONY at the start, saved ground well back, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied for the show. HARD TEN saved ground in range and
lacked the needed rally. FEELING DANGEROUS vied three wide and weakened in the drive. EASTERN SYMPHONY was bumped at the start, was in
range three wide and lacked closing bid. MOUNTAIN KING played no factor while racing three wide. BAD BOY E. J. chased the pace four wide and came
up empty in the lane. ACASEADAY disputed the early pace and retreated two wide around the turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SEVEN
FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID pressed BRASSTOWN from outside early, took over after a half-mile, drew well clear around the turn, continued to widen under pressure
through upper stretch and was merely shown the crop through the last sixteenth of a mile. NACHO PAPA raced two to three wide improving position around
the turn, could not menace the winner and ran on clear of the rest. COUNTY COURT was outrun for six furlongs, angled five wide approaching the top of
the stretch, and offered a mild response to pick up the show. MEADE raced three to four wide, and tired near the quarter-pole. AYCAPOTE moved off the
inside around the turn, and could not gain. BRASSTOWN set the early pace inside, could not fend off TRAPPEZOID after a half, and was through before
reaching the stretch. MALIBU MAX was finished after a half four wide.

RENEESDREAMGIRL broke on top, vied inside to upper stretch, shook clear leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held clear under a drive. NUMERIC vied
outside of the winner down the backstretch, dropped back two wide around the turn, angled in in upper stretch, re-rallied inside then was in tight on heels in
the last few strides. WOW TAPIT bumped with PENNY ANGEL soon after the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide in upper stretch to
loom the main danger to the winner in midstretch but flattened out and was outfinished for the place. MY D'VALENTINE saved ground off the pace, angled
out near the eighth pole and had a mild rally. BLACK SILK bobbled just after the start, rushed up four wide, angled into the two path nearing the
three-eighths pole, led outside of the winner around most of the turn and tired in the lane. PENNY ANGEL bumped with WOW TAPIT soon after the start,
raced three wide and never threatened. NOBLE PRESENT played no factor while racing two wide. DA FURIOUS CAT was outrun while racing four wide.
MISS INEZ chased the pace three wide and faltered nearing the lane. SUSPICIOUSLY SWEET trailed outside.
