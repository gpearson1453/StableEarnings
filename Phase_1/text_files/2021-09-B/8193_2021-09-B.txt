Footnotes
JACK LUVS NOVA was off slowly, dropped back early on, moved up four wide through the far turn, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and
finished well to be clear late under steady pressure. PURRS WELL settled off the early going, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and gained ground
late to get up for the place position. DRINK MORE BOURBON was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole
and had no final winning bid. CONFUSION was reluctant to load, showed good early speed from the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile.
RESTLESS ROCKER stalked the early pace from the outside, angled in to race along the inside through the stretch run and had not enough. CALICHITO
stalked the early pace, raced near the inside and had no response. HOOKEAI was off slowly, dropped back early, raced near the inside and never was a
factor.

Footnotes
ESTILO VARONIL raced up close down the backstretch while being rated down, raced in the two path around the far turn through the stretch and just got up
under all out pressure. THE FIRE WITHIN showed good early speed to set all the pace, was ridden along through the far turn, dug in late but just missed in
a game effort while racing near the rail. MAGIC WIZARD was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide into the upper stretch but was had no final
winning bid. COMBATING settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide in the lane and had not enough in the drive. ANGEL'S ENTRY was unhurried
early on, raced five deep just past the quarter pole and had no late rally. MUTAKAAMIL stalked the early going, raced two wide through the lane and had no
response. FULGURANT stalked the early pace, saved ground and never was a factor. EDEN ROCK was slow early and never threatened. NOTHIN
REALLY raced far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

BUY THE BEST broke in at the start, stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to draw
clear under steady handling. LITTLE MISS SASSY settled to the middle of the pack early, raced along the inside around the far turn, moved up two to three
wide in the lane and finished second best. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL showed good early speed to set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
DARIO'S ANGEL was off slowly, raced four deep near the quarter pole and had no late response. DETERMINED TRUTH dropped back early, raced five
wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SHE'S A FAST ONE failed to sustain a bid.

the upper stretch and had no late rally. ARLO BELLO settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened.

MISTY TASTE was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. DARIA'S ANGEL raced four wide around the
first turn, was five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. SAMMIE SUNSHINE failed to sustain a bid. CAUGHT UP IN YOU was slow

Footnotes
CAPTAIN THUNDER stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under strong handling. ONE
TWO KID was in tight at the break, dropped back early on, moved up four wide in the stretch run and closed in well late. DECKOLOGY stalked the early
pace, moved up to challenge the leader around the far turn, raced two to three wide and kept on to the wire. DRAMATIZED showed good early speed to set
the pace along the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. DAVID'S PROSPEC stalked the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had
no late rally. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA broke to the outside, settled off the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and never was a factor. THE
MORMON MAULER was bumped at the break, stalked early and weakened through the drive. BILL'S MAFIA took up at the break, was slow early on, raced
towards the inside and never threatened. INITFORTHELOVE failed to sustain a bid. DIRECTOR (IRE) was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early
stages, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAST ROMANCE was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up around the far turn, made a five to six wide bid through the drive and finished well to
get up under strong encouragement. GRUMLEY pressed the pace, raced in the four path through the lane, led late but couldn't hold off the winner to finish
second best. MY HANDSOME MAN was fractious in the gate, stalked the early pace, raced between rivals around the far turn, raced two to three wide
through the lane and finished willingly. LUCKY ACES showed good early speed from the outside and weakened a bit in the final stages. DR. GRANT was
off a step slow, rushed from the inside to raced up close early on and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ESPRESSO LUNGO was slow early on, raced
five deep through the far turn and never was a factor. BIGSHOT ON NOTHING dropped back early, raced towards the inside and had no response.
