THE LAST APPLE sat off leaders to the turn, roused three wide to go well clear as much the best in the final furlong under stout handling. EARLY
BLOOMER lagged back to the stretch, off rail rally and ran on late for place spot. QUALITY BET off a bit tardy with no speed to the turn, rallied inside
through the stretch for show. MAYBE FRANKY rushed to the front, stayed well to deep stretch but gave way late. BAREFOOT BEACH good position to the
turn, four wide run with no late gain. PENNIESANDDIMES rushed between horses early, pressed pace to quarter pole but weakened inside. MY DIRTY
BIRDIE could not keep up from inside to the turn and dropped back readily.
