APPEALING SENORITA was bumped at the start, rallied three wide through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch and finished full of run under right
handed urging to win as much the best. MIZZEN SPOILS broke outward bumping rivals, railed into the stretch then closed determinedly along the rail and
got up for second. SMALLTOWN CAT was bumped at the start, chased the leader, inched closer two wide nearing the top of the stretch, was put in tight
between rivals, checked then was outfinished for second. STORMY MOON sprinted to the lead leaving the chute, set the pace into the stretch, drifted from
the two path to the four path then gave way late. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SMALLTOWN CAT LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS
TOOK NO ACTION.

CONDUCIVE stalked the pace from the three path into the stretch, dropped inside the leader, rallied to make the lead nearing the furlong marker and drew
clear late to win in hand. FU ROO chased the pace for five furlongs, made the lead two wide, set the pace into the stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
EVEN KEELED hopped at the start, trailed into the stretch, angled outside and closed a gap in the four path. PORT HUNTER allowed to settle, moved up in
the four path on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. JOES A ROCKIN broke in front, set the pace for five furlongs then was used up.

K FOR KATHY prompted the pace inside for a half, made the lead, set the balance of the pace, drifted to the middle of the racetrack, drew clear and lasted
under strong handling. UCANTKEEPUP loomed boldly outside the winner on the far turn, was carried out through mid stretch, altered course inside the
winner and was gaining late in the five path. PALI'S REWARD trailed into the far turn, swung wide and passed tiring rivals near mid track. SPIT'S IMAGE
failed to menace. LAISSEZ FAIRE away alertly, set a pressed pace two wide into the far turn then weakened. CIRCLE WILL RUN reared at the start, rushed
to contention three wide on the clubhouse turn then was through early.
