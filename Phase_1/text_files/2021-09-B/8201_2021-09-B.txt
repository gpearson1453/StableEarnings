hand ride and got up by the narrowest of margins. TOTELLYOUTHETRUTH dueled for the lead two wide then near the inside, maintained a narrow lead
through the stretch and was caught in the final stride. BOOT LEGGER unhurried early, drifted out through the stretch bumping a rival and gained third.
KOLE MAN CAN allowed to settle, swung wide entering the stretch, was bumped through deep stretch and went evenly. BUSTER'S BOY failed to menace
and drifted in a bit mid turn. GRAND STRATEGY settled along the rail, was shut off midway on the turn, checked and dropped back.
FURTHERINSTRUCTION was outrun. OLE WATASHI was no factor. INTO THE OUT battled for the lead along the inside into the turn then stopped. THE

ZALINSKY waited along the rail through the far turn, shifted out three wide for racing room, dug in under left then right handed urging and got up in the final
strides. ROGALLO vied for the lead three then four wide into the stretch, dug in determinedly late and got up for second. MOST SANDISFACTORY pressed
the pace two wide and was outfinished despite a game effort. KULP checked along the inside on the clubhouse turn, was always within striking distance
then finished well outside. READY MY WAY broke in front, set a pressured pace until deep stretch and weakened. BOSS BEAR with the second flight three
then two, failed to offer the needed response.

ONLY ONE BOSS LADY drifted out at the start causing CAN I GO TOO to clip her heels, settled just off the leaders, rallied steadily two wide to make the
lead near mid stretch and won under a hand ride. SHEZ SHACKED UP away alertly, set the pace into the stretch then finished second best along the rail.
COSTUME JEWELRY unhurried, closed a gap late in the six path. CAN I GO TOO clipped heels at the start then found her best stride late in the seven
path. RONNI'S DAY chased the pace into the stretch then faded in the five path. PRICEY APPEAL failed to menace. ZENMODE was bumped at the start,
settled inside then lacked the needed response. PERSEVERING HONOR bore out at the start bumping ZENMODE, dropped back and was no threat.
