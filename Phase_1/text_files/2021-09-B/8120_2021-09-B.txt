CAESARTHERULER seized command at the outset, edged clear leaving the far turn and readily drew off in the stretch. THAT'S WHAT I SAY reserved
early, commenced a bid far on the turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch. GALACTICA stalked, was outpaced leaving the far turn and kept on in the
stretch. BIG HEARTED FACTOR chased along the inside and lacked a rally. COPPER FIDDLE raced forwardly while three wide and offered no response
when asked in the stretch. JASIRI was always outrun. CAMPAIGN SPY was bothered at the start and no factor.
