Footnotes
PLATINUM FROLIC took a quick lead and angled to the inside to show the way through the front stretch, drifted outward into the first turn but corrected
course back to the inside and rated on top with a slim advantage, kept the edge over Deemed Essential past the half mile pole, moved clear of that one
leaving the five sixteenths, came under pressure into the stretch and held well to prove much the best. KINKY FROLIC saved ground racing well off the
pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, drifted a bit into the stretch but closed steadily to take second late yards.
DEEMED ESSENTIAL was carried out into the first turn then angled back toward the inside to stalk two deep, challenged past the half mile pole, but
dropped back leaving the five sixteenths and flattened inside the eighth pole. MISS BEE HIVING rounded the first turn about the three path, raced well back
leaving the turn and showed little response. DANCING WITH DEDE broke a step slow and dropped well back.

Footnotes
UPHEAVAL engaged in close chase the opening quarter mile and took the edge at the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the
turn, drifted while drawing clear into the stretch and held well with steady handling. GRAND FIBER contested pace three wide, was met a the five sixteenths
pole and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, lost ground outside the winner leaving the turn then dug in under steady stretch
encouragement and just held on for second. GRANDPA MUNSTER was jostled early then gave chase through the backstretch, ran through the turn about
the three path, eased to the five path into the stretch and dug in for third mid-stretch, was gaining on the runner-up but just lasted to save third. TRUTH
SERUM brushed Grandpa Munster on the chute then picked up the chase inside, angled to the outside entering the stretch and finished well. GUNTER
pressured the early pace two deep while between horses, but dropped back past the quarter pole and weakened near the rail on the turn. KICKIN' KIRBY
made light contact with Grandpa Munster on the chute then angled to the outside to give chase, though, weakened in the six path of the turn.

Footnotes
ROCKET SOUND pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn, dueled to even terms mid-stretch and edged clear later
yards. HE'S ON THE LINE took the lead inside approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in to the challenge of the winner leaving
the turn but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. OFFICER APPEAL chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out
leaving the turn and was closing well through the stretch. ISLAND CADGER chased the earlier pace inside, angled outward on the turn, drifted wider and
entered the stretch about the eight path and showed little further. EASTBOUND N DOWN became fractious in the gate and showed the way early, gave
chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened about the three path on the turn. STRONG SAFETY became anxious in the gate and was unprepared
for the start, gave up several lengths advantage to the field and was not encouraged. The Stewards posted the inquiry and reviewed the start of this race
before declaring it official.

YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then dug in
determinedly through the stretch to hold off the game challenge of NO CHANGE, who stalked toward the inside, bid at the five sixteenths pole and
challenged two deep midway on the turn, dueled to near even terms a furlong away and remained a threat to the finish. DREAMING OF GERRY stalked
from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back in the three path midway on the far turn and
weakened the final furlong. MACY'S BOY settled off the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened
stride off the rail on the far turn. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground the first turn then eased out with a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and had little left in the stretch. STEP OUT DANCING saved ground racing well back. This race was hand timed.
