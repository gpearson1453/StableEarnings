around the final turn three wide, proved no match for the winner down the lane, but held on for second, while finished wide. MORE THAN BLESSED raced
in the middle of the field, made a late rally and just missed third. CH BERN raced near the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the outside,
made a mild bid and finished evenly. VISION OF ANGELS lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no real threat. MY SUGAR TOWN raced near
the middle of the field, finished wide and lacked a rally. DEGRASSE raced within contention, made a bid, challenging WAR TRIBUTE for the lead at the 3/4
pole and faded. CHARMING BULLET raced near the back and was never a threat. LOOKIN HIGH void of earlyh speed and was never close. RED

Footnotes
LT. BONURA vied for lead, raced on the front throughout, drifted in late, was all out and held on for the win. MUCHO MARVIN unhurried in the beginning,
came around the turn three wide, dueled down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. GOLDEN PALACE pressed the pace, saved ground around the
turn, made a rail bid, steadied down the stretch, getting in tight quarters on the inside and was outfinished by the top two. DONNA'S COURT pressed the
early pace, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick. BEAUTY BOY void of early speed, showed late interest, while finishing wide, but was no factor.
QUEETEN raced within striking distance, lacked a rally and put forth an even effort. CROOKS REBEL lacked early speed, moved up on the inside around
the turn, angled out entering the stretch, finished wide and was no threat. CHEERS TO BERTI vied for the early lead and was finished early. COOL FIRE
raced in the middle of the field in the beginning and dropped back. JOURNEY WEST always raced near the back and showed little. RACE WAS HAND
