Footnotes
CYBERKNIFE broke inwardly before tossing his head due to correction at the start, recovered to stalk three wide, bid for the lead outside of HOIST THE
GOLD approaching the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage while shifting inwards and bumping that foe in upper stretch, then dueled while managing
a narrow margin from that rival through the lane, and prevailed. HOIST THE GOLD took a bump from an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside,
dug in as CYBERKNIFE bid for the lead turning for home, received a solid bump from that foe while being headed in upper stretch, then fought on gamely
thereafter to sustain a prolonged battle, but failed to regain even terms. COFFEE WITH ALEX stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase the
leaders home while failing to keep pace with them, and safely held show. FAST LANE took the turn two wide while off of the pace, and failed to threaten the
leaders while achieving a minor share. CLOUDY pressed the pace setter two wide, but failed to keep pace with that foe and an outer rival passing the three
furlong pole, and steadily tired through the lane. DEVIL'S GLEN tracked from the three to four paths around the turn, and failed to factor. HIGH SPEED
RAIL saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BEEASY bumped an inner foe at the start, and never got involved. SILENT DISCO shied from an outer
foe a the start, got outrun throughout, and showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH,
CYBERKNIFE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND

Footnotes
CARRIBEAN CAPER stalked the leading trio from the four path into the turn, ranged up to those rivals turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter
pole, swiftly assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure through midstretch before being ridden out late. SOMEONE SAID SO
prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied between horses turning for home as CARRIBEAN CAPER menaced, but
proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then safely held place while tiring through the final furlong. MALLOY saved ground while trailing around the
turn, shifted to the three, then four, path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. SHESA MYSTERY lied off of the pace in the two to three paths
around the turn, swung to the five path at the quarter pole, but failed to mount a rally while hanging on her left lead. PATTY H dueled for the lead outside of
COPPELIA, then from between horses around the turn, but gave way to outer foes in upper stretch, and weakened. COPPELIA dueled for the lead along
the inside, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
KING FURY tracked the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, tipped three wide into the backstretch, advanced in hand among rivals
down the backstretch to take aim on the pair of leaders into the far turn, bid in hand around that bend before assuming command entering the lane, and
drew off in upper stretch under brisk hand urging. BOURBON THUNDER tracked while hung out four wide, came under a drive into the far turn to keep
pace, took that bend four to five wide while threatening for minor placings, then stayed on through the lane to claim place passing the sixteenth pole while
no threat to the winner. DR JACK vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses into the far turn, contended inside of KING FURY around the far
turn, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, gave way, then lost place a sixteenth from home. SERMONONTHEMOUNT trailed in the two path
early on, swung five wide in upper stretch, but lugged inwards approaching the final furlong, then finished up mildly. KING'S OVATION set the pace along
the inside, showed the way inside of DR JACK down the backstretch, but weakened inside of a pair of foes into the far turn. GAGETOWN stalked along the
inside while keen around the first turn, shifted two to three wide around the far turn while driven to attempt a bid, but failed to do so before tiring in upper
stretch. ANGKOR stalked three wide, but came under an all out drive to keep pace at the half mile pole, failed to respond, and wilted through the field
passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
EVERETT'S SONG broke outwards, lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, tipped outside of the leading group at the three sixteenths pole,
grinded away through midstretch to bid passing the furlong grounds, then drove clear passing the sixteenth pole while drifting inwards on his left lead.
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER broke a step slowly, raced far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, picked up stride while swinging to the six path
entering the lane, then sustained a rally through the final furlong to reach place in the late stages. RAM was squeezed between rivals at the start, trailed the
field in the four path around the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and followed HE'SMYHONEYBADGER's rally through the final furlong to
reach show on the wire. BOB'S EDGE broke inwardly and bumped RAM at the start, chased from midpack two wide while under steady urging, split foes
passing the furlong pole to attempt a bid, but was outkicked by an outer foe leaving that station, and flattened out inside of rivals. EMERALD FOREST
prompted the pace two wide, bid entering the lane while floating to the three path, forged an advantage before drifting outwards approaching the furlong
grounds, saw the rider lose his crop when trying to change sticks at the furlong pole, wandered about before succumbing to an outer foe approaching the
final sixteenth, and faltered between horses late. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST stalked three wide, shifted to the four path to stay outside of the leading pair
entering the lane, but only managed to chase them through midstretch, and was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole, and failed to bid. FLAGS UP
trailed the field in the two path turning for home, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and passed tired foes. DREAMER'S DISEASE bumped an outer foe
at the start, set the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path entering the lane to meet EMERALD FOREST's bid, but was headed by that foe in upper
stretch, and weakened. SHADOW MATTER broke a step slowly, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail. IRISH UNITY stalked along
the inside early on, but chased around the turn, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
HOWLING TIME tracked four wide, rallied through the lane to wear down the clear leader a sixteenth from home, and drew clear. OSBOURNE chased three
wide, then from between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the furlong grounds, shifted inwards and kept on reach place
passing the sixteenth pole. BACK TO NORMAL set the pace, shook clear from a bidding LEDDY entering the lane, but tired passing the furlong pole, and
was caught by rivals on both sides in the late stages. CHASING TIME tracked along the inside around the turn, switched out from behind traffic to be five
wide at the three sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase the leaders home. I'M A WAR LORD bumped with an inner foe at the start, and failed to factor.
BRAWNDO stalked along the inside and from the two path around the turn, but weakened. LEDDY bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked the leader
two wide, mildly bid turning for home, but was repelled entering the lane, and weakened. FEDERAL HILL bumped the gate and was off slowly, then never
got involved. YASUKE broke slowly and got outrun.
