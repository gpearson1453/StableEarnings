Footnotes
POP THE BUBBLY rated tracking the front from mid pack three to four paths off the hedge, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, rallied to steadily gain issuing a threat through the final eighth and was up in the last jumps to prevail. CAUMSETT dueled in hand briefly five
paths off the inside into the backstretch with LADY THORNHILL to her inside as that rival was hard held to concede the front, tucked four then three wide
slipping away to a comfortable advantage to show the way down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and remained patiently handled until
placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and
was nailed in the final strides. OUT OF SIGHT tracked the front from just off the pace four then three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. FIST FULL OF DICE just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out to spin six to seven wide into upper stretch, then kicked on
belatedly to the finish. HIT THE NAIL tracked two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, got coaxed along with
five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide for home, offered up a mild bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. LADY THORNHILL dueled briefly
despite a hard hold and eased off two to three wide conceding the front to CAUMSETT, had that rival tucked in front and tipped out four paths off the hedge
in closest aim of that leader, tucked three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. GRACE IN MOTION just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SALUKI five then four wide in pursuit, got ridden along midway on the far turn, swung three to
four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ASHAAR broke fast from the inside post, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, stalked along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole,
chased against the rail with a clear opening inside of the pacesetter into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear
under steady handling. MR. BRIGGS showed good speed, set the pace on the outside of a foe, controlled the tempo in the two path on the turn, was asked
turning into upper stretch then came under a drive, led until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while well clear for the place. WICKED INDEED
settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND brushed the inside of the gate at the start then was hustled, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch and came up empty. PARADE FIELD settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to respond. IRISH GIANT bobbled at the start and was off a step slow, dropped well behind early then settled at the back, saved
ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and was no factor. INDIAN COUNSELOR settled just off the pace, lugged out some
under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, floated four wide while dropping back around the five-sixteenths. came five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MAIDEN BEAUTY coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside uncontested through
moderate splits, tucked inside through the turn settled into a comfortably rhythm, came under coaxing just outside the quarter pole and was set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, surged clear under a drive kept to task to the finish. THANKFUL chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors.
ESPRESSO SHOT forwardly placed two to three wide early on between foes, remained patiently handled losing position in reserve to be just off the pace
behind a trio in the two path into and through the turn, tipped out nearing the quarter pole under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home,
dug in under a drive chasing the winner home and weakened in the late stages. MRS. ORB four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NONNA MADELINE
four paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths
remaining, tipped three wide at the head of the stretch and tired. PARIS LIGHTS chased four then three wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, went
four wide for home and never got involved.

Footnotes
SCUTTLEBUZZ five then four paths off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to prompt the leader from
the outside placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command narrowly a furlong out, tussled with
VALMONT until inside the sixteenth marker before inching away in the late stages. CALL ME HARRY chased along the inside in aim of the front, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home before tipping out a path straightened away, dug in under a drive running on willingly
to the finish to get up for the place honors in the final strides. VALMONT bobbled at the break, crossed to show the way lightly coaxed along in the two path,
tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for home roused into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on
inside to the finish, safe for the show honors. DANCING BUCK coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out
five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. ALPHALFA bobbled at the break, chased along the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and was outkicked. OPT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid belatedly but was outkicked. DISCRETIONARY MARQ four wide in pursuit near the rear of the field,
advanced through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch moving into contention, dug in under a drive
prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. NEW YORK'S FINEST bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside, got set down angled
four wide into upper stretch and tired. DR. DUKE coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along
from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home and tired. RACE TIMES ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

FIGHT ON LUCY broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, angled four wide inside the five-sixteenths, rallied
into upper stretch, took over at the three-sixteenths, vied outside of the runner-up while still on her inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper
lead while drawing away outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best. BRATTLE HOUSE disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the
rail on the turn, led into upper stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, fought with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while able
to hold the place. COURAGEOUS GIRL settled at the rear of the field, was urged three wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, swung
five wide into the stretch and just got up for the show. CARTWHEEL bumped soundly with a rival early, settled well back on the outside, was urged four
wide on the turn, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and just missed the show. FROST ME bumped soundly with a foe early, settled off the pace, was
urged while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, gained into upper stretch but lacked the needed response. IFIHADACHANCE settled in third
position, was urged three wide early on the turn then carried five wide late on that bend and came up empty. AWILLAWAY broke through the front of the
gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, bumped with an opponent at the start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the
turn and tired.

SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR three then two wide in aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command near the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. JORDAN'S LEO just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place
honors. RUNAWAY RUMOUR three then two wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick. OUR FLASH DRIVE three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at

Footnotes
TALLIS went four wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, traveled three wide on the far turn, took over while set down in upper
stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. MY BOY COLTON went to the front, rounded the first turn
in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, battled gamely with that opponent into the final sixteenth
and was outfinishd while well clear for the place. SEIZING THE DREAM raced three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace while loosely between horses,
vied in the two path on the far turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. ISABELLA'S DREAM went four to five wide on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn then spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
DECLAREATRUCE bumped with a rival at the start, went five to six wide on the opening bend, settled off the pace, traveled four wide on the far turn and
was no factor. RAISING SAND steadied between foes while five wide on the first turn, dropped to the three path nearing the backstretch, settled off the
pace, went three wide on the far turn and came up empty. WAR LIGHT broke a step slow, dropped to the two path around the opening bend, settled off the
pace, was coaxed along passing the nine-sixteenths, went four wide under strong encouragement on the final turn and also lacked the needed response.
BLAME IT ON BRUTUS settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. HELLMAN broke a bit slow,
was caught six then five wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. READYSEEKGO was backed out of the gate then reloaded, settled in the two path, was
roused on the final turn and failed to respond. FLIGHT TO PARADISE broke a step slow, settled on the inside, moved to the two path under urging on the
far turn and also failed to respond. TERM SHEET was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, angled in at the rear, settled at the back, saved ground
on the far turn and was no factor.
