Footnotes
NEST was eased back off the pace while showing early speed, stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead under her
own power at the quarter-pole, floated out while moving clear on her inside lead coming to the three-sixteenths, swapped to the proper lead when shaken up
outside the eighth-pole, drifted in into the final furlong with the rider taking a couple of confident peeks behind him, widened quickly at that point and proved
much the best with the rider poised like a statue in the irons from outside the sixteenth-pole to the wire in a good debut. DOVER DREAMS settled on the
inside, was roused while inside early on the turn, moved to the two then three path later on that bend, chased four wide into the stretch, drifted out outside
the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. ANILEATE displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch,
vied inside on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and tired but was well clear for third. SEA PINES settled off the
pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn, dropped back under the crop at the three-eighths and had nothing left. SAFFRON MOON stumbled
severely at the start and unseated the rider, was apprehended by an outrider after the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
F F ROCKET just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths advancing to take
over command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under threat from a pair, dug in gamely to fend off the runner up kept to task to the
finish. MY FIRST GRAMMY five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch challenging for
command, dug in fighting on latched on through to the finish and was ultimately rebuffed while along well clear of the rest and second best. ROCCO
STRONG led early on before conceding the front, chased four then three wide in closest aim of the spurting leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths when heads apart for command, swung three wide for home between foes and weakened in the stretch. UNLEVERAGED six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked five then four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. QIAN B C two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
STRIKING SPEED established the front a sixteenth into the race and spurted away in hand three wide, tucked to the two path through the turn coming
under light coaxing at the three-eighths as the field took closer order, yielded the front readily with five-sixteenths to go, cornered two to three wide into
upper stretch in retreat and folded.

Footnotes
QUICK RETURN settled comfortably off the pace, jostled with NOTORIOUS FLIRT leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was given his cue
nearing the quarter-pole, rallied outside into the final furlong and got up while drifting out some late to prevail. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE was fractious in the
gate but broke alertly, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, responded well when put
to the crop in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. SEVEN LILIES broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace,
was roused while three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out under a left-handed crop while gaining at the
sixteenth-pole then switched to a right-handed crop and finished with good energy for the show. QUICKFLASH bumped with a rival at the start and was off a
step slow, settled at the back, steadied off heels in the two path outside the seven-sixteenths, shifted three wide before the three-eighths, was driven five
wide into upper stretch then moved a bit further out and gained but failed to impact. HIM SHE KISSES bumped with an opponent at the start, settled on the
outside, was asked four wide on the turn, came under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ON OUR WAY BOYZ broke out and
bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole and tired. NOTORIOUS FLIRT
bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, was coaxed along on the inside, jostled with QUICK RETURN leaving the backstretch, dropped back
along the rail on the turn, came out at the quarter-pole and faltered then was pulled up bleeding from the nostrils and vanned off.

LIFE IS GOOD brushed the near side stall at the start, established the front soon after the break and showed the way five paths off the inside down the
backstretch through moderate splits, tucked three wide into the turn and had FORT PECK advance outside latching on briefly, angled in to spin just off the
inside into upper stretch, received four taps to the right shoulder in upper stretch and was briefly placed to light coaxing with three-sixteenths to go, drew off
quickly and was placed back in hand just inside the eighth pole holding clear and prevailing comfortably on the wire. FORT PECK four wide in aim down the
backstretch, advanced on the aforementioned foe half a mile from home latching on to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
then three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on willingly for the place honors. DOUBLY BLESSED five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide with nine-sixteenths to go before making his way to the rail through the turn, got coaxed along
through the bend shaken off by the top pair, cut the corner into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was outkicked. CHANCE IT brushed the near side
stall at the start, raced six paths off the inside in closest aim of LIFE IS GOOD down the backstretch, suffered an injury with five and a half furlongs
remaining and was quickly placed to a protective hold and eased up before being pulled up into the turn, and was subsequently vanned off.

TOO SEXY was reserved off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied on the outside, closed fast to get
the lead inside the furlong marker and moved clear in the final sixteenth under a strong hand-ride to prove much the best. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) a bit
recalcitrant behind the gate, was well placed just off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into upper
stretch, closed well to make a bid into the final furlong, fought with the winner to near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished but clear for the place. TIME
LIMIT was hustled to the front, set the pace with some company to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was given her cue inside the five-sixteenths
then put to a drive into upper stretch, lost the advantage just inside the furlong marker and weakened but just held the show. GOTTA GO MO prompted the
pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, fought on even terms for the lead into the final furlong and
also weakened but just missed the show. TIPLE (IRE) angled in at the rear early, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS J MCKAY was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole and came up
empty. KISSING FROGS was reserved off the pace, dropped back with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail outside the
quarter-pole then spun five wide into the stretch and was no factor. UNION GABLES steadied while crowded against the rail outside the five-eighths,
bobbled inside the nine-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

OVERSTEP forwardly placed from the start, settled just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before advancing to latch on that rival to the outside half a
mile from home, steadily advanced to get on near even terms before taking over command at the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, got roused
straightened away to a light drive and drew off, then got geared down near the sixteenth pole to prevail comfortably at the end. ASYMMETRIC away to a
hesitant start getting away last from the gate, raced four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch at the tail of the field, came under coaxing four
wide at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on willingly outside to secure the place honors while never able to threaten the winner.
THRILL OF IT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure
the show honors. DROSEL DIEM chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and passed tired rivals to the
finish. TAP'N DE BANK broke in at the start under hustling, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide into upper
stretch and tired. MY LAST MISSION chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
SILVER SAMURAI hustled from the gate intent on the lead, showed the way coaxed along the inside through swift splits under pressure through the turn
from OVERSTEP to the outside, got headed spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

four then three wide on the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole,
came under a drive in upper stretch, led until outside the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken but clear for the place. SHAMROCKET broke out at the start,
settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn and finished with good energy to garner the show. JOURNEYMAN broke near the back of the field, went
around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn, was asked around the five-sixteenths then moved to the
two path, came three wide into the stretch and tired. OPRY went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths,
lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. WINNING FACTOR
was asked leaving the gate then rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, moved to the two path around the five-sixteenths and lacked the
needed response. ANGELUS WARRIOR went five then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the far
turn, floated six wide into the stretch and came up empty. ZARKALLANI (FR) was taken in hand early, steadied while four then three wide on the first turn,
settled at the back on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, angled out outside the furlong marker and failed to
threaten.

four wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away roused, edged clear under a light drive to prevail. MISS TEHERAN (IRE) under a firm hold
saving ground at the tail of the field, tipped out briefly to the two path midway on the far turn before tucking back inside, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and angled out to swing four wide into upper stretch following the top one, ran on to chase that barn mate home safely securing the place
honors on the wire, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off and reported to have bled. LAKE LUCERNE along the inside into the
first turn, tipped to the two path in behind STAND FOR THE FLAG midway on that bend, tracked that rival in closest aim under a rating hold, came under

Footnotes
CINDERELLA'S CAUSE settled nicely off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into upper
stretch, closed well to get a narrow lead around the furlong marker then drew clear in the final sixteenth under good handling. MADAME ROSE was away
well from the outside post, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, was set down
into upper stretch, lost the lead near furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place. LIVE IN FIVE broke a half-step slow, settled on the
outside, was urged four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. STEPPIN' HAWK
settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. VIVAZANO settled off the pace, went
three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SINFULLY SWEET was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace,
dropped back two then three wide on the turn and capitulated. U SHOULD B DANCING stumbled at the start and was last away, raced at the rear, went
three then four wide on the turn and faltered.
