Footnotes
SINGING ALLI tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the
stretch and held off a closer under a drive to the wire. CONSTANCIA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, began to improve
position while racing in the two path around the turn, angled in to continue her bid entering the stretch, and gained ground steadily on the outside from there.
LADY EXPRESS trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch still in last place, and gained ground quickly on
the rail down the lane. DRAMA RUN chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while racing four wide around the turn,
swung wider still entering the stretch and finished evenly on the outside. WILDWOOD MAGGIE broke slowly, raced off the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, made some mild outside in gain in upper stretch and was outkicked late. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN raced
off the pace between horses in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. GODSGIFT raced off the pace on
the inside up the backstretch, moved up while racing in the two path around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. NICE AND TRUE led the field on the
inside through the opening quarter, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MISS
SURPRISE pressed the pace between horses in the early going, continued to duel for the lead from the three path while racing around the turn and faded
down the lane.

Footnotes
GLITTERARY tracked the leader through the first turn, took closer range on the leader down the backstretch while well clear of the rest of the field, engaged
outside of SMACK near the half, prompted the pace two wide around the far turn, dueled from near the quarter pole, was driven in upper stretch, took the
lead approaching the furlong mark, came in near the furlong mark causing SMACK to check sharply, cleared, and held off the late rally of WHITE LIES. The
latter settled at the middle of a well-strung field, inched forward to chase the leading pair outside of APRIL'S GEM around the far turn, began to improve on
the leading pair into the lane, sustained her rally, and gained outside of GLITTERARY all the way to the wire. WINDY CITY GIRL settled in second last
early, raced at the rear of a stretched-out field down the backstretch, took closer order inside on the far turn and into the lane, found her best two wide in the
final sixteenth, and gained well late for the show. RAPID TRANSIT settled at the rear early, continued toward the rear while well off the rail down the
backstretch, chased toward the rear of the main pack in the two to three path around the far turn, swung four wide for a rally in the lane, improved but was
outkicked for the show. SMACK set a clear lead through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, was engaged by GLITTERARY to her outside near the
half, dueled inside of that foe from the quarter pole, proved no match approaching the furlong mark, checked sharply at the eighth pole when GLITTERARY
came in, and weakened inside. NORTHERN ALLIANCE was keen while chasing with the middle of a well-strung pack, kept on toward the rear in the two to
three path on the far turn as all but the leading pair took closer order with each other, took closer order on the leading pair in upper stretch but was ultimately
outfinished three wide between horses. APRIL'S GEM chased the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, continued well behind them through the
backstretch, chased the leading pair in the two path inside of WHITE LIES around the far turn, and lacked the needed finishing kick inside in the lane.
STEWARDS PERFORMED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GLITTERARY FROM FIRST AND
PLACED HER FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE ON SMACK MIDSTRETCH.

P H FACTOR was urged to the early lead, showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the
far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held off a late closer under a drive to the wire. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME stumbled and bumped with the horse to
his outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, began a bid between
horses while racing in the two path around the far turn, and gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire. GO FOR SHERRIE raced in the two path
around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, could not go with the
eventual winner entering the stretch and finished evenly. JEFF THE LION was bumped by the horse to his inside and squeezed back leaving the gate,
raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path, made a
mild bid approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked while finishing evenly in the stretch. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) saved ground around the first turn,
tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER tracked the leader inside of UPBEAT MELODY early, stalked two wide on the turn, encroached outside of VALIANT VINNY past the five
sixteenths, loomed two wide in upper stretch while he and VALIANT VINNY drew well clear of the rest, vied with that foe through midstretch, and edged to
the lead in the final sixteenth. VALIANT VINNY broke sharply, bumped UPBEAT MELODY in the opening strides, cleared early, saved ground on the turn,
was engaged by CITY DRIFTER to his outside past the five sixteenths, raced well clear of the rest of the field while threatened by CITY DRIFTER in upper
stretch, vied inside that foe through midstretch, and proved no match in the final sixteenth. ETCHED IN STONE settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four
path on the turn, began to take closer order when pushed along past the three eighths, swung four wide into the lane, gained outside while all out in the
lane, never threatened the top pair but ran well clear of the rest. POWER THROUGH came in early and brushed with DREAM KEEPER while racing three
deep in the chasing flight, continued three deep in the four path while chasing on the far turn, came into the lane toward the rear, drifted in and out down the
stretch, could not match the finish of ETCHED IN STONE but proved best of the rest. RICHY was bumped by DREAM KEEPER in the opening strides and
brushed with that foe early, raced at the inside of the chasing flight, saved ground around the turn, raced into the lane inside near the rear, was driven inside
in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. DREAM KEEPER came in and bumped RICHY early, brushed with RICHY and POWER THROUGH early
while racing in tight between those horses, continued between horses in the chasing flight around the turn, was relegated to the rear two wide into the lane,
dropped to the inside in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. UPBEAT MELODY was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the start and was bumped by
VALIANT VINNY in the opening strides, tracked the leader outside of CITY DRIFTER down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the
turn, began to weaken two wide into the lane and was allowed to fade late.

AND WON tracked toward the front of the main group outside of JUSTENUFFTUFF, took closer order on the leader three wide past nine sixteenths of a
mile out, was urged three wide near three eighths of a mile out, encroached outside of DRIVER DAN into the lane, took the lead just past a furlong out,
cleared briefly in upper stretch and held driving. JUSTENUFFTUFF tracked toward the front of the main pack inside of AND WON, took closer order past
nine sixteenths of a mile out in tandem with AND WON, saved ground around the far turn while tracking in range, shifted three wide under a drive into the
lane, rallied, but could not get to AND WON in time. MEMORY BANK settled toward the rear outside of ANDREW THE GIANT, took gradually closer order
on the tracking flight into the backstretch, was pushed along approximately seven sixteenths of a mile out, improved four wide on the far turn, raced five to
six wide in upper stretch and continued to rally mildly. DRIVER DAN was placed on the lead and soon opened up a gaping advantage, carried a smaller
lead approaching the far turn but still set the pace in the two path around the bend, was confronted by AND WON to his outside into the lane, headed with a
furlong mile to go, and flattened out. ANGELINO settled toward the rear inside of MEMORY BANK through the clubhouse turn, chased patiently down the
backstretch and in the three path on the turn, began to rally under a drive past five sixteenths of a mile out, improved mildly inside into the lane, but was
ultimately outkicked. ANDREW THE GIANT was anxious in the gate, came in and bumped KEARNY COUNTY in the opening strides, chased at the middle
of a well-strung field, took closer order while driven four wide on the far turn, but flattened out into the lane and ultimately did not have enough two wide in
the lane. HIGH ON SUGAR settled inside of KEARNY COUNTY in the rear flight, continued well off the pace in the five to six path on the far turn, and
lacked the needed rally. CADET CAPTAIN chased well behind the lone leader early, inched closer past nine sixteenths of a mile out, raced at the inside of
the tracking flight into the far turn, began to weaken near three eighths of a mile out and had no more for the drive. KEARNY COUNTY was bumped in the
opening strides and took back as a result, settled outside of HIGH ON SUGAR in the rear flight, was urged in the six to seven path on the far turn and had
no response.

GIANT'S FORREST settled near the rear while well behind most of his foes, took closer order while saving ground around the far turn, swung five wide into
upper stretch, was forced out in traffic midstretch, nonetheless finished well on the outside and nailed CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT in the final strides.
CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT broke outward, soon trailed, took closer order in the three path on the far turn in tandem with GIANT'S FORREST, swung out six
wide into upper stretch, improved under a drive, reeled in ZARMAE approaching the sixteenth pole, but was caught in the final strides. DARK WOOD (IRE)
chased at the rear of the main group, was pushed along inside into the far turn, improved while saving ground around that bend, swung three wide into
upper stretch, came out and bumped SPEAK ENGLISH midstretch, sustained a rally between horses, but was outkicked. ZARMAE tracked the leading pair
inside of SPEAK ENGLISH, inched forward to track the leader inside of DANCIN NICKY near the half, tracked the leader inside around the far turn, bid two
wide into the lane, took the lead approaching the furlong mark, was headed nearing the sixteenth and flattened out inside. SPEAK ENGLISH tracked the
leading pair two wide while racing keenly through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase outside foes while under restraint, chased two wide around the far
turn, swung out and was driven four wide in upper stretch, was bumped by DARK WOOD midstretch, and flattened out. DEWY'S HIT was sent two wide,
cleared into the clubhouse turn, continued to set the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground around the far turn, was engaged by ZARMAE
near the three sixteenths, lost the lead to that foe approaching the furlong pole and folded inside. DANCIN NICKY was sent for speed inside but outsprinted
by DEWY'S HIT into the clubhouse turn, tracked the pacesetter around that bend and two wide down the backstretch, was driven in the three path on the far
turn, weakened between horses and had no more for the drive.
