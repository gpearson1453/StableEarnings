Footnotes
GRUMPELSTILTSKIN prompted the pace two to three wide outside BLUE DANUBE, moved to challenge past the five sixteenths, secured command soon
into the lane, kicked clear under strong handling in mid stretch then dug in late. VICTORY ELEMENT chased the leaders off the rail, shifted four wide into
the lane and finished gamely to steadily gain. CONFUSION BABY BOY drafted back after and alert break, saved ground under firm rating leaving the far
turn, angled out for the drive, advanced between rivals with a sixteenth to go and kept on with interest to bridge the gap. KEEPING THE PEACE edged up
four wide early and gained a chasing spot, circled five wide into the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and came up empty. VICTORY GIVEN broke a
step slow, lagged off the pace while towards the inside, angled five wide into the lane, altered further out in the drive and had a mild response. BLUE
DANUBE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was pressured past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. D C FIREMAN
lacked speed two to three wide and failed to generate a kick.

Footnotes
ENGLISH TAVERN , bumped and squeezed back at the break, regrouped and settled back early on, was taken well wide soon into the backstretch, was
floated out to be about five wide while advancing into the far turn, responded when given his cue and moved up three deep past the five sixteenths,
sustained under pressure and moved to engage the leader nearing the eighth pole, took over with about a sixteenth to go and dug in tenaciously to fend off
and outside bid from MYSTICAL MAN. MYSTICAL MAN settled off the pace while saving ground, picked up some momentum mid way on the final turn,
shifted out four wide into the lane, ranged up outside rivals leaving mid stretch, threatened the winner through the final seventy yards, kept on willingly but
was denied. AMERICAN D'ORO , between runners early, dropped in and took closer order after a half mile, saved ground advancing past the five
sixteenths, eased out in upper stretch, moved up behind the leaders in mid stretch and churned on with interest. TORRES DEL PAINE cleared early, set the
pace towards the inside, came under pressure in upper stretch, dug in when confronted, battled past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly in the final
yards. BENANDJOE stalked three wide, was ridden chasing around the final turn then faded. SOUPER FORTUNE , bumped at the break, raced three wide
around the first turn, shifted four wide past the half mile marker but failed to fire leaving the three eighths. WILLING TO SPEED rated off the pace and off the
inside, was angled out put to pressure leaving the far turn, dropped in nearing the quarter pole and gave way. WINSTON PEGG stalked the pace two wide,
moved up to briefly challenge around the far turn, failed to kick on nearing the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
THE ANGRY MAN , three deep stalking the pace down the backstretch, moved up outside horses around the far turn, took command in upper stretch and
pulled away with something in reserve. AWARD NOMINATED , a forward factor in the two path around the far turn, chased the winner through the stretch
and impeded GREY GIANT when drifting out approaching the finish. GREY GIANT , four wide the far turn, moved up outside AWARD NOMINATED in the
stretch and was bumped and herded out by that one in deep stretch. CORKMAN , in hand behind horses entering the backstretch, raced along the rail,
steadied and dropped back when lacking room entering the far turn, remained inside horses on the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and offered a
late move. SUPER HOUDINI , three wide on the far turn, was fanned to the six path in mid stretch and showed some late interest. JACK OF HEARTS ,
three deep entering the first turn, was taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear approaching the backstretch, set the pace along the rail to upper stretch and
tired. IRISHMAN hugged the inner rail around the far turn and gave way. TYLER TIME raced well off the rail and gave way. Following an objection by the
rider of GREY GIANT, AWARD NOMINATED was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
GREAT IDEA saved ground early under some rating, checked nearing the five eighths, dropped in to save ground past the half mile marker and was
patiently handled, worked between foes past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide soon into the lane, made a grinding run under pressure, forged to
command in deep stretch then edged clear in the final yards. WELSHMAN , keen early while four wide into the first turn, relaxed a bit better into the
backstretch and tracked a contested pace, angled out three wide into the far turn, rolled up when given his cue and gained command nearing the lane,
kicked clear after being set down in upper stretch, was hooked inside the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. NORDIC RHYTHM settled off the pace,
edged up three wide into the far turn, shifted out wider and closed steadily. EMPHASIZE was squeezed back soon after the break, regrouped and settled,
advanced off the rail leaving the far turn, moved up with aim in mid stretch, angled in and kept on willingly. LACCO AMENO was steadied around the first
turn, lagged back, angled four wide into the stretch and rallied. CALLYOURIGHTBACK dueled inside on a short lead, was headed near the quarter pole and
weakened in the final furlong. NTH POWER , off the pace, angled three wide leaving the far turn and lacked a bid. BALLYHOO PRINCE settled in the clear
near the half mile marker, failed to kick on nearing the lane and weakened. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT , three deep with the pace into the first turn, emerged in
a battle outside CALLYOURIGHTBACK through the backstretch, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and weakened. TREASURE TRADITION ,
fractious behind the gate, vied between foes into the first turn, dropped in and stalked through the opening three furlongs then dropped back.

GENTLEMAN JOE moved up three wide on the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch, dueled outside THERISASTORMBREWIN, repulsed that one near
the sixteenth pole then dug in tenaciously to prevail. INK chased the pace and rallied outside the winner to just miss. THERISASTORMBREWIN hugged the
inner rail, dueled through the stretch and tired late. YES SIR COLONEL broke sluggishly, circled the turn three wide and lacked a rally. GHOST STALKER
lacked speed and was not a factor. GALATIANS saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. ARMANDO R trailed.

Footnotes
DREAM BIG DREAMS saved ground off of a contested pace, was put to a hustling ride leaving the far turn, angled out and circled five wide with some
momentum into the stretch, sustained under left handed encouragement and got up in the final jumps. CELTIC TREASURE broke on top and dropped in to
set the early pace, was joined soon into the backstretch and got into and extended battle to the inside of BRUTUS, shook clear under asking nearing mid
stretch, widened a bit soon after, kept on valiantly but just could not hold off the winner's charge. ROMP , taken to rate early, edged up past the five eighths
and took aim of the embattled leaders, was put to pressure mid way on the final turn, edged up while trying to lay in past mid stretch, corrected late and
rallied between foes. TIZ MANDATE broke a bit slowly, raced three wide around the first turn, dropped further off the pace soon into the backstretch, was
under a ride leaving the three eighths, came four wide for the drive and steadily gained between rivals. BRUTUS , off a bit slow when breaking outward,
straightened and pulled his way forward to join CELTIC TREASURE from the outside, gained a short lead heading to the five eighths, sparred to upper
stretch, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded. SASSY KING , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WAR CANOE , bumped by ZEYARAAT soon after the break, was patiently rated inside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, eased out to the
four path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside rivals and was up approaching the finish. KISS THE GIRL forced in ZEYARAAT when bumping with
that one leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace three deep down the backstretch, advanced to bid for the lead between horses in deep stretch and just
missed. DECIDING VOTE prompted the pace two wide, gained the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and weakened in the
drive. CAT'S PAJAMAS saved ground stalking the pace, eased out in upper stretch and failed to rally. ZEYARAAT broke awkwardly, was forced in when
bumping with KISS THE GIRL leaving the starting gate, raced four wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally. POSITIVE DANGER assumed the
early lead, set a slow pace along the rail and faltered in the drive.

COUNT THE SHELLS , taken to rate early, edged up three wide and between foes in upper stretch, dropped inside past mid stretch, sustained under
pressure and forged ahead in the final yards. PEPE AND HEYWOOD dueled outside a rival through a sharp pace, shook clear mid turn, widened under a
drive in upper stretch, dug in when confronted from his inside and gave way grudgingly. TRUE SHIPMAN , three to four wide, moved up into the stretch, had
aim and flattened out. PET'S NIGHT saved ground leaving the far turn, eased out and moved up between horses into the stretch, chased and came up
