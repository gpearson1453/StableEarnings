drive and swept by the leader in deep stretch. TALLY ROAD set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn, led near mid stretch but was passed in the late
stages. POOLSIDE MANNERS raced in mid pack, closed two-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch, dueled, but gave way mid stretch. INFINITE PASSION
stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then evened out in mid stretch. ZIP IT forced the pace, bid along the rail entering the turn, dueled,
yielded upper stretch and faded. SHAZEEN broke slowly, trailed the field but never reached contention.

QUEEN BEACH raced in mid pack along the rail, closed two-wide late turn, rallied determinedly and was up in time, driving. WIDE AWAKE settled in mid
pack, closed three-wide on the far turn, launched a strong stretch drive but was out done in the final yards . PENETANGUISHENE pressed the pace, bid
late turn, led into the stretch but was caught in the late stages. KENTUCKY FAN steadied leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, closed late turn, angled out in
the stretch and rallied. ALTERNATIVE VIEW stalked the pace, was hustled on the far turn, moved off the rail upper stretch and finished gamely. SWEET
SHADES led into the first turn, set the pace, was headed late turn and had no response in the stretch. CLASSY MISTRESS settled off the pace, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn and was striding out through the stretch. IVY'S STAR settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the
far turn then tendered a mild rally. SUPER LEGGERA settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide through the far turn then evened out in the final
furlong. STORM GAUGE, off slowly, gained position in striking range, dropped back while racing five to three-wide on the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
NAITAKA comfortably stalked the leader down the backside, moved up and led by mid turn, opened a clear advantage turning for home and was kept to her
task to maintain it. FOR MY ELBI hit the side of the gate and broke in at the start, sat off the pace and closed from the rail to four wide on the turn, tipped out
to the five path into the stretch and closed widest, getting by three rivals in the final sixteenth for the place. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA won the break and
dropped back to midpack while three wide, moved up outside the winner on the turn and looked dangerous at the quarter pole but couldn't sustain the rally
down the lane, stubbornly holding off two rivals for the show. GEORGIAN DANCER was midpack and inside into the turn, came two to three wide and to the
inside of the eventual place finisher by the quarter pole, outfinished by two rivals for second and third. JUNGLE GODDESS hit the gate and stumbled at the
start, came off the rail midpack on the turn and followed the winner's path but levelled off in the final furlong. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY began awkwardly
and trailed through the backstretch and turn, able only to pass a few tiring foes down the lane. GO GIGI GO GIGI GO off the pace early, circled up two to
five wide on the turn but levelled off in the final furlong. ELITE SONG broke out at the start but quickly recovered and went to the front, held the lead until
midturn when the winner collared her, backing up from there to the wire.

the pace, closed quickly between horses on the far turn, bid near the final 16th and gained the lead but was caught late. KERICS BEAUTY stalked, bid
three-wide late on the final turn, led briefly in the stretch but was passed late. THATNIGHTINTORONTO, off a step slowly, led briefly then pressed the pace
on the backstretch, bid on the far turn, led at the 1/4 pole but was passed in the final furlong and chased to the end. TOTAL BETTY settled in mid pack, was
hustled two and three-wide on the far turn and finished gamely to no avail. THESKYISTHELIMIT hopped out of the gate, raced in mid pack, circled five-wide
late turn then evened out in the final 16th. ROSA VILLOSA settled off the pace, saved ground on the turns, was hustled through the far bend but lacked a
closing response. NO MORE FENCES showed early speed, led on the backstretch, gave way to rivals mid way through the far turn, was eased up, crossed

Footnotes
GOLDEN GARTER, in range, came three-wide through the turn, rallied determinedly, led a 16th out and held under a drive. ANITA GRIGIO, away slowly,
settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, launched her rally at the head of the stretch and was gaining late. SPARKLE SAMMY set a
reserved pace, was passed a 16th out and lost the place position late. GRATEFUL PRAISE broke inward and settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn,
was blocked upper stretch and posted a belated run. MISS SAVVY stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened
out with a 16th to run. VEIL stalked the pace from the rail, chased hard upper stretch but finished evenly. SILENT RESPECT steadied leaving the gate,
settled in mid pack, raced three and four-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response.
