Footnotes
SO COURAGEOUS stalked toward the inside, took the nod while between horses leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn
then dueled clear later yards. CHARITABLY GIFTED stalked inside, dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and continued a factor to
mid-stretch before relenting later yards. ATRANI rated a slim early lead, was headed leaving the five sixteenths pole, drifted a bit toward the top of the
stretch then flattened. MEGALODON'SREVENGE chased outside, rounded the turn in the three path and passed a rival in deep stretch. UNCLE BOOTSIE
rated close off the rail then faded into the turn. TEDDY TED came away slowly then saved ground.

Footnotes
TIZ AUCTION TIME stalked inside, bid toward the five sixteenths pole and raced close at the rail on the far turn, angled out from the eighth pole and dug in
through the lane to take over the final yards. JACOB T stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, challenged into the backstretch and contested
at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, took a slim lead a furlong away, was steadily encouraged through the lane but gave up the advantage in
the final yards. GOOFY BOY saved early ground then eased slightly out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
three path of the far turn, moved to the outside leaving the turn and dug in to take third the final yards while gaining on the top two. TRUE CROSSING took
a quick lead and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was
headed at the eighth pole then flattened the final sixteenth. COMPROMISO was shuffled back early and settled off the pace about the three path, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MINE TO HOLD settled off the
pace about the four path and raced close outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far
turn. HACKER MAN rounded the opening turn about the five path and was always well off the pace.

Footnotes
HESSICA broke outward to exchange contact with Bonnie Bluetooth then rated close toward the inside, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole,
drew to a threatening position two deep midway on the far turn then dug in under steady stretch handling to take over the final yards. CASTLE LIGHTS
angled to the inside the rate the pace, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and kept the edge over Timetogetup from that point, put that one away at the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled leaving the turn, though, gave up the lead in the final yards. BONNIE
BLUETOOTH broke in to exchange contact with Hessica then rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
off the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BAYS CASTLE settled close to the early pace in the two and three paths, gave chase
from the five sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then outfinished in a stretch long duel for third. PRINCESS HALO raced in the five path the
first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, saved ground on the far turn but showed little in
the lane. MY JUBA showed little response through the backstretch. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS was never a factor. TIMETOGETUP stalked the earlier
pace about the three path, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
RAVEN RAHY drew clear on the chute and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the turn and was under steady hand urging down the lane. LIL CHITU pressured the early pace, raced close in the three path on the turn, dueled in the
upper stretch for second and gained mildly on the winner late. RICHIE'S B L chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then ceded in the stretch duel for
second. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY engaged in close early chase off the rail then faded through the turn. CASTILLETE was never a factor. APPEAL TO
RESPOND dropped well back early on.
