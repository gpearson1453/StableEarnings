Footnotes
TEQUILA JR forced the pace outside, edged to front quarter pole, inherited a long lead when his inside challenger fell and proved much the best. BUSTER
BRUNO stalked the dueling leaders, swerved sharply to avoid stricken rival in the stretch and lasted for the place. MERGING TRAFFIC broke a step slowly,
rallied then steadied near the fallen rival. ROAD CALL dropped back outside and steadied to avoid stricken foe. LEA'S ROAD chased in the two path and
was never a factor. FORGOTTEN MAGIC vied for the lead inside, suffered a catastrophic leg injury at the top of the stretch and was subsequently
euthanized. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident in the stretch..

Footnotes
BRAZEN set a pressured pace inside, repelled a challenge at the head of the stretch and edged away. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE prompted the pace outside,
engaged the winner at the top of the lane but was no match. RACK GIN saved ground throughout and continued willingly. SPECTACULAR KID prompted
the leaders outside and came up empty in the stretch. HARD GAME was urged between rivals down the backstretch, moved wide in the stretch without
menacing. MISSION WRAPITUP dropped back racing wide and was never in contention. WILDCAT CURA lunged at the break, chased wide and gave way.

advanced inside and finished willingly. CHARLIES SAFARI lacked speed, moved closer along the inside but was no threat. DIABLO D ORO dropped back
three wide and lacked a rally. LIAR SIDE CHAT was urged close up outside for half a mile and faded. ONE SLICK START hustled to the front inside, was
collared midway on the turn and faltered. M I SIX chased outside and stopped losing contact with his field.

DOC MEEKS well placed inside, angled out into the stretch then wore down the leader through the final furlong. MOON CHANT set the pace inside, moved
clear in midstretch but was nailed nearing the wire. JANELLE DREAMS dropped far behind then closed the gap along the inside. SUPERLING lagged very
far behind then offered some late energy. DRIVEN BY SPEED was fanned extremely wide into the first turn, raced close up and faded. SIDEREAL raced
behind wall of rivals, clipped heels and bobbled near the top of the lane. LORDEN'S LOVE prompted the pace in the two path for half a mile and faltered.
BOOMERANG MISS drifted very wide into the first turn and faded. WINGS OF FURY raced close up between rivals and gave way. Due a timing issue the
six furlong fraction was omitted.

FRISKY FEELING dropped to back of the pack, advanced inside, sustained her rally and was up in the final yards. TIZ A SHARPIE lagged far behind,
moved wide on the final turn and just missed. SUGAR STREAK saved ground, bid to the front on the final turn, drifted out badly in the stretch losing the
advantage. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER stalked the pace outside, bore out near the quarter pole, moved very wide in the stretch. PENANCE hustled to the
front in two path, was finished after three quarters. BIRD TRAFFIC raced inside and lacked a response. BROAD STORM moved briefly closer before half a
mile then faded. WEST HORIZEN raced off the leaders inside and stopped abruptly.

pace outside, bid wide into the stretch and finished willingly. SUPERHELPFUL dropped back inside, continued along the rail but was outfinished. SOCIAL
EXCLUSION lacked speed inside, moved out in the stretch with some late energy. TAQSEEMAAT hustled to the front from the outside post, led to the
stretch and tired. LIRAZ prompted the pace outside then came up empty in the stretch. SHARON'S LAW raced wide within range and lacked a rally.
BROAD JUMPER chased in mid[ack and lacked a response. AFRICAN SONG lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. PETTIGO GIRL chased outside,
moved three wide on the final turn and faded. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD dropped back inside and weakened steadily. DIAL A LADY raced far behind
