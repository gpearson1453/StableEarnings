ISLE STORM Contested the lead from the outset while four wide, two path on the turn, battled to the wire and proved best. BUSTED CREDIT Contested the
lead along three path, took the rail on the turn and then matched strides to the late stages while finishing gamely. PURPLE MALINDA Unhurried along the
three path, angled wide and was going well late. NOT NOW DONALD Well placed four wide early, three path on the turn and weakened. ANOTHER IMAGE
Close up inside early and then saved ground while tiring. CHOSEN BY GRACE Broke slow and then saved ground throughout while always outrun. SO
ARE YOU Broke three lengths slow, four wide on the turn and tired. Due to a timer malfunction the half and five-eighths time were hand timed.
