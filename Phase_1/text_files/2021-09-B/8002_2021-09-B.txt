Footnotes
WINDING chased briefly then went up to duel from inside, cleared rival at the three-eighths pole, showed the way three wide into the drive, drifted out a bit
through the lane and was kept to task with the right-hand and steady handling. AROUND THE DIAL forwardly placed outside the top pair early on, angled
down to the two path around the turn, could not threaten the winner late but stayed on to prove second best. THELUTEISMINE tracked the speed off the
rail, went four to five wide into the lane and gained the show. NO MORE FIREBALL away quickly at the start, challenged from inside and dueled with
WINDING for command, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn, chased four wide into the lane and weakened. ROYAL SEEKER lacked early
speed, angled in on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FLIPPING FAST broke out, went three wide around the first turn, went up to apply pressure from outside under a hold, headed rival on the far turn, battled
down the stretch, fought between rivals in the final sixteenth and won the bob on the line. ASSIGNATION stalked the pace from inside, angled out on the far
turn, came three wide into the stretch, steered out further in the lane, closed in and drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and lost the bob. SOCIALLY
SMART sped to the front in the two path, set the pace under pressure on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, battled down the stretch and finished
gamely to the wire. DEVIL'S MESSENGER took the first turn four wide, raced in range well off the rail, traveled three then four wide on the second bend,
chased within striking distance in the drive, shifted in nearing the sixteenth pole but faltered in the late stages. KOKO'S MOM settled at the back while not
far off the leader, went two wide around the far turn and came up empty.

FAST DRAW MUNNINGS showed early speed between rivals then dropped back to chase the leaders, went three wide into the turn, moved out and came
five wide into the stretch, re-rallied and headed the top duo with a sixteenth to go and got up late. ASPEN SHADE vied three deep while between rivals
early, cleared briefly past the half-mile pole, was re-engaged by OUBABE around the turn, fought with that rival down the stretch, carried a short lead into
the final sixteenth but yielded to the winner late. OUBABE vied four deep early, dueled with ASPEN SHADE around the turn and down the stretch, fought
back in deep stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. EREBUS vied for command from inside then chased leaving the backstretch, angled off the rail and
came three wide into the stretch and churned on to hold a minor award. SIPPIN N KISSIN was off slow to begin, traveled five then six wide around the turn
and lacked a rally. DISOBEY hustled early from inside, tracked the pace two wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide, angled out in upper stretch and
lacked further response. GRAZEN IN THE PARK was off very slow to begin, went two wide into the turn, exited four wide and never got involved.

SHES BOUT A MOVER away quickly from inside, set the pace with SUGAR SUGAR alongside, held a short lead three wide into the lane, cleared with
three-sixteenths remaining and inched away. SUGAR SUGAR pressed the pace from outside, kept the pressure on four wide into the lane, lost contact at
the three-sixteenths pole and held the place. TALKATIVE GAL broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased off the inside, five wide into the stretch and
finished evenly for the show. MACHO QUEEN stumbled and bumped at the start, chased three then four wide on the turn and could not offer the needed
response. DELIA MO chased off the inside, outside a rival on the turn, exited the bend six wide and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SWEET SONNY sped clear from outside, angled to the rail entering the turn, roused with three-sixteenths remaining, put to right-handed urging approaching
the eighth pole and lasted. DUAL REALITY got bumped from outside early, went two wide into the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, rallied late and
got up for the place. MEASUREOFDEVOTION forwardly placed in the beginning inside a rival, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the lane and
continued to give chase, then launched a late bid but was not enough. ARISTEIA chased off the rail, navigated the turn two then three wide, angled out in
upper stretch and failed to produce a bid. MAMMA RAMA shifted in, bumped rival and checked early, angled four wide into the stretch and improved
position. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR stumbled sharply, raced in mid-pack early on outside a rival, went three deep into the turn, exited the bend five wide and
lacked a rally. RIVER GIRL broke out a bit but was quickly straightened out, went up to be forwardly placed outside a rival, went two wide through the turn
and weakened. CROOKHAVEN LASS tracked the pace from inside, shifted to the two path around the turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace.
