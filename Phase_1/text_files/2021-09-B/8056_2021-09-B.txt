WE'RE IN COMMAND away well and was allowed to settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced from
along the inside midway down the backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, took command in deep
stretch and quickly pulled clear. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, controlled the
pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch and was all out to hold the place. HEART OF TEXAS broke sharply
and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly one out from the rail
in the drive to garner a share. BRANDON'S LEGACY saved ground through the first turn to gain a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied four wide
through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. COUNTESS CAT tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, began to weaken approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

PARKER POINT away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering
the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and held off a late surge by ONE FIFTY ONE to prevail. ONE FIFTY ONE broke sharply and tracked the
leader two wide from between rivals through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail
entering the final turn, and closed with a late surge four wide in deep stretch to prove second best. BAKLANE away well and raced to a narrow advantage
one out from the rail entering the first turn, continued to set the pace from the outside of FOOT SOLDIER in the run down the backstretch, disposed of that
rival entering the final turn but was quickly tackled by PARKER POINT, was unable to keep tabs on that rival entering the lane, and was outfinished in the
late stages. GUNS N AMMO stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but
failed to mount a serious late bid. FOOT SOLDIER was off a step slow, but rushed up from along the inside to track the leader from along the rail through
the stretch the first time, battled for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the final
turn, and was eased over the final furlong.

COUNTRY COWBOY unhurried early while dropping back to trail while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied five wide entering the final turn,
and closed steadily three out from the rail rail in the stretch drive to get up in the final strides. AMANDA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, opened a clear lead entering the final turn, and just failed to
last. CATTITUDE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out
from the rail in the drive to garner a share. TOMMY TOO settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while in tight quarters. SHOWMAN
broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of AMANDA in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering
the final turn, and was outfinished late. HARBOUR STORM away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

Footnotes
TIZ MEOW settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering backstretch, advanced smartly from along the inside midway down
the backside, rallied smartly from just off the rail through the final turn, and finished full of run three wide in the drive to take command in deep stretch and
quickly pull clear. LITTLE GROOT away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the first turn and in the run down the backside, took
control entering the final turn, but was unable to fend off TIZ MEOW late, while just holding the place. SWORD FIGHTER lagged well off the sharp early
pacesetters while saving ground at the rail near the back of the pack, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly five wide in the
drive to just miss the place. APPELLANT was off a step slow, and lagged well behind the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DAKATI settled off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. MARTELLO away well and vied
for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides
with LITTLE GROOT entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. MUSTACHIO broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing just out from the rail, failed to maintain his posiiton in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

THE CHANCES R away well and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, slipped through along the rail to battle for the lead entering
the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to prevail. DEMERARA away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace two wide in the run down the backside, battled through the final turn from the outside of THE CHANCES R,
and continued a stretch long battle with that for to just miss. SPOKANE'S GEM stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive while gaining late to garner a share. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN
broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn,
and found his best stride too late while finishing five wide in the drive. WICKED FORTITUDE settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the
first turn, advanced three wide shortly after entering the backstretch to loom a danger approaching the final turn, but was unable to sustain his early bid over
the final furlong. ONE LAST HIT settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field into
the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

REPRIMAND broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of LAUGH WITH ME entering the backstretch, began to get the better of that pace rival
while racing two wide into the final turn, maintained his lead into the lane, and held the closers safely at bay late to prevail. EYE BE SEEING YOU stalked
the leaders from the back of a compact field entering the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn
to loom a danger entering the lane, but was unable to gain ground late while holding on for the place. BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and tracked the dueling
leaders from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the stretch drive
to just miss the place. VOLO VELOCE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, to
loom a threat leaving the turn, but needed more late. LAUGH WITH ME away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with REPRIMAND entering he final turn, and faded over the
final furlong.
