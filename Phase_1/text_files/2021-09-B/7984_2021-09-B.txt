Footnotes
SAVE THE DRAMA mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides.
MIDNIGHT PUNK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, held sway to the final yards and was outfinished. CATHMOR well
placed, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. POLLARD STAR allowed to settle,
saved ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and passed tiring rivals for a share. SAMURAI ZIP well placed and outside, held position on the two
path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and evened out. TALE OF KANTHAROS was no factor. UHAVETOBEKITTENME chased the pace
inside and was through after a half.

WOODCHUCK tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to
the task. DORISTO stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then was no match
for the winner and closed for the place. MAGICSTICK allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
flattened out. MAC NINETY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and
held a share. LEGIO well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and weakened. SHARP'S FLASH allowed
to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had no rally. WILD CHASE was no factor.

tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals, then lacked the needed late kick. GROUNDED well placed, held position on
the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and could not gain in the late going. IMPERIAL KING allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and closed well. UNFLAPPABLE MAX well placed, moved
up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, steadied, then could not gain in the late going. NATURAL POWER (IRE) allowed to
settle, moved up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved his position. GRAB THE GOLD mid pack, moved up on the
two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. PEANUTS PERFECTION mid pack, lost some ground three wide through the turn,
bid four wide into the stretch and had no rally. REALLY RED was no factor.
