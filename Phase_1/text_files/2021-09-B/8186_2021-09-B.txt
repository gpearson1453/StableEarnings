Footnotes
MAGICSTICK mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off late. RUNAWAY STAR tracked
the pace, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the winner, while clearly
best of the rest. MAC NINETY well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then flattened out and held the
show. ETTAPLACE lunged at the start, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then could not gain while holding a
share. T REX allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and improved his position. SHARP'S FLASH
showed little, inside. DONALDSON sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the lane and had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
ALYDARIUS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook clear from rivals again through the second turn, then drew off the final furlong under steady
pressure. LIL HOOH'S HOOH tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not gain the final
furlong and held the place. LAPULGA hopped at the start, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and flattened out. HOXIE
allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, weakened in the lane while gaining a share.
DIAMOND N SIMON well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded the final
furlong. MIDNIGHT LEAP passed tiring rivals, widest. SENORITA SPARKPLUG mid pack, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn,
bid four wide into the lane and had no rally. EXTRA SALSA stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn.

STEVIS MAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenged, then drew off in the stretch and was ridden out. JARETH chased
the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, dueled with BLICHTON through the lane, edged ahead of that one
and held. BLICHTON well placed and outside, angled in to save ground through the turn, came through inside, dueled with JARETH and was unable to best
that one. LIDO LEGACY ran evenly. GOOD ONE steadily lost ground.

Footnotes
STRETCH RUNNER stalked the pace on the outside, shook clear three wide through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. FIFTY
PLUS allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the
place late. HUSBAND IN LAW mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, weakened late loosing the place spot.
MONTRICHARD allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and got up for a share. BLAKENSTEIN set the pace
on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened late. SEMI AUTOMATIC ran evenly, inside. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) tracked
the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and had no stretch rally. ABANDONED was a brief factor, outside. KICK IT CHARLIE
stumbled badly at the start, lost the rider and walked off.

STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of
the rest. JUST PLUNGE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the show.
HEATHER'S GOLD stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and flattened out.

Footnotes
ENJOY THE MUSIC mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear late.
BEACH PASS allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed the gap on the winner late. ADIOS
BOBBY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. HEY GRIFF well placed,
gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. BETTER TAPIT allowed to settle, moved up on the two
path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. LEXATOGA mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. DERBY MODEL passed tiring rivals. BETTYS BOMBER improved his position. SPLIT MY BRITCHES
tracked the pace and faded through the second turn. CONGRATS SMOKE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the
second turn, then had no stretch rally. MUTAFAANY was never involved.
