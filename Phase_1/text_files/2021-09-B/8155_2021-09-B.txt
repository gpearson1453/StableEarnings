Footnotes
HONOR MY WORLD angled in soon after the break, was patiently rated between horses down the backstretch, moved up between horses leaving the turn,
steadied when placed in tight quarters by L'ARTISTE at the head of the stretch, closed determinedly outside JESTER , led late and drove clear. JESTFUL
saved ground stalking the pace under a nice, rating hold, found room along the inner rail to take the lead turning for home, opened a clear advantage in mid
stretch and gave way grudgingly. SUPER SCOOBY , checked in tight quarters entering the first turn, was six deep turning for home and rallied outside
horses. DUNLUCE CAISSLE , four deep the first turn, advanced three wide on the far turn and weakened in the drive. THEMSFIGHTINWORDS , four wide
the first turn, was not a factor. L'ARTISTE set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. STORM TOWER , four wide the far
turn, lacked a rally. TRANSFER THE FUNDS dropped back when checked in tight quarters entering the first turn and passed tired horses late. VLAJKO
raced along the inner rail and retreated. MANGO MAN prompted the pace two wide, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
CURRENT was rated back from between rivals soon after the break, settled towards the back and off the inside, crept closer leaving the three eighths,
circled five wide into the lane, sustained under left handed encouragement and forged past ORDER FOR PORKY in the final yards. ORDER FOR PORKY
stalked the pace three wide, moved to engage the leader after six furlongs, went clear under asking in mid stretch, kept on willingly but could not withstand
the winner's charge. PASSPORT , reluctant to load, broke poorly, settled off the pace while saving some ground, came under pressure leaving the far turn,
shifted out six wide for the drive and rallied. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME stalked off the rail, moved up four wide into the lane, had aim nearing mid stretch then
flattened out. B DETERMINED dropped in early and rated in a good spot, edged up leaving the far turn, eased out and progressed between foes in mid
stretch, failed to sustain with a sixteenth to go and faded. TOE CURLIN' KISS saved ground through the backstretch run and lacked a bid. BE YOURSELF
settled off the rail, moved up a bit while between rivals near the half mile marker, shifted in near mid stretch and faded. CURLEE FOX cleared early, set the
pace towards the rail, was taken on near the quarter pole, did not offer much resistance and tired through the final furlong.

THE WALK saved ground on the turn staking the pace, eased out in upper stretch, took command inside the eighth pole and drove clear. KINGSTON PIKE
stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail, was forced to alter course outside IMA IMA STARBOY near the sixteenth pole and rallied
gamely. IMA IMA STARBOY sprinted to a long lead on the backstretch, set the pace to mid stretch and tired. ROYAL NUMBER lacked speed off the rail on
the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to menace. POINT DRIVEN lacked speed, was four deep turning for home, got fanned to the five
path in upper stretch and failed to rally. IT'S SIZZLING TIME chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
VIRGINIA FIB , in a bit close at the break, raced well back into the turn, eased out and was put to pressure mid turn, angled three wide into the lane, closed
steadily under left handed asking, drew alongside SACHMO in deep stretch then just got up to earn the narrow decision. SACHMO rated inside early on,
moved off the rail mid turn, came four wide into the lane, bid outside FRANCIS X. to take command past the three sixteenths, edged clear under pressure,
kept on gamely but was nipped at the wire. FRANCIS X. , four wide outside rivals, moved up three wide past the three eighths, bumped with
WONDERVILLE when laying in past the quarter pole, bid between foes to briefly be on near even terms, drifted in vying past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. WONDERVILLE broke a step slow, regrouped and and edged up inside to stalk, eased out and bumped with FRANCIS X. in upper stretch,
faded and was eased up soon past the sixteenth pole as his rider appeared to misjudge the finish. DIRTY DIRTY , three wide between foes early, checked
between rivals nearing the turn, circled four wide into the stretch, steadied off heels in upper stretch and gave way. HAIR OF THE DOG dueled inside,
briefly went clear in upper stretch then tired nearing the furlong grounds. STAR OF NORMANDY , off the pace, came four wide for the drive and failed to
menace. SPRITZER flashed speed inside and weakened. A GREAT AFFAIR dueled outside HAIR OF THE DOG, failed to kick on entering the lane and
faltered.

DARE TO TRY saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased outside in upper stretch, swept to command in mid stretch and drew away under
intermittent urging. BAY OF ANGELS , near the inner rail around the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and rallied between horses. AMERICAS
WOMAN , four wide on the turn, was well positioned in upper stretch and flattened out. WILLOW DRIVE , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, bid for
the lead entering the stretch and weakened the final furlong. GREEN EYES , prominent three deep around the turn, weakened the final furlong. YOU'RE
DOING FINE raced in mid pack and failed to rally. BLESS AND HONOR was outrun. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS , three wide on the turn, was no factor.
PECULIARITY set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch. MEGALOMANIA trailed.

turn, was roused clear in upper stretch, widened a bit near mid stretch the held sway while steadily hand ridden the final yard. TUSK , five wide early,
dropped in a few paths and engaged the winner into the turn, dueled around the turn, dropped a bit near mid stretch then battled back gamely through the
final sixteenth. PRINCE JAMES stalked two wide, eased back past the five eighths, came back a bit three wide under a ride mid turn, chased the leaders
into the lane but came up empty. CLOSER LOOK , towards the inside and within range into the lane, failed to muster up a rally.

Footnotes
FAIR CATCH , three wide around the turn while chasing the pace, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole and dug in tenaciously under brisk urging to
hold sway. SLIPPIN JIMMY lacked speed, raced wide on the turn, entered the stretch in the five path and rallied between horses. BY THE SEY SHORE ,
void of speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside. HAY BOY sped to the early lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn and
weakened the final furlong. GODLOVESASINNER lacked speed, raced in the three path inside horses in the stretch and failed to be a factor.
FLASHINTHENIGHT , four deep on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. PRINCE PERE raced along the inner rail throughout and
weakened. GALLANT GEORGE chased the pace racing along the inner rail and faltered leaving the turn.

Footnotes
APRILNESS prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, moved to pressure mid turn, secured command in upper stretch, drifted out when clear past
mid stretch, was corrected and dug in tenaciously under a drive to narrowly prevail. MILLIE CHILD settled off the pace, angled out leaving the far turn,
edged up three wide into the lane, shifted out very wide leaving mid stretch, closed gamely but just missed. LIKELY CHOICE , in a bit tight soon after the
break, quickly gained four wide outside rivals nearing the three eighths, edged up between runners in upper stretch, angled in, bid inside the winner in deep
stretch then hung. ALLURING RUMBA rated off the pace and was four deep nearing the turn, circled five wide advancing into the lane, sustained to about
the sixteenth pole then flattened out late. HELLO GRACIE , three wide between rivals early, angled in for the drive, steadied in close quarters near the three
sixteenths then picked things back up in the final sixteenth. ARTEMIS RISING sped clear early, set the pace two wide, was joined past the three eighths,
dueled inside APRILNESS into the stretch, wandered outward near mid stretch and gave way. TRIKKI NIKKI saved ground off the pace, worked outward in
the drive but lacked a solid punch. MS. HAITI , between runners early, made a four wide run to loom into the lane, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and
faded. CLAIRE'S DARLING broke through the gate pre race, stalked towards the inside, eased out in upper stretch and weakened. DOMINATING BUYER ,
between rivals into the turn, eased back out of some tight quarters then was hand urged in the drive.
