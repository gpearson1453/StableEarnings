Footnotes
SHALIMAR GARDENS came out after the break, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, drew off in the two path on the turn, was given a tap
or two of a down-turned crop while dropping to the rail in upper stretch and widened with the rider motionless in the saddle to win handily. BIG CITY
MOMMA bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up while pinched back, was reserved off the pace, moved closer with five
furlongs to run, was urged along while inside to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. VIOLENT VIXEN
was bumped hard at the start and forced strongly into another foe then was squeezed back, raced near the back under some restraint, drafted behind
horses while two to three wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MY SUNNY VALENTINE
was rated on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn and came up empty. TEKILA broke out and bumped hard with a foe, was well position down
the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn and capitulated. BOSS CARA broke in and bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside,
dropped back in the three path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT SKINNY established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside shaking away midway down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn and came under challenge for the initial time near the five-sixteenths when placed to coaxing, got displaced by VIKING ZIM
from command nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, came again unwilling to be denied to take command at the eighth pole, then
edged clear under a drive to the finish to prevail. VIKING ZIM five wide in pursuit, commenced a five wide bid through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths moving quickly into contention to take command near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, came in a path to look the
aforementioned foe in the eye and was collared a furlong from home, got shaken off inside the final furlong while keeping on to secure the place honors well
clear of the rest. ARROWHEART traded a bump at the start with WAR NOVEL, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six
wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. NOBLE JOURNEY chased two to three wide down the backstretch until getting steadily
nudged out to the five path with nine-sixteenths to go by WAR NOVEL tipping out to his inside, tucked four then three wide by the three-eighths, continued
to angle in cutting the corner into upper stretch, then passed tired rivals in the drive. SANDRO THE GREAT chased four then three wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened. REUNION TOUR crossed inside to the three path directly after the start, came under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. GHOSTMON three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. WAR NOVEL traded a bump at the start with ARROWHEART, chased along the inside down
the backstretch, began to steadily tip out to the four path carrying out NOBLE JOURNEY to the five path with nine-sixteenths to go, went four wide through
the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. PIVOTAL RUN chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, then went four to five through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled in to swing along the inside route into upper stretch and
made no impact. COX'S LEDGE chased inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out,
swung three to four wide for home, folded and was eased home. MAMBONICK chased three to four wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, spun
three wide for home, faltered and was eased home. DUE TO A TELETIMER PROCEDURAL ERROR THE MILE SPLIT WAS UNAVAILABLE.

the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, bumped with the runner-up into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging.
PARTNER'S HOPE was rated off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was asked just inside the five-sixteenths, gained outside to make a bid in upper
stretch, bumped with the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE was eased back when

roused at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. UNCLE MO'S CAT bumped with a rival at the start, was taken back

rival at the start, attended the pace on the inside of three foes, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out while asked for
his best in upper stretch, remained on his inside lead to the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. VOTER PROTECTION dropped back early then
settled near the rear, moved in around the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
MISTER J T attended the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. THRUSTER was off slow and
spotted the front a couple lengths, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

outside, vied four then three wide on the turn, took a short lead outside the quarter-pole then was asked, lost the advantage to the winner into the final
furlong, fought on well with good courage but missed while able to get the place. TIMELESS JOURNEY was unhurried at the rear of the field behind a slow
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and finished with good energy. JILL'S A HOT MESS showed the way while
well out in the course, moved in leaving the backstretch, vied in the three then two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and gave way.
FETCHING was reserved off the pace, went four wide early on the turn then gained while shifting six wide, was asked near the quarter-pole and lacked the
needed response. KINKY SOX was reserved off the pace, went three wide early on the turn then moved to five wide, was roused near the quarter-pole and
failed to rally. PURE BODE settled on the inside, moved up with five furlongs to run then advanced to race just off the pace, saved ground while tracking the
leader on the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole and came up empty. ITSAKEYPER hit the outside of the gate at the start, was reserved off the
pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. PARTY AT PAGE'S settled off the early pace then

VENTI VALENTINE coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong issuing a challenge and was up in the very last jump
to the finish. LET HER INSPIRE U coaxed from the start, raced five paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn
advancing to latch on midway, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got floated three wide into upper stretch and came in straightened away to take
command, dug in tussling with SILVER FIST to the eighth pole, shook off that rival near the sixteenth marker now under threat to the outside and was nailed
in the very last stride to the wire. SILVER FIST established the front just after the start and showed the way lightly coaxed in the two path through swift
splits, came under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside three furlongs from home and had the rider intensify the coaxing through the latter
portion of the turn, floated just off the inside into upper stretch taking LET HER INSPIRE U to the three path, got nudged inside straightened away by that
rival and was headed for command, dug in fighting on to the finish but was shaken off in the late stages while clear for the show honors. TRINITY TITOLI
coaxed from the gate, chased four wide until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, made her way to the inside when placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. CINDY'S CHOICE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide
under coaxing from the get go, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TAKE CHARGE LISA seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. SHE'S A MIA broke in
at the start bumping PIMENOVA, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. KNOW
IT ALL AUDREY bobbled at the break, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide for home and tired. PIMENOVA
bumped at the start by SHE'S A MIA, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside forwardly placed, tucked inside through the turn and advanced on the
front through the latter portion of the bend, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. SISTER LINDA coaxed from the break, chased four paths off
the inside early on, tucked to the two path through the turn under coaxing from midway, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact.
SHANE'S RISK coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired. TRY IT AGAIN showed brief speed coaxed along four then three wide, faded through the
turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
BELLA SOFIA showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, responded well set down into upper stretch and drew off under a
mild hand ride to prove much the best. LADY ROCKET stumbled badly at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn and
proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. LAKE AVENUE broke out and bumped with a foe, angled in early, was coaxed along off the
pace, chased inside on the turn and came up empty while able to get the show. DON'T CALL ME MARY settled at the rear of the field, dropped well behind
in the three then two path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
HAPPY HILL LIL four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command swinging three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive confronted by the runner up a furlong out, dueled through the final eighth knocking heads to the finish and got the bob on the
wire. THEODORA GRACE just off the pace three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
duel through the final furlong and lost the nod at the finish. APPRECIATE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. ADELE KAT chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. BACK CHANNEL forwardly placed three wide down the
backstretch, advanced to take command inside the five-eighths, showed the way tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, yielded at the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. ATHENA DANCER broke in at the
start bumping BEYOND BROWN solidly into LUCKY LATKES, then squeezed BEYOND BROWN back against LUCKY LATKES, chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. LUCKY LATKES got bumped between foes at the start when
AVA K'S GIRL broke outwards and ATHENA DANCER broke inwards bumping BEYOND BROWN into her, chased four to five wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no headway. MAZAL EIGHTEEN just off the pace just off the inside in pursuit, got coaxed along
three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. AVA K'S GIRL broke out at the start bumping LUCKEY LATKES in tandem
with BEYOND BROWN due to pressure from ATHENA DANCER to the outside, chased three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went five wide
for home and made no impact. BEYOND BROWN got bumped solidly between foes and was forced to steady when squeezed back at the start conceding
four to five lengths before settling into stride, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. PROPER
GRAMMAR led early on crossing to the two path among a quartet forwardly placed, got headed for command five furlongs from home and chased in closest
aim into the turn tucked to the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered.
