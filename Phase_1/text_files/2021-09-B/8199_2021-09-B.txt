the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged into the turn, came again in the stretch to gain a short lead, then was no match for the winner late and
held the place safe. SECOND ENCORE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady
gain and missed the place. LORD BYRON allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, evened out and gained a
share. SURPRISE KICK mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and ran evenly in the stretch.
WAR DOCTOR ran evenly. HEY SACH stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short lead three wide through the turn, then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
THE SINNER IS YOU stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady
gain and drew off late. MAD JACK rated inside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and lacked the needed late kick. BIG RIG mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and evened
out. BLACK TIE EVENT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share.
CARISSIMO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals and flattened out. GO HIPPO GO allowed to settle, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. C THE KING passed tiring rivals. BREZNO well
placed, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and had no rally. ARCH REVENGE ran evenly for three
quarters and had no stretch rally. CHUCKLES CANDY was no factor.
