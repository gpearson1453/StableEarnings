ANYTHING PAZIBLE In hand along the rail, gained inside into the turn, appeared to check briefly midway around, took the rail again, responded, rallied to
take the lead late and drew off. HEY BIG GUY Broke sluggishly, unhurried along the rail, two path midway around while trailing, altered out for room nearing
the eighth pole and rallied. HARRISON KNOWS Away on top, vied for the lead along the two path, shook clear on the bend, remained clear a furlong out
and weakened late. BUSTIN HOFFMAN Well placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it, lodged a bid outside and hung. SPECIAL STORY
Well placed along the two path, tracked inside into the lane and weakened. FED FEVER Unhurried four wide, five wide into the lane and failed to gain.
LEAP TO GLORY Vied for the lead along the three path, tracked on that path into the lane and tired.
