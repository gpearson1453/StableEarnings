AVENIDA MANANA set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely, drifted in in front of VIP
NATION at the sixteenth marker and then held on well for the win. VIP NATION raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail
in the stretch, steadied behind AVENIDA MANANA at the sixteenth pole, altered course off the rail and rallied mildly late. ACT LIKE ARTIE was bumped at
the start, raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside and was outkicked in the final furlong. STRONG GEM raced off
the pace with a three wide trip, then lacked a stretch rally. GIULIA AMMANNATI raced two wide off the pace, moved up inside in the stretch drive and then
lacked a rally. PADDY'S PRINCESS tracked off the pace on the inside, lacked a bid and faded. GLOVANNA lunged at the break, raced off the pace, came
three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HEADING HOME raced off the pace inside and did not factor. UNCUT was bumped at the start, stalked the
pacesetter, chased and gave way. MAGICAL ROMANCE raced three wide and did not factor. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of
the runner up, the race was declared official. PER THE NEW JERSEY RACING COMMISSION, AVENIDA MANANA HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.
