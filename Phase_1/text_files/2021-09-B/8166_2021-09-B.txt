UNIDENTIFIED MAN rated off the pace inside, made a strong three wide run into contention on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, pulled away and
was kept to the task in the lane. ARTISTIC REASON raced two wide off the pace, went three wide on the backside, chased between rivals on the far turn,
came three wide into the stretch and rallied for second. TWITTY CITY raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied
mildly outside. MAID THE JOURNEY pressed the pace racing close up outside of MY CANDY BIZ, bid two wide on the turn, dueled between rivals and
weakened. MY DANNY BOY raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. KIDYOUNOT raced four wide early, then two wide, chased on the far turn and
lacked a rally. MY CANDY BIZ set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and faded.
