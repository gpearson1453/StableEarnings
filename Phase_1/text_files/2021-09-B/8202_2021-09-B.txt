MORO TRUMP was away in good order on the inside was three off the rail into the first turn and then went to the ral for the remainder of the race and held
sway under mild urging. LET IT RIP raced along the inside behind the three horse speed duel came out entering the stretch while closing much ground but
drifted out in the final eighth and could not sustain the move. PREFERRED PROSPECT raced qat least three wide the entire mile and tired through the
stretch. TOMBI was up close in the two path until midway on the final turn and tired. BOX CANDY raced in the two path while trailing throughout and was
not a factor.

MY MEADOW showed the best speed and was able to get to the rail and edged clear through the stretch and held in the final yards. EPSOM IMP raced
along the inside behind the pace angled out for the drive and was gaining late but ran out of distance. LIVELY SPELL showed good early speed in the two
path but could not go with the top two through the stretch. MISS REVEILLE raced four wide on the turn and could not make up ground. DUSTY SKY had the
rail trip behind the pace but could not make up ground. MAGIC MOMENT was in the back the entire race and never a serious factor.

Footnotes
RHINE FALLS was away in good order and had the early lead and the rail dropped back to fourth on the turn while still on the inside angled out entering the
stretch and finished best to earn the win. APRILINTHEPINES showed good early speed on the outside took a clear lead into the stretch but could not hold
off the resurgence of the winner while second best. WAR MAIDEN hesitated at the break to trail right out of the gate was hustled along the inside to get in
striking position but could not make up the needed ground in the stretch. HEAVENLY ARCH raced three wide on the turn and dropped back in the strtech.
SHESASMARTYPANTS raced along the inside and had no rally. NON DISCLOSURE was bumped at the start and well of the pace and had no rally. MINI
MAGS broke inward and bumped was quickly straightened but had little to say in the outcome.

ALWAYS A TIZ was away in good order took a clear lead early to avoid trouble and drew clear to win handily. SPELL WINDER was in tight quarters going
up the backstretch and was forced to steady slightly raced well in the two path and was up for second. T. P. RIGHT LANE drifted in almost from the outset
causing a chain reaction of bumping and horses that had to steady chased in the two path but after a stewards inquiry was disqualified and placed sixth for
causing the incident up the backstretch. SENNEBEC SUMMER was forced to take up in the chain reaction bumping up the backstretch and seemed to get
the worst of the bumping as she was forced down to the inside rail. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY also was severely impeded in the bumping incident and was forced
to check and lost all chance. BLUEBIRD DAY was forced to steady along the inside up the backstretch and trailed. GARNETS GAL did not get a quick
break and was pretty much clear of trouble raced wide and had nothing for the stretch run.

MUWAAN MAT showed the best early speed to get the rail was challenged for the first half drew clear on the turn and was never seriously challenged
through the stretch. DABBLIN CHANNEL came through along the inside for second while never a real threat to the winner. FRANKI D ORO raced in the two
path the entire trip but had no stretch rally. MISS RULES was well off the pace in the early stages began her move three wide on the turn but could not
sustain the rally through the stretch. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN showed good early speed in the two path to engage for the lead held gamely to the top of the
stretch and then gave way.
