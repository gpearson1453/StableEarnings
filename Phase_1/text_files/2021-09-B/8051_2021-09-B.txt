Footnotes
ADELAIDE COURT settled off the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and was up late under a drive.
CHAIRMAN FOX broke inward, stalked the pace, closed to take the lead into the turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch but was caught as
he neared the wire. JUST START ME UP stalked the pace, pressed the issue on the turn, chased into the stretch, chased, but weakened late. VIRREINATO
had brief speed then stalked the pace, closed approaching the turn, was taken back from tight quarters then rallied gamely along the rail. MAGIC
MOUNTAIN broke outward, sprinted to the lead and the rail, was squeezed back early turn and stumbled, was hustled to the stretch and angled out and
rallied gamely. MY BOY CHRISTIAN was herded outward at the start, closed late backstretch, pressed the pace three-wide but tired at the top of the
stretch. THE BAND COMING was taken back from the start, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. MUSIC TRIBUTE showed brief
speed then settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn but had no closing response. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO
THE TURN BY CHAIRMAN FOX, VIRREINATO AND MAGIC MOUNTAIN AS WELL AS CLAIMS OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDERS ON VIRREINATO
AND MAGIC MOUNTAIN RESULTED IN CHAIRMAN FOX BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH AS BOTH CLAIMS WERE ALLOWED.

DIAMOND CITY stalked the pacesetters, closed 2-3w late turn, swept to the lead a furlong out and held under a drive. SILENT RUNNER stalked the pace,
closed along the rail late turn, was blocked on the fence near the furlong marker, steadied, angled out and closed with a rush. SAN COSTANTINO dueled,
gained a narrow advantage late backstretch, was rejoined early turn, dueled, was roused upper stretch but lacked a response and had had to settle for the
show award. FEELTHEBEAT broke to the outset but had early speed, was joined in a duel, was headed briefly but rebid early turn, battled to the stretch,
wore down his rival but was immediately passed by the winner and gave way. THIS WAY OUT broke inward and had to start from off the pace, was hustled
through backstretch and turn and continued to gain in the stretch.

Footnotes
WHITE FLAG got away slowly and settled in mid pack, chased four-wide late turn, rallied, had the lead a 16th out and held under a drive. LAPOCHKA raced
in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, rallied outside and was gaining late. SIR SEAMUS broke sharply and showed speed, was
headed and pressed the pace, drew even late turn, led a furlong out but was passed near the 16th pole and bravely held place. LOOKINATAMIRACLE
raced in mid pack, saved ground, chased two-wide into the stretch and finished gamely. MR. DIFFLEY, away slowly, settled off the pace, closed three to
five-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. TOLD IT ALL broke inward and bumped CLEAR DESTINATION just out of the gate, settled in mid pack, came
two and three-wide through the turn then rallied between foes. MARTEN RIVER showed early speed, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch but gave
way with a furlong on tap. ARMISTICE DAY raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. SENOR JOBIM
hopped out of the gate, raced in mid pack, chased along the rail into the stretch but evened out late. HONEY WON'T stalked the pace, pressed the issue on
the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out late. CLEAR DESTINATION, bumped just out, raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the turn and
lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SOUPER FLASHY broke slow and trailed into the turn, came two to three wide to move up and tipped out into the six path into the stretch, dove down to the
two path at the eighth pole and was in front at the seventy yard marker, holding safe the place horse in the final few jumps. MENAGERIE chased three wide
down the backside, angled out two to three wide on the turn with dead aim on the embattled pacesetters in upper stretch, got a brief advantage at the
sixteenth pole but the winner went by at the seventy yard marker, staying game but second best. DEMOGORGON stalked the leaders outside, moved up
quickly to engage the pace survivor midway on the turn, won the battle with that rival and held until the sixteenth pole, losing the war to the top pair in the
final stages. LOAD ABROAD led inside a rival, shook that one off but was immediately tackled by the eventual third place finisher, dueled with that foe until
upper stretch but tired in the final furlong. BREATHING FIRE was four wide chasing the front early, dropped back while three to four wide on the turn but
moved up again following the eventual second place finisher into the stretch, levelling off in the final furlong. DREAMS AND SCHEMES three wide and in
midpack down the backside, dropped back four to five wide early on the turn but revved up again and moved up in the five path in to the lane, only able to
inch up down to the wire. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH hesitated at the start and was up to her usual antics, bearing in to the rail when she did decide to come
out, caught the trailers late on the backside and rallied until upper stretch when levelling off. ALLPAIDUP was steadied out from between horses chasing the
early leaders, midpack on the rail throughout before angling out in upper stretch to go by a tiring foe but not much of a bid ensued. LOADED SECRET was
impeded at the break by a foe, sat three wide at the rear and was able to mildly rally down the lane to pass a few stragglers. MAJESTICIMPRESSION sat
along the rail, fell back to off the pace on the turn when between runners and did not enter contention. ESSENTIAL BELLA chased along the rail, dropped
back midway on the turn and down the stretch. SNEAKY REBEL broke out at the start and impeded rivals, recovered to press the leader but faded on the
turn.

DERRYNANE settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to two-wide closing late turn then rallied willingly and swept to the lead in the late stages under a
hand ride. FIFTH ANNIVERSARY pressed the pace into the turn, chased two-wide into the stretch, was all out and gained command in the final furlong but
was passed in the late stages. DUFRESNE broke to the outside, raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, seemed to hang upper
stretch while trying to find the right lead then came running late. MO TOURING settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide closing on the turn, was
fanned out at the top of the stretch then finished gamely to no avail. FULMINATE sprinted clear early, set a reserved pace, was headed in the final furlong
and faded. FOREST B stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then evened out with a 16th still on tap.

WILD BEAUTY (GB) hit the gate and was pinballed between runners soon after the break, trailed down the backside, picked off a few rivals at the rear
before taking a breather early on the turn, advanced when let loose three wide late on the bend before tipping out to the eight path into the stretch, getting
the front by the three sixteenths marker and clearing off, in hand for the final few strides when still clear, the race dominated by closers. PIZZA BIANCA
settled along the rail in midpack ,rallied in behind a wall of pace pursuers late on the turn, in tight quarters when looking for a seam in upper stretch, got that
room at the three sixteenths marker and sprinted into second but the winner was gone, holding safe the place spot over a closing rival. EMINENT VICTOR
had one rival beat on the turn, swung out to follow the winner in the seven path turning for home, closed doggedly down the lane while laying in during the
final stages. MRS. BARBARA trailed on the turn before swinging out into the eight path turning for home much like the first and third place finishers, drifting
in down the lane before switching her lead and continuing to inch up in the final stages to best the rest. DIABOLIC (IRE) sat two wide in midpack watching
the front runners speed off, moved two to three wide on the turn before tipping out into the seven path into the stretch, getting the front at the quarter pole
but out of gas after giving it up near the three sixteenths, tiring from there. GUILEFUL broke out at the start and bumped a rival, stalked the leader through a
solid pace, bid and led as they turned for home but it was a short advantage, swallowed up in early stretch and dropping back down the lane. READY LADY
tracked along the inside behind the leader, stayed in behind a wall of rivals into the stretch and awaited room but had no response when clear in midstretch.
BAKSHEESH broke in and bumped the winner at the start, settled off the pace but could only manage a mild run down the stretch to pass a few tiring foes.
ROYAL ENGAGEMENT was sandwiched between rivals at the start but recovered quickly to three wide stalk the pace, bid late on the turn and was heads
up and down for the front turning for home but retreated in the final three sixteenths. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) cleared to the lead and was had an open
length advantage until late on the turn, headed turning for home and retreated down the lane.

Footnotes
SILENCE BREAKERS dueled past the leader early backstretch, battled through the turn, got his head in front a 16th out and held under a drive. LAST
AMERICAN EXIT stalked the pace in hand, came two-wide through the turn, was boxed in on the rail until he could angle out with a 16th to go and closed
with a rush. NASHTRICK was rated off the pace, closed four and five-wide on the turn, rallied gamely and just missed. COMBATIVE dueled past the early
leader. battled from the rail on the turn then gave way grudgingly in the final 16th. EXECUTIVE SEARCH held a short early lead, but was quickly passed by
two speedsters, stalked three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. ICOMEFROMDOWNTOWN was away slowly and was
left to bring up the rear, closed to contention then was taken to the back of the pack, angled out approaching the stretch and closed outside but did not
menace. SOUPER CLASSY pressed the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

ALPHA PREDATOR settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and closed late. BUTTERED TOAST
settled off the pace, closed four to six-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. STAR SCHOLAR, in range, chased two-wide on the far turn and finished all
out. TRUECREST raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly. HULLABALOO forced the early pace, stalked on the
backstretch, angled from the rail to three-wide hustling late turn but flattened out in the late stages. EXPO bumped with ARQUEBUS at the start, settled off
the pace, closed from the rail on the far turn and was still showing interest in the stretch. SPIRAL STORM settled in mid pack, was hustled three then
two-wide on the far turn but leveled off mid stretch. ARQUEBUS, bumped at the start, gained a short lead, moved clear into the backstretch, dueled on the
turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and retreated. MR. DYDYK settled off the pace, trailed on the far turn and passed several tiring rivals but never
reached contention. IN ALL ALONE raced in mid pack, dropped back late on the far turn and lacked a rally. LOADED SNIPER stalked the pace, closed into
