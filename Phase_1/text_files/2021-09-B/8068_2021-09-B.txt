MISS INHOFE was well rated early while three wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn to duel for command, then slowly edged clear in the stretch to
prove best under a drive. ROYAL CHEYANNE set the pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and dueled for command to leaving the turn, then
stayed on gamely to the wire while being outfinished, second best. PEEKACHICA was allowed to settle while three wide early, came five wide into the drive
and had no rally while besting the rest. EMBROILED prompted the pace two wide then fell off the pace on the turn and eased out four wide by the quarter
pole and came up empty. FUN KEY TOWN was allowed to settle early on the inside and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MELTDOWN set the pace while clear and racing removed from the inside, then was sent down leaving the turn and remained clear to prove best under a
drive. GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE was a bit rank and climbing while on the inside on the first turn, advanced towards the inside nearing the half mile marker,
then eased out on the turn and made a mild four wide bid but could not gain on the winner while clearly second best. RHETT THOMAS was reserved early,
advanced five wide on the turn and came five wide into the stretch but finished evenly while besting the rest. RED LIAISON tracked the pace five wide down
the backstretch and then moved to be three wide on the turn and weakened. HEZA MISCHIEF stalked the early pace while four wide on the backstretch,
then dropped down to the inside on the turn and tired. R B BANNER was reserved early and was four wide on the turn and had no response, dull effort. The
quarter mile fraction was unavailable.

much the best under mild right handed crop urging. FIRESIDE KITTEN was allowed to settle early towards the inside, made a bid two wide on the turn but
flattened out while being clearly second best. OXUM POWER was taken back early and was four wide entering the backstretch, then dropped down to the
inside entering the far turn, advanced two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and was along for the show award. NATIVE LION tracked
the pace and made a five wide bid on the turn but weakened. THE BEAUTY'S TALE chased the early pace three wide and tired. CURLINESQUE was

Footnotes
HE TAKES CHARGE was well rated while four wide down the backstretch, then dropped down to the inside leaving the three eighths pole and made a
inside bid to take over by the five sixteenths pole, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. SHOBIZ STAR pressed the early pace
and made a four wide bid on the turn, but could not go with the winner in the stretch while clearly second best. BOB'S CALLING broke in the air at the start,
then stalked the pace five wide and weakened. TRAFFIC PATTERN set a pressured pace while removed from the inside and gave way. NOD TO PERSIA
stumbled at the start causing the rider to fall off, then walked off.

POLO ART pressed the early pace and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, shook clear by the furlong marker then held sway late under right handed
crop urging. DR. FORMAN was settled early, then was three wide by the quarter poler and closed the gap fast late. SOUIXPER CHARGER set a pressured
pace towards the inside and faded while saving the show award. BORDINI hesitated at the start, then was reserved early, came five wide into the drive and
had a belated rally. RIVERS OF LITE was settled back early, came eight wide into the drive and found best stride late. The starting gate used the five
outside stalls to start this race.

HUMBLE WARRIOR was five wide into the first turn, then rated while six wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn, hit the front
leaving the three sixteenths pole, then was kept to heavy pressure to remain clear late. JUST PHIL set the early pace while racing off the rail, dropped to the
inside on the far turn, then was headed by the winner by the three sixteenths pole, but kept on gamely to the wire to hold the place. CORNER TAP was
allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and closed well late to just miss the place. SHINEONBRAD was
well placed early on the inside, then shifted off the rail on the turn and came three wide into the drive, drifted out through the lane and was gaining. AIR
PAYNTER was settled back early, then was three wide by the quarter pole, shifted out in the stretch to offer a belated rally. PABLO'S SUN was allowed to
settle early, then was on the inside by the quarter pole but lacked a rally. JEOPARDY THEORY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace four wide and
tired. CAST IRON ALEX was not a factor. BUCKSHOT RUN was seven wide into the first turn, pressed the pace five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
KATIE'S BELLE set the early pressured pace while racing off the rail, then shook clear on the turn, then was headed leaving the turn, then was roused and
dug in gamely and drew away late to prove best. MY TOMMY LEE was reserved early while three wide, then steadied slightly nearing the three eighths
pole, shifted out and made a big five wide move on the turn to go on even terms with the winner leaving the turn, tried to lug in by the furlong marker, shifted
to left handed crop urging then back to right but hung, then was wrapped up late while clearly second best. EVIE was well placed early on the inside, made
a inside bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive, bested rest. ABOVE MINE was five wide into the first turn, then was rated four wide down the
backstretch, then weakened. ANGELS OVER ME passed the tiring rivals. HONEST INTENTIONS checked early, then went up to press the pace four wide
and in between rivals and tired. MOCHA pressed the pace five to six wide on the backstretch and stopped.
