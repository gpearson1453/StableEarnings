lane vying willingly. LET'S TWIRL tracked pace vying four wide down the lane hanging late. SHESAROCKSTARTOO slow early raced five wide to upper
stretch finishing evenly at mid track. WILL B LATE played no factor. BEND THE KNEE pressed a narrow lead through the turn dueling to upper stretch
wearing out late. CAKE INA CAN gave way on the turn.
