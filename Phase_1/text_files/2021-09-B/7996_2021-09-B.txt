Footnotes
PRAYERS SAVED broke on top, sprinted clear soon after the start, increased advantage through the turn and into the stretch, continued to hold a
comfortable advantage past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. KUDOS TO YOU closest to the winner in the run up the
backstretch, continued to chase that rival through the turn off the inside, set down, closed the gap on that same rival late. KASEN'S SISTER in the second
flight inside early, saved ground through the turn, went one paced down the lane while remaining in the rail to finish up best of the rest. SUNDAY'S GIFT in
the main body up the backstretch, shuffled back a bit in some traffic into the turn, went evenly when clear through the lane. MY LITTLE GUERA off the pace
while racing outside, four wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
IZZY'S BABY BOY back off the pace after moving off the inside, came three wide through the turn, late surge on the outside to challenge a sixteenth out,
edged clear. ALTERANA chased the leader up the backstretch and through the turn, continued to pursue that one while three wide into the lane, collared
that same foe with a furlong to run, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. FLASHY BREW in mid pack for a half inside, crept closer
turning for home, shifted out a bit for the stretch run, lodged a bid while closest to the inside of the first flight past the sixteenth pole, flattened out in the late
going to be outkicked for the second spot. LOUISIANA HERO fell well back after the start, moved closer along the inside into the turn, two path for the drive,
improved position while not a serious threat to the top three late. BORN AGAIN GEORGE lacked early foot, failed to menace. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER
away in good order, sprinted clear soon after, showed the way through the turn and upper stretch, caved in when headed by the runner up past the furlong
marker. PALVERA tired while four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
THE THREE KS broke in good order from the outside, dueled up the backstretch in the two path, shook clear of the other speed in the turn, expanded that
advantage through upper stretch, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. CLEVER PRINCE lacked speed for a half toward the inside, split foes
when advancing into the stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. TOO TUFF TO CRY void of speed, saved some ground the turn, switched
to the outside when straightened for home, also closed with good energy to be coming at the winner in the late stages while outside the top two. R AND R
STAR within striking distance off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, lacked a winning punch the final furlong. LIGHTNING
HARBOUR in the second flight, came four wide out of the turn, improved position slightly while never dangerous. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY remained back
in failing to menace. BRAD EYE dueled up front inside the winner and closest to the inside, first to blink in the turn, continued to give way through the
stretch. GENES FEATHER moved up steadily along the inside to a forward position the opening quarter, checked up into the turn, 2nd flight into the lane
after recovering then backed up. IDE B STRANDED in mid pack while racing outside, five wide turning for home, tired.

Footnotes
APHRODITES REVENGE forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, continued to prompt the issue onto the backstretch, dueled late backstretch
and into the far turn off the inside, shook off that rival turning for home, drew out through the lane under steady handling. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN broke
through the gate prior to the start, away in good order, narrowly set the early pace, put that rival away before a half, joined from the outside by the winner
soon after, dueled into and through the final turn, could not keep pace in the drive, narrowly held the place. TIZINDY QUEEN settled off the pace and the
inside, asked along three wide through the final turn, went evenly through the lane, not enough for the place. J Z'S FIRST four wide through the first turn,
one paced throughout in lacked a closing response. I GOT WINGS rank at the start, fell back along the inside, moved out, raced four wide through the
second bend, also failed to respond when called on for the drive. MARLOW void of speed, made little impact. MISS LAUGHALOT broke through the gate
and ran off for about a furlong prior to the start, broke on top, flashed brief speed inside, gave way, stopped, jogged in. G G'S WRECKINGBALL under went
a shoe repair in the paddock, broke back, finished early, jogged in. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTINAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
PARK RIDGE BENNY in the second flight in the run up the backstretch after breaking with the leaders, shuffled back along the rail into the turn to lose
position, moved out, came four wide out of the turn, rallied willingly to be up in time. BOSTON REPO broke alertly, narrowly set the pace off the inside,
disposed of the other early speed early in the turn outside that one, shrugged off a second foe from the outside late in the turn, clear past midstretch, could
not contain the winner. WHY JOEY WHY pressed the runner up from along the inside up the backstrech,fell back off that one turn, went evenly through the
lane while continuing to chase that same foe, finished up best of the rest. BEST YOU EVER SEEN behind the early pace outside in the second flight, moved
slightly closer in the turn while four wide, finished up flat. DEBONNAIRE DUDE off the pace while off the inside, three wide and between rivals turning for
home, lacked a serious bid while improving slightly. MAINTAINANCE MATT broke out, last away, trialed for a half out in the strip, five wide into the lane,
picked off some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. FIRE BLASTER in mid pack early, lodged a mid move to challenge outside the runner up in the
turn, gave way in the drive. LITTLE TOE forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady fade before a half. RUN AWAY SON finished early.

Footnotes
DOCTOR LEO broke with the field, settled in mid pack, moved closer two to three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, kicked down the leader
under firm handling. TRIPPER JOHN with the pace after an alert beginning, vied three wide late backstretch, dueled turn, shook clear when straightened for
home, could not contain the winner late, held the place. EGEAUXTISM fell back to trail after the start, fanned six wide when still well back exiting the turn,
rallied down the middle of the strip to be up for the show. PERFECT PERIGEE with the pace while between horses early, dueled into and through the turn
inside the runner up, weakened in the drive. JUSTA SWINGING broke out and a bit slowly, raced back for a half, three wide into the lane, improved position
through some traffic with some belated interest. RELAX TOWN one paced while racing outside, lacked a closing response. YANK CRIME back off the early
pace and the inside, five wide exiting the turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out. PALACE WIND in the second group early, had nothing for the
drive. MR. PAYCHECK pressed the issue early four wide, was five wide when beginning to tire late in the turn, continued to weaken through the stretch.
CRUSADER EXPRESS moved up the inside to be a pace factor early, began to give way turn and backed up through the stretch. LAST APPEAL finished
early, trailed home.

Footnotes
BODIE ON POINTE broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, dueled into the far turn, extended advantage late in the bend, responded when
confronted by the runner up from the outside past the furlong marker, dug in late to hold off that rival in a determined effort. CAJUN SHOTS popped stall
doors, raced in mid pack early, moved closest to the winner when three wide turning for home, closer still nearing the furlong marker, could not get by that
one under firm encouragement, clearly second best. BEE HOUSE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide exiting the turn, rallied out in the strip to be
along for the show, not a threat to the top two. EXOTIC TOWN settled in the second flight, raced three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive.
SWEET AMELIA void of speed after being last away, continued to trail, angled out six wide turning for home, improved position down the middle of the strip.
CANDY CANDY CANDY also lacked any early foot, saved ground through the turn, improved inside of several rivals into the stretch, flattened out in the final
furlong. TEN TAP DANCES back off the pace well out in the strip, came five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. LAST DESTINY also back early, four
wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally as well. SALT LIFE ANGEL moved up to duel inside the winner for just over a half, gave way midway on the
turn. SEVEN COME ELEVEN forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half. KOHENSRISING forwardly placed early, stopped before a half.

Footnotes
FREE LIKE A GIRL asked along from the outside to improve into the turn, challenged from the outside midway on the bend, drifted out entering the stretch
to lose some momentum, rebid past the furlong marker, edged clear late in finishing up with good energy. BUCKLEY BUNNY raced in mid pack for a half
while saving ground, two path upper stretch, roused, lugged in a furlong out, was righted and finished willingly to gain the place. SERAPE settled off the
pace and the inside, came three wide out of the turn, drifted out in midstretch, closed some ground late after recovering to miss the place. MADAME JANE
took command soon after the start, clear late on the backstretch, dueled inside the winner midway on the turn, garnered a slightly larger advantage when
that rival drifted out three sixteenths out, briefly raced on equal terms again with less than a furlong remaining and then weakened in the final strides to lose
a couple of more positions. MOREWICKEDTHANLESS forwardly placed for a half, remained within striking distance upper stretch, came up empty the final
furlong. IRON BANNER one paced early behind the leaders, asked along and improved a bit in the turn then flattened out in the drive. DROP DEAD SEXY
in the second flight early, fell back in the turn, had nothing for the stretch run. ORDER UP ANOTHER fell back to trail after the start, trailed turn, came six
wide into the stretch, remained back. MYLIES STAR broke through the gate prior to the start, was never involved while five wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
THE FLUSH KING in the second flight while well off the inside for three furlongs, 4w into lane, kicked down leader. TOOL BOX away in good order, quickly
worked way clear, held a large advantage through the turn and upper stretch, could not contain the winner late, held the place. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR
broke to the inside, raced in mid pack for a half off the inside, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. PARALISSFRMANALYSS lacked early foot
outside, four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally to improved position, not enough late for the show. SHACK PARTOUT chased the runner up for three
furlongs and began to falter. MR ELVIN off a bit slow, raced well back for a half, found best stride too late through traffic to be going rather well at the end.
PRIMEINTERESTRATE within striking distance outside, raced five wide out of the turn, had little left for the stretch run. MY PAL GREELEY raced in mid
pack for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. RIVER'S RAGING saved ground to no avail in giving way in the drive. ANDREW'S MUSIC dwelt at
the start, remained far back throughout in showing little.
