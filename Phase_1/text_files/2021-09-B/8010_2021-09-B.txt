Footnotes
IZU IZ OR IZU AINT was blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole,
gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, pulled clear with a furlong to go and held his margin to the wire under a drive. MEATABALL raced off the
pace up the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, switched lanes to find room in upper stretch and gained ground quickly in
the final furlong while drifting in mildly. BIRDMAN RICHIE dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the
turn and into upper stretch and gave way with a furlong to go. STAR ON THE MAP dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and weakened between horses in the stretch. HOUR CAT swerved out leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up
the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
MORETHANSOULTITLE came in and bumped FINAL CALL in the opening strides, sent to the lead, was prompted by LAST SPRING to his outside past the
three quarters, continued to set the pace with that foe in close range while racing in the two path around the turn, kicked clear of that foe when shaken up
past the quarter, and continued to draw off under a mild drive in the lane. LAST SPRING switched out leaving the chute, tracked the pace outside of
MORETHANSOULTITLE from just past the three quarter pole, encroached closer to the leader while racing in the three path around the turn, loomed
approaching the quarter, was outkicked by the pacesetter into the lane, but chased on second best under a drive. WILL YA WIN SUM settled at the rear,
took closer order in the three path past the three eighths, was driven between horses in the chasing flight into the lane, floated out to the six path in upper
stretch, and chased the leading pair under a drive while not finding enough to get up for the place. FINAL CALL was bumped by MORETHANSOULTITLE in
the opening strides, chased the leading pair outside of COPPER CROSSING, chased the leading trio into the turn, was pushed along past the three eighths
in the four path, offered a brief mild bid, floated into the lane in the six path, and came up empty for the stretch run. COPPER CROSSING chased the
leading pair inside of FINAL CALL down the back straight, inched closer to the leading pair from near the nine sixteenths, was pushed along past the half
but lost ground on the leading pair while racing in the two path, was driven up the inside into the lane, floated out in upper stretch and proved empty.

SPORT PEPPER came out and soundly bumped JIM AND JIM in the opening strides, was keen to the lead, set the pace while pressured by
WONDERSTRUCK through the first turn, attended inside of WONDERSTRUCK as he took a narrow lead down the backstretch, vied inside of that foe
around the far turn, took over in upper stretch and edged further clear down the lane. WONDERSTRUCK broke slightly inward, pressed the pace outside of
SPORT PEPPER through the clubhouse turn, took a narrow lead outside that foe for the backstretch run, vied inside of that foe while racing in the three
path around the far turn, was outkicked by SPORT PEPPER into the lane but chased on second best. BEAU NOIR (IRE) broke inwardly and a step slowly,
raced keenly inside at the rear into the clubhouse turn, settled better near the rear into the backstretch, rallied three wide from near the three eighths, proved
no match for the top two from upper stretch, and chased on best of the rest. DREAM ISLAND hopped at the break, raced near the rear two wide into the
clubhouse turn, advanced to chase two wide around that end, chased three wide down the backstretch, bid in tandem outside of DARE GOES DA DEVIL in
the four path on the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, drifted further out, and chased on while being ultimately outfinished. JIM AND JIM broke slightly
outward, was bumped soundly by SPORT PEPPER in the opening strides, chased the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, was relegated toward the
rear approaching the far turn as other horses began their advances, continued two wide between horses toward the rear on the far turn, was driven two wide
into the lane and passed tiring horses. WINTER'S GHOST tracked the leading pair inside of DARE GOES DA DEVIL around the clubhouse turn, raced
keenly into the backstretch, chased the leading pair, began to flatten out inside past the half, saved ground around the far turn, was driven inside into the
lane and offered no late rally. DARE GOES DA DEVIL was in tight between horses in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair two wide through the
clubhouse turn, chased between horses down the backstretch, bid in the three path on the far turn in tandem with DREAM ISLAND, was driven two wide
into the lane and flattened while drifting out. EMBODIMENT grazed the gate and broke outward, settled at the rear, continued to trail four wide through the
far turn, was driven three wide into the lane and proved empty.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD flipped his head and broke behind the field leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the far outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane and got up for the
win in the final strides. CRANKSHAFT broke sharply and led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn,
dueled gamely from the rail the length of the stretch and just missed. DEVIL'S RULE tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
began a bid while saving ground nearing the three eighths pole, gained ground in upper stretch and dueled between horses to the wire, narrowly missing.
OFFLEE FUN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and
continued to gain ground to the wire. ABUELO NUNO chased the leader between horses in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn and
weakened between horses in the final furlong. RIVER FINN was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the two path and was outkicked from there. RENEGADE BOB brushed with the horses to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and made no bid. POWERFUL MAN pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAY OWL was asked for pace inside, attended inside of MUSIC CITY STAR in the opening furlong, settled back to track the pace inside around the turn
and into the lane, bid inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, sustained it in the final furlong, drove to the lead near fifty yards out and proved best.
RICHIES GREAT GIRL tracked the leading pair early, tracked the pace two wide on the turn outside of GRAY OWL, raced four wide into upper stretch and
began to improve, sustained her rally four wide in the final furlong, brushed with MOM'S RED LIPSTICK late, and missed. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK settled
near the rear inside, saved ground toward the rear on the turn, began to improve approaching the turn for home, was taken three wide approaching
midstretch, rallied under a drive, bulled through between MUSIC CITY STAR and RICHIES GREAT GIRL near the sixteenth, brushed with those foes late,
and missed three wide between horses. MUSIC CITY STAR broke sharply, was attended by GRAY OWL early, cleared to set the pace in the two path on
the turn, carried a diminishing lead in upper stretch, was engaged by GRAY OWL to her inside into the final furlong, was also engaged by RICHIE'S GREAT
GIRL past the furlong mark, was brushed near the sixteenth by MOM'S RED LIPSTICK as she made her way between nearing the furlong mark, dug in, but
was headed by GRAY OWL near fifty yards out and flattened late. PIECE OF MY HEART settled near the rear between horses early, raced in the three to
four path on the turn, came two wide into the lane, chased on under a drive but lacked the needed late kick. OH SO TERRIBLE settled at the rear, raced in
the three path on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive, and did not find the necessary rally. MS SASSY ATITUDE settled near the rear three wide
early, flattened out in the three path past the three eighths, dropped to the inside near the five sixteenths, and came up empty inside in the lane.

Footnotes
GIVIN UP NONE broke outward, tracked the leading pair early while racing outside of BEE HAPPY ATTACK, continued in range of the leading pair while
tracking them in the three to four path on the turn, raced into the lane three wide in range of the leaders, engaged outside of AGAVE KID in upper stretch,
headed that foe just past the furlong mark, and kept finding enough to keep him at bay to the wire. AGAVE KID was sent for speed inside, set the pace early
while pressured by STORMIN EL PRADO, dueled inside that foe while saving ground around the bend, turned back STORMIN EL PRADO in upper stretch,
was soon engaged by GIVIN UP NONE to his outside, was headed by that foe inside the furlong mark, kept on gamely but was unable to retake the lead.
BEE HAPPY ATTACK tracked the leading pair inside of GIVIN UP NONE early, chased the leading trio while saving ground around the turn, swung out four
wide into the lane, kept on under a drive, and rallied for the show. BORA BORA settled near the rear, continued near the rear in the two path on the turn,
was driven inside into the lane, rallied in upper stretch, kept on with late interest inside but was outfinished for the show. DEMAND RANSOM chased at the
rear of the main pack, was urged three deep in the four path on the turn, was driven near the rear in upper stretch, and passed tiring foes four wide.
RAHFEE TOWN chased inside foes early, continued between horses midfield three wide on the turn, raced into the lane between horses, and lacked the
needed rally while three wide between foes. STORMIN EL PRADO was sent for pace, hounded the pace outside of AGAVE KID down the backstretch,
dueled in the three path on the turn, proved no match for AGAVE KID un upper stretch and flattened out two wide. DAY IN THE COUNTRY leapt at the
start, settled at the rear, trailed in the two path on the turn, swung out to the center of the track in upper stretch, shifted in while driven down the lane but
ultimately lacked the needed rally. DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT ERROR FINISH MARGINS WERE PROVIDED BY EQUIBASE CHART CALLERS.
