KATS IN CHARGE took command inside, widened into the far turn, repelled a challenge and edged away again. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL pursued the winner,
was asked for run on the final turn, loomed a threat but raced an erratic course through the stretch. MONKEY ON MY BACK chased the pacesetters wide
early, moved closer to the inside and lacked a bid. MISS JASSER dropped back early and passed a fading rival. DORA JONES raced well behind inside
and weakened steadily. GRAND ENTRADA lagged far back while trailing throughout.

SAILOR'S SALUTE settled close up inside, took over into the far turn, drew away to a long lead and remained safe in the stretch. FARCICAL rated at back
of pack, steadied on the final turn, secured room and closed with a rush. HEY BABE broke slowly, rallied on the final turn then flattened out. HOME BY
SEVEN chased outside and lacked a solid response. LA SMARTY wax well placed outside the pacesetters, made a brief bid then faltered. ESTILO
ELEGANTE saved ground in midpack and lacked a rally. REAWAKENED prompted pace outside for half a mile and gave way. JORDIN'S SURPRISE
stumbled at the start, set the pace and stopped abruptly.

INEDATEQUILA forced the pace outside, took over when ready midway on the final turn and drew off while ridden out. RAG TOP broke a step slowly, rated
outside and finished gamely to get up for the place. NANA'S SHOES advanced strongly four wide on the final turn and finished willingly. CARMELTINI
settled close up inside and lacked a solid rally. SWEET BLAME broke alertly and led inside to midway on the final turn and faded. TINK lagged far behind,
moved wide and was no factor. CAR LADY saved ground and steadily retreated.

BORGOBYTHESEA moved clear to the stretch, was challenged from both sides in the stretch but held rivals safe gamely. LAW OF THE LAND saved
ground throughout, loomed a threat in the stretch but could not get by the winner. SAMUI SUNSET advanced wide into the far turn, rallied close then went
evenly late. LOVE LIFE moved extremely wide into the stretch closing the gap. ALONZO MOSELY prompted the winner in the two path and weakened
slightly. STILL THE ONE saved ground within range early and gave way. GEORGIA PINES dropped far behind and was always outrun. MY FREEDOM
forced the pace three wide for half a mile and stopped.

READY REWARD well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out into the stretch and outfinished rivals following a long drive. NICKY BEAR settled
inside, moved wide advancing in the stretch but could not get by the winner. DAMIR hustled to the front; lost the advantage then came again for the place.
DECLARED prompted the pace outside, led briefly into the lane but yielded. STRIKING IT LUCKY dropped back in the two path and closed a gap while no
threat. GALILEAN MOON lacked speed, was asked for run on the final turn but had no response. IMAGINETHEJOY dropped back early and was always
outrun. BULLDOG CONNECTION broke a step slowly and raced far behind throughout. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT lacked speed and was never in
