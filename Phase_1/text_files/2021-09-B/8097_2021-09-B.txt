Footnotes
QUEEN CHARMAINE was rated along three to four wide early, made a three wide bid on the turn, hit the front leaving the three sixteenths pole and then
slowly drew away in the final furlong to prove best under right handed pressure. NOT A ROLE MODEL set the early pace dropping over to the trail by the
half mile marker, then was headed leaving the quarter pole, proved to be no match for the winner in the final furlong while keeping on to be clearly second
best. RHAPSODY IN GREY was four wide into the first turn while being settled into stride, then moved up to tracked the pace four to five wide down the
backstretch, then was four wide by the quarter pole while fading on the turn, proved to be no match for the top two wide clearly besting the rest. ANNA'S
TRIBUTE stalked the early pace three wide and tired. SHOTGUN KATIE was settled early towards the inside and tired.

best. RUTABAGA chased the early pace and made a inside bid leaving the quarter pole but could not go with the winner in the final furlong while being
second best. GOODBYE GREELEY was away alertly and soon clear early to set the pace while racing in the three path, then was headed leaving the turn

best under a drive. STOP HAMMERTIME was settled early while four wide, made a five wide move on the turn to loom boldly leaving the quarter pole,
finished willingly but could not gain on the winner late while clearly second best, good effort. FLOWERPECKER dueled for the early lead and made a three
wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead by the quarter pole and faded in the drive, bested rest. SOUL STREIT dueled for the early lead two wide and then
moved to the rail on the turn and weakened. WHEREWEGOIN steadied after the start, then was settled back early and was four wide by the quarter pole
and offered no rally. ROCK N JUNE BUG pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened.

MR. BIFFLE was reserved early while saving ground, then started to unwind on the turn and moved out to make a four wide run, then continued that bid
leaving the turn and hit the front leaving the three sixteenths pole, then was given two right handed pops with the riding crop by the furlong marker and drew
off to prove much the best. CANDY CURL was rated along three to four wide early, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command by the quarter
pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while holding on to the place gamely. BOONE'S SPIRIT was well placed while two to three wide throughout,
then angled out by the furlong marker and finished willingly to just miss the place award. GO MANNY GO stalked the early pace three wide and made a two
wide bid to vie for command while dropping down to the inside by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. WILDCAT CROWN ducked in after the start,
then was sent up the inside to set the pace on the rail and then folded after five furlongs.

Footnotes
NOBODY LISTENS was soon clear to set the pace on the inside while clear, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. CAP DE
FUEGO stalked the pace three wide and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. G AS IN GEORGE chased the early pace three
wide and then came five wide into the drive but failed to gain while saving the show award. FLATOUTJUSTICE chased the early pace four wide and came
six wide into the drive and came up empty. EMPIRE'S SCORE lacked a rally while on the inside. FOREVER A CHAMP had no rally while three wide.
