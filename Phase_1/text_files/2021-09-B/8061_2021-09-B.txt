GAME TO PLAY sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was always in command. SHIPS JEWEL chased the pacesetter and stayed on in the stretch.
PALETTE settled well, advanced on the turn and managed a mild three wide rally in the stretch. CAMPFIRE TALES stalked the pace and weakened.
GIROLAMO LUCY was bumped at the start and did not factor. HER WAY OR NO WAY reared at the start and surrendered all chance. FOLLOWING THE
RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE START. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THEY MADE NO
CHANGES.

Footnotes
AQUATICA chased while four wide, remained four wide into the stretch, responded to pressure and was driven clear. DIANNA'S JET settled well, advanced
on the turn, moved three wide into the stretch and rallied. MAGIC IN A HAT forced the pace, lost her position on the turn, lacked room in the vicinity of the
eighth pole and kept on well. SEATTLE BAY raced forwardly while three wide and lacked a rally. SPILLED PERFUME ducked out at the start and showed
some mild late interest. JITTERS was outpaced while three wide and did not factor. WHAT NOW MY LOVE led early, was headed on the turn and yielded.
ANGEL ARKIE was always outrun.
