Footnotes
ABRAAJ MIRAGE tracked the pace of OVERLY FAST from the inside, waited for racing room in mid-stretch, found room inside the sixteenth pole and was
up in time. OVERLY FAST sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and just failed to last.
SILVER KING BAIN was off a step slow, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. ATTORNEY LOUIS chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and gradually weakened. FIRING PIN settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.
BARNABY BONES lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and dropped far back.

FLOAT ON broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. CODY'S CHOICE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position into the stretch
but failed to gain on the winner in the drive. PISTOL POWER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
COASTAL JAZZ was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a hafl. WINE AT NINE lacked
early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

MARCH ON LINCH pressed the pace while racing five-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, quickly opened a clear lead and
was ridden out through the lane to be kept to task. PAT'S GOLD lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the
drive but clearly second best. LT. BULLITT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. STANDING
ROCK settled off the leaders from the inside and failed to rally. R N' R ATTHE BEACH lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
BIG GALUTE broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

yards. ONE OCEAN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run, vied and was caught late.
LAFONDA broke sharply to duel for the lead with MISS BELLA from the inside, responded when challenged by ONE OCEAN with a furlong to run, vied with
that rival and gave way grudgingly late. WICKED WEAVE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn, veered out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and did not menace thereafter. MISS BELLA was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened
through the final furlong.

MISO FAST was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away from PROUDTOBEICILIAN in
the closing yards. PROUDTOBESICILIAN drifted in soon after the start, disputed the pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
seven-sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly to the winner through the final furlong. TUMAC MOUNTAIN raced unhurried early, saved ground through
the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN pressed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened.
ARDENLEE STAR steadied soon after the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. CHRIS THE BEAVER
showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane. THE RIDER OF ARDENLEE STAR LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
PROUDTOBESICILIAN CONCERING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT SOON AFTER THE START AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE
STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT PROUDTOBESICILIAN HAD CAUSED THE INFRACTIOIN BY DRIFING INWARD AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH.

TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY stalked the pace of FOREVER GOLD while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore that rival down in
the final yards to be clear late. BIG ENDEAVOR tracked the pace of FOREVER GOLD from the inside, angled out into the stretch, could not match strides
with the winner but was clearly second best. FOREVER GOLD sprinted clear at once, increased his advantage into the stretch and gave way through the
final furlong. VICENTE'S SHADOW was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to menace.
MUNCEY showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

PERFECT D dueled for the lead with DOUBLE PERFECTION while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and edged away late. DOUBLE
PERFECTION was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing from off the rail, vied with that foe and gave way through the closing
yards. CONTINUE ON VICTOR lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid.
OXBOW PARK settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch, drifted in with a furlong to run, angled back out
and finished evenly late. REDDISH showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths marker and was not a
factor. MR. ATLANTICO set a pressured pace from the inside, weakened after going three furlongs and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. ALPINE
HYPNOSIS lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and again nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good late
energy. PERFECT DUDE chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole, offered a bid nearing the quarter, vied with
IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN into mid-stretch and gave way. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by PERFECT DUDE
nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and gave way through the final furlong. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through
the turn and weakened in the drive. HARBOR OUTLAW was off a step slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. TEMPLE
SECRET showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
DISCREET DEMONS dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear advantage nearing the three-eighths pole, remained in control through
mid-stretch and held by a diminishing margin. SENOR FABULOSO lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was
gaining on the winner late. TAP THE BANK settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. JAZZ
STORY was forwardly placed from the inside, checked nearing the three-eighths marker, angled out approaching the stretch and did not threaten. GABBY
TOM was never far back while racing from between foes, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. ROARRALLYROAR was off a step
slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. MY NAME IS SUE disputed the pace from the inside
with the winner and weakened after going a half. COASTAL AFFAIR was fractious in the post parade, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and did not offer a bid.
