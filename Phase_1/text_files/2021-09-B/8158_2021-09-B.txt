Footnotes
PRESS BRIEFING stalked two wide around the first turn, stayed off the rail, moved closer but got shuffled back between the leader and riderless horse at
the seven-sixteenths pole, moved out four wide on the far turn then exited the bend three wide, bid inside the leader at the top of the stretch, took over at
the quarter pole, battled from inside through the final furlong and held gamely over the runner-up. VERY IRISH chased five wide through the first turn,
outside a pair of foes on the backstretch, angled six wide on the far turn, bid three deep in upper stretch, dueled with PRESS BRIEFING in deep stretch and
got outkicked. WHATSITTOYA sped clear and showed the way through the early stagers, got floated out by the riderless horse on the far turn, vied between
foes in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ACHILLEUS was off slow to begin, lagged far behind to the stretch and was never a factor. DAPPER
tracked off the inside then between rivals, came five wide into the stretch, drifted out and was a bit rank in the drive and tired. PALACE PRINCE stumbled
badly at the start and lost the rider, ran inside rivals up the backstretch and far turn and was caught by the outrider in the stretch, then walked off.

Footnotes
DESERT SWARM stalked the pace off the inside, bid outside at the five-sixteenths pole, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear to win going away.
TRUMPER took control early and angled down to the two path, held a short lead in the two path entering the stretch, lost command with a quarter mile
remaining and lasted for the place. AROUND THE DIAL settled off the inside, went three then four wide around the turn, kept to task through the drive and
missed the place. KENZOU'S RHYTHM trailed around the turn, entered the stretch three to four wide, moved out in the final sixteenth and showed a mild
response. ROYAL SEEKER was hard to load when being backed in from the front of the gate, raced at the back of the pack early on, had one rival beat and
chased four to five wide into the lane, was floated out a bit in the final sixteenth and made no impact. SWAMP'N AIN'T EZ got bumped from outside at the
start, went up to be forwardly placed from inside, saved ground around the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, came back to the inside and flattened
out. WINK AND A DREAM stumbled and bumped with inner rival at the start, raced in ranged to the turn, traveled two wide around the bend and weakened.

WHISKY MY GOD (ARG) broke in and bumped rival, dueled inside TWO BILLS into and around the turn from the two path, put that rivals away past the
three-sixteenths pole, met the bid from CAPTAIN N. BARRON in midstretch, turned that rivals away in the final furlong and held gamely over the late rally
from OLDER BROTHER in the final sixteenth. OLDER BROTHER tossed his head at the start to come away last, chased between foes then angled four to
five wide leaving the bend, rallied outside the winner but was not enough. CAPTAIN N. BARRON got bumped from outside at the start, chased along the
inside to the stretch, bid inside the winner in midstretch but faltered in the late stages. NO MORE FIREBALL was forwardly placed in the early stages,
dropped back into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and summoned a mild rally to earn a minor award. REEDLEY chased outside rivals then four wide
into the turn, exited the end five wide and flattened out. TIZ LOVE sat off the pace, went three wide around the turn, came out in upper stretch and was not
a factor. TWO BILLS dueled for command outside WHISKY MY GOD to the stretch, lost contact past the three-sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
GRIGORO went four wide around the first turn, five deep in the middle stages, traveled five then six wide on the second bend, rallied three deep late and
got up. MEDUSA'S GAZE chased off the rail early then went up to duel for command from outside, vied with rivals around the far turn and came three wide
into the stretch, clung to a narrow advantage with a sixteenth remaining and got nailed in the final strides. ARISTEIA went three wide around the first turn,
angled out and went up to raced four deep outside the leaders, challenged four deep on the far turn, battled down the stretch with MEDUSA'S GAZE then
finished gamely between rivals in the final sixteenth. BANDEENA got brushed shortly after the start, sped to the front from inside, dueled with rival up the
backstretch, vied with rivals on the far turn, lost contact approaching the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in furlong grounds. SEVEN POINTS broke in
and brushed rival at the start, stalked on the inside then moved off the rail, took the second turn two wide and lacked a necessary bid. CAN FLY bobbled
leaving the gate, forwardly placed off the rail then three deep on the backstretch, put in a mild bid around the far turn, could not keep up and chased four to
five wide into the stretch and faded. MONGOLIAN ROSE came away slow tossing her head a bit at the start, trailed two wide into the lane and was always
outrun.

SEE THROUGH IT stalked four wide into the turn, lacked room behind rivals around the bend, angled six wide nearing the stretch, took over past the
three-sixteenths pole and won going away. JOE DON LOONEY brushed from outside at the start, vied for the lead between rivals, took a short lead around
the turn, moved clear in upper stretch, was overtaken past the three-sixteenths pole and stayed on to secure the place. SINGLE ME OUT dropped back
early, went three then four wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and summoned a mild rally for the show. TETON VALLEY broke in and brushed rival
leaving the gate, went up to vie three deep for the lead, could not keep pace around the turn, entered the stretch four wide and churned on for a minor
award. REDACTION dropped back early, raced along the fence shifted to the two path around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position.
TOO LATE vied for command inside a trio of rivals, dueled around the turn, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened. THIEF IN THE NIGHT vied four
deep to the turn, chased the top duo five wide into the lane and faded. BAM BAM AGAIN brushed the gate in the beginning, traveled in mid-pack early on,
went five then six wide around the turn and made no impact. SO CAL MEMORY was off a bit slow to begin, angled to the inside, exited the bend two wide
and was never a factor.
