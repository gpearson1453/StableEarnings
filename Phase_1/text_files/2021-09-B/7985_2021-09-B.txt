behind the gate while saddle adjustment was being done, chased the leader while inside, made a bid but was no match in the end. PICKLE SNAPPER
raced two wide on the turn making a bid but was no menace in late stretch. MR OKLAHOMA CITY was unhurried early then made a mild rally and was no
menace. CRAPS SHOOTER showed brief speed then gave way. MY REAL DIAMOND pressed the pace while two wide on the turn then stopped in late
stretch. DEVIN showed very brief foot and stopped.
