SWITHER'S SHORTCUT never far back loomed four wide into upper stretch engaging abreast foe surging clear late. FREEDONIA pressured the pace
dueling on the inside to upper stretch digging in with a clear lead angling out to meet rival late ceding grudgingly. TAURUS C crowded foe early lagging
through the turn, lost ground to upper stretch giving a mild rally six wide to improve late. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE a step slow through the turn raced five
wide down the lane finishing evenly. HALFBACK chased the pace through the turn weakening in upper stretch. SOUL OF DISCRETION pressured the pace
dueling through the turn wearing out down the lane. TICKER TAPE PARADE played no factor. HARD ASTRAY was crowded bobbling early, rushed to
contention would give way on the turn.
