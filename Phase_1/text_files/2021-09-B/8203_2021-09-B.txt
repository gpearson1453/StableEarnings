Footnotes
STELLA MARS settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly to get
up late. PATH LESS TAKEN settled comfortably off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, swung four wide
into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong, closed well to make a bid late but just missed while narrowly up for the place. CANDY MONET showed good
speed, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole,
shook clear under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, remained clear into the final sixteenth then switched to a left-handed crop and was caught
while clear for the show. ROXEN broke out at the start, settled near the middle of the field, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch,
moved further out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and improved position. NEW YORK DANCER was taken up early, settled towards the rear, went four
wide on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and also improved position. IDAKA disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the
turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. MILL STONE CREEK
was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, chased while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, pursued the leaders into upper
stretch and came up empty. BERTINGA was reserved on the outside, tucked into the two path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to
rally. ESCAPEWITHFRIENDS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
was no factor. NEW YORK SUPREME quickly became very rank under stout restraint, checked repeatedly under a vigorous hold all the way into the turn,
leveled some in the two path around the bend, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SPEIGHTSKA broke a bit slow, was reserved near
the back, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. LITTLE MS SCARLET dropped back towards the inside, lost more position around the half-mile
pole, saved ground on the turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
HAPPY MEDIUM dueled early on three then two wide with IMMORTALIZATION to his inside, shook off that rival in the two path through the turn, got roused
continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive getting geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish. CASTLE CHAOS
hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors. NO BURN broke out at the start, chased six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the winner while keeping on clear for the show honors. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved
position. IMMORTALIZATION dueled inside of HAPPY MEDIUM down the backstretch in the two path, tucked inside through the turn getting shaken off and
gave chase coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MACH ONE broke out at the start bumping
MOTION TO STRIKE while under coaxing, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. KINGDOM WARRIOR five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at three furlongs from home, went five wide into
upper stretch and tired. MOTION TO STRIKE bumped at the start while under hustling, raced briefly inside before tipping out to chase two to three wide
down the backstretch and through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went three wide for home and faltered.

EQUAL MEASURE broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on
the outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. LIDO KEY settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide
into the stretch, rallied on the inside of the winner, closed well to get the lead three jumps before the wire but was denied while just able to get the place.
CANDY FLOWER broke through the gate while fractious in the stall prior to the start, was backed out then reloaded after deemed fit to run by the state
veterinarian, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was set down in upper stretch, led
until the final three strides and was caught while just able to get the show. LAGOM settled in fourth position, was asked while three wide on the turn, gained
to make a bid in upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong but just missed the show. BLUE ATLAS had her gate pop open when the inside neighbor
became fractious, was taken up while off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the back, raced under some restraint while tucked into the two
path on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, passed the three-sixteenths under coaxing, came between horses into the final furlong,
lacked room behind a wall of horses into the final sixteenth, altered course severely to the far outside late and was gaining but lost her best chance. BEE
BIT was well placed while rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, raced behind horses under
intermittent urging into the final furlong, was stymied while blocked in the final sixteenth and lost her best chance. FLASHING RED settled on the inside,
saved ground through the far turn, moved out around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. FOXTAIL went to the front, showed the way on
the inside, was headed under urging at the quarter-pole and gave way. MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
VARATTI pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two path on the turn, took the advantage just inside the
five-sixteenths, fought with TRIPLE ELVIS into the final furlong, disposed of that foe outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away under steady urging. TRIPLE
ELVIS was well placed just off the pace, chased a bit off the rail early on the turn, shifted three wide while gaining at the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside
the quarter-pole, reached even terms for the lead in upper stretch, battled outside the winner until inside the furlong marker then proved no match while able
to get the place. MO DONEGAL broke a step slow, was urged along while dropping well off the pace, steadied briefly near the half-mile pole, moved from
the rail to the two path before the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into upper stretch, drifted out some in the final furlong and finished with late energy to
secure the show. GREEN JACKET broke a step slow, showed no speed while ridden along, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper
stretch and gained late but failed to threaten. PRINTRACK went to the front, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost
the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. JURKOVEC was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two
path and failed to respond. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN settled off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
GLASS CEILING chased along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, then drew clear to the finish kept busy to the end. STARFRONT chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path in
closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head with BEFORE YOU when overhauled by the top one a
furlong out, proved no match for that rival while running on to be along clear for the place honors. BEFORE YOU broke in at the start bumping FIRING
CAROL in tandem with RUVIES IN TIME, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught a furlong out, then weakened to the finish while along clear for the show honors. FIRING CAROL got
bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and had the left side iron break inside the eighth pole and opted out of the right side iron improving position to the finish for the
last major share. MORE MOONSHINE chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths
to go, swung four to five wide for home and tired. RUVIES IN TIME broke out at the start bumping FIRING CAROL in tandem with BEFORE YOU, chased
three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. SPA READY chased four to five wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
BALLYDOOLEY (GB) showed good speed on the outside, set the pace under a snug hold, moved clear inside the half-mile pole, controlled the action while
inside on the turn, responded well when set down in the two path into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker and held under
steady urging. COLTON'S COMMAND broke a step slow then dropped back while crowded between horses, settled near the rear, went four wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished fast but was too late while able to get the place. SCOCCIATORE was
taken in hand early then rated off the pace, went three wide while let out on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive in the
stretch and was out-kicked but earned the show. CHRISTOPHER settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole,
moved out while roused in upper stretch and finished willingly to narrowly get the last spot in the superfecta. DIGITAL FUTURE settled comfortably on the
outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SHIRAZ showed speed on the inside of a foe
while in hand, was wrestled back off the pace with a half-mile to run then switched out, came under urging in the two path on the turn, chased into upper
stretch and had nothing left. PERFECT MUNNINGS was hustled from the start then urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into
the stretch and was no factor. REJECTED AGAIN bobbled shortly after the start, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up
empty.

wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to issue a challenge through the final eighth taking
command just inside the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the finish to prevail. ALPHA BABE stumbled at the start recovering outwards bumping
ENTWINE into the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun three wide for home
taking over command straightened away, dug in under threat getting collared just inside the sixteenth marker, then fought on willingly to preserve the place
honors over a pair on the wire. PRINCESS PINKY bumped at the start by FREDDYMO FACTOR, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide until
tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to the finish and
just missed for the place honors. ENTWINE (IRE) got bumped at the start by ALPHA BABE and in turn bumped AMORTIZATION, chased four then three

for the place and show honors. ADRIATIC ROSE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the finish. FREDDYMO FACTOR broke out at the start striking the off side stall before bumping PRINCESS PINKY, chased three to

the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. APURATE bumped at the start by CONSTITUTIONALRAGE, raced just off the inside in closest aim of that rival, came under coaxing taking over
command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the front straightened away, then tired to the finish. LUCKY SITKA three paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch
and made no impact. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE broke out at the start bumping APURATE, established the front into the backstretch and showed the way in
hand along the inside, came under pressure midway on the turn and got placed to coaxing when headed for the front with five-sixteenths remaining, took the
