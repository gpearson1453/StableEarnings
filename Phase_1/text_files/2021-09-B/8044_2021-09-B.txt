Footnotes
MISS RENO stumbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly to take control, pressured from outside early then moved clear on the backstretch, challenged
again from both sides on the far turn, dueled with SET THE TONE down the stretch, drifted out a bit then drifted inward in the late stages and prevailed.
SET THE TONE stalked the pace from inside, bid inside a pair of rivals on the far turn, battled MISS RENO through the stretch run and stayed on gamely to
the wire. BRIMAGE went four then three wide around the first turn, pressed the pace from outside then chased up the backstretch, put in a mild bid three
deep past the three-eighths pole, could not match strides with the top pair, drifted out in upper stretch, then flattened but was able to hold the show.
ASSUNTA broke out, took the first turn five then four wide, remained off the rail to the far turn, came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. SIP SIP
HOORAY broke out, traveled five wide into the clubhouse turn then moved down to the three path, angled inside a runner on the backstretch, steered to the
inside for the far turn, exited that bend two wide and had little left.

Footnotes
FINGLAS LAD away quickly in the beginning, showed the way up the backstretch, turned away MEDINA MAN when tested on the turn, then drew off under
right-handed urging and steady handling late. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT was off slow and forced in leaving the gate, traveled three wide into the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, rallied and bested the rest. MEDINA MAN broke well alongside FINGLAS LAD, chased that rival to the turn, put in a mild bid from
outside around the bend but could not keep up with the winner past the three-eighths pole, exited the turn three to four wide and flattened to third. LA'OCH
ALOYSIUS came in at the start, raced up close on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. CHASING
ALCHEMY tracked three wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and never made an impact. CORTEZANO shifted in at the start, raced off the rail in
range early, navigated the turn two then three wide, drifted slowly to the inside in the stretch and could not rally.

HALF RIGHT dueled for the lead outside HONOR AMONG MEN, battled around the turn and down the stretch, dug in the final sixteenth and bested the
runner-up. HONOR AMONG MEN stumbled at the start, went up to duel from inside, held a short lead while continuing to battle with HALF RIGHT down the
stretch and got outgamed in the final sixteenth. SQUALOTORO settled off the pace, was guided off the inside and went four wide through the bend, tipped
out in upper stretch, drifted in through the late stages and closed willingly for the show honors. CHASING FAME came away a bit slow, trailed early on, took
the turn two wide and improved position. SABUDA stumbled leaving the gate, went five wide into the turn, moved in a path around the bend and came up
empty. RAYRAY coaxed from the gate to be forwardly placed outside the top pair, chased three wide into the turn, angled to the fence around the bend and
weakened. PALALEO threw his head at the start to come away slow, went up to track outside a rival, took the turn four then three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
MANHATTAN UP steadied off heels while between rivals on the first turn, continued to between foes while stalking the pace, took aim four wide into the
drive, bid alongside the leader at the three-sixteenths pole, battled through the final furlong and drove clear late. SASH (GB) set the pace off the inside,
inched away up the backstretch, remained off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, met the challenge from MANHATTAN UP with three-sixteenths
remaining, clung to a short lead with an eight of a mile to go and yielded grudingly. BOLD ENDEAVOR stalked near the inside then moved two the two path,
angled back to the inside and saved ground around the far turn, came out a bit entering the stretch and lacked the needed late punch. MAGIC ON TAP went
four wide around the first turn, chased three deep then exited the far turn four to five wide and failed to produce a bid. LEADING SCORE took the first turn
three wide, saved ground while trailing around the far turn and failed to menace. BORDER TOWN traveled five wide around the first turn, came four wide
into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
PHANTOM DANCE got bumped leaving the gate, went five then four wide around the first turn, chased outside a rival off the pace, between rivals midway
around the second bend, came four wide into the drive, took over with three-sixteenths remaining and inched away. C FALLS broke out and bumped rival at
the start, established a clear lead, showed the way three wide into the lane, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and stayed on well inside the winner
for the place. RONAMO got bumped at the start, traveled four then three wide on the first turn, raced outside a rival into the second bend, navigated that
turn two wide, chased within striking distance in the final furlong but could not find more in deep stretch. ROOKIE YEAR broke out and bumped rival at the
start, chased off the rail, four then five wide on the far turn and weakened. CLUB CAL went five wide around the clubhouse turn, remained well off the rail up
the backstretch, moved out further on the second bend, entered the lane eighth wide and made no impact. NEXT REVOLT got bumped from inside at the
start, angled to the inside prior to the first turn, stalked along the inside to the stretch, tired in the lane and was eased in the final furlong and walked off.
GOV FROM ABOVE broke out and bumped rival, got floated out into the first turn, exited the far turn seven wide and faded.
