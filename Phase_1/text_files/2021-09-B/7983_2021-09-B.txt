Footnotes
RUNAWAY MONET bumped with FORTES leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace racing along the inner rail, eased out to the two path leaving the far
turn, swept to command approaching the eighth pole and pulled away while under encouragement. MY MAGGIE MOO , three wide entering the first turn,
dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch, was three wide turning for home and passed a tired foe. SUGAR SNAP , three wide entering the first turn, was
taken to the inner rail after opening a clear lead mid way down the backstretch, remained on the lead in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. UNION
TATTERS lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home and passed a pair of tired rivals. FORTES bumped with the winner leaving the starting
gate, raced along the inner rail on the far turn and retreated through the stretch. LIKE NOWHERE ELSE (IRE) , four deep entering the first turn, faltered on
the far turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CAN cleared early, set a rated pace towards the rail, edged away after being roused near the three sixteenths then held firm while under a steady
drive through the final sixteenth. BEHIND THE COUCH rated between rivals, eased out three to four wide entering the lane and closed willingly.
CHROMEPLATED HEART prompted the pace two wide, was under pressure about three wide in upper stretch and kept on well to cut back into the margin.
POLISHED GAL steadied while saving ground leaving the far turn, swung five to six wide for the drive, moved up past the furlong grounds then flattened
out. FAST CHICA broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, shifted well wide for the final three sixteenths and had belated action. NOT MY MONEY ,
lightly shuffled in the opening furlong, chased two wide outside a rival mid turn, shifted in some and came up empty. HOPE HAS A NAME , four wide outside
rivals, raced in range to upper stretch then faded. PRETTY LORI was steadied into the turn and failed to make a serious recovery. MISS MARLEY , off the
pace two to three wide, lacked a response. CATCHING THE WIND saved ground chasing to the inside of rivals mid turn, lacked a kick in upper stretch then
gave way.

NEW FRONTIER sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted off the rail in upper stretch and prevailed under brisk urging. KINGSTON
PIKE hugged the inner rail throughout and rallied nicely. BAHAMA CHANNEL , bumped leaving the starting gate, circled foes three wide on the turn and
offered a slight rally. ON THE LAM bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while two wide on the turn and weakened. HONORABLE SERVICE
lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and was under some hand urging. PHANTOM RO , a forward
factor in the two path on the turn, faltered approaching the stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
FED UP FIRED UP dropped in early and settled nicely, took closer while saving ground past the five sixteenths, eased out three wide into the lane, brushed
with POSTERITY when working further out past the three sixteenths, advanced between runners under left handed rousing to gain a slim lead past the
sixteenth pole then dug in gamely to narrowly prevail. MINISTER'S STRIKE settled in the clear while saving ground, swung six wide with momentum into the
lane, straightened away to make a bold run outside rivals, drew alongside the winner in deep stretch but just could not get past. POSTERITY broke slowly,
was taken four wide for the backstretch, moved up past the five sixteenths, exchanged a brush with the winner, failed to match strides with that one but
churned on willingly to the line. SPEED GAME prompted the pace two wide, moved to attack near the three eighths, pressed into the lane, battled on near
even terms leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. CRAZY KATER rated outside early on, edged up three wide nearing the half mile marker, spun
four wide with aim into the lane, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds then flattened out. ARGENTIC (FR) rated inside, moved up between foes after a
half mile, dropped back in around the final turn, was bottled up with run in mid stretch, angled out then steadied in traffic near the sixteenth pole.
GUNSLINGER (IRE) cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure from the far turn, battled past mid stretch then weakened late.
MAKES MO CENTS was taken three wide for the backstretch run, prompted the pace into the far turn, gave pursuit between rivals in upper stretch, failed to
seriously kick on and angled out late. LUCKY RAMSEY saved ground advancing in hand to the half mile marker, awaited room past the quarter pole, eased
out, had a seam close in mid stretch then was taken up sharply near the sixteenth pole. LUDICROUS MODE bobbled at the break and was outrun.

Footnotes
LOUELLA STREET broke sharply and dropped in to set a rated pace, dug in when confronted by AMAZON QUEEN leaving the far turn, dueled in the two
path into the lane, kicked back clear under solid handling near the sixteenth pole then held firm. AMAZON QUEEN prompted in hand outside the winner, bid
to engage near the three eighths, dueled three wide into the lane, kept up the fight past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. LADY PROWESS tracked
inside, saw the leaders get away a bit past the five sixteenths, was under pressure into the lane and came back wllingly. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER lost ground
four wide, edged up nearing the half mile marker, was under a hearty ride pursuing past the five sixteenths and churned on. CECILITA broke slowly, lagged
back through the opening five furlongs, was under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths, swung wide and offered a late bid. TIME GOES FAST settled in
the clear near the half mile marker, shifted out around the final turn, came four wide for the drive and had belated interest between foes. LITTLE BIT OF
THAT rated outside a rival, angled out leaving the three eighths, moved up a bit into the lane then came up empty. WASSER saved ground and failed to
menace. PETITE ROUGE pulled her way forward past the three quarter pole, rated off foes past the five eighths, shifted in and faded. TEN TWENTY ONE ,
three wide stalking the pace, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and gave way between rivals.

Footnotes
NATTY BEAU sprinted to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, was pressed around the turn, lost the lead in mid stretch then
battled back late. DECORATED prompted the pace outside the winner, gained a short lead in mid stretch and just missed in a game effort. GOLAZO saved
ground around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and had a mild rally inside rivals. MORE TWIRL , under urging early, hugged the inner rail
chasing the pace and finished willingly. GATOR FIFTY TWO , forwardly placed early, raced in the two path on the turn and lacked a rally. SING A VERSE ,
along the inner rail around the turn, failed to menace. KEEPYOURGUARDUP , four wide on the turn, was not a factor. DYNAMIC DAY , no factor, was four
wide leaving the turn. EL ROJO was outrun. SAM AND SY was unhurried and kept wide. NEW YORK ONE , three wide on the turn, weakened. GOLDEN G
chased the pace while three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
BELTWAY BOB , unhurried early while saving ground, eased out near the quarter pole, swung five wide soon after, leveled off under left handed asking
past the three sixteenths, kept on determinedly and got up at the wire. DEPOSITORY prompted the pace outside BROKER'S REWARD, dueled past mid
stretch, gained a slim lead between foes in deep stretch, kept on gamely but nabbed at the line. BENNY HAVENS relaxed three wide outside rivals, took
closer order into the far turn, ranged up into the stretch, bid to engage the leaders in mid stretch, dueled and hung late. BROKER'S REWARD took over at
once, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled pressure leaving the far turn, was under coaxing as the pace quickened leaving the five sixteenths,
dueled past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. ANTIPOISON broke a step slow, regrouped and moved up three wide into the first turn, stalked between
rivals leaving the half mile marker, chased with aim into the lane but needed a bit more in the final sixteenth. MONSTER MASON rated within range while
saving some ground, came under a ride while in the clear past the five sixteenths, angled out but came up empty. MY BOY PADDY , taken to rate while
saving ground, moved up a bit past the five eighths, was steadied off heels leaving the far turn, stayed inside and was under a solid ride past the five
sixteenths then faded. ELEMENTARY broke slowly, raced three wide outside rivals past the half mile marker but lacked a rally. BEACH TRAFFIC failed to
menace. MARKET MOVER , rank between rivals around the first turn, dropped in and stalked through the backstretch, failed to go on nearing the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
DEFY EXPECTATIONS , taken to rate, angled out early turn, moved up three wide nearing the stretch, responded to right handed rousing and struck the
top in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and was fully extended to prevail. CASTILLEJA broke a step slow, rushed up to the inside of rivals and gained a
stalking spot into the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good energy between rivals. MINNETONKA was sent clear early, set the pace
towards the inside, was collared nearing mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. CRYSTALOLOGY prompted the pace two wide, loomed into the stretch but
came up empty. OUR STRONG VOWS rated off the rail, advanced three to four wide into the lane but failed to seriously sustain. TAPDANCING GIRL rated
between early, raced two wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. ORDINARY GIRL had speed to the inside of a rival then rate back, saved ground stalking
mid turn, was under asking into the lane and faded. FLAVA'S DREAM , off the pace three wide, swung wider in the drive but failed to pose a threat.
