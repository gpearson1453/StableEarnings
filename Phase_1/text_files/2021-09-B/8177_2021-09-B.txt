Footnotes
TIA FLOR ready to pounce while wide to quarter pole, took over into the stretch, fought gamely while all out and lasted. A LITTLE FLYER pinched back
start, fanned widest into the stretch while lugging in thru the drive to just miss while probably best today. SAMOA outside trip throughout ran on for the show
spot. PASSION'S IMAGE inside speed to the front, clear to turn, headed past the quarter pole and faded. QUEEN OF CORONA steadily faded while never
a factor. ARCHIE'S GIRL was through early and dropped back quickly.

throughout, kept on for show spot. EIDA'S STORM inside speed to the front, led to the stretch, gave way. POST CODE ENVY close up to far turn, steadied
inside out of the turn, gave in. C V THUNDER up close to the half with a steady fade thereafter.

Footnotes
OUT OF THE MIST had an awkward start while being forced out, regrouped and rushed between horses to contention, took over at the half and ran on to
go clear in a gallant effortunder good handling. HONKY TONK MUSIC close up to the turn, ran on for place while no match for the winner. R HOUDINI no
speed to the stretch, kept on in the stretch run for the show spot. MY TICKET was close up early, shuffled back turn, re-rallied and pinched in tight mid
stretch, tried hard with a good effort. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY bore out into rival at the start, well placed thereafter, came widest into stretch with no gain in
the final furlong. DUNROAD pressed pace while saving ground entire way, faded in the stretch and subsequently vanned off after the finish. BELTON AVE
had a terrible start and never reached contention. SUGAR MAC showed early inside speed to the turn but stopped badly. MOX NIX was pulled up into the
turn and subsequently vanned off.
