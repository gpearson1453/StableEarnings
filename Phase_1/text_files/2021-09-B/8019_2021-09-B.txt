Footnotes
JUST SO YA KNOW stalked the pace three wide, edged closer while sticking on the left lead in the lane, switched over nearing the sixteenth pole, struck
the front soon after and edged ahead under a drive. EYE OF THE TEMPLE vied between foes early, angled to the rail near the half-mile, set the pace along
the rail from there, led to the sixteenth pole and settled for second best. ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE pressed the pace between the top two finishers and
weakened in the lane. PRINCIPE raced off the early pace, moved up five wide around the turn and lacked a rally. FROSTY WARRIOR saved ground off the
pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. EL ROSILLO had early speed inside and retreated around the turn.
DRINKSONTHEBEACH chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. TAKEMYSHOT hopped at the start and was outrun while racing two wide.

DAHLONEGA pressed the early pace three wide in a tight pack, bid for command around turn, dueled outside DISTINCTLY BLUE through the stretch and
forged clear late. DISTINCTLY BLUE brushed with INCLUDE THE BEAST at the start, slipped through on the rail to join the leaders past the five-sixteenths,
battled inside DAHLONEGA to deep stretch before yielding, and saved the place. INCLUDE THE BEAST brushed with DISTINCTLY BLUE at the start,
shifted out to the four-path coming off the turn, advanced mildly through upper stretch, then finished up evenly. RAIN was four wide into the turn, fanned to
the six-path at the top of the lane, and posed no threat on the far outside. SALSA RITA raced between horses into the turn, moved out five wide into the
stretch and made no headway. FIERY PRINCESS advanced four wide to reach a short lead after three-eighths of a mile, but gave way in upper stretch. MS
BIG SPRING set the early pace in the two-path, came under attack from both sides on the turn, and retreated.

the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY vied two wide, briefly cleared nearing the quarter pole but was unable to match
strides with the winner through the final furlong. POSEIDON'S SON stalked the pace three wide, had the rider lose the whip leaving the quarter pole and
was no match for the top two in the lane. SUN VIKING chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a closing bid. CAPTAIN SENSIBLE broke a bit
awkwardly and was outrun inside. GONE NUTS dueled inside for a half, stopped nearing the quarter pole and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
FOLK HERO dueled early outside LA CUMPARSITA, got the best of that dispute on the turn, got hooked from outside by AWESOME APEAL after three
furlongs, dug in through a long drive on her left lead, and held firm for the decision. AWESOME APEAL tracked the dueling leaders three wide into the turn,
ranged up outside FOLK HERO to reach even terms a quarter-mile out, battled through the stretch and was outgamed while clearly second best. CURRENT
CAUSE was reluctant to load, eventually doing so without the rider, broke two lengths slow, was outsprinted to the stretch two to three wide, and was along
for the show. SHE IS ROYALTY became edgy in the gate prior to the start, broke two lengths slow, and was no factor inside. MISS BETH'EL broke two
lengths slow, and was always outrun. LA CUMPARSITA vied early inside FOLK HERO, and was finished after three furlongs.

Footnotes
ELDON'S PRINCE settled off the early pace outside, advanced three and four wide around the turn, bid outside of NO NAY FRANKLIN nearing the eighth
pole, dueled outside of that foe under confident handling and prevailed. NO NAY FRANKLIN (IRE) stalked the pace in the clear inside, angled four wide
near the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch, battled on gamely inside of the winner but was narrowly outfinished. GOLDEN JUAN dueled inside for a
half, drifted out nearing the lane, weakened but held well clear of the rest. CREDIBILITY chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. GILLIGAN was in a
bit tight early, saved ground off the pace, was bumped near the three-eighths pole, stayed inside throughout and never threatened. NIGHT JUMPER dueled
two wide to upper stretch, angled outside and was cautiously ridden through the lane. T VILLE was outrun while racing four wide. ETERNAL REST had
some early speed, raced two wide around the turn, bumped GILLIGAN near the three-eighths pole and retreated.

Footnotes
KHOCU dueled outside of GUNMAN for a half, put that foe away to briefly go clear leaving the three-eighths pole, was soon confronted by BRETT'S
WORLD who ranged up outside to put a head in front in upper stretch, battled on inside of that foe and edged away late. BRETT'S WORLD stalked the duel
three wide in the clear, moved to a short lead outside of the winner in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole but was outfinished. OUR STUIE hit the starting
gate to get away last, saved ground off the early pace, angled four wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, loomed outside of the top two in upper stretch but
flattened out. KLEON saved ground off the pace, swung widest in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. GUNMAN dueled inside of the winner for a half and
retreated. BIG CITY RED played no factor while racing four wide.

GUACO broke slowest and settled in the second flight for a half-mile, fanned five wide between horses as the field spread across the track into the stretch,
finished determinedly and edged away. MONY bumped with UNION GAP at the start, raced behind horses awaiting an opening past the quarter-pole in the
two-path, found room and bid between horses through the furlong grounds, and was edged out to the finish inside the winner. STARSHIP TAXI advanced
approaching the quarter-pole three then four wide, loomed a threat between horses into the lane but was outfinished. CAPTURED BY FATE contested the
pace outside rivals for a half-mile, and faded through the late stages. SEA TRIDENT battled up front between horses to the stretch, and faded through the
last eighth of a mile. UNION GAP bumped with MONY at the start, trailed inside to the stretch, moved out and made no headway. POSEIDEN was
outsprinted early, fanned six wide coming off the turn, and tired. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL dueled for command inside to the stretch, and tired.

Footnotes
PAPETU was reserved early in striking range, advanced readily four wide around the turn, reached the front outside POPPY'S PRIDE once straightened
away for the drive, and moved away under pressure. FLAMINGO HAWK prompted the early pace outside, lost position around the turn despite coming
under a busy ride, shifted out four wide to the top of the stretch, and rallied with good courage while no threat to the winner. POPPY'S PRIDE set the pace
inside to the top of the stretch, and weakened. MY MANE MAN steadied between EMPEROR'S CAUSE and LAUDA SPEED a couple jumps away from the
gate, moved up outside horses through the backstretch run, bid for command three wide midway on the turn, but could not sustain the rally and faded into
the lane. RABDAN saved ground outsprinted early, moved out four wide leaving the turn, and could not make his presence felt. EMPEROR'S CAUSE broke
slowly and never became involved. LAUDA SPEED was forwardly placed early, but faded inside after a half-mile.

Footnotes
DIVERT settled off early pace outside, was in range two wide around the most of the turn, split rivals three wide near the quarter pole, seized command in
upper stretch and drew off under a drive. SHANGHAI RONNIE disputed the pace outside of HIERRO, could not match strides with the winner in upper
stretch but battled on to win the place duel. HIERRO dueled inside of SHANGHAI RONNIE, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, continued
the battle inside through the land and just missed second. KIGER saved ground and failed to menace. UNCLE PIP played no factor while racing four wide.
GREYZER never threatened while racing three wide. MIAMI CHROME stalked the pace three wide, drifted wider nearing the lane and retreated.
KHOZANDO hit the starting gate, raced two wide and was outrun.

LUVMESUMCAJUN for six furlongs, bid between that one and STAR DEPUTY through the furlong grounds, and proved clearly second best.
TUTANKHAMUNATCHA was outrun for six furlongs, rallied into upper stretch while lugging in a bit, moved out past the eighth-pole and finished willingly.
LUVNMESUMCAJUN broke slowly, rushed up in the run out of the chute to get the lead, moved away through the middle fractions, then gave way in upper
stretch. JOYFUL SURPRISE broke a bit slowly, and was no factor inside. WILLIAM BOY vied early outside LUVMESUMCAJUN, and was finished before
going a half-mile.
