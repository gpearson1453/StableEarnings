Footnotes
FULL OF LUCK (CHI) pressed the pace from outside, went up to duel around the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, put away UNTHROTTLED in upper
stretch then held well over the closing kick from THE BLACK ALBUM in the final furlong. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) went four wide around the first turn,
stalked widest through the middle stages, navigated the second bend five wide, closed willingly in the final furlong to gain ground on the winner but needed
more late. ENGRAM stalked off the rail then moved inside on the backstretch, came two wide into the drive, moved back to the rail in the stretch and got up
for the show. UNTHROTTLED set the pace under pressure from FULL OF LUCK, dueled inside that rival through the second bend, lost command with a
quarter of a mile remaining, flattened in the furlong grounds and got edged for the show.

Footnotes
BORKAN sprinted clear quickly then crossed over to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch and two wide into the far turn, eased out around the
bend and entered the lane four wide and drew away. MONGOL ALTAI got bumped into the first turn, came four wide into the drive, showed late interest
through the lane but had to settle for second best. ROADSIDE bumped with inner rival in the beginning then bumped with outer rival entering the first turn,
raced off the pace early on, went three to four wide through the final turn, steered inside entering the stretch and flattened to third. EIGHT MAKAR bumped
outside rival at the start, settled at the back early on, angled out on the far turn and exited that bend five wide, drifted in then back out in the lane and never
threatened. GONE AWOL went five deep into the first turn then angled to the four path around the bend, angled to the inside at the half-mile pole, chased
two wide into the drive and weakened. SIR WILLIAMS DREAM got bumped and crowded between runners into the first turn, stayed off the rail and came

and inched away. LEN'S LUCK hesitated and came away slow then got bumped by LOOKOUT POINT, trailed in the early stages, moved closer up the

between horses into the first turn, took control and set the pace outside GEMINI BAY, held a short lead through the second bend, lost command entering

STAY HAPPY brushed with rival at the start, settled well off the rail, took the turn five to six wide, rallied outside the top pair with an eighth of a mile
remaining and drew clear. CAPTURE THE SEA vied between rivals into and around the bend, fought back from inside to the eighth pole, could not kick on
with the winner but stayed on to secure second. RINSE AND REPEAT brushed with the winner at the start, angled down to the three path, moved to the two
path around the bend, steered to the inside in the stretch and put in a mild late bid. STUDLY PERFECTION chased from outside early then bid four deep
into the turn, gained the lead three deep at the three-eighths pole, held a short lead over CAPTURE THE SEA in the drive, lost command at the eighth pole
and weakened late. AWHITESPORTSCOAT chased on the inside to the turn, came out and entered the stretch five wide and lacked a late bid. PRINCE ALI
was a bit fractious in the gate, broke slow to begin, sent for the lead between runners, vied inside around the turn and weakened in the lane. ESKIMO
ROSES vied for command three deep, could not match strides around the bend and chased four wide into the lane and also weakened.

BACK RING LUCK sped clear to take control from inside, challenged by GOLDENEYED into the far turn, dueled with that rival to the drive, cleared in upper
stretch and drew off. MR. PICKLES took a stalking position early, ran up on heels and steadied at the nine-sixteenths pole, angled four wide around the far
turn, ran evenly through the lane and finished a clear second. GOLDENEYED rated outside the leader early on, drew alongside into the far turn, dueled to
the stretch, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and saved the show. LAUNCH PAD broke out, raced in range at
the back well off the rail, entered the stretch five wide and failed to threaten.

four wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch run and flattened to a minor award. CURLING SECRET vied for command between rivals to the turn,

rival, navigated the turn five wide and could not rally. TRAPALIS raced outside a rival at the back of the pack, entered the stretch three wide, moved out in
the lane and was not a factor. LAKER BARRY saved ground around the turn and made no impact. DADSTAR vied for the lead from inside early, checked
entering the turn, dropped back around the bend and weakened.

RISK AND REWARD sped to the front in the two path, challenged briefly from inside midway up the backstretch, moved clear again approaching the
half-mile pole, inched away around the far turn and padded the lead in the stretch. MARGOT'S BOY stalked the pace from inside, put in a mild bid
approaching the nine-sixteenths pole but lost contact shortly after, angled four wide around the far turn and chased the winner to the wire for a clear second.
WILLY THE COBBLER traveled six wide around the clubhouse turn, moved down to the three path, steered five wide leaving the second bend and edged
SIGNOFTHECROSS for the show. SIGNOFTHECROSS was fanned seven wide into the first turn, remained wide then angled in on the backstretch, saved
ground through the far turn and missed the show. ON RAGLAN ROAD raced up close outside the pacesetter, angled five wide around the far turn and faded
in the lane. THE BEAT went five wide through the first turn, angled in for the second bend, exited the far turn three wide and came up empty.
TIZHOTNDUSTY raced four wide through the first turn, traveled in range off the inside, between foes on the far turn, came four wide into the drive and
weakened.

Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY showed early speed between rivals then chased outside a runner into the turn, came three wide into the lane then angled inside the
leader at the top of the stretch, struck the front midway through the drive and continued strong to the wire. PHILLY LISHES raced up close from outside,
took control with three-eighths remaining, lost command to the winner in midstretch and stayed on well through the final furlong for the place.
YOUONLYLIVETWICE stumbled leaving the gate, bid four wide leaving the turn and faltered in the final furlong. LIBERTY LIBERTY tracked off the inside,
outside a rival on the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and could not rally. BACKTOFLASH sat off the pace early on, went four wide into the turn, exited
six wide and lacked a late bid. ALLISON'S SURPRISE lacked early speed, angled down to the inside, came out into the stretch and improved position.
MONGOLIAN BABY hesitated and came away slowly at the start, traveled along the inside into the turn, moved to the two path around the bend and failed
to menace. MY TIGRESS tracked off the rail, entered the stretch five wide and weakened. BEAUTIFUL WORLD sent for the lead from inside, chased the
top pair into and around the turn and faded. TURF KITTY coaxed early to go to the front, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, lost command at the
three-eighths pole and retreated in the stretch.
