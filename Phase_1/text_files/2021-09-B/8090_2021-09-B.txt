Footnotes
GOLANI BRIGADE settled just off the pace in third position, went three wide on the turn, was asked just inside the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into upper
stretch, closed well to go past the embattled leaders inside the furlong marker then moved clear under strong urging. CASALSA bumped with a rival at the
start, moved up to take the the lead, showed the way on the inside under some pressure, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the lead into the stretch,
fought on well with DEVIOUS MO into the final furlong, led narrowly at that point but was headed by the winner shortly thereafter and was outfinished then
just held the place. DEVIOUS MO bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was given his cue while
taking a narrow advantage into upper stretch, battled with CASALSA under a drive into the final furlong and was also outfinished then just missed the place
while clear for the show. EL SOBREVIVIENTE was urged along off the pace, angled in with five furlongs to run, raced inside to the two path on the turn,
moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. QUINTARELLI settled towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, was roused outside the
quarter-pole and failed to respond. TRUE PALACE settled at the rear on the outside, went five wide while under extra left-rein guidance early on the turn,
dropped to the three path outside the five-sixteenths then moved to the rail and was no factor.

Footnotes
DAUNT broke in at the start bumping PARATUS and bobbled, tracked just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tipped out to the three path straightened away, dug in under a drive
between foes among a host in behind the leader, emerged from the pace inside the final sixteenth to get up in the last jumps and prevail. CURBSTONE
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive safe to the eighth pole, came under threat from a host and fended them off save one lone rival surging late and was nailed on the line while
just preserving the place honors in a blanket finish. FORT WASHINGTON four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. PARATUS bumped at the start by DAUNT, who broke inwards, settled just off the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive among a host of rivals in a blanket finish
and missed at the end. STREET VENDOR tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outfinished in the late stages. FLIP THE SCRIPT broke out at the start bumping NAPA VALLEY, settled just off
the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was outfinished in
the late going. NAPA VALLEY bumped at the start by FLIP THE SCRIPT, who broke outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. EXCLUSIVE ORDER chased three to four wide under light coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PLEASE NOTE THAT DUE TO A TELETIMER PROCEDURAL ERROR THE

WILL SING FOR WINE settled just off the pace on the outside, was put to coaxing leaving the backstretch, gained to make a three wide bid on the turn, was
roused for more while taking the advantage coming to quarter-pole, floated five wide into the stretch, responded well while inside of the runner-up into the
final furlong then edged clear under vigorous handling. FULL COURT PRESS bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, drafted inside to the
two path on the turn, angled five wide while given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, made a bid in the six path into the stretch then drifted further out, battled
outside of the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished but clear for the place. MAHAAMEL made light contact with an opponent at the start, moved
out while urged along early, advanced to press the pace on the outside before the three-quarter pole, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked while
taking a short lead approaching the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage nearing the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired but held
the show. CHOWDA went clear early then was challenged outside the three-quarter pole, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path
on the turn, was asked while being headed coming to the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. TREASON settled at the rear of the
field, was roused three then four wide on the turn, passed the three-eighths pole under the crop, moved to five wide late on that bend and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SUNDAESWITHSANDY went to the front, showed the way on the inside with some company to his outside, responded well when asked near the
quarter-pole, drew off to a sizable advantage into upper stretch, remained well clear into the final sixteenth then was fully extended to last.
EXCURSIONNISTE checked while taken up significantly shortly after the start, was reserved near the three path, moved out while asked for his best in
upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining fast nearing the sixteenth-pole and closed strongly but missed while clear for the place.
MASETA went three wide under a hold on the first turn, was rated under vigorous restraint then wrestled back with six furlongs to run, dropped further off
the pace while still under restraint, was roused two then three wide on the final turn, swung five wide into the stretch then was fanned out near the
three-sixteenths, drifted in while gaining coming to the sixteenth-pole and secured the show. SIR JOHN broke out at the start, was rated just off the pace
while saving ground, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch then came out further and lacked the needed
response while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. KINGHAM HILL broke out then shied out and was off a step slow, went five wide on the first turn,
was reserved on the outside, came under urging while three wide early on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped in from behind foes around
the three-sixteenths then lugged in and failed to rally. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, dropped from the four
path to the two path on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch, steadied while lacking room from near the furlong marker to outside the
sixteenth-pole and failed to impact. JUGGLER shied out shortly after the start, went four to five wide on the initial turn, stalked the pace on the outside under
a hold, was asked three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch before being carried further out and tired. TOGA DANCER was reserved
on the inside, came under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. MONTEGO BAY CIRCLE was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, saved
ground while unhurried at the back, was coaxed along on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and failed to
threaten. SOMETHING MAJESTIC went around the opening bend in the four path, prompted the pace on the outside under a snug hold, was asked in the
two path on the far turn, shied three wide briefly outside the quarter-pole then dropped back to the two path and came up empty.

Footnotes
KING JAMES was rated off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide near the five-sixteenths, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed
strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the runner-up from that point to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong handling.
ELUSIVE EDGE broke in then was hustled, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at
the quarter-pole, inched clear into the final furlong, was challenged by the winner coming to the sixteenth-pole, dug in gamely and fought determinedly with
that opponent to the wire and was denied while able to get the place. MORE LIKE IT brushed with a foe after the start, settled off the pace, went three wide
on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. HALPERT broke a bit slow, was urged along towards the back, rounded the
turn in the two path, was roused for more in the three path at the quarter-pole then moved out and improved position. YANKEE EMPIRE settled off the pace
under some restraint, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
BARDOLINO pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired.
MAGNIFICENT CHROME broke a bit slow then brushed with a foe, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path
nearing the quarter-pole and was no factor. LOADED JOE was urged to establish early position then taken in hand, saved ground on the turn, was roused
near the quarter-pole and came up empty. DISCIPLANARIAN stalked the pace, was asked three wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and
capitulated. MOMMIE'S JEWEL tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and had nothing left. K. K.
ICHIKAWA dropped well behind under urging and was pulled up then walked off.
