PRIVATE NETWORK entered the first turn in the five path then stalked three wide into the backstretch, challenged approaching the five sixteenths pole,
dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn then dug in determinedly through the stretch to take the nod in the final yards. MORE PLEASE ran in
the four path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms three wide nearing the top of the stretch, drifted outward in the
upper stretch but dug in when straightened away to take second at the wire. TOPPSGOLDENTICKET raced with the pace two deep while between horses
and took the nod past the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths, contested the advantage nearest the rail into the far
turn, was met midway through the turn and dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding. RAGING WHIRLWIND saved ground off the pace, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, improved near the rail on the far turn and finished well. BOSEY set the early pace inside, was met leaving the nine sixteenths
pole and gave chase through the backstretch, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened in the
lane. INDY DEL SOL settled just off the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but showed little response. PALMETTO BLUE raced
just off the early pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

MORALITY CLAUSE stalked from the three and four paths, bid toward the five sixteenths pole and took aim in the four path on the far turn, dug in for the
lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. HARDSCRATCH took over at the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving
the three eighths pole, dueled clear into the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn, dug in to the challenge of the winner past the eighth pole, but was
caught mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. FINDER ANGEL R V F settled off the pace inside, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole,
angled five wide through the far turn and finished evenly to take third later yards while gaining on the runner-up. JEAN GREY raced well back saving early
ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn and came through the stretch widest.
CAROLINA BAMBINA saved ground into the first turn then stalked from the three path into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, dueled close two deep on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE raced with the pace inside, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the quarter and weakened nearest the rail approaching the top of the stretch.

MACKENZIE'S STAR stalked off the rail then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, threatened the runner-up while two deep approaching the head of
the lane, took over from that one mid-stretch and dug in to inch clear the final strides. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY came away a step slow then closed to the
lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths, contested the edge near
the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was headed mid-stretch and relented later yards. MABEL settled close to the early pace inside, picked up
the chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out mid-stretch and finished well to gain on the runner-up. LADY MADISON
steadied early and rounded the opening turn about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn about the three path but flattened inside the eighth pole. LONGSTORYLUCY saved early ground then picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. KIM'S DIAMOND rounded the opening turn in the three path
and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
CARMELO came through the first turn in the three path and settled close into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, ran in the five
path of the far turn then dug in through the lane to get up the final strides. LITTLE LEO settled back saving ground the first turn, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and steadily progressed at the rail on the far turn, threatened and took a slim brief lead mid-stretch, but suffered a fatal injury in the final
strides and had to be euthanized on the track. WONDER HOW rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch then flattened stride later yards. PROUD ENOUGH rounded the opening turn
about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn and finished
evenly. TWOBITSARIDE stalked two deep, challenged approaching the three eighths pole and contested the turn at a close disadvantage about the three
path, then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. C B BODEMESTER saved ground into the first turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the
five sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. LIL BITTY ROAD rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened into the far turn.
