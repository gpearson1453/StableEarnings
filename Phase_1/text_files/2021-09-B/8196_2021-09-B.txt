Footnotes
JOE FRAZIER was well rated early and made a four wide move leaving the five sixteenths pole, then took command leaving the turn and was clear by the
furlong marker, then drew out in the final furlong to prove much the best under a drive while being wrapped up late. LONG WEEKEND was fractious in the
paddock pre race, then dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid to gain a short advantage on the turn, then was confronted by JOE FRAZIER by the
quarter pole, could not go with that rival while staying on for the place award. IMPRESSED was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn and angled out
in the stretch but offered no late rally while being along for the show award, besting the rest. CHARCOAL chased the early pace five wide, made a four wide
bid on the turn and came five wide into the drive but came up empty. AGGRESSIVITY chased the early pace on the inside and faded. WILLISTON WAY
stumbled at the start, then was rushed up the inside to duel for command on the inside and folded up.

Footnotes
JOY IN THE JOURNEY dueled for the early lead four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear by the quarter pole, then remained clear by
the furlong marker, then kept CUPP OF CLASS at a safe margin to prove best under a drive. CUPP OF CLASS was well placed early towards the inside,
then made a two wide bid in between rivals on the turn, tipped out four wide leaving the turn for aim on the front runner, but could not get to that rival while
clearly second best. MAJESTIC CLIMB chased the early pace three wide and in between rivals, made a three to four wide bid on the turn while still in
between rivals, then came five wide into the drive but flattened out. WHERETHEMONEYWENT stalked the early pace five wide, came four wide into the
drive3 and faded. THIRST TRAP passed the tiring rivals. KOJO'S QUEEN lacked a rally. LOONA LUV dueled for the lead in between horses and
weakened. MISS HELEN BACK pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
MS SATCH MO pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid when ready on the turn to draw clear by the quarter pole, then drew off leaving the turn
and was ridden out to prove much the best. PERTINACIOUS TIZ was void of early speed, raced out in the four path down the backstretch, advanced four to
five wide on the turn, and rallied well on the outside for the pace award while no match for the winner. ANNA'S MOONLIGHT was allowed to settle early,
advanced on the inside on the turn, eased out midway on the turn and came four wide into the drive, but could not sustain that bid while besting the rest.
EVIE was reserved early on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive but lacked the needed rally. POLYESTER BRIDE set a pressured pace on the
inside and weakened. WICKED ECSTASY was well placed early on the inside, then was two wide on the turn and tired. MISS DONNASUE broke in the air,
then settled in mid pack and tired. QUITE WHIMSICAL was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace four wide and tired.

Footnotes
ROSY GLOW pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, edged clear leaving the turn and remained clear to prove best under a drive.
LILMISS SASSYPANTS chased the early pace on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive, closed well and altered course late for racing room to gain
the place spot. PRIME N PROPER chased the early pace three wide, swung out five wide for the drive while making a bid, but needed more late. TRIP
CHARGE set the pace early on the inside, then vied for command to the upper stretch, then faded late. SENORITA EMMA chased the pace five wide, came
six wide into the drive and offered no rally. TWO LUCKY was reserved early, came seven wide into the drive and offered no rally. TUSCAN ROSE prompted
the pace from between horses and weakened. ISLANDBUM was off a step slow, not a factor. SHE'S NO TOY stopped while wide.

Footnotes
TORTE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, hit the front approaching the furlong marker, then drew clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best under a drive. AMAZINGNESS was rated early three wide and in between rivals, made a two wide bid on the turn to be in contention
leaving the turn, needed more late while gaining the place spot. MAMALA KAMALA set the pace while racing in the three path, was headed leaving the turn
and faded late. GIO'S BABY GIRL was taken back early and dropped to the inside, moved up through traffic on the backstretch, then was three wide by the
quarter pole, angled in mid stretch but finished evenly late. BEYOND JUSTICE was well placed early on the inside and weakened. LIZZSAIDNO lacked a
rally. FASHION DIVA was five wide into the first turn, then tracked the pace five wide and tired. FARM SAFETY failed to menace. CAROLYN'S ANGEL was
not a factor while wide.

Footnotes
LIZA'S READY was soon clear and crossed over to the inside to set the pace, then dug in gamely in the stretch to remain clear while being kept to her task.
LING LING chased the early pace on the inside, remained down on the inside leaving the turn, angled out late to finish willingly to get the place. ROYAL
COUNTY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but hung late. WARRIOR'S BATTLE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into
the drive and offered a late rally for the minor rewards. BODIEFUL chased the early pace three wide, then was on the inside entering the stretch, shifted off
the rail through the stretch and had a belated rally. SHEGOTTHEGOLDMINE was off a step slow, then was settled back early, swung out five wide for the
drive and showed some late interest. BELLA PRIMA chased the pace three to four wide and faded. FABULOUS PHILLY was off slowly, then was six wide
into the drive while being no threat. FAITHFUL AUSTIN was reluctant to load, then raced on the inside and was pulled up, walked off. The half mile
fractional time was unavailable

the show spot. FAITHFUL NOTION stalked the pace in the two path but had no late bid. BELLA'S PRAYER raced in the four path, bid at the quarter pole
but faltered in the stretch. HOBNOBIN GENERAL pressed the early pace in the three path, dueled on the turn outside of the winner but couldn't last in the
stretch. JUSTICETHEBEAST stalked in the five path before giving way in the stretch. TRAVELINJUSTICE raced evenly outside. MEMORY IN MOTION

SANTIN was bumped at the start, then was settled three wide while covered up in the backstretch, was roused nearing the three eighths marker and shifted
to the outside, made a six wide move leaving the five sixteenths pole, continued that move and hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then drew out to
prove much the best under a drive. FEBRUARY SON was rated along four wide, made a five wide move on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn, but
could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong while clearly second best. AMERICAN DIAMOND was settled back and five wide on the
backstretch, advanced on the outside on the turn, came seven wide into the drive and was along for the show award. KID SHELLEEN tracked the early
pace towards the inside, came three wide into the drive and faded. SIMON PETER passed the tiring rivals. ROCKET HOTSHOT was void of early speed,
swung out seven wide for the derive but offered no rally. TROPICAL TORNADO chased the early pace and made a four wide bid to gain a short lead briefly
on the turn and weakened. RUFFLED WATERS was four wide into the first turn, then settled five wide down the backstretch, then was nine wide into the
drive and had no rally. DYNABLUE lacked a rally. NOBEL vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. CALL OF HONOR vied for the lead three wide and
