AUTISM ABILITY chased the early pace, mounted a bid while six wide on the turn, gained ground into the stretch, quickly collared SOUL PRODIGY inside
of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. MCGEORGE settled near the rear of the field, was five wide on the turn between horses, rallied off of the
turn and won the head nod for second but was not pressuring the winner in the end. SOUL PRODIGY was hustled to set the early pace while being
pressured, had a clear lead into the final furlong but was quickly collared by the winner and was outfinished, just missing for second. COLONEL MIKE
pressed the early pace from a three wide running position, was still in contention leaving the turn but weakened in the drive. EL CHARRO CHAMP stalked
the pace from the middle of the field, was four wide on the turn, was losing ground when checked in tight quarters in the final furlong and finished evenly in
the stretch. LAZARUS COME FORTH had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.

BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) was away a step slowly and chased the early leaders, was four wide on the turn and mounted a bid leaving the bend, was
steadily closing the margin on WHOA BUDDY and was all out in the final strides to nail that rival on the wire to prevail. WHOA BUDDY broke sharply and
set the quick fractions while saving ground, had a clear lead inside of the final furlong and was nailed in the final strides for the win while clear of the rest.
SOUND JUDGMENT tracked the early pace from a two wide running position and was outkicked in the stretch. MY FRIEND TONY pressed the early pace
while three wide and weakened in the stretch run. PASSIONATE REWARD chased the early leader from the rear, saved ground on the turn and was
outfinished in the stretch.

Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY broke alertly and set all of the pace from a ground saving position, was confronted inside of the furlong marker by the runner-up and
determinedly held on over that rival to prevail. I WILL YEAH (IRE) sat just off of the early pace, gained ground while three wide on the second turn,
confronted the winner inside of the furlong marker, battled for another sixteenth but could not reel him in in the final stages while clear of the rest.
COOLCROSS tracked the early pace from a two wide running position, lost ground off of the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch. BARBIERE
settled in the midflight, saved ground on the second turn while two wide and did not offer a late rally in the stretch. CANYON CREST had no speed in the
early stages, saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor. DEALERS HAND was four wide on the first turn, continued that wide trip along the
backstretch, was three to four wide on the second turn and trailed throughout.
