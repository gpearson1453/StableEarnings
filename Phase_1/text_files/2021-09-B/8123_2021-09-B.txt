COLTONS DREAM set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch, widened under a drive then finished under a hand ride. SEA SCOUT lost his path
leaving the gate, closed fast two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, ran into traffic upper stretch and ducked in towards the rail but the way was
blocked so he angled out and rallied with high energy. TIZ ROMANTIC stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn and was all out in the stretch. BULLET
SPEED was off slowly, settled in mid pack, closed on the turn and finished under a determined drive. TWICE AS SMART broke outward, raced in mid pack,
was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied outside but did not threaten. MAD DOG N JOE, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from
the rail on the turn but failed to menace. VIEW FROM EGBERT forced the early pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn but evened out on mid stretch.
MIGHTY PELE broke inward and steadied, trailed the field, was hustled along but never reached contention.

Footnotes
RIGHT TO STRIKE had a nice open gap trip chasing the duelers down the backstretch, came two to five wide to bid at the quarter pole, drove by under
strong handling by the eighth pole and was all out to hold the advantage to the wire. VERRAZANO BRIDGE was three to two wide and off the pace on the
first turn, four wide down the backside before angling in to the fence on the far turn, came up inside early stretch, out and around a tiring rival at the eighth
before dipping back inside and in tight by the sixteenth, squeezing through and up for the place late. GRAND GIZMO leapt up at the start and was off the
pace, advanced outside two rivals into the far turn, came the winner by the quarter pole but seemed in a little tight, took back and re-rallied down the lane
while widest to get the best of two rivals in a show photo. KOMUNIST two wide and off the pace early, rallied two to four wide between foes on the far turn
and was in close quarters nearing the stretch, dropped back momentarily before coming again inside the show finisher in the late stages. SAINT'S REST sat
along the rail in midpack, moved up inside two rivals on the turn before angling out to the three path and bidding when turning for home, actually had a short
lead inside the winner at the eighth pole but was outkicked by numerous foes to the wire. ONE WAY TO WIN stalked the early leader, pressed that one and
took over midway on the far turn and stayed game until inside the eighth pole when tiring in falling back. DOC FISHMAN trailed until midway on the far turn,
rallied mildly to midstretch but stalled from there. SON OF MY FATHER was offstride at the start before quickly recovering and set the pace while stalked
and pressed by a rival, began to fade into the stretch and retreated down the lane. CARROBIO was three to two wide and at the rear of the field on the first
turn, never reaching contention.

MOPOLKA led quickly, set a pressured pace, drew clear late backstretch, was pressured on the turn, shook clear into the stretch, widened when asked and
finished under a hand ride. COOL SOCIETY settled in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns, was hustled on the far bend and chased through the stretch.
AMI'S LINK broke a step slowly, closed on the backstretch, forced the issue on the far turn, chased gamely in the stretch but to no avail. CRUMLIN TIME
raced in mid pack, came two-wide through both turns and finished gamely. TIZ MY RIGHT pressed the pace, dropped back two and three-wide on the far
turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. THE ADRIE FACTOR was rated off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the far turn, drifted out at the top of
the stretch, lost ground and evened out.

four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. TAKE CHARGECHRISTY raced in mid pack while saving ground and finished willingly along the fence.
TWISTED PATH was bumped at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace.
HANCHY raced in mid pack, dropped to the rear early on the far turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. SLYDINI set a reserved pace,

Footnotes
MATTHAUS led quickly, set a pressured pace, dueled two-wide on the turn, edged clear mid stretch and held under a drive. TARA DAWN settled in mid
pack, was patient on the rail through the turn then rallied in the stretch and was gaining late. ROLLING SLOAN forced the pace, dueled from the rail on the
turn, yielded grudgingly in the final furlong and chased to the end. SADIE IRENE got away slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide
on the turn then rallied gamely between horses. SHANGHAI KIMMY in range, chased two-wide late turn and was all out in the stretch. SARARENDA rated
in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but evened out. MISGUIDED PASSION was away slowly and
settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. TUSCAN DAMSEL stalked the pace, chased hard two and
three-wide on the turn, was lightly bumped between SHANGHAI KIMMY and SARARENDA at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.
