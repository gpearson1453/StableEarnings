Footnotes
LUNI SIMA was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace four to three wide down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the far turn, dropped
down to the rail leaving the turn and was sent down, drew clear to prove best under strong crop urging. PURE ROCKET was bumped at the start, was six
wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace five to four wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid with the winner on the turn, shifted in to be three wide
leaving the turn but could not match strides with the winner late, second best. FROSTY DREAMS pressed the early pace two wide and in between horses
on the backstretch, the fell off the pace by the quarter pole, angled out leaving the three sixteenths then finished evenly late to be clearly best of the rest.
BEACH HOLIDAY set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. THISPOINTINTIME was three wide into the first turn, then chased the early pace and
moved to the inside and tired. XKUZ was five wide into the first turn, then was seven wide on the backstretch, not a threat.

Footnotes
LIGHTUPJUSTICE vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid to draw clear on the turn and drop down to the inside, then dug in gamely the last
furlong to hold on late under a drive. LUSH BE A LADY was four wide into the first turn, then angled in to rate kindly three wide and in between rivals down
the backstretch, then started to make a bid between rivals around the three eighths pole, but had to check sharply, then shifted out and made a four wide
move past the quarter pole, closed well to just miss, lost bob. DASH OF SIMPLICITY was in tight into the first turn down on the inside, then rated along the
inside, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out three wide for aim on the front runner and made a three wide bid to loom boldly by the furlong marker
but flattened out late. WICKED JUSTICE was four wide into the first turn, chased the early pace three wide and tired. THE STONE EVENT lacked a rally.
BEYONDSPOTLIGHT stumbled at the start, then proved to be no factor. PRIZED CUPCAKE vied for the early lead two wide and folded up.

Footnotes
ANTALYA was well placed early in the pocket on the inside, swung out six wide for the drive for racing room, closed well to draw away to prove much the
best under mild urging. GO YEOWOMEN pressed the pace three wide and made a bid leaving the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while
saving the place award. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE tracked the pace four wide early, then fell back on the turn while five wide by the quarter pole, came
again to just miss the place award. LADY LEAH chased the early pace five wide and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out. SWEET N WICKED
set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. TRAUMARAMA passed the tiring rivals. MAUK'S TUFF failed to menace. MAGNA G FORCE was
allowed to settle early on the inside, made a mild bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. AIR TURBULENCE tired. The half mile and the six and a
half mile fractional times were unavailable

came six wide into the drive and rallied. INDIGO RICH stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out. BROKEN JUSTICE
broke outwardly at the start, then was outrun early, was six wide by the quarter pole, came nine wide into the stretch and offered a belated rally for the minor
rewards. GUARD pressed the early pace on the inside, then tipped out two wide for the drive and faded. CALL ME DROSSEL chased the pace three wide
and weakened. PRINCE SHIM was bumped hard at the start, set a pressured pace in between horses and weakened. STUDENT PRINCE failed to

Footnotes
EL BOHEMIO was well placed early behind the duel, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front leaving the turn, lugged in by the three
sixteenths pole all the way to the rail, drew clear to prove best under left handed urging. SACRED KIKI BIRD dueled for the early lead three wide, made a
two wide bid on the turn, then altered course leaving the three sixteenths pole and faded, held place award. WARRIOR'S REMARK was void of early speed,
then advanced three wide by the quarter pole, closed gap late. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER chased the pace three wide, came four wide into the drive but had
no rally. SHADOW OF JUSTICE was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out five wide for the drive and had no rally. GAWKIER dueled for the lead
on the inside and weakened. TOPPING was settled four to five wide and weakened. The rider on SACRED KIKI BIRD claimed foul against the winner EL
BOHEMIO for alleged interference around the three sixteenths pole, after review the race was left as is.
