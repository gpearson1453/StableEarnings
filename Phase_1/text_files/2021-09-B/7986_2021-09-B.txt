THE DRAKE stalked the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly outside, was carried out by the leader and proved best under right handed urging. PURRS
AGAIN away alertly, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out to the six path then couldn't handle the winner late. YOU ARE AWESOME saved ground
through the far turn, angled out past the quarter pole, angled inside the drifting leader a furlong out then was outfinished. SHE LOVE ME passed tiring rivals.
SAN RULER was no threat. DOBBYS SOCK outside, failed to respond. NO EXAGGERATION pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half.

HOLDONTOYOURTIARA dueled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch and drew off through the final furlong to win as much the best under a
hand ride. Z U IN MY DREAMS battled with the winner two wide then along the inside into the stretch but was no match while clear for second. STREET OF
JEWELS contested the early lead along the inside and dropped back on the turn. YAMBOREE QUEEN was no factor. PRECISION PRADO was no threat.
