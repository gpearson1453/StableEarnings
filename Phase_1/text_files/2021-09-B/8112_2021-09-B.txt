Footnotes
DOLCE APRILE disputed the pace three wide between foes, drew clear leaving the three-eighths pole, angled in and drew off under a drive. SPLICER
raced well back well off the rail and finished with late interest to gain the place on the wire. UNBRIDLED CHROME raced off the pace four wide, improved
position in upper stretch, moved into a clear second near the sixteenth pole but was nailed for the place on the wire. ANGELIC STORM stalked the pace two
and three wide between foes, had the rider lose the whip near the quarter pole, angled in and weakened. CUPID AUSTIN bumped with CAGUA at the start,
advanced four wide, bid near the three-eighths pole, could not keep pace with the winner from there and faded through the lane. BRINGTHEWINE vied two
wide between foes, steadied near the quarter pole and retreated. CAGUA bumped with CUPID AUSTIN at the start, raced three wide and played no further
factor. THE CUBAN MISSILE tried to duck into the gap leaving the chute but was quickly corrected, advanced inside down the backstretch, disputed the
pace from the rail for a half, could not match strides with the winner from the three-eighths pole, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole and retreated from
there. MOONLIGHT TANGO was in tight at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PO BOY vied early among rivals, edged clear after a quarter-mile, and widened through the stretch kept to task. DAVID'S CUPID got bumped by RIDE ON
BYE at the start, raced forwardly while alternating between the rail and two-path to the stretch, and prevailed for the place between horses. VOICE OF NOW
was never far back, loomed a threat outside the winner after three-eighths of a mile, could not keep pace into the lane, and was outfinished outside rivals for
second. RIDE ON BYE broke out into DAVID'S CUPID, hustled up early on the rail, steadied lacking room past the half-mile marker, stayed inside for the
drive and finished one-paced. SARAWAT was pushed out a bit at the break, came off the turn three wide, moved farther out and could not gain. ROJO
TORO was always outrun. SO IN LOVE broke slowly and raced far back.

Footnotes
WHITE ABARRIO moved to a forward position up the backstretch, split GLORIOUS BUSINESS and CLASSICSTATEOFMIND to challenge for command
midway on the turn, kicked away through upper stretch and widened under a drive. LOGICO broke slowly and was outsprinted early inside, began to
advance around the turn in the two-path, moved further out into the stretch and rallied to go clear of the rest. CLASSICSTATEOFMIND contested the pace
outside rivals in the three-path for a half-mile, and weakened in the stretch. GLORIOUS BUSINESS dueled for the early lead inside, and gave way after a
half. SUPERSTITIEUX tracked outside the early leaders three then four wide, and faded into the stretch. FROSTED ARMOUR was outrun for a half, shifted
five wide approaching the top of the stretch, and made no headway. GRAND DAVID raced four wide around the turn within striking range, then gave way.
DOMINICAN ICE showed little. FIRST TEAM was outrun inside. JEST ABOVE was finished early three wide. GUN FOR SUCCESS was through early
outside.

Footnotes
SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE stalked the pace inside, waited for room nearing the quarter pole, split rivals three wide leaving that marker, seized command
soon after and drew off under a drive. LOVIN LIVIN raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the place.
GINGERONMYMIND was off early the pace, bid two wide nearing the turn, disputed the pace to midstretch and held third. TEN PIN ALLY raced off the
early pace, advanced three wide around the turn, bid near the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. CACTUS KITTEN was in tight at the start, raced three
wide and never threatened. BLUES SONGS vied inside and tired in nearing the lane. DORA PRINCELLA bobbled at the break, saved ground and was
outrun. MIRANDA SOFIA disputed the early pace outside, pulled up nearing the half-mile pole and was vanned off. COMMANDER GRACE led early, was
pulled up near the five-eighths pole, refused to load on two different vans and eventually walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND
TOOK NO ACTION.

FIRST RULE was slowest to begin, was urged along entering the turn, split the leaders past the three-eighths pole, battled between horses into the stretch,
and edged past GEOSCIENCE after a long drive. GEOSCIENCE set the pace inside, dug in through the stretch, and could not withstand FIRST RULE in
the last 50 yards. ABSOLUTE GRIT pressed the early pace outside, drifted five wide coming to the top of the stretch, and was outfinished. JUST RIGHT
MIKE raced widest of the foursome for a half-mile, and tired.

EASY COME EASY GO settled off the early pace inside, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up late. SISTER LOU ANN hit the
starting gate, rushed up inside, set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and led until deep stretch. CUMULONIMBUS saved ground off the
pace, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied for the show. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER was in range outside, dropped back four wide around the turn

Footnotes
DANCE D'ORO took control after the start, maintained a clear advantage to the stretch, widened through the furlong grounds under a drive, and was being
geared down the last 70 yards. STARSHIP NTERPRISE saved ground in pursuit of the pacesetter for six furlongs, could not seriously menace, but dud in
along the rail to get the place. HELPING LISA D advanced outside around the turn, got closest to the leader after six furlongs, then was outfinished for
second. INDICIA trailed to the stretch, and passed only tired horses. PENS STREET tired after six furlongs. CLASSY WOMAN stayed in range early, and
faltered nearing the stretch.
