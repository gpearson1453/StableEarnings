MAJESTIC BLEND pressed the pace early, raced in the three path through the turn, was under a long drive in the stretch three wide and edged clear in the
final stages. UNTIL NOW set the pace early, raced in the two path through the turn, was under a long drive in the stretch from between horses and yielded
in the late stages. DULCIMER DAME was a tad slow at the start, stalked the pace early from the inside, made a bid from the inside down the lane but
weakened late in the drive. RONAN trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. HER GIANT was never a
threat. KOJO'S QUEEN was through after a half. BLONDE BY NATURE was done early.

Footnotes
EXEMPLAR raced in the two path along the first turn and chased the early pace, raced in the three path along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane,
took over command in the stretch and drew away late under a steady drive. URBANITE was a tad slow at the break and trailed the field while far back early
on, came flying into the lane from the five path, continued the rally down the lane and was up for place while no match for the winner. CHICORY BLUE
raced in the three path along the first turn and was back early, raced in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. RARE FORM set the
pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. PICKFORD tracked the pace early, raced in the three path along both
turns, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE was never a threat. TAOS broke in the air and hit the gate
at the start, through after a half.

Footnotes
JUST MIGHT set the pace outside of a vying DENNIS' MOMENT, disposed of that foe turning for home as a pair of outer foes ranged up, repelled those
bids in midstretch as ENDORSED loomed a danger, drifted out multiple paths through the final stages, but held from that foe to the wire. ENDORSED trailed
in the three path into the turn, shifted ground four to five wide turning for home while picking up stride, rallied outside of foes through the lane, took aim on
the clear leader in the final furlong, but ran out of ground to catch that foe while not being impacted by that one's drift. BANGO stalked four wide, shifted
three wide into the turn, inched closer to the pace setter turning for home to attempt a bid between horses entering the lane, but hung on his left lead, was
repelled at the furlong pole, kept on, then got outkicked by place in the late stages. MIGHTY MISCHIEF broke outwardly, tracked the pace five wide, then
four wide into the turn, ranged up outside of foes turning for home to mildly bid for the lead entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, and yielded
through the final furlong. DENNIS' MOMENT rushed to vie for the lead inside of JUST MIGHT, but gave way turning for home, and faded through the lane.
DERBY DATE chased three wide for a quarter mile, but steadily faded thereafter.

Footnotes
HIDDEN CONNECTION prompted the pace two wide, inched closer to vie for the lead at the five furlong pole, showed the way between rivals around the far
turn, but willingly kicked clear when let out passing the quarter pole, swiftly drew away from rivals in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure
through the final furlong. MAMA RINA saved ground off of the pace, left the rail entering the lane to pass the tiring early pace setter, but shifted back to in
upper stretch, produced a rail rally through the lane, then reached placed inside of a pair of foes at the sixteenth pole while not threatening the leader.
GODDESS OF FIRE was unable to achieve forward early positioning after breaking a bit flat-footed, was coaxed between horses passing the half mile pole
to advance to a tracking position, but was floated five wide by an inner foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on well through the late stages,
claimed show a sixteenth out, and held it late. CODE FOR SUCCESS trailed around the first turn, shifted to the four path down the backstretch, got floated
to the seven path around the far turn, then sustained a belated advance outside of foes in the late stages, but failed to reach show. MAJESTIC D'ORO
stalked three wide, prompted the pace around around the far turn, but proved no match for an inner rival entering the lane, held place through midstretch,
but faded between horses a sixteenth from home. ONTHEONESANDTWOS stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio approaching the five
sixteenths pole, but lacked a rally through the lane, encountered mild traffic problems between horses at the furlong grounds, and tired thereafter. MISS
CHAMITA tracked from midpack five to four wide around the first turn, but faded when floated six wide approaching the five sixteenth spole. KNEESNHIPS
tracked three wide, but was done early. MAXINE MACHINE lied far off of the pace in the three to five paths around the turns, and failed to factor. LEMIEUX
cleared around the first turn and set the pace inside of the eventual winner, then weakened inside of a pair of foes at the five sixteenths pole, and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
MAJOR GENERAL bobbled at the start, took back between rivals into the first turn to track from the four path, came under urging to sustain position around
that bend, remained under steady urging down the backstretch, was roused leaving the half mile pole to produce an early bid for the lead into the far turn,
dueled outside of STELLAR TAP while tucking two wide entering the lane, brushed that foe at the quarter pole before mildly bumping that rival approaching
the three sixteenths marker, prevailed in that battle passing the furlong grounds as outer foes rallied, but lasted to the wire. TOUGH TO TAME was taken
back into the first turn to stalk along the inside, pulled in the bit while tracking the leaders down the backstretch, shifted to the three path turning for home,
but drifted out while taking aim on the leading pair in upper stretch, chased through midstretch while steadily progressing, bid for the lead approaching the
wire, but was denied. RED KNOBS broke a bit slowly, settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path in to the far turn before coming into
the lane five wide and between horses, but produced a steady rally through the lane, claimed show late, and held that position to the wire. BOURBON
HEIST bobbled a bit at the start and trailed the field, took the far turn in the six path, shifted seven wide entering the lane, and rallied well outside of foes
through the final furlong, but was denied show. STELLAR TAP pressed three wide before brushing an inner foe into the first turn, backed off to stalk the
pace into the backstretch, produced an early bid for the lead into the turn as MAJOR GENERAL forced her hand, dueled around that bend before tucking to
the rail entering the lane, got brushed by the aforementioned rival before being bumped minorly by that foe in upper stretch, then yielded through the final
furlong. GUNTOWN settled far off of the pace, split foes three wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. STRIKE HARD settled off of the pace in the three
path, got caught five wide around the far turn, then lacked a rally on his left lead. HUSBAND MATERIAL stalked in the three path, but faded turning for
home. ROGER MCQUEEN took a bump from an outer foe into the first turn, dueled for the lead inside of that foe thereafter, but gave way after being
headed by a pair of outer foes approaching the five sixteenths pole. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT was minorly bumped by an outer foe into an inner rival into the
first turn, got keen and pulled in the bit to duel for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole. THE RIDER OF
STELLAR TAP CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MAJOR GENERAL FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED
BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SHEDARESTHEDEVIL set an uncontested pace while well in hand in the two path, turned away a pair of mildly bidding outer rivals when let out passing the
quarter pole, met CRYSTAL BALL's rail bid in midstretch, and gamely clung to a margin through the final furlong. CRYSTAL BALL stalked along the inside,
slipped through a manageable rail opening in upper stretch to bid for the lead passing the furlong grounds, but failed to reach the leader's throatlatch, and
was denied. ENVOUTANTE stalked two wide while in the three path, ranged up to the leader between horses turning for home to bid for the lead entering
the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, and chased thereafter. MATERA settled off of the pace in the two path, and improved past outer tiring foes in
the late stages without threatening the top trio. OUR SUPER FREAK tracked three wide, ranged up to the leaders around the far turn, but flattened out four
wide in upper stretch. HIGH REGARD trailed into the far turn, gained ground four wide and outside of foes around the bend, but flattened out in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
RUNWAY MAGIC prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, and drew clear a sixteenth from home. JENNINGS broke
outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked the duelers from the three path around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and chased through
the final furlong to reach place late. FLINT RIDGE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner around the turn
and through midstretch, but yielded approaching the sixteenth pole. NOTARY lied off of the pace four to five wide around the turn, and failed to threaten the
leaders through the lane. SONO GRATO settled at the rear of the field four wide around the turn, and stayed on through the final furlong, but missed
reaching an outer foe for fourth. MOTAGALLY stalked along the inside, tracked the dueling leaders from the three path around the turn, but lacked a kick to
produce a bid, and faded while lugging in in upper stretch. EXCESSION failed to factor. ARABIAN PRINCE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to
the three path in upper stretch, but faded. REGULAR GUY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BELAFONTE was off slowly and got outrun.
