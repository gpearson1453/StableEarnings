SHOW SOME SKIN was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch drew clear. CASSIE'S RAINBOW showed speed from the
inside and had a slim lead on the turn but failed to hold. MS SUEDOO was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and finished well. NOT A HOUSE FRAU
was away alertly and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SOMEONE ELSE was up close and
dueled from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch flattened out. IN PURSUIT was in touch and a factor on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch faded.

TORPEDO MAX was away alertly, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. EXPRESS BANKING tracked
the early leaders, was roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. JERSEY DIAMOND set a pressured pace and
dueled on the turn but had nothing left. CAUSE FOR ALARM was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch was no real threat. LUCKY STREET was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. FINDING PERFECTION settled off the pace,
trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

Footnotes
SONJA'S JOY was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch proved best. DOODLE DANDY was well back,
closed the gap on the far turn and angled out through the stretch to finish well. MADAME BOVERY tracked from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and
had the lead in mid stretch but failed to hold. NATURAL HABITAT had no speed and gained ground on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. WONDERFUL SOFIA was off the pace and roused on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response.
ALITTLEIRISHLUCK was in touch and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. STELLA UNREAL stalked the early leader and
forced the pace on the far turn but had nothing left. SILVER SUNRISE was in range and had a good position on the far turn but dropped back through the
stretch. ROSES LITTLE GIRL set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

BIG BAND BENNY showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. UNYIELDING was unhurried
early, raced evenly on the turn and was clearly second best. TOBRUK showed no speed, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the
stretch finished well. A GERSHWIN TUNE was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for a share.
OPTIC was hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out. FRONT NINE was off the pace and saved
ground on the turn but had no impact. MCGARRETT was in touch but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

HESATHRILLER showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure in mid stretch drew off. CAPE ROMANCE was up close
and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. TINKER RING was away alertly and roused on the turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. ICE CHALLENGE broke awkwardly and trailed the field on the turn but angled out through the
stretch and was up for a share. ZOOLOGICAL was in range and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. ZOOMER MUSIC was in touch and raced
evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch faded.

Footnotes
LOADED ONCE MORE showed speed from the inside and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed.
I AM I SAID settled off the pace, was roused on the turn and rallied late. STRIKING RED was in touch, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at
the top of the stretch was up for show. PLAY IT SMART was in mid pack and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out.
FAIRY was in range and moved up on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no kick. REAL CHOPPER was unhurried early and in
tight on the turn but leveled off late. LEAVE IT WITH ME forced the early pace but lost ground on the turn and was empty. LIGHT IT UP was off slow and
showed nothing while outrun.
