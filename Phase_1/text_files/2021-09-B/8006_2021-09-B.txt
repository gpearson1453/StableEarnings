JACKMAN'S RIDE chased the pace while two wide into the turn, rallied in upper stretch and was in a strong drive and wore down ELUSIVE WAR in late
stretch to be up in time. ELUSIVE WAR set the pace and drew clear on the turn, was in a long drive but weakened in late stretch and could not last in the
end. TIME MACHINE raced three wide on the turn and rallied but was no menace to the top two in late stretch. PALUXY lunged at the start then was
unhurried early then made a mild rally in the stretch but was no menace. PISSARRO'S MANDATE was inside on the turn then two wide for the stretch drive
but was no menace. CAUSEWAY STORM was unhurried early then raced on the inside in the stretch and was no threat. FORREST was allowed to settled
then faltered. MONET'S DEVIL chased the early pace, was used up and stopped.
