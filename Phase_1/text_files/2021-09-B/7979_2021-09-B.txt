Footnotes
FLOURISHING set the pace in the two path, held clear past the eighth pole then fended off challenges from both sides in the final yards. YES I'M
SPITEFUL stalked the pace inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and was gaining quickly late. BARBARA was in range inside early,
steadied along while in a bit tight between foes down the backstretch, angled back to the rail early on the far turn, was ridden out along inside nearing the
lane, stayed at the rail through the stretch and was gaining inside of the winner late. MIA ROSA raced off the pace two wide and had a mild three wide gain
the lane. STRAIGHT TO GO chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. UNBRIDLED CHROME failed to menace while racing three
and four wide. ALEIDA was outrun inside. STORM DREAM prompted the winner from the three path and retreated around the far turn. WHITEROSE
SPIRIT hopped at the start, raced three wide and was through early.

Footnotes
VANCOUVER D'ORO moved inside INDEED INDEED to take over after three-eighths of a mile, widened steadily and was kept busy under a mild drive.
POWER G was outsprinted early, swung widest leaving the turn and rallied to go clear for the place. HE'SSOSUBTLE raced three wide around the turn, was
outfinished for the runner-up spot, unseated the rider past the finish, and was apprehended and escorted back. CLOWNSHOE was a step slower than the
rest at the start, and never factored. INDEED INDEED led early, yielded to VANCOUVER D'ORO midway up the backstretch, and tired after six furlongs.
ROGATIVE showed brief speed, and was finished after a half-mile.

Footnotes
BELLA ROMANCE sprinted clear early inside, came off the rail widening the lead after a half-mile, and continued to expand the margin while drifting out
under pressure. MORE MUCHO chased outside BELLA ROMANCE throughout, and held for the place. ALRIGHT ALREADY raced three to four wide
around the turn, moved in through the last eighth of a mile and stayed clear for the show. ONLY GIRL lunged at the break and was off slowly, lagged well
back for a half, and improved for the last major share outside. OODLES ON FIRE was never close. TONE ELISE hit the left side of the gate and was off
slowly, and remained well back. ISLAND WINTER pursued the leaders for a half, then retreated. SPLICER showed brief speed two to three wide, and tired.
AMAZIN QUEEN was finished early outside.

LORILOUPIES set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch, steadily drifted out under right-handed urging through the lane and widened.
SIMPLIFY (ARG) pressed the winner in the three path, led nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on to hold clear of the
rest. NACHO MAMA raced off the pace four wide and was along for the show. LIZA STAR stumbled at the start, chased the pace inside and lacked a
closing bid. KAMAR TAJ tracked the pace four wide and faded through the stretch.

RAYO COLORADO dashed clear early, widened away from WOW RUN through the furlong grounds and was kept to pressure. WOW RUN advanced to
loom a threat outside RAYO COLORADO past the five-sixteenths, got shaken off turning for home and ran on clearly second best. BAD GUS trailed for
three furlongs, came three wide off the turn, and rallied late between horses to snag the show. PROCURADOR failed to menace two to three wide. GO
CRISTIAN bumped lightly with REGAL HOLIDAY at the start, moved up mildly five wide approaching the stretch, then faded. RAYO tired after three furlongs
toward the inside. REGAL HOLIDAY bumped lightly with GO CRISTIAN at the start, chased outside the early leaders, got out badly midway on the turn, and
dropped far back.

Footnotes
SUM RETURN was guided out to press LLUVIA from outside early, took over entering the turn, got clear after a half-mile, then steadily widened the
advantage under a drive. DOLCISIMA saved ground in midpack early, came two wide off the turn and finished willingly while no threat to the winner.
PAINTBRUSH hit the left side of the gate and was off two lengths slow, lagged well back for a half, and offered a mild late response on the rail to get up for
third. DOLCE APRILE pursued the winner from outside under a drive on the turn, and weakened in the stretch. BRODY'S CAUSEWAY broke two lengths
slow, stayed in range for a half, and faded four wide into the lane. HAD A NICE WEEKEND was outrun three to four wide. TEA'S DREAM tired after a half
outside. LLUVIA moved inside with the early lead, got overhauled entering the turn, and had nothing left into the stretch. IRISH SAMURAI trailed inside.
