Footnotes
CROATIAN raced three wide early, then stalked the leaders, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled, dug in gamely outside of MOHS in the stretch run,
battled heads apart with that rival through the final sixteenth and prevailed at the wire. MOHS set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far turn, dug in
gamely inside of CROATIAN through the final furlong and just missed at the wire. OPTIC WAY broke out bumping a rival at the start, pressed the pace, bid
between rivals entering the far turn, dueled, could not go with the top pair and was well clear for the show spot. BIG CITY BOB raced three wide early,
settled off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and had no rally. ANTIGRAVITY raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. TIVANO was
bumped on both sides and pinched back at the break, then outrun early and did not factor. KITTEN'S SPA raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
CASH CALL KITTEN was outrun inside.
