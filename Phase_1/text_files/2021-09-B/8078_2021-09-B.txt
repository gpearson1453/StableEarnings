KING ALAN tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, challenged around the far turn, raced two to three wide through the stretch run and drew
clear late under steady handling. GREGORIA'S BAY was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and could not
cut into the margin of the leader through the stretch run to finish second best. EL GUAPO showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced well off the
inside into the upper stretch and weakened late. BIG DADDY BUZZ hopped at the break, settled off the early going, raced four wide at the three sixteenths
pole and had no late respponse. ENANO was off slowly and trailed throughout.

KINDA LUCKY set the pace on the inside, opened up a comfortable lead, responded when asked, finished willingly and was kept to the task. THREE
COINS raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied for second. LEIA ORGANA raced off the pace
inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dug in and was outfinished for the place spot. CASH ON FIRST tracked the pacesetter, chased on the far turn,
lacked a bid and weakened. PEACELOVENKARMA stumbled after the start, was outrun early and passed tired rivals. BLUEBERRY PIE drifted out wide
entering the first turn, then raced off the pace inside and did not factor. BELLA COOLA drifted out wide entering the first turn, then raced three wide on the
backside and failed to threaten. MISS CONSTRUE raced two wide off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
MY THOUGHTS chased close up early outside, bid three wide entering the turn, dueled three wide, took over, edged away, dug in gamely inside in the final
sixteenth and held on well for the win. MURUMBI chased between rivals early, angled out in upper stretch, split rivals at the furlong marker, closed willingly,
dug in gamely outside of MY THOUGHTS in deep stretch but needed more. NOTHINGMAKESENSE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, moved up wide
on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and dug in gamely to the end. ESTILO DIFERENTE was a bit reluctant loading, stalked close up two wide
early, bid between rivals entering the turn, dueled and tired. HIGH FRONTIER chased close up outside, went four wide into the turn, four wide into the
stretch and tired. ANAHIYA'S DREAM set the pace on the inside, dueled into the turn and then gave way readily. SHE'S LOST AT SEA chased inside, was
steadied at the half mile marker, continued on the rail, then was forced to check behind a tiring rival on the turn, failed to threaten after.
