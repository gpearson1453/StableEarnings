and rallied. CRACK THE SAFE lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied. LIFESPAN lacked speed, raced between horses in the
stretch and rallied late. BLOODPROF , well placed between horses, failed to rally. BOLD TREK , four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late response.
KING SHAWN prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened the final furlong. TEMPTING MOMENT saved ground on the turn and weakened.
BOONDOGGLE , wide on the turn, weakened. NATIVE COURAGE , along the inner rail early, was no factor. ZIP THE LIP raced along the inner rail and
weakened.

Footnotes
BOLD LEADER broke alertly then drafted back off the leaders in the opening three sixteenths, relaxed three wide off the duel leaving the far turn, was put to
some asking mid turn, circled three to four wide into the lane, closed in under left handed rousing while trying to lay in a bit, moved to command past the
eighth pole then drew clear while kept to task. BUST'EM KURT stumbled inward at the break, recovered and pulled his way to command while towards the
rail, dueled under rating leaving the far turn, shook clear under pressure past the quarter pole, could not resist the winner leaving mid stretch but kept on
well to the wire. SHAKE EM LOOSE disputed the pace outside BUST'EM KURT, raced on near even terms past the half mile marker, kept up to battle to the
head of the lane, stayed on willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. MONEY ROOM , forced in at the break, straightened and advanced towards the rail
nearing the five eighths marker, pursued under a ride while saving ground into the lane but came up empty. GENERAL'S DUTY , off the pace three wide,
circled four wide into the lane and faded. CANDY COOL , brushed inward at the break, raced off the pace while two wide, was under asking nearing the turn
but failed to respond.

Footnotes
TONED UP lacked speed, saved ground around the far turn, swung outside inside the eighth pole and was up late. DANCING TIL DUSK stalked the pace
racing near the inner rail, eased out to the three path leaving the far turn, bid for the lead between horses in deep stretch and missed. NO DOWN DAYS
stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path to take the lead entering the stretch and faltered in the drive. WICKED MERCURY ,
unhurried early, raced inside horses on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch, failed to rally and drifted in approaching the sixteenth pole. KITTEN WITH
A WHIP , caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. OIL ON CANVAS was never a factor.
DOUBLE FIREBALL , fractious going to the starting gate, sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered. SWEET TALKING GIRL
stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
LADNEEDSAHANDLER sped to the front, set a rated pace inside while handling some outside pressure, moved clear mid turn, responded and widened a
bit in upper stretch then was fully extended to hold sway. DESHACKLED , off the pace, dropped in leaving the far turn, angled four wide advancing into the
lane, straightened and closed well through the final furlong. CHAMBO rated inside, moved up mid turn, angled three wide nearing the lane, ranged up to
loom past the sixteenth pole but was out finished. POLITICAL DECISION dropped off the early pace while saving ground, angled four wide into the stretch,
offered a slight response but never posed a threat. LOST UNCLE rated off foes in the opening furlong, was under pressure mid turn and gave way. ONE
MORE FACTOR forced the early pace between rivals, chased two wide from the three eighths to upper stretch then gave way. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT
stumbled at the break, rushed up wide soon after, forced the pace three deep into the turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and faltered.

MORE ABUNDANCE stalked the pace racing in the two path around the turn, was put to the whip in upper stretch and closed determinedly between horses
under a hand ride, as his rider dropped his whip near the eighth pole. EXTRA MEDIUM , three wide around the turn in a striking position, closed nicely
outside the winner. CALL WIL , two wide prompting the pace around the turn, gained a short lead near the eighth pole and weakened late. BACKWOODS
BOOGIE lacked speed, raced well off the rail on the turn and rallied between horses. JAMMER , wide on the turn, floated to the six path turning for home,
raced outside horses and passed tired ones. BIG HAMBONE set a pressured pace near the inner rail and weakened in the drive. FLAT RATE , along the
inner rail around the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally. HARD FOUGHT saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, raced
between horses in the stretch and weakened. NO MORE TALK , four wide on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home and gave way. SMART

behind rivals near the far turn, eased out, progressed between runners from upper stretch past mid stretch, finished strong once clear in the final yards and
just failed to get up. KNOCKHOLT broke a step slow, edged up four wide into the first turn then settled within range, picked up momentum outside rivals and
under asking past the five sixteenths, ranged up past mid stretch then flattened out very late. TROUBLE COFFEE , between rivals early, steadied near the
five sixteenths, came well wide for the drive and churned on. MINT GAME , in tight at the break, regrouped and found a fairly forward spots while saving
ground, was stalled behind a rival near the five sixteenths, steadied when lacking room in mid stretch then kept on with some effort. SURVEY (IRE) stalked
three wide, advanced under a ride to take closest pursuit mid way on the final turn, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded. T MINUS TEN stalked
inside, eased out around the final turn, chased between rivals into the lane then came up empty. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN cleared early and dropped in to

Footnotes
CAPE LOOKOUT saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch, slipped through inside AIR ON FIRE to gain the lead late. AMEN
CORNER lacked speed, eased out approaching the stretch, was taken to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. AIR ON FIRE , right to the
early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted to the two path in upper stretch and weakened late. AWESOME BUZZ , checked in tight quarters along the
inner rail entering the turn, swung outside in the stretch and offered a mild gain. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) prompted the pace outside AIR ON FIRE and
gave way. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD circled the turn three wide and gave way. PER RULING #21-162 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION,
ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BEACON HILL , unhurried early while three to four wide, commenced a run leaving the three eighths marker, circled into the lane, closed in under left
handed asking, took over near mid stretch and drew away while kept to task. ROHRBACHER , away alertly, raced under a snug hold inside then checked
sharply entering the first turn, regrouped to rate close, eased out and gave chase past the five sixteenths, moved to slim lead in upper stretch, could not
contain the winner nearing the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. KING BUBBLE (IRE) rated off the pace while between rivals, dropped in to save
ground leaving the far turn, came back out past the five sixteenths and rallied mildly. SANDY LANE KITTEN broke a step slow, lost ground four wide past
the five eighths and had belated action. MOKHEEF settled well back while saving ground, swung five wide for the drive and rallied mildly. GUSSY MAC
(IRE) went clear soon after the break when eager to go, dropped in to set the pace, was joined entering the lane, stayed on past the furlong grounds then
gave way. PRETTY GOOD YEAR , off the pace while saving ground, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked a solid response. COMPASS ZONE
stalked the pace two wide, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
EMPTY NET set the pace along the inner rail and eagerly pulled away through the stretch while kept under encouragement. LOVE MY CAT , pinched back
leaving the starting gate, trailed to the stretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. MY DREAM GIRL lacked speed, circled the
far turn three wide, had a mild move into the stretch then failed to sustain the bid. MONSTER RISING , carried out entering the first turn, saved ground the
far turn and lacked a rally. EPHEMERAL , steadied in tight quarters approaching the first turn, stalked the pace and gave way in mid stretch. CHARLIV ,
inside horses down the backstretch, swung to the four path in upper stretch and came up empty. SUPERSTASIA hopped at the break, was carried wide
entering the first turn then failed to be a factor. TIPSY TOURIST bore out entering the first turn, chased the pace and gave way. PLAY CHARADES , carried
out entering the first turn, raced forwardly down the backstretch and weakened. PEACHY BETWEEN US was no factor.
