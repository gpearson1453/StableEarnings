PERFECTOMUNDO raced within contention, moved up on the outside around the turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. CYBER GUN
raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. SPIRIT SOUL lacked early speed,
made a steady gain and was outfinished for second. BREWSTER dueled for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout and weakened deep in the

Footnotes
BOSTON HONEY broke out, pressed the pace, saved ground and drove clear late. HONOR GIVEN raced within striking distance, came around the turn
three wide, made a wide bid and was a clear second. REBEL VISION lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. T W N
LETSGOGIRL raced near the back in the beginning, showed late interest, but was no factor. DANCER ON THE SAND sprinted to the front, drove clear,
saved ground around the turn and faded. SAVANNAH'S HERE pinched back at the start, raced in the middle of the field and weakened.
CLOUDYWITHACHANCE pressed the early pace and was finished early. LASTPRECIOUS D'ORO broke in, swerved out, raced green and was never a
threat. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
