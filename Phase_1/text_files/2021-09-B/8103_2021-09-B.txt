WAY OUT WEST was well back in the on the inside going into the turn came four wide entering the stretch and continued his bid on the outside through the
lane and was up in the final yards. JACK WITH SEVEN showed the best early speed took a big lead to the eighth pole but could not sustain in the final
yards. THETRAILERGUY was well off the pace along the inside came wide on the turn and was closing best on the far outside in the final sixteenth.
ROCKETRINGO chased the pace in the two path but gave way late. INTIMIDATING was up close in the two path entering the stretch but tired. OUTRUN
THE POSSE was up close in the three path but tired on the turn. LITTLE NO WAY was always well back and not a serious threat. MORNING SHADOW
was away a step slow to trail early on the inside and was never a serious threat.

HEAVY FAVOR showed good speed on the inside took command at the head of the stretch and was never seriously challenged through the lane. WILD
TONIGHT well back along the inside came to the two path and was moving well between foes through the stretch for second while never a threat to the
winner. GHOST SQUAD chased the pace on the inside angled out for the drive but could not make up the needed ground. BEHOLD DE FLAME was
quickest away from the gates but dropped back quickly settled off the pace but was five to six wide throughout and had little to offer in the stretch. BIG
TONY showed good arly speed in teh two path but gave way in the stretch. BACKCHATTER raced along the inside and had no response in the stetch.
MACHO ON DAX raced four to five wide on the turn and had nothing left for the stretch run.

KILBARRY LADY was not away as quick as some rivals but took command shortly after the break opened a clear lead and was never seriously challenged.
TOP OF THE PODIUM chased the frontrunner the entire trip but could never make headway on the winner. KURIOUS KENNEDY had an inside trip and
never mounted a rally in the stretch. MAGIC MOMENT raced mid pack throughout and made little headway in the stretch. WRINKLED ROSE raced in the
two path in good position but had no rally in the stretch. SASSY SAPPHIRE trailed along the inside and could not make up the needed ground. GOLD PASS
came out for the stretch drive but had little to offer. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT raced four to five wide throughout and dropped back through the stretch.
