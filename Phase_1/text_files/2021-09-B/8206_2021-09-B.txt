Footnotes
TAYET tracked the leaders along the inside, worked his way to the outside leaving the second turn, made a bold bid and took over near the three-sixteenths
pole, drifted in through the drive but maintained a clear advantage. MAKE ME LAUGH was away in good order, angled in to set the pace, relinquished the
lead before going a half, fought on doggedly through a long drive, altered out off of the fence when TAYET came in with a furlong to run, boxed on but
settled for the runner up spot. FORGOT PASSWORD was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, commenced a rally through the second turn, came
four wide and loomed a danger, but flattened in the final yards. RUN WITH GRACE was unhurried, lagged well back, came under a ride with three furlongs
to run, angled out into the lane and improved position. PALM COURT was close up off of the inside through the second turn and tired. EPICUREAN
hesitated slightly at the start, disputed the pace to the outside of MAKE ME LAUGH through the second turn, was collared between runners and came up
empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
ENRAGED jammed up between rivals for a tracking position early, settled off of the leader on the turn a bit, reengaged three wide into the stretch, struck the
front nearing the sixteenth pole and was inching away. STEELY DANZA sprinted clear to dictate terms, was challenged before going a quarter, opened
clear again on the turn, was collared inside the furlong marker and grudgingly gave in. OUT WORK'N was unhurried off of the inside, got through toward the
inside entering the stretch and toiled on to earn the minor award. BARKMAN lagged at the tail of the field and failed to threaten. INCITATUS prompted the
pace three deep, drifted out a bit further leaving the turn, came up empty entering the lane and retreated.

DREAM ON IT was forwardly placed along the inside, angled out four wide to launch a bold bid, took over nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened clear
and maintained a safe advantage. JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL settled saving ground, moved up swiftly through the turn, angled out entering the lane and
loomed a danger but flattened and settled for the runner up spot. A WISH FOR TRISH sped clear to set the pace, was headed entering the stretch, gave
way but had enough left to hold the show. SODDY DAISY came away a step slow, settled off of the inside, was fanned four wide leaving the turn and failed
to threaten. DRESSEDTOIMPRESS broke slow, lagged well back and was never a factor. BRASH was close up three wide, came up on the turn and
dropped out.

ABSOLUTE LOVE tracked three deep, moved up to engage the leaders leaving the turn, fought on through a long drive with GIANNA'S GIFT and was fully
extended to shake off that one late. GIANNA'S GIFT dueled outside with INDIAN BELLA through the turn, dug in to meet the bid of ABSOLUTE LOVE
entering the stretch, battled hard but was unable to resist. INDIAN BELLA dueled along the inside, weakened entering the stretch, but churned on to
maintain the minor award. SOCIAL CIRCLE broke a step slow, settled saving ground, moved up through the turn to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the
drive. KASSERINE PASS was forwardly placed along the inside, angled out and loomed a danger entering the stretch, but came up empty in the final
furlong and faded. MY WYNTER ROSE failed to respond. BOW MAKER came away slow and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MR CREED settled saving ground, began his advance through the second turn along the inside, got through into the stretch, shifted out near the
three-sixteenths pole, quickened once uncovered, reeled in the leaders and edged clear. SPEND AGAIN disputed the pace along the inside, fought on
through a long drive, but was unable to go on with the winner late. BELLINGER contested the pace outside, weakened slightly during the drive, but had
enough left to hold the show. TIZABIGMICK settled saving ground, ranged into contention on the second turn, came five wide and improved position. BET
stalked the pace three wide, but lacked a response when called upon. CRAZY GENIUS was forwardly placed toward the inside through the second turn and
tired. HERO DRAGON was never a factor. KENDALL SQUARE was allowed to settle, ranged into contention on the backstretch, but came up empty on the
second turn and dropped out.

FAMILY TIME sent clear to dictate terms, repelled every challenge and gamely led throughout. GLAMOUR GIRL settled saving ground, commenced her
advance through the second turn, slipped through tight quarters nearing the furlong marker, tipped out but was no match for the winner. BLUSHABLE was
close up three deep, took her run at FAMILY TIME leaving the second turn, but flattened in the drive and gave way. SHE'S FOREVER attended the pace
along the inside, but came up empty after six furlongs and faded. POINT WILD was allowed to settle three wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TIZPLENTY contested the pace to the outside of GORMAN through the turn, forged command with three-sixteenths to run, shook clear, was kept to task
and held sway. MOLLIE KATE tracked three deep, loomed large entering the stretch despite drifted out a bit further while on the wrong lead, swapped late
but was no match. CALIFORNIA ANGEL was fractious in the gate, came away a bit slow, settled saving ground, got through entering the stretch, split rivals
a furlong out and was up in time to earn the show. SOL DORADO was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, but failed to make
headway. GORMAN disputed the pace along the inside, was headed entering the stretch and gave way. CRIMSON ROSE was hung wide and failed to
threaten. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR was allowed to settle between horses and failed to respond. SWEET N SASSY was hustled along four wide for a half
and faltered. MERCURY HEAD saved ground to no avail. QUEENS UP showed little. SMILE AT THE STORM was never a factor.

Footnotes
B MAKER opened clear to control the tempo, settled into the stretch in command, dug in and gamely led throughout. ROAD BIBLE was close up three deep,
took dead aim entering the stretch, fought on but was unable to best the determined winner. HEX settled in hand, moved up four wide to make his bid, but
lacked the needed late response. CANT STOP THIS MAN settled off of the inside, came four wide but failed to make headway. BASSETT was unhurried,
looped into the lane four wide and improved position. THUNDER AHEAD was forwardly placed through the turn and tired. AL MILLON BOB tracked
between rivals to the stretch and faded. SONIC BURN showed little.
