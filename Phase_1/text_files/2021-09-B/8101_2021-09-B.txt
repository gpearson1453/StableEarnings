Footnotes
DERBY INCLUDED pressed early, rallied in the stretch and prevailed under left handed urging. SAMURAI WAY was well placed early on the inside, rallied
in the stretch and drew close, could not get past the winner but was second best.. DYNAMITE CLOUD was never far back, rallied in mid stretch three wide
and drew close, needed more late. FLAT OUT OF CREDIT never far back, lacked a late response. BRILLIANTBENNY allowed to settle, failed to menace.
NOT QUITE WRIGHT set the pace until the stretch and came up empty.
