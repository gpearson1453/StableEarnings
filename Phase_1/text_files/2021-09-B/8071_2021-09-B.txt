VERRAZANO VITTORIA vied inside through the turn then drew away under confident handling. ATLANTIC AVENUE made a menacing three wide move on
the turn then proved no match for the winner. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR rushed to contention inside, faded on the turn then came again. HARBOUR WAY
forced the pace outside, led briefly then weakened. CHANCEE chased wide and was never a factor. LUNA AZTECA lacked speed and was never in
contention. TIZ A DATE broke a bit awkwardly and trailed throughout.

MOUNTAIN TREE trailed early, circled his field on the turn, accelerated and drew away in the final furlong. EXPLAIN saved ground off the pace inside and
finished willingly. DR ZRADA rushed to contention outside and bid wide into the stretch. SAPONARA saved ground close up and faded on the turn.
AMERICAN QUALITY dueled for the advantage, moved clear then fell late while tiring. REGAL RUN forced the pace outside to the stretch, injured his left
front leg near the head of the stretch, was eased and vanned off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incidents in the stretch.

HOLIDAY RAID stalked the pacesetter, vied through the final turn then pulled away while kept to her task. SKY QUEEN bumped into the first turn, chased
inside, angled out and was just up for the place. LA ALTENITA settled close up outside, vied on the final turn, raced an erratic course through the stretch
costing the place. REACH FOR THESTARS was in tight and bumped into the first turn, moved wide in the stretch and was no threat. TIME SENSITIVE
moved clear inside then stopped after five furlongs. CAPE ELIZABETH dropped back early and was always outrun. EVERYBODY'S PAL was three wide
early then finished after half a mile. WANNA BE REGAL was squeezed back after the start and trailed throughout. An objection by the fourth finisher against
the second finisher for interference into the first turn was denied.

START MEEE saved ground off the pace, angled out advancing at the quarter pole, drifted in and outfinished foe in the final furlong. ALFATEI broke poorly
causing his rider to lose iron briefly, saved ground, loomed a stretch threat but was second best. MR. DODA dropped back wide then finished willingly for
the show. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF set pressured pace inside, moved clear on the turn but weakened in the stretch. SCREEN SAVER fractious in gate just
before start, trailed and was no factor. LITTLE HARBOUR prompted the pace outside then stopped on the turn. ANANROAD forced the pace for half a mile
and stopped.

match late. DOLLARIZATION broke sluggishly, angled wide after the quarter then flattened out. ELEAZAR was urged just off the pacesetter between rivals
and gave way. JUST A THOUGHT hustled within range four wide and stopped abruptly.

FINEST WORK bore out into the first turn, moved extremely wide in the stretch but surged and rallied clear. CAJOLE dropped well behind, angled out in the
stretch and closed well. SISI trailed for half mile inside, swung wide into the stretch rallying late. EIGHT DANZAS settled outside then went evenly through
the final furlong. R GIRL FAITH saved ground, was blocked and taken up at the top of the stretch and failed to recover. PRINCESS RUNAWAY rated
outside off the pace then proved empty in the stretch. VENEZUELAN TALENT raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and faltered. NYSSA sprinted away
soon after the start then gave way in the stretch. Due to a timing issue the six furlong fraction was omitted.

ARRIVEDERCI vied outside duo to the stretch then pulled away through the stretch driving. SON OF A SAINT vied three wide, held a narrow lead at the
quarter pole but was no match late. LUXURY SUITE dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. BOB'S MY UNCLE settled close up inside
then began fading on the final turn. MY MAN ELVIS was urged off the leaders inside and continued well while no threat. OLDFASHIONED CLUB vied
between rivals into the stretch and proved empty. ESPRESSO CALIENTE chased three wide and weakened steadily. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY trailed
early and raced far behind throughout. KING'S GOLD lacked speed and gave way readily.

DIAL TO WIN saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch and edged clear through the final furlong. MUNDLE OF JOY set a clear pace, drifted out in the
stretch but continued gamely to the finish. STAND BY YOU lacked speed inside then rallied through the stretch too late. SHINING COLORS prompted the
pace outside for half a mile and faltered. INCOMPARABLE dropped back outside and was never in contention. B B'S ROCKET stumbled at the start, bid
wide on the turn and gave way.

and flattened out in the stretch. TOMATER GATOR urged close up early and weakened steadily. SILVER FURY dropped back after the start and lacked a
rally. ABDAA raced far behind throughout. SILVER DAGGER forced the pace outside, injured his left front near the eighth pole, was eased and vanned off.
