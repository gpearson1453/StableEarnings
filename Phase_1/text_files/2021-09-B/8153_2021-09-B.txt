Footnotes
ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL pressed the pace of COASTAL SWEETIE while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a quarter to run, opened a clear
lead into the lane and was fully extended to hold off the closing MO SUGAFOOT. MO SUGAFOOT was bumped at the break, raced unhurried early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and finished with good energy. COASTAL SWEETIE was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside and
gave way to the winner after going a half. JAN'S BEST settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. SKY'S
THE LIMIT showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ROYAL DANIELLE was fractious in the gate, pressed the
pace while racing three-wide for the opening quarter and weakened. BEAZEE BOLT showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
TRIBAL IMPACT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and was up in the final jump. TUNE TO WIN pressed the
pace of the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take a brief lead with a furlong to run and just failed to last. AZEE RULES hopped at the
start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. TRASK settled off the leaders early, was carried
out through the second turn and finished willingly when straightened away. SIR LAUGHALOT disputed the pace from between foes and weakened after
going five furlongs. MUSKET POWDER raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a
bid. DUSALUT dueled for the lead from the inside for five-eighths and weakened.

Footnotes
AWESOME IMAGE was pinched back at the start, raced unhurried early, circled the field while racing five-wide, gained command with a furlong to run and
quickly drew off. TADEO lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was up for the place. TORCH disputed the pace from the inside
for a half and gave way. BOY HOWDY pressed the pace while racing five-wide, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain. MY PERFECT
GRAYDAR settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE checked nearing
the three-eighths marker, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. CAPES HOT ROCKET dueled for the lead while racing three-wide
and weakened after going a half.
