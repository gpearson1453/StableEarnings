Footnotes
BALLERINI showed early speed, drove clear, pulled away down the stretch and won handily. BABY IT'S YOU lacked early speed, made a steady gain,
proved no match for the winner, but was just up for second. FURKA PASS challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was caught for
second. KANCANCUTIE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. LITESTER bumped start, pressed the pace, raced outside around the
turn and faded. COME ON BIRDIE bumped at the start, raced within striking distance and faded. SUMMER TSUNAMI broke out, raced in the rear in the
beginning and was never close. STORMY SPOTS lacked early speed and was never a factor. ABIGAILS TAKEOVER always raced near the back and was
outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
