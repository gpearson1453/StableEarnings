Footnotes
BEER CHASER sped to the lead after initial strides, set the pace and held firm around the turn, went two to three wide into the lane, came under right
handed pressure, had plenty left in reserve and remained clear. WHEREVER HE IS tracked in range near the inside, launched a three wide bid into the
lane, was solid in response but could not reach the winner and had to settle for second best. BUBBA'S QUEST raced off the early pace, went wide into the
lane and cleared show. CHICAGO CHROME raced three wide in contention then weakened in the drive. PRINCE OF EARL lacked speed and saved
ground to no avail. EOS ANIMATIONS chased up close two wide through early stages then came up empty.

FIVE O ONE stumbled at the start and dropped back to last, was allowed to settle through early stages then began to pick up the pace midway around the
turn, responded willingly when called upon in the upper stretch, split foes in the final sixteenth and finished clear. BOURBON COWBOY headed in pursuit
midway around the turn, raced three wide in striking distance at the furlong marker, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch but sustained response for
second best. MR. ANKENY set the pace and held clear around the turn, remained on top in the final furlong then got worn down in the late stretch. COROT
raced two wide in close contention around the turn, sustained a three wide bid to the final furlong then flattened out. WENYEN raced up close in the opening
quarter then failed to keep pace and dropped back.

BAYLEYWICK dueled outside of REBEL RISING around the first turn and through the backstretch, shook free near the five-sixteenths pole, hustled along
three wide into the lane, stayed sharp under pressure and remained clear. TAPTHATLUCK stalked the embattled pair through the backstretch, launched a
bid for command past the quarter pole, sustained a steady two wide bid for the winner through the lane and secured second best. BUG A BOO raced off the
second flight through middle stages, circled four wide into close contention at the quarter pole, stayed on with response into the lane and stayed on for a
share. ANGEL'S MELODY was unhurried, swung five wide into the lane and failed to threaten the top trio. PAPA'S SECRET raced in the last flight, was
ridden along three wide into the lane and never menaced. PEGGY RULES raced outside of foe in the second flight, was ridden along three wide between
foes at the quarter pole then came up empty. REBEL RISING dueled with the winner around the first turn and through the backstretch, could not maintain
equal terms past the five sixteenths pole and faded.

TIME GOES ON dueled for the lead in the opening quarter and battled on outside of SHIP BOSS into the stretch, shook free to a slim margin at the eighth
pole then kept clear under steady pressure. RED WHITE AND LOUD was away on good order then weakened off the early speed, swung five wide into
lane, rallied and captured place. SHIP BOSS dueled in the opening quarter, batted on into the lane, could not move on with the leader then got caught for
place. LOCH GARMAN trailed through early stages, saved ground and improved along the rail. VALLA raced off the top pair, launched a three wide bid at
the quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. KNIGHT COMMANDER chased the pace and weakened leaving the turn. TRUE SAINT chased the pace then
faded.

Footnotes
CARPE VICTORIAM rated off the early pace, picked up the pace with three furlongs left to run, gained the advantage late on the turn then stayed on three
wide through the lane and held firm. SIR BRAHMS tracked the top flight through the backstretch,, was ridden along three wide around the far turn, sustained
bid through the lane and gained place. LOUD N PROUD pressed the early pace, dueled around the turn then stayed on with response for a share. IOWA
NATIVE set a pressured pace, dueled around the final turn then gave way in the lane. ROCK CITY ROADHOG was unhurried, hustled up three wide into
the lane and lacked a needed rally. BIG HEARTED FACTOR raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. GALACTICA raced in
the second flight and had no response when called upon on the final turn. SILVER MAKER raced off the pace and never menaced.
MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE raced in back throughout.
