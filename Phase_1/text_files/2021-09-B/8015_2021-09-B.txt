CANDY CARLOS led narrowly inside, alternated for the lead and held on tenaciously in a tight finish. LECTRIC CHOKE settled behind a wall of pacesetters,
angled out advancing on the final turn and made a gradual gain. MUCHO MAS GRANDE dueled between rivals, faded on the final turn then came again in a
sharp effort. CHARLIE THE GREEK forced the pace three wide, battled with the winner and continued gamely while tiring slightly. PEPPI THE HUNTER
dropped back early and trailed throughout. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.

LAUGHIN' PLACE close inside, angled out into the far turn, took over midway on the turn then held rival safe through the stretch. BE BOP A LOLA saved
ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. DANESSA BABY was taken up soon after the start, dropped far back then
advanced very wide. BEST CAUSE chased wide, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened out. BABY CLOUD lacked speed in the two path, steadied on
the turn and was no menace. BOBBIES quickly sprinted clear then stopped abruptly midway on the turn.

Footnotes
CHIEF ALPHA rated inside, angled out near the quarter pole, lost his whip in early stretch and drew off in a decisive score. AWESUMMER took control
early, was collared nearing the stretch then ducked into the gap briefly while tiring. HODLER prompted the leader outside then proved empty in the stretch.
GALILEE angled out into the first turn, chased outside and flattened out. DON CICCIO was reserved off the pace three wide and faltered. DON'T THROW
STONES lacked speed and was never in contention. FULGURANT lost contact with his field on the backstretch and was eased. CHERRYS CROSS was
ordered a late scratch during the warm-up on the advice of the track veterinarian.

PERSISTO reserved inside, angled out on the final turn, hooked the leader and edged clear late following a long drive. DECOUPAGE angled inside setting
the pace, was collared on the final turn but continued very gamely to the finish. CHICK'S SHADOW fanned wide into the first turn, bid extremely wide into
the stretch rallying. BREVIARY settled off the pace, faded on the final turn then came again while no threat. CONGRATSROSY dropped back between
rivals and failed to menace. ALL GOOD TIMES forced the pace outside to midway on the final turn and faltered.

HIGH PRINT between foes into the first turn, advanced on the final turn and edged away through the stretch driving. ESTILO VARONIL settled inside,
moved to contention on the final turn loomed dangerous but was outfinished. MAGIC WIZARD angled out advancing in the stretch then went evenly late.
SAM IN STYLE dropped to back of field then passed rivals wide in the stretch. SPANISH SEA broke a step slow, bid wide into the far turn then proved
empty through the stretch. BIG EASY EMPIRE lacked speed outside, was asked for run on the final turn but had no response. MANGO MAN extremely
wide into the first turn, rushed to the front then stopped. FREUD WIND led inside briefly then began fading badly into the far turn.

Footnotes
KATHERN'S JOY vied for the lead in the two path, alternated for the advantage, was challenged again from his inside in the stretch and held on gamely.
COMBATING settled well back, advanced inside, challenged the winner but was outfinished. SUNNY SAINT vied for the lead outside, battled to the stretch
then weakened. ROGUE RAGE made a menacing outside bid on the final turn, swung very wide into the stretch. ANGEL'S ENTRY squeezed back early,
saved ground and lacked a rally. NOTHIN REALLY chased four wide and gave way readily. CHUBSTER was hustled to the front before a quarter mile then
stopped abruptly into the far turn..
