Footnotes
OK HONEY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside just off the duel up front, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to collar the embattled pair a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish kept to task. BUSTIN BAY dueled three then two wide
with EXTRA EFFORT to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head coming
under threat a furlong out, got overtaken a sixteenth from home, ran on to preserve the place honors. EXTRA EFFORT coaxed from the gate, dueled from
the two path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive having dueled herself in tandem with BUSTIN BAY into submission and was displaced near the sixteenth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. COVER PHOTO hustled from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped three wide near the three-eighths placed to urging,
swung four wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
LANDSLID chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, drafted behind the leader passing the five-sixteenths, was roused three wide into upper stretch then
made a bid on the outside under the crop, took the advantage inside the furlong marker and drew clear under strong urging. CHARLOTTESOMETIMES
displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was given her cue turning into upper stretch
then came under the crop, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while clear for the place. MOSTLY HARMLESS
chased the pace on the inside, checked sharply while crowded against the rail inside the five-eighths and dropped back significantly, saved ground under
urging on the turn, moved out in the stretch and finished willingly for the show. CEE ARE EM was hustled from the start then urged along in fourth position,
chased in two path early on the turn then shifted four wide, was driven five wide into upper stretch and weakened. PURRFECT MISTRESS was urged along
off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. LONDON GOLD was taken up early then urged along at the rear, moved from three to five
wide on the turn and was no factor. FROSTED WILD RIDE chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was carried four wide into upper
stretch, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead and tired. EXCHANGE ROAD was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back five wide on the
turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch under the crop and came up empty.

Footnotes
TIERGAN five paths off the inside at the tail of the compact field, went four wide into the turn before tipping back out five wide placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, got floated seven wide into upper stretch outside the top pair, dug in under a drive latched on through the length of the stretch and was up in
the final jumps to the finish kept to task. THREE JOKERS prompted CITY MAN from the outside in the four path, tucked briefly three wide as the leader
went to the two path through the turn and was briefly shaken off from being latched on midway before advancing once more under coaxing from the
three-eighths, got floated out six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between rivals taking narrow command just inside the eighth pole, dug in
under threat to the outside and was nailed in the final strides. CITY MAN lightly coaxed from the gate when away last, ranged up inside to take command
after the start and showed the way in hand three paths off the rail through sensible splits under the watchful eye of THREE JOKERS to the outside, tucked
briefly to the two path into the turn, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, shaking away briefly floated back three wide at the three-eighths,
came under growing pressure inside the five-sixteenths, floated out five wide into upper stretch carrying his rivals six and seven wide respectively, dug in
under threat and capitulated just inside the eighth pole, then got shaken off in the late stages.

MO MISCHIEF showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and proved
much the best under steady urging. RICKYS REVENGE was well positioned just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, chased the winner in
the stretch and was second best. FLIPPING FUN was well placed on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and lacked
the needed response while well clear for the show. YAH HUH moved up on the outside under urging, chased four wide on the turn and tired. D'VINICRIS
settled off the early pace then was ridden along passing the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths in hand then dropped back
and failed to respond then had the rider lose his whip approaching the finish. KISSES FOR VAL pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader
near the half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came under the crop into upper stretch then dropped back
while remaining on his inside lead and tired. ALITE settled just off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn and came up empty. BATTLE MAP settled on
the outside, was urged six wide on the turn and had nothing left. GREAT GRAND SON was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went four wide on

JUDGE DAVIS was well placed in third position, went five then four wide on the turn, made a bid before the five-sixteenths, took over into upper stretch,
fought outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. FROMANOTHAMUTHA showed good speed, set the early pace,
lost the lead inside the three-quarter pole then pressed on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, regained the lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner into upper stretch, fought on well inside that foe in the final furlong but missed while clear for the place. MISBEHAVED moved out
early then settled on the outside, was caught six wide early on the turn, dropped to the four path around the three-eighths, was driven five wide into the
stretch and finished willingly for the show. UNBRIDLED BOMBER broke in at the start, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came
three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. CONCLUSIVE settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn,
turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. VODKA MARDINI raced just behind the early leader, took the advantage inside the three-quarter
pole, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed while being asked coming to the five-sixteenths and tired. ST. LUKES settled on the outside, was urged five
wide on the turn and had nothing left. IMMOKALEE settled on the inside, was roused along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered
then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

PRINCE OF PHAROAHS four then three wide just off the duel, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch taking over
command, dug in under a drive drifting out when edging away, got corrected a sixteenth from home and held safe to prevail. WATER'S EDGE broke through
the gate prior to the start inspiring BARRAGE to do the same and was reloaded, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four to five wide for home, dug in under a drive rallying to latch on the aforementioned foe inside the final sixteenth but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish.
BARRAGE dueled three then two wide with SARATOGA FLASH to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took narrow command inside
that station, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and was displaced from the front, weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest for the
show honors. SARATOGA FLASH got bumped at the start by HORN OF PLENTY, who broke inwards, came under hustling and advanced to duel with
BARRAGE along his inside in the two path, tucked inside through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, got headed inside the five-sixteenths,

Footnotes
CLASSY EDITION was urged along early then settled on the outside, came back under urging while three then four wide on the turn, rallied outside to take
the lead into the stretch, drifted in while moving clear inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady handling. VELVET SISTER was coaxed along
just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and proved no match while well clear
for the place. SHESAWILDJOKER pressed the pace while loosely between foes, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked around the five-sixteenths,
turned into the stretch between horses, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and tired but held the show. ADVERSITY went to the front, set the pace
under pressure to her outside, was asked along the rail on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch and tired. NOVEMBER REIN stalked the pace on the
outside then three wide on the turn, was asked between foes at the quarter-pole, dropped back past the three-sixteenths, drifted out near the furlong marker
and faltered badly then was placed under a protective hold to the wire. OUR TINY DANCER was urged along while dropped well behind, raced inside to the
two path on the turn and showed little.
