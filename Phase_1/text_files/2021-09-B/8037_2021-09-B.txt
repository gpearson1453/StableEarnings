Footnotes
GUNNER PAUL was off a beat slowly, hugged the fence while rating well off of the pace around the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane to pass a rival,
then sustained a rally to drive past outer foes passing the furlong grounds, and drew clear. WINDCRACKER tracked from off of the pace in the three path
around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and rallied outside of foes in the final furlong to claim place in the late stages. ABDAN vied along the
inside, dug in while shifting to the three path to meet LEND IT TEWMEY's bid entering the lane, vied inside of that foe to the furlong grounds, but began to
wander about while tiring approaching that marker, go headed leaving that junction by an outer foe, then lost place in the final sixteenth. SOUTHERNER
saved ground off of the pace, but was outmoved by the eventual winner in upper stretch, kept on thereafter to attempt a rail bid for minor rewards, but failed
to menace. MO HEAT tracked along the inside, advanced into the turn before attempting a two wide bid between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but
failed to keep pace with those foes turning for home, shifted four wide entering the lane, but greenly delayed his lead change to inside the three sixteenths
pole, then only managed to chase the leaders home. LEND IT TEWMEY stalked four wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, briefly forged an
advantage in upper stretch, but faltered approaching the furlong pole, and weakened. ROUSING SIREN was off slowly and got outrun. PELOTA rushed
while tugging in the bit after a furlong to press two wide and between horses, shifted outside of those foes into the turn, but was outmoved by an outer foe at
the five sixteenths pole, and steadily faded thereafter. DINNER BELL rushed between horses leaving the chute to vie for the lead three wide, shifted two
wide into the turn, but weakened between horses passing the three furlong pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out around the turn to produce a four wide sweep past leading foes entering the
lane, drew clear in upper stretch, met a pair of bids on both sides a sixteenth from home, but held safely. DUPLICITOUS stalked along the inside, took the
turn in the two path, got outmoved by outer foes turning for home before committing to a rail charge in upper stretch, produced a decent kick to grind away
at the leader's advantage passing the furlong grounds, bid inside of that foe at the sixteenth pole, but was denied. TOWN BEAUTY broke slowly, recovered
to track the pace two wide from the three path around the turn, but was outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, encountered mild traffic entering
the lane as CONNIE K drifted into her path, altered course five wide and outside of foes in upper stretch, rallied to attempt a bid a sixteenth from home, but
flattened out late. MISS IS ZIPPY broke a step slowly and trailed the field around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and improved late.
ANTHROPOLOGY broke through the gate pre-race, set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, but proved no match for a bidding foe in upper stretch, then
faded passing the furlong grounds. CONNIE K prompted the pace three wide, drifted to the four path entering the lane while getting outmoved by an outer
foe, then weakened through the final furlong. BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
RAIN CHECK stalked two wide, shifted to the five path for clear sailing in upper stretch, produced a good kick when called upon approaching midstretch, bid
for the lead a sixteenth out, and drove clear. GIN N SIN bumped an outer foe at the start, vied two wide, then from between horses around the turn after
outer foes made bids, gamely clung to an advantage from those rivals through upper stretch, led passing the furlong grounds, but had little résistance for an
outer rallying rival at the sixteenth pole, and held place. COCO PUFF stalked three wide, made an early bid for the lead between horses at the three furlong
pole as LA BOMBONERA forced her hand, vied turning for home and through upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong, got outkicked by an outer foe at the
sixteenth pole, and saved show. OUT DANCING tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a rival entering the lane, shifted to the four path in
upper stretch, altered course out from behind traffic in midstretch to be six wide at the furlong marker, and rallied late, but missed reaching show. LA
BOMBONERA bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, produced an early bid for the lead into the turn, vied turning for home, but flattened out in
upper stretch, and tired through the final furlong. OFF THE CHARTS was off slowly after brushing the gate, settled off of the pace three wide into the turn,
swung six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. FULL FOCUS lied off of the pace along the inside early on, tugged forward to encounter mild traffic
passing the five furlong marker, faltered inside of a stopping rival into the turn, then saved ground around that bend, but lacked a true re-rally along the rail
through the lane. CANCEL THIS vied along the inside of a trio of foes into the turn, but weakened entering the lane. SURPRISING took bumps from rivals
on both sides at the start, lied far off of the pace four wide around the turn, and never got involved. START CLASS got outrun. SUMMER AUTUMN ROSE
was done early.

TOWN AVENGER lied off of the pace early on, commenced an advance by progressing three wide and between horses into the turn, steadily rallied to bid
for the lead turning for home, swiftly cleared passing the furlong pole, widened through the lane, and was geared down through the final sixteenth.
TRUMPET LILLY dueled for the lead two wide, but offered little resistance to an outer bidding foe entering the lane, and held place thereafter. STOP
SHOPPIN TAMMY settled far off of the pace two wide into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and stayed on through the final furlong, but failed to
reach place. LADY TRAVELER dueled for the lead inside of TRUMPET LILLY, but proved no match for a bidding foe entering the lane, and tired.
TELLMEONASUNDAY prompted the pace three wide, backed off to stalk approaching the half mile pole, but was outmoved by an inner foe at the five
sixteenths pole, then chased through the lane without bidding. ROC'S PRINCESS got caught five wide around the turn while off of the pace, and failed to
factor. MY MY MUNNY tracked four wide, but tired turning for home. THIRTEEN STRIPES bumped an inner foe at the start, came under a drive while at the
rear of the field leaving the chute, and was outrun thereafter. GYPSY TOUCH saved ground while tracking the pace, but faded turning for home, and was
eased through the lane. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, but was through after a half mile,
stopped turning for home, was eased through the lane, distanced, and walked off

three sixteenths pole, and widened under vigorous hand urging. PRINCESS LEA settled off fo the pace two wide, split foes three wide at the five sixteenths
pole to claim place, then held that position to the wire. STREET MISSY lied far off of the pace, shifted to the three path down the backstretch, gained ground
five wide turning for home, but only managed to chase through the lane. LEMON'S MEDAGLIA settled far off of the pace two wide, shifted inwards for clear
rail racing room in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. VIVA LA RED trailed, took the far turn in the four path, and improved. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX
tracked three wide, gained four wide around the far turn to bid for place at the five sixteenths pole, but faltered entering the lane. MOONCHILD tracked
along the inside, but faded around the far turn. THE GIRLS stalked two wide, but weakened turning for home.
