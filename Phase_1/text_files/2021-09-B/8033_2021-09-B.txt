SHUGS CHARLIE switched off the inside heading to the turn, went four wide on that bend, shifted in once in upper stretch then altered outside the
weakening leader, drove past. AUTUMN TOUCH settled at the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, ran on to get up for
place. IZE A CRAFTY GAL was forwardly-positioned early, forced in by a rival, switched outside that one then was carried out a bit late up the backstretch,
moved to the lead at that juncture, widened in the two path on the turn, drifted five wide turning for home then came in once in upper stretch and weakened.
RANEEM was bumped at the break, switched outside a foe and was brushed by that one late up the backstretch, went six to seven wide on the turn, had to
alter outside the same foe in late stretch. MINE ME brushed a foe leaving the backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn drifting seven deep turning for
home, drifted in a bit in late stretch. WHO'S ASKING bumped a rival at the break, pulled to the lead while shifting in, drift out late up the backstretch then

EFFORT N RESULTS was forwardly-positioned between rivals three wide early, eased back off the leaders, moved three wide on the far turn to challenge
taking a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was clear in upper stretch, held under steady handling. TRUST N PRAYER angled in from four to two wide on the
first turn racing outside a rival at the back, came out heading up the backstretch, advanced outside foes five then six wide floating seven or eight deep into
upper stretch, gained late. SPINNING BLACK was reluctant to load, angled in and settled at the back heading into the first turn, raced on or just off the rail
trailing the field through the turns, came out in upper stretch, gained but too late. NEXT AFFAIR eased back and shifted in early on the first turn moving in
from five to three wide on that bend, stalked mid-pack before advance three to four wide on the far turn, split rivals in upper stretch, loomed a threat but was
outkicked. ON A WARPATH was forced six then five wide on the first turn, chased up the backstretch, went four to five wide on the far turn, failed to rally in
the stretch. WEST DAWN pursued the leader four then three wide early, moved forward to prompt the issue up the backstretch, contended between rivals
on the far turn then weakened. SEA EMPEROR set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was pressured up the backstretch into the far turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
BELLA DONA exchanged a light bump at the start, dueled inside a rival up the backstretch, edged away on the turn, came off the inside turning for home
and extended the margin in upper stretch, held sway while being kept to the task. ACTION JUNKY stalked the leaders from outside, went three to four wide
on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch, loomed a threat but could make no headway on the winner. READS PET ZENON settled in the back half of
the field, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, got up for show inside WHERES BRAYDEN, who dueled outside the winner, went two to three wide
on the turn, dropped back five wide in the stretch. I'VE GOT IT exchanged a bump at the break, tracked up close inside early, went two to four wide on the
turn swinging seven deep into upper stretch, failed to rally. MARK'S WARRIOR lacked early speed, went five wide on the turn, came in through late stretch
and improved. LONZO WHO chased mid-pack, went three to five wide on the turn, swung eight deep into upper stretch, came up empty. EMMYS SILVER
shifted in to go three wide racing off the leaders into the turn, was outpaced and not a threat. FABSTRACTION stumbled badly at the start almost unseating
the rider, appeared a bit rank in behind rivals early, moved nearer the rail, saved ground on the turn and failed to menace. Due to a timer malfunction the
five furlong time was omitted.
