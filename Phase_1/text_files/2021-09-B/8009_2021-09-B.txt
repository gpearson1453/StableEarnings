Footnotes
MCTHANKS stalked the early pace three wide, moved to challenge from between rivals up the backstretch, took the lead on the far turn still three wide and
between runners, came out a path leaving that bend then lugged in once in upper stretch, kicked clear and held safe. ESTEEMED settled mid-pack off the
leaders two wide, began to advance on the far turn moving out from three to six wide, swung eight deep turning for home, was gaining but too late.
BASHFUL BOB was unhurried early content to trail mostly two to three wide, swung five wide into upper stretch and gained show honors. AZTEC
EMPEROR hesitated at the start, saved ground inside on the turns coming out three wide past the quarter pole, moved back in once in upper stretch and
ran on evenly. JEDI WARRIOR settled off the inside going three to four wide early, advanced four to five wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick.
LIL LATIGO stalked from outside, took closer order up the backstretch making a mild bid on the far turn, travelled four to five wide throughout and came up
empty. INDIAN H WHO moved clear early to dictate terms one path removed from the rail, faced outside pressure into the far turn still just off the rail, gave
way.

CANOODLING stumbled at the start, stalked the leader, asked for more past the five-sixteenths already having reached striking distance, took a narrow
lead about the three-sixteenths then drew clear under steady handling. SHANGHAI KEELY steadied just slightly at the break then was urged forward to set
the pace, went in the two path through the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and no match. ZAMARA settled off the leaders, saved ground on the turn,
came out and bumped with a rival in upper stretch, ran on. BRAVE CINDERELLA switched out and settled off the leaders, went two to three wide on the
turn coming four wide into upper stretch, was carried out and bumped then exchanged another bump with a foe and lacked a rally. FLYING TO THE LINE
stalked the leaders going four wide on the turn, came up empty. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BRAVE CINDERELLA AGAINST
ZAMARA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND THE FORMER. PER
RULING #2022-SUN-11 FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, BRAVE CINDERELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE
TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
YUKIO prompted the early pace, moved clear three wide on the turn, drifted to the five path turning for home, held under moderate urging. GROOVY HUEY
vied briefly inside, continued to pursue on or just off the rail through the turn, kept on in the lane, made no headway on the winner but held the place.
CREATIVE BID settled last but one, moved out from four to seven wide on the turn, swung nine wide into upper stretch, drifted in just a bit at that juncture,
gained belatedly. ROCKS A BLACK SUIT broke just a step slowly, soon angled in while unhurried at the rear, saved ground through much of the turn,
swung three wide into upper stretch, shifted in for room, found none so abruptly angled back out, gained belatedly. BRIAR was bumped several times
between rivals midway up the backstretch, dropped back two to three wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to improve position. THE MET broke outwardly,
was getting in and bumping a rival midway up the backstretch and forced to steady, went three to four wide on the turn swinging out seven wide, steadied
again in upper stretch when in tight. IT'S A GIRL bumped a rival a couple times heading up the backstretch, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn,
had no rally. JOKERIN broke on top but was quickly outpaced, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to threaten. LAUGHING STORM was reluctant to
load, steadied slightly at the break, came out soon thereafter, went four to six wide on the turn and wider into upper stretch, shifted in then altered back out
in upper stretch and was not a threat.

RESTRAINEDVENGENCE shifted in to stalk three wide in behind the leaders, advanced between rivals leaving the backstretch, dueled on the far turn,
edged clear in upper stretch, just held. TENFOLD broke inwardly and bumped hard with a rival, shifted in and settled in the two path off the leaders,
advanced three wide between rivals on the far turn, came out a bit turning for home, was gaining late but missed. SHERIFF BROWN was unhurried inside,
came out in the stretch and gained belatedly. HOUSE LIMIT tracked inside, bid along the rail early on the far turn, dueled with the winner on that bend, gave
way in the stretch. ZESTFUL was bumped between and squeezed back at the start then coaxed forward outside rivals five wide into the first turn, continued
to stalk up the backstretch, lost ground on the far turn and weakened. STACKIN SILVER set a pressured pace in the two path, weakened. MAGIC MOSCO
was outside foes off the leaders, went four to five wide on the turns and failed to rally. PIRATE JUNCTION pressed the early pace three wide then was in
range four wide on the far turn, weakened. TROOPER exchanged a hard bump at the start losing action at that juncture, raced well back, was distanced,
pulled up and walked off. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ZESTFUL AGAINST TENFOLD ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

BRAZILIAN SUMMER shifted in early, dueled inside a foe but off the rail, edged clear into upper stretch and held sway. AGRONOMO dueled outside the
winner three wide, was no match but held the place. ATTILA'S FLAG settled well back, advanced into the turn two wide, shifted five wide nearing the quarter
pole, improved position while running evenly. MR. NASTY bumped a rival at the start, shifted in heading up the backstretch and was urged along, saved
ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch then drifted about. CAROLS BOUTIQUE settled well back racing wide, angled from six deep to two wide about
the three-eighths, steadied in late stretch as a rival drifted nearby. SNOW IN THE NORTH was mid-pack early, moved out three to six wide on the turn,
failed to rally. LEMON ICE broke a half-step slowly, was encouraged forward to chase the leading pair going four wide on the turn, weakened. CEBOLLA
broke a bit awkwardly, was held up behind traffic up the backstretch, gradually shifted out, entered the turn seven wide, angled in four deep about the
quarter pole and was not a threat. WIN LIKE COACH P was bumped at the break, went five to seven wide on the turn, drifted out a bit further in upper
stretch and was not a threat.
