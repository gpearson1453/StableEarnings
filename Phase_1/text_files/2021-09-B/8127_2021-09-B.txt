Footnotes
EL NOBLE pressed the pace down the backstretch, engaged EDDYSHAK racing into the lane, matched strides in the lane under a strong hand ride and
won the nod. EDDYSHAK soon led, set the pace while under pressure by EL NOBLE through the backstretch, responded to challenge from EL NOBLE at
the head of the lane, battled determinedly inside late stretch and was outnodded. WYE CROSS away last, tracked the pacesetters and improved late.
NEVVARE stalked inside and lacked a response when called upon. MR. KALYPSO sat just off the pace from the four path, chased the leaders into the lane
and was unable to improve position. MIDNIGHT SALUTE raced at the back of the pack and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
VISION QUEST quickly opened up on the field, held good margins through the backstretch, seen margins decrease racing into the lane, was kept under
urging and held safely. BOOKIE saved inside, angled out to the three path leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader, was gaining through the
stretch but was no match for the winner and held. KING KLOVER raced four wide through the backstretch, bid steadily outside and missed. MINSKY
MOMENT rated well off the pace from the three path, gained closer order under encouragement and gave way in stretch. BOLSANO trailed the field and
passed tiring. TRANG reserved off the early pacesetter and was done early.

Footnotes
THESHACK contested the early pace leaving the first turn, dueled inside of ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER, accept challenge from MAKE GOOD CHOICES at
the head of the lane, inched clear late stretch and held sway. TRADER LYNN trailed the field early, advanced quickly through the final turn, closed steadily
outside under urging, got by MAKE GOOD CHOICES and missed out settling for place. MAKE GOOD CHOICES raced three to four wide in the opening
turn, took back into a stalking position off the early pacesetters, lodged a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, moved up menacingly alongside
THESHACK but was unable to sustain the bid that was required and was caught late. DOC COPE unhurried early, angled out to the five path through the
backstretch and passed tiring. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER contested the pace from between rivals, dueled through the backstretch outside of THESHACK,
was unable to move on with the eventual winner and wilted abruptly. SLEWMACH never reached contention. ETU BABOU was not a factor, was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
TINY TYCOON unhurried early, advanced quickly outside racing through the final turn, angled out to the four path and won driving. FIRST PRINCE hustled
away, chased through the far turn, came under heavy urging then reached the front into the stretch and was caught late. SPIRIT RACER raced three to four
wide in second flight, waited briefly at the head of the stretch then split rivals in the final sixteenth to secure show. JIMMY FLASH pressed the pace from the
three path, dueled in the final turn and left little in reserve for the drive. FAST EH set a pressured pace from the rail, dueled inside of JIMMY FLASH
approaching the stretch, was overtaken and gave way. HUNTERS PRIDE broke alertly then was allowed to settle off the pace from the four path and lacked
a serious bid. LITLE BERTHA'S BOY away slow and offered little. DOCSLASTJOKE chased then was steadied inside nearing the half marker, dropped
back and stopped.
