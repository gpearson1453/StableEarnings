Footnotes
LASTCHANCEATGLORY was well rated early and raced four wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn and drew clear leaving the
turn, then was kept to mild pressure to keep OLYMPIC ROMP at bay late. OLYMPIC ROMP was reserved early, advanced wide on the turn and came six
wide into the drive, closed well. SLICK SILVER tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out. SHOFAR had a slight bobble
at the start, then settled four wide down the backstretch, then made a mild bid four wide but needed more. HOME RUN TRICK set the pace and was
headed at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. HARPOON HARRY checked shortly after the break, then was two to three wide into the far turn and tired.
The mile time was omitted.

AWESOMELY SHY was sent to the front to set the unchallenged pace early, then was sent down leaving the turn and kept to pressure to draw clear to
prove much the best. ABUELA'S HUMOR chased the early pace on the inside, shifted off the rail in the drive and finished willingly. OPTIONALITY tracked
the early pace and made a mild four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out. STRIKE UPA WISH was allowed to settle early and was towards the
inside on the turn and showed some late interest. MASTERFUL MISTRESS stalked the winner three wide early and then angled out in the drive and
weakened. I'MPRETTY I'MSMART broke inward at the start then failed to menace. GOLDEN RETRIEVER was off slowly and then not a factor.

drive and rallied well. TAPPED OFF sprinted well clear early to set the pace while racing well off the rail, then weakened in the final furlong while saving the
show. BLUES TUNE broke sharply then was shuffled back to trail the field on the turn, angled out in the stretch to offer a belated rally. MORE MEMORIES
hit the gate at the start, then was given rein and made a inside move on the turn but flattened out late while racing green early. MR LIBERTY chased the
pace five wide and weakened.

EVERYOTHERWON was away alertly to set the pace while racing well off the rail, then kept CHANDANA at a safe margin to prove best under mild urging.
CHANDANA stalked the winner three wide but to the inside of that rival, made a bid leaving the turn and by the furlong marker but could not get to that rival
while clearly second best. BRIBE was bumped at the start, chased the pace from the inside, angled out in the stretch but was empty, held show award. D D
SEVEN THIRTY chased the early pace and made a five wide mild bid on the turn but weakened. GOT SPIRIT broke outwardly bumping a rival then failed to
menace. BROOKVILLE STORM was not a factor. Head on replay cut out after a quarter of a mile.

ON K P pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn, then drew off in the drive to prove much the best
under right handed urging. JURA set the early pace in the two path, was headed by the quarter pole and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly
second best. YANKEE MISCHIEF chased the early pace three wide and came into the drive four wide and was empty, bested rest. ELVIS JUST ELVIS
stumbled badly at the start, then chased the pace five wide and weakened. LOREO'NICK was outrun early and was three wide by the quarter pole and not a
threat.

TINY SNEAKERS was sent to the lead to set the pace while clear and racing in the three path, then was headed leaving the turn, was roused left handed by
the three sixteenths pole, came out bumping SUMMER HOME by the furlong marker and again by the sixteenths pole, then edged clear late to prove best.
SUMMER HOME stalked the winner early and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, drew even by the three sixteenths pole, then was bumped
twice by the winner through the lane and hung late. ALLIE MAES REVENGE chased the early pace three wide, swung out five wide for the drive and offered
no late rally to best the rest. UNFORGETABLENATALY passed the tiring rivals while saving ground. IWANNABEPERFECT was off slowly, then had a five
wide pursuit, then swung out seven wide for the drive and had no rally. OH LA DE DA was not a factor. LILIES FOR MORGAN was off slowly, then chased
the pace on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive and came up empty in the drive.
