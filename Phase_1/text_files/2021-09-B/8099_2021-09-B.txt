Footnotes
BELL THE CAT allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the lane, then made a steady gain and drew
off late under mild urging. HOT TAKE set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, held that margin to the furlong marker, then was no match for
the winner and held the place. DECLARESQUE chased the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, then weakened in the
late going and held the show. CALIFORNIA REIGN stalked the pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into
the stretch and flattened out. NEEDSGRASS broke a step slowly from the gate and passed a tiring rival. SILVER DESTROYER mid pack, moved up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally.

DONYA KNOW IT set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, shook clear in the lane, then lasted under steady pressure. CASCADE PARK mid pack,
held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. BABY NO WORRIES allowed to settle,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out and closed well for the show. MUSIC AMORE never far back, held
position two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had a mild gain. SWEET DUTCHESS well placed and outside, held position on
the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, drifted in late and weakened. SLENDER BETSY well placed and inside, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and weakened late. CHINKARA allowed to settle, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into
the lane and ran evenly. DR GS SWEETIE ran evenly. FEMINISTA was never involved. SCOOP THERE IT IS was a brief factor.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT MADNESS mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove
clear. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drifted out slightly through the turn, carrying rivals with her, straightened, held that
margin to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place. ULTIMATE BARONESS mid pack, looped up three wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and closed well for the show. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY well placed, moved up on the two path through the
turn, angled out to bid outside, then weakened late and held a share. YES IT'S ERIE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
and improved her position. COUPLE OF NIKKIS well placed outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, was carried out slightly, bid four wide into
the stretch and flattened out. OH MY PRECIOUS passed tiring rivals. COZZENE'S CAT mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, was carried out
slightly to be widest into the stretch, then had no rally. BRING IT ON HOME tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and
faded the final furlong.
