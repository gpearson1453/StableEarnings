MY GIRL LEXI set the pace from the outset, was on the inside into the lane, under a long drive down the lane while the inside of the trio, inched free a bit
late in the stretch and held in the final stages. GINNY B stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a three wide bid down the lane, was
bumped late in the stretch and did not have enough in the final stages. MAGICAL PEAPOD came out at the start, pressed the pace throughout, was in the
three path into the lane, continued on down the lane from between horses but gave in nearing the wire. MATT'S HONEY chased the pace early, was in the
three path into the lane and moved up. GINORMOUS was never a threat. DUTCH TREAT was through after a half.

run. PAYNT YOUR WAGON set the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn, was on the inside into the lane and had the lead overtaken, tired down
the lane. RELATIVLEA was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. TWITCHY
stalked the pace early, raced in the four path through the turn and faded late in the stretch. KEEN MIND chased the pace early, raced in the three to four
path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and empty down the lane. BRAZIL NUT was never a factor. MICHAEL COLLINS was done early. EL

Footnotes
SPHEROID saved ground off of the pace, shifted three to four wide in upper stretch, rallied between horses to bid for the lead approaching the final
sixteenth, and drove clear. BUFFALO SHUFFLE pressed two wide, vied around the turn, led from a bidding ENRAGED entering the lane, gamely clung to a
margin into the final furlong, but drifted outwards approaching the final sixteenth, got bested passing that junction, and saved place. STRIKING A POSE
chased four wide, but was outkicked by an inner foe in midstretch, then kept on through the late stages, but missed reaching place on the wire. ENRAGED
stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, vied under a long drive through upper stretch, but yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. SOL
DEL SUR advanced along the inside from midpack to a stalking position into the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane to pass the tiring early pace setter,
but only managed to chase the leaders through the lane before shifting inwards a sixteenth out, but lacked a further kick. LAKE NAKURU lied off of the pace
three wide around the turn, shifted five to six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly without bidding. BUMP lied far off of the pace in the three to four
path around the turn, and failed to factor on her left lead through the lane. WASPIRANT bumped with an inner foe at the start, got caught five wide while off
of the pace around the turn, and faded. ENGLANDER set the pace along the inside, but gave way to a pair of bidding foes at the five sixteenths pole, and
weakened through the lane. SWINGIN FRIAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked the leading group from the two path early on, but wilted through
the field around the turn. BOSS IS A PAL was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
KANT BELIEVE IT broke inwards, dueled for the lead inside of PRINCEDREAMCESS, inched clear of that foe entering the lane as FABULOUS FANNY
took aim, dug in to resist that foe's bid passing the furlong grounds, and tenaciously maintained an advantage to the wire. FABULOUS FANNY stalked three
wide, claimed place entering the lane while taking dead aim on the clear leader, ranged up to that foe at the furlong pole sparking a duel, battled
determinedly to the wire, but was denied. TRICKED OUT tracked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, then forged show between horses at
the furlong grounds, and just saved that position from a rallying CATWINGS on the wire. CATWINGS broke a step slowly and was forced inwards by an
outer rival at the start, settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home while picking up stride, rallied through the lane before
altering course four wide a sixteenth from home, then sustained his charge through the late stages, but missed reaching show. SOPHIE GRACE broke a bit
outwards, tracked four wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading group in upper stretch. SOUTHERN MISS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
GORGEOUS CARINA was wiped out at the start when an inner foe broke outwardly, steadied due to the incident and trailed the field early on, took the turn
in the three path before swinging six wide entering the lane, and improved without threatening. PRINCEDREAMCESS dueled for the lead two wide, but
faded turning for home. PLEASE BE KIND broke a beat slowly, lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. MOST
EMPRESSIVE broke outwardly and greatly interfered a rival at the start, chased the pace for a quarter mile, but steadily faded in the two path around the
turn. ANOTHER FLAT DRUNK was outrun along the inside.

ALBERTA SUN rushed to duel for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, inched clear in upper stretch, and just lasted from a rallying rival on the wire. SUNNY
ISLE BEACH lied at the rear of the field in the four path around the turn, then rallied through the lane, surged late, but missed. SHASTALOO broke
outwardly, tracked from midpack two wide in the three path around the turn, then kept on well between horses through the final furlong. FORTUNA
ADIUVAT saved ground while tracking the pace, then chased along the rail through the lane. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY dueled for the lead three wide, but
failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart in upper stretch, then tired through the late stages. OFF WE GO dueled for the lead two wide and
between horses, but faded turning for home. STYLISH RAGS played no factor. GOLDEN ACCOUNT was outrun. BAYSHORE FOXES stalked the trio of
duelers from the four path around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
COLONELSDARKTEMPER established a loose lead early on, widened his advantage into the backstretch, received a breather into and around the far turn
as his margin narrowed, but responded well when roused in upper stretch, and held safely to the wire. ALLEGE stalked along the inside, shifted two wide
into the far turn, took aim on the loose leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase that foe through the lane, and saved place on the wire. BEAU
LUMINARIE tracked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane to attempt a rally, but only managed to chase through the lane, vied for place
through the late stages, but missed reaching that position. MR. BIG NEWS lied off of the pace two wide, chased three wide and between horses around the
far turn, and failed to threaten. TREASURE TROVE was pinched back between horses after a step slow start, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted
four wide into the far turn, but failed to make an impact. TWENTY TWICE trailed, improved by cutting the corner turning for home, but failed to factor.
AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) stalked two wide, tucked behind the clear leader, but came under a drive into the far turn, then faded around that bend.
CLAYTNTHELIONHEART lied far off of the pace in the three to five paths around the turns, and never got involved. GOOD JUJU tracked two to three wide,
but faded. JOB SECURITY was outrun.

Footnotes
YUUGIRI pressed two wide, ranged up to the leader on her own power turning for home, assumed command entering the lane, and drew off under very light
urging. DAME JOVIALE chased three wide, took aim on a bidding YUUGIRI entering the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, then held place.
OCEAN SIZE tracked along the inside, rallied to bid for place inside of DAME JOVIALE late, but missed reaching that position. HONEY RUN lied far off of
the pace three wide, and stayed on through the lane. PARLANCE dropped the rider while warming up, then set the pace along the inside, but proved no
match for the eventual winner entering the lane, and yielded. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. KARMARI was never
involved. BODE BY YOU lied far off of the pace between horses, steadied among those rivals into the turn, and failed to factor. MEANWHILEINLEITRIM
tracked from midpack two wide, and steadily faded.
