Footnotes
GOLDEN BROWN raced off the early pace, made a three wide run into contention on the turn, bid outside of LIKE WHAT I SEE at the top of the lane,
gradually wore down that rival and edged away late for the win. LIKE WHAT I SEE set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, dug in gamely inside
when challenged in the stretch, battled on and yielded grudgingly late. LUCKY JAIME chased three wide early, moved up inside on the turn, ran on well in
the lane and bested the others. SAND DUNE raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn and rallied mildly in the lane. DR. DOYLE chased between
rivals, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. QUIBERON BAY raced off the pace, two wide, steadied midway on the turn, went four wide at the quarter pole,
then lacked a rally. AMATTEROFTIME chased outside rivals and tired. SHIELD OF FAITH chased close up early on the inside, steadied at the three eighths
marker and tired. OUR MAN LUKE trailed the field, came five wide into the lane and did not factor.

SOUND MONEY tracked along the inside, made a strong three wide run on the far turn, quickly took charge, drew clear and then was kept to the task in the
final sixteenth. FAN CLUB raced two wide off the pace, made a three wide run into contention on the far turn, rallied into the lane, finished well but second
best. COMEDIC TIMING raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. ZUZUDINI raced off the pace,
advanced on the far turn, came wide into the lane and rallied mildly. BALTASAR was sent to the early lead, set a quick pace racing with a clear advantage,
was no match when challenged on the far turn and then gave way. SKILLFUL raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MOMZA stalked the pacesetter
racing close up, chased on the far turn and gave way. MISS MONTROSE raced four wide early, did not factor and then dropped far back.
