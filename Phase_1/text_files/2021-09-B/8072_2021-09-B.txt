TRIXIE'S TIME moved to the front from the inside shortly after the break, ran out entering the stretch and drew out under urging. TRUE HEIRESS steadied
in tight along the rail nearing and entering the turn, angled out for room approaching the stretch, vied outside the winner into the final furlong then flattened
out. HONORABLE LILLY settled, raced two wide around the turn, improved position into the stretch then lacked a further response. LADY MAGICA was
slow early then made up ground along the inside. TARAFIRMA showed between rivals early, fell back two wide on the turn and continued to fade through
the lane. RACINGINTHESTREET chased the winner three wide into the turn then tired in the lane. LOOP THE LOOP was no factor. ALLISON K was outrun
after a slow break. ZIPPY JO had to be reloaded before the start then was finished early.

at the break, left slowly, lagged early then passed tired ones. SHADYS KEEPER opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed along the rail while

Footnotes
BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD rallied four wide around the turn, ran clear leaving the furlong grounds and widened under urging. CUCKOO FORCONONUTS
wasn't far back inside and weakened. COLOR FORCE opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed along the rail while making the pace for over five
furlongs then tired. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER had position two wide between rivals to the stretch then tired. LUNAR STAR was hustled between rivals early
then stopped. GROTON ST SCOUT raced three wide with the pace into the turn then stopped.
