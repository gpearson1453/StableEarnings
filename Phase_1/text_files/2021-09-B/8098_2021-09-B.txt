CHARM CITY BAND , bumped by BILLINGSGATE when that one was forced in leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the rail while
disputing the pace around the turn and in upper stretch then drew clear the final furlong under stout encouragement. SOUTHSIDE SWIG bore in on
BILLINGSGATE leaving the starting gate, dueled outside the winner to mid stretch and finished gamely. BILLINGSGATE , bumped around leaving the
starting gate, saved ground around the turn, remained near the inner rail in the stretch and rallied. HARTEL , along the inner rail chasing the pace on the
turn, eased out at the head of the stretch and weakened. SMITTEN ENOUGH circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path at the head of the lane
then weakened. FLANK SPEED , four deep on the turn, gave way entering the stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
ROUGH SEA rated early while saving some ground, edged up past the five eighths, eased out and bid three wide in hand between foes nearing the lane,
sparred to the inside of TITAN'S WILL past the three sixteenths, shook clear under a right handed ask near the sixteenth pole then eagerly widened while
confidently handled late. TITAN'S WILL , in close attendance three to four wide, moved to engage the leader leaving the far turn, vied four wide outside foes
into the stretch, drifted in when dueling past the three sixteenths, was no match through the final furlong but continued willingly enough to be clear for the
place. BAHAMA CHANNEL led early inside foes, eased back nearing the turn and tracked, edged up back near the quarter pole, shifted out soon after,
failed to seriously kick on and faded late. GLENGAR vied outside BAHAMA CHANNEL early on, briefly moved clear after a half mile, battled inside foes into
the lane, steadied when put in a bit tight past the three sixteenths then gave way. THREETHEHARDWAY was squeezed back at the break, settled off the
pace, moved up four wide to be in range after a half mile, chased between foes nearing the lane and gave way. HAYNE'S FEVER came in at the break and
tightened THREETHEHARDWAY, lost ground four to five wide, chased around the turn then faltered.

TRADITION , in hand in the two path behind a trio of horses leaving the turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, gained the lead near the
sixteenth pole and held sway under urging. DOC ELM prompted the pace two wide around the turn, drifted out when taking the lead in upper stretch,
remained on his left lead through the lane and just missed. RIPPOLINO , forced in a bit at the break, was under urging soon after the start, raced in the two
path on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, had aim on the lead and finished evenly. LET US MAKE GOLD lacked speed, raced near the inner rail on
the turn and failed to be a factor. MIRACLE BOBBIE , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. CAPTAIN CARDO , no factor, drifted four
wide turning for home. EFFULGENT showed speed along the inner rail and stopped.

determinedly through the final seventy yards to prove best. ADABEL , bumped at the break, rated towards the inside, eased out with run into the lane,
worked between rivals, ranged up to loom past the furlong grounds, kept on willingly but was denied. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , off the pace and outside a
rival, raced three wide into the lane, advanced between runners past mid stretch, churned on with interest and got the bob for the show. SHERIFF'S KID
came out at the break and bumped with ADABEL, straightened and raced off the pace while saving ground, stayed inside and edged up past mid stretch,
kept trying but was nipped for the show. DIAL EMMA REILLY lagged well back, saved some ground into the lane and offered a slight kick. MY WAY OR
ELSE , three wide chasing the pace, moved up mid turn, was fanned six wide into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. SMOOTH DANCER

Footnotes
MISTY'S BANSHEE bobbled slightly at the break, cruised to the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn, was under urging in the stretch and
drew away. GHOST MAIDEN stalked the pace, moved up four deep on the turn, challenged for the lead outside the winner in upper stretch and weakened
the final furlong. POUNDING MUSIC , lightly steadied in narrow quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, remained along the rail around the turn,
eased out in upper stretch and raced a bit erratically in the stretch drive. TASFEEQ , in the three path chasing the pace around the turn, angled to the inner
rail in mid stretch and weakened. LEMON DROP KISS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and passed tired rivals late. BELLA THYME
hugged the inner rail around the turn and lacked a rally. INCONTROVERTIBLE , four deep on the turn, gave way. POLISH COOKIE , in the two path
between horses on the turn, gave way. LUCKY LORRAINE , outrun, was eased.

Footnotes
SPICY MARGARITA was hard sent to the lead soon after the break and secured the inside, was nudged along past the five sixteenths when taking some
outside pressure, was roused clear in upper stretch, had her rider lose the stick nearing the furlong grounds then held firm while steadily hand ridden.
MISTY'S LASS stalked the pace three to four wide, ranged up into the lane, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds and continued gamely to nab the
place in the final jumps. MISS CASEY tracked towards the inside, eased out with pursuit in upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. DRY WELL , four
wide under asking while chasing past the five sixteenths, shifted out wider for the drive and churned on with interest. COST A FORTUNE tracked three
wide, bid to threaten the winner mid turn, forced the issue into the lane then faded through the final furlong. REDWHITEANDTACOS , three to four wide
between rivals, gave chase past mid stretch but lacked a finishing response. THUNDER BOSS came in at the break and bumped with a rival, edged up and
stalked inside mid turn, eased out into the lane but failed to rally. GOOD STORY , off the pace, raced three wide outside a rival mid turn, shifted in near mid
stretch but failed to make headway. SWEET TALIA , bumped at the break, found an inside spot early on, waited briefly near the five sixteenths, stayed
inside but failed to threaten. DERBY JULEP lacked speed inside, swung out for the drive but was not a threat. MEJORAMIGA drafted back towards the rail,
swung very wide into the lane but came up empty. RUBI DE LEON , three wide, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
ALPHA CHI RHO sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted out when well clear in upper stretch and was kept under
urging in the drive. RAPID RESPONSE hugged the inner rail around the turn and rallied nicely inside horses. SEMPER FI , outside the winner while chasing
that one around the turn, faded in the drive. SPITBALL stalked the pace in the three path for a half mile, raced between horses in the stretch and lacked the
necessary late effort. SPOTTED BULL had a mild rally inside rivals. MIAMI MUMBLES , five deep on the turn, weakened. THE RIGHT PATH , well placed in
the four path on the turn, weakened in the stretch. DIALING DIXIE raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was outrun. ROCK RIDGE , outrun, drifted
wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HE'S A SHOOTER vied inside DREAMING OF CARATS leaving the chute, eased back off that one nearing the five eighths, shifted out and rebid two wide
heading towards the half mile marker, took over leaving the far turn then went clear mid turn, was guided to about the four path while confidently handled
into the lane, opened up after being called upon past the three sixteenths and was kept alert as much the best. ICE RAIN , jostled soon after the break,
lagged off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, shifted in and kept on willingly. SEBASTIAN , bumped at the break, settled back off the pace while
saving ground, rode the rail into and through the lane and churned on with interest to nab the show. WICKED PRANKSTER pulled his way forward three to
four wide early, prompted the pace, loomed a presence pursuing into the lane, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then faded. INSPECTOR FROST broke
a step slow then was pinched back to be well off the leaders, gained between rivals heading to the half mile marker, angled out chasing into the lane and
faded. ERIC'S EMPIRE , pinched back at the start, raced three to four wide and failed to menace. SOUPER EMPEROR , forced in some at the break,
straightened and edged up three deep past the five eighths to prompt the pace, forced the issue past mid turn, gave futile chase past the three sixteenths
and weakened. DREAMING OF CARATS was hard sent to get the lead, went clear nearing the five eighths and dropped in, was hounded by a pair of rivals
into the turn, ceded soon after, stayed on the quarter pole then gave way. MR EVERYTHING saved ground chasing the early pace, angled out mid turn,
circled into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY TRIP drifted in at the break, corrected and rushed up between rivals soon after to entertain the pace, dueled outside SLOW GIN BIZ into and
around the turn, shook clear under strong left handed asking in upper stretch then held sway while kept to task. SLOE GIN BIZ sped clear early towards the
inside, was joined after a furlong, dueled into and around the turn, failed to match strides past the three sixteenths but stayed on well to the line. JIM BOME
BOME , three wide early, dropped in and rallied mildly. NOTION TO TAPIT , off the pace and off the inside, edged up leaving mid stretch then flattened out
between runners. HOLIDAY AVENUE , with the early pace three deep, was shoved along chasing the dueling leaders mid turn, came four wide for the drive
and faded. SUMMER ASH broke a step slow, edged up early, chased and made a mild four wide advance into the lane, was under pressure past the furlong
grounds and came up empty. CLAUDEE BOY broke slowly, steadied soon after, raced well back into the turn, came three to four wide for the drive, edged
up some near mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. FOREVER YOURS flashed speed inside, chased into the turn then faltered.
