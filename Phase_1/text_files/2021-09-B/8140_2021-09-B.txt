Footnotes
MORNING MATCHA far back early, advanced inside throughout, collared the pacesetters near the eighth pole and drew away. DARLING DONNA
prompted the pace outside, was passed from her inside and continued willingly. ALICE HARPER dueled along the inside then weakened through the
stretch. GOLDEN ESSENCE lagged far behind then finished with good late energy. ARGENTINA GIRL saved ground close up in the two path turn then
faltered. SEBAGO LAKE raced off the pace between rivals and lacked a rally. TWODOGSFOURCATS raced extremely wide throughout and failed to
menace. ONE WILD WOMAN dropped well behind then passed rivals without menacing. CRAZY SERENA chased two and three wide and faltered.
BIENVENUE prompted the pace outside and faded on the turn. BELLITA lacked speed and was never in contention.

DREAMING DIAMONDS stalked outside, went after the leaders on the turn then edged away through the stretch. CARAMEL CREAM lacked speed then
closed the gap wide to get up for the place. MISS DILLINGHAM far behind early, raced very wide and finished strongly. CHARITY STRIPE dropped back
early, rallied wide but too late. BAYLEAF well placed outside dueling leaders but proved empty late. FLASHING DIAMOND broke slowly, moved up inside
and lacked a solid rally. ALWAYS TALKING vied outside with narrow advantage then proved empty. LOVE ON FIRE broke sluggishly, rushed to contention
then faded. MISS LOYALTY broke a step slowly and trailed early and was no factor. BUCKS SOME faded between rivals on the turn and failed to respond.
LE PETITE PAPILLON dueled along the inside then began retreating on the turn.

energy along the inside. MOTION PICTURE settled wide off the pacesetters and lacked a solid rally. FLYING WITH ANGELS moved wide just off the

throughout. GO LIME trailed early then passed fading rivals. O'BRIEN earned a narrow advantage then stopped after half a mile. ITS ABOUT MY TIME
chased wide down the backstretch and gave way. BET ON GRET weakened steadily. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN chased in midpack and retreated.

and continued willingly while moving evenly in the stretch. NINETYPERCENTBRYNN rated along the inside then flattened out through the stretch.

yards. SILVER STATE broke awkwardly, trailed for half a mile, circled his field and rallied to the lead in the stretch but was nailed from his inside nearing the
wire. WARRIOR'S CHARGE prompted the pace outside, led into the stretch then weakened. ROCK ON LUKE was hustled to a clear lead early then was
finished after three quarters. THORNY TALE moved closer up between rivals before half a mile then faded. WEST WILL POWER chased close up between
the pacesetters inside and gave way on the final turn. INFORMATIVE dropped back wide and was never in contention.

HOLLYWOOD TALENT settled wide off the pace, bid on the turn then surged through the final stages and moved clear late. BEER CAN MAN raced just off
the leaders inside, angled out in the stretch and closed strongly to get up for the place. ADMIRAL ABE dueled outside, led to final sixteenth and continued
gamely while tiring slightly. FIRECROW vied along the inside and finished gamely while weakening in the final furlong. BATTLE STATION eased back after
the start, showed some late energy. CAROTARI steadied between rivals near the three eighths pole and faded. CARAVEL raced within striking range three
wide but proved empty in the stretch. WEST FORK dropped back wide early and was always outrun. AMBLIN MAN was taken up into the far turn and gave

JACKIE'S WARRIOR led narrowly outside in hand through the opening quarter, took over when ready at the three eighths pole and drew away under wraps
through the entire stretch with the rider taking look back to check his opposition five times. PICKIN' TIME lacked speed, advanced inside on the turn and
was easily second best while no threat to the winner. REAL TALK dueled winner along the inside and began faltering on the turn. AWESOME GERRY
dropped far behind then passed a fading rival. BEREN was urged just off the leaders outside and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
CLAIRIERE settled well back outside in hand, began advancing wide on the final turn, surged into the stretch taking the lead nearing the eighth pole and
pulled clear under moderate pressure. OBLIGATORY prompted the pace outside, vied through the stretch and gamely held the place while no match for the
winner. ARMY WIFE raced within range three wide, split foes in the stretch and finished willingly. MARACUJA bobbled early, saved ground under rating,
loomed a threat in midstretch but weakened late. ALWAYS CARINA set the pace off the inside, was collared into the stretch and weakened. LEADER OF
THE BAND dropped far behind, moved extremely wide on the final turn and was no factor. WILL'S SECRET jostled at the start, dropped back inside and
lacked a rally. ALLWORTHY ducked out at the break bumping rival, chased wide and stopped.

HOT ROD CHARLIE set a measured pace inside, was challenged on the final turn, drifted out badly at the top of the stretch, was straightened and edged
away through the final three sixteenths while kept to his task.. MIDNIGHT BOURBON pressed the winner throughout outside, was carried out very wide into
the lane, continued gamely while unable to match strides late. AMERICANREVOLUTION advanced near the inside on the final turn then flattened out late.
FULSOME dropped far behind inside, angled out rallying near the five sixteenths but lacked a further response. BOURBONIC trailed for three quarters then
passed rivals without menacing. SPEAKER'S CORNER saved ground within range then faded after half a mile. I AM REDEEMED chased outside, was
asked for run into the final turn but gave way. WEYBURN saved ground close up then stopped abruptly on the final turn. The stewards conducted an inquiry
into the incident at the top of the stretch and the rider of MIDNIGHT BOURBON lodged an objection against the winner for interference at the head of the
stretch. The result was allowed to stand.
