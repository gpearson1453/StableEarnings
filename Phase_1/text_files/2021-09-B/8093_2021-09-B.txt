Footnotes
TAP ATTACK chased the leading duelers three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch, and held sway from an inner bidding
POSEIDON WRATH late. POSEIDON WRATH tracked along the inside, chased around the turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, rallied to bid inside of
the clear leader in the final furlong, but proved second best. KOLSCH broke slowly and bumped the gate at the start, rushed to vie for the lead along the
inside, led around the turn, but was headed in upper stretch, and weakened on her left lead. THIRTYEIGHT vied for the lead two wide, but faded between
horse entering the lane, and tired. CONSIDER broke a step slowly, came under urging while lagging behind the field, took the turn in the four path, and
failed to factor. BASSETT lied off of the pace two wide around the turn, and faded. PRIEST was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
TOMATO BILL prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, led in upper stretch, and drew clear passing the furlong pole. PETIT
VERDOT set the pace while feeling outer pressure from the eventual winner, dug in to resist that foe's bid entering the lane, but gave way passing the
furlong pole. SCHOCHOH stalked three wide, then chased through the lane. TOOBADSOSAD lied off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide in upper
stretch, and finished up evenly. INVENTING BLAME lagged well behind the field into the turn, and failed to factor. CONVECTION lied close up along the
inside early on, chased into the turn, but faded through the lane.

BEYOND A MILLION set the pace along the inside, drew away from a pressing MY PHAROAH LADY entering the lane, and widened under driving
pressure. I'M STYLIN tracked the pace two wide, commenced a rally turning for home to achieve place in upper stretch, and proved second best. HYLAND
HAVEN lied far off of the pace three wide, and improved to reach show late. MADAM PIE broke a step slowly and was bumped by an inner foe at the start,
trailed around the first turn, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, then improved inside of HYLAND HAVEN, but was outfinished by that one for
show. MY PHAROAH LADY stalked before pressing the pace setter from the outside, but drifted outwards entering the lane while fading, then wandered
about late before losing show approaching the wire. PALACE MAGIC veered inwards at the start, recovered to track along the inside, but weakened turning
for home. NORMA GEX got outrun. AS YOU WERE bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked three wide, but was through after a half mile, got eased
through the lane, pulled up inside the final sixteenth, then walked off.

Footnotes
FEELING HAPPY tracked from the two path, stalked the leaders around the turn, passed the tiring early pace setter at the five sixteenths pole before
shifting inside of the leading pair entering the lane, bid in upper stretch sparking a three-pronged duel, and gamely prevailed. SHOTGUN HOTTIE stalked
three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, dueled outside of a pair of foes thereafter, but hung late, and was outfinished by her innermost counterpart.
IMPLOSION pressed the pace two wide, led passing the five sixteenths pole as SHOTGUN HOTTIE ranged up outside, dug in between horses in upper
stretch as FEELING HAPPY produced a rail bid, gamely sustained the battle into deep stretch, but was outfinished by both of her foes late. RED HOT
MAMA gained between horses from far off of the pace into the turn, sustained that advance while tipping three to four wide turning for home, took lead on
the leading pair entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, and chased thereafter. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN bumped an outer foe at the start, took the
turn in the four path while off of the pace, and stayed on without threatening. VICARIOUS LADY lied far off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor.
TINSEL saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SECRET MELODY set the pace along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. KEINO
bumped with an inner foe at the start, lied far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and never got involved. FROSTED CHARM was off slowly then
pinched back in tight quarters between horses at the start, then got outrun.

WINDMILL stalked the pace early, raced in the four path along the turn and into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the leaders four wide near the
eighth pole and cleared the field in the final stages. PERFECT HAPPINESS tracked the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn and into the lane
while making a bid but was no match for the winner late in the stretch run. BREAK CURFEW trailed the field early on, raced in the five path into the lane
with a mild gain in the stretch drive. REAGAN'S EDGE chased the pace early, raced along the inside in the turn and into the lane, made a bid in the stretch
but weakened late in the drive. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) set the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn and into the lane then faltered late in the
stretch run. SOUTHERN MAMA was done early. STERLING MISS was never a threat.
