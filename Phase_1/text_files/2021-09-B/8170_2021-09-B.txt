Footnotes
STEVIE'S SONG away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of TAKE CHARGE GWEN entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from
the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and prevailed over that rival in the final strides while finishing between
rivals. TAKE CHARGE GWEN broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and just missed while battling gamely from along the rail in the stretch drive. HARLAN'S ANGEL saved
ground through the first turn to gain a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn,
and found her best stride late while finishing three wide in deep stretch to just miss. FOURTOWIN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced
her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the drive. MAKIN IT UP chased the leaders into the first turn,
before easing into a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued two wide approaching the final turn, but had little to offer over the
final furlong.

JUST JIMMY broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final
turn, battled two wide through the final turn, and wore down a stubborn BELCARRAPARK late to prevail. BELCARRA PARK away alertly and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from the inside of JUST JIMMY in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn,
battled through the turn and into the lane from the inside of that rival and just failed to last, while proving easily second best. VALUABLE COWBOY hopped
at the start to get away poorly, saved ground through the first turn and began to advance soon after entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact while finishing from along the inside in deep stretch. CHICA HERMOSA away well and was
allowed to settle off the early pacesetters while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a
serious late bid while finishing two wide in the drive. KIKI MY STAR unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide through the final turn, but
failed to make an impact.

SMART LAD broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of BLACK METAL entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch and from between rivals through the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and battled willingly to the wire to hold on for
the win. COULTERBERRY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly three wide while engaging the leaders three wide entering the final
turn, battled into the lane from the outside of SMART LAD, but was unable to match strides with that rival in the final strides. DRILLER was slow into stride,
but saved ground through the first turn to gain a tracking trip into the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn while awaiting room, and closed two
wide while steadying in tight quarters in mid stretch. BLACK METAL away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and had little left for the stretch drive. Following the
running of this race there was a steward's inquiry, as well as a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of BLACK METAL lodged a claim of foul against the rider of
SMART LAD for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original
order of finish.

ACE DEUCE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of PITCH COUNT through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue with
that rival into the backstretch, began to get the better of his pace rival midway to the final turn, opened a clear lead through the final turn, and held the
closers safely at bay late to prove best. WICKED FORTITUDE settled off the contested early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the stretch
the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the
drive to get up for the place. WE GOT IT COVERED away well and stalked the dueling leaders while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first
time, held his position from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to
garner a share. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished five
wide in the drive while improving her position late. CRAZY PROPHET lagged well back early while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first
time, rallied five wide entering the final turn, and finished six wide in the drive while improving late. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN stalked the leaders through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late when called upon.
PITCH COUNT away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, struggled to keep up with his pace rival in the run to
the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. HEARTSET was slow into stride while under snug restraint, lagged well back early, and failed to mount a
serious late bid. SPOKANE'S GEM stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a three wide trip in
the run down the backstretch, and faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
THE VALENTINE KID lagged well back early while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advance three wide midway down
the backside, rallied smartly four wide through the final turn, and finished determinedly while drifting in slightly in deep stretch to prevail in the final strides.
WALKINTHEWALK broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, tracked the leaders two wide in the
run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and just failed to last while drifting out slightly in
mid stretch. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS away alertly and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, raced into a tracking
trip in the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, steadied when in tight quarters from between rivals in mid stretch,
before finishing three wide late. HEART OF TEXAS away well and tracked the leader into the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the
issue two wide in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide into the turn, but was outfinished in the drive. AIRAFFAIR settled off the early pace while racing
three wide through the stretch the first time, held a striking position throughout, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ACCEPT NO
OTHER settled well off thee early pace while racing two wide through the lane the first time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a
serious late impact. DONE THAT settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run through the second turn, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, but failed to mount a late bid. STAY ALL NIGHT lagged well off the early pace while saving ground entering the stretch the first time, was always
well back and showed little. PRINCESS SOIREE raced to the lead from between rivals entering the first turn and dictated the pace through the stretch the
first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, and began to weaken entering the final turn.
