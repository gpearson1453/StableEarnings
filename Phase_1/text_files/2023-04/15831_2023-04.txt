Footnotes
SEMINOLE JUSTICE stalked the early pace three wide, rallied two wide to make the lead midway on the turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch,
was headed nearing the furlong marker then fought back gamely under left handed urging and proved best by the narrowest of margins. PEANUTS
PERFECTION had good early speed along the rail, dropped back a bit then shifted out three wide on the turn, was carried out to the seven path by the
winner while drawing on even terms for the lead at the top of the stretch, gained a narrow advantage, battled through the final furlong and just failed. LORD
OF LEGENDS never far back, finished with good courage along the inside. BIG TRIP away alertly, set the pace two wide then along the inside into the turn,
had speed into the stretch then weakened. DUEL FUEL was no factor. DERBYS MONEYMAKER trailed.
