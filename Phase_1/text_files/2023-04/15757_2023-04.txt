Footnotes
TELLER TO SING was unhurried while off the inside, advanced in the three path into the turn, angled in approaching the quarter pole, rallied through the
inside down the lane, cleared and widened. ARDIS raced off to a long lead while in the two path, continued on a diminishing lead into the lane then yielded
to the top one inside the eighth pole while remaining clear for the place spot. MAUREENLOVESFRANK raced in the two path through the turns and lacked a
closing response. OCELIA raced in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and weakened in the final eighth. RICHIES
NOBLE GIRL never a factor while along the inside. FORGLO chased the pace along the inside into the turn and tired.

Footnotes
YOLO SANTIAGO settled off the early pace while off the inside, bid in the four path into the turn, gained the lead after mid-turn, moved closer to the inside
into the lane and drew away. DOMHNALL vied for the lead early while in the two path, gained the lead into the turn, was challenged through mid-turn, could
not keep up with the winner then chased that one home. SMALL SAILOR was in the three path through the turn while a contender then could only just save
the show spot. UNCAPTURED DREAM raced in the two path through the turn when never far back then lacked a closing response. VELOCIMO pressed the
early pace from the four path, continued off the inside through the turn and settled back and was not a factor through the lane. FLOYD G raced in the three
of four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. BARRY'S MUSIC saved ground into the lane and was empty.
UTOPIAN TREASURE was outrun while near the inside.

path, then gave way in the stretch. TRAPPE THE GOLD was quickly over to be clear, then gave way at the sixteenth pole. GO EARLY STAY LATE faded.

Footnotes
GRAY FROST stepped in at the start, trailed for half, moved through the two to the three path on the far turn, angled into the seven path for the drive and
rallied to be up in time. FREDERICIA set the pace from the two path through the far turn, was joined by another after straightening in the lane, dueled with
that one through the final eighth, led late and was just caught by the closing winner. FORTUNE BOUND tracked the pace while along the inside, came off
the rail into the lane to engage the pacesetter, dueled with that one while in the five or six path then could not keep up very late. MIDNIGHT TANGO chased
the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane to be a serious factor then hung inside the eighth pole. JE SUIS RAPIDE raced in the four
path through the turn when never far back, was in the eight path for the drive and needed more. BALLOT INITIATIVE weakened through the lane while
racing in the three path through the far turn. ZING chased the pace from the two path through the far turn then tired.

Footnotes
AZURITA chased the two rival duel through mid-turn while four wide, continued in the four path into the lane, caught the leader inside the sixteenth pole and
quickly drove clear. ECLIPSED hustled between rivals early to gain a short lead, dueled into the lane, put challenger away inside the sixteenth pole but was
no match for winner while second best. JE SUIS BELLE pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane, was on near even terms with an
eighth to go then weakened in the final sixteenth while finishing best of the rest. WHERETHEMONEYWENT raced in the three path through the turn and
moved up while not a threat to the top ones. SHANNON'S GIRL raced in mid-pack through the turn and into the lane then weakened. HOPPESTRY never a
factor while in the three or four path throughout. MEDWAY QUEEN lunged at the start and spotted the entire field at least four lengths, raced in the two to
the four path through the turn and was never a factor. GIFT WRAPPED showed early foot to duel for the lead then steadily faded along the inside.
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY trailed along the inside.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY ROJO dueled inside of a rival, was headed at the eighth pole briefly and fought back to be clear under mild urging. BAD BOY GEIST dueled
outside of the winner, had a head in front at the eighth pole but was no match late. STARLITE RUN stalked the pqce in the four path but had no late bid.
PAYNTER'S CANVAS raced in three path, moved inside at the eighth pole but had no late bid. BUCKLE UP was unrushed, then improved position late
outside. MAS ORO stalked the pace in the five path, then faded on the turn. JACK THE BIRD moved inside at the eighth pole but failed to respond.
CARNACK ON TOUR saved ground to no avail. MY PAL GREG faded. GRAY MIKE was not a factor.

Footnotes
SOARING BIRD settled off the early pace while in the two path, moved up while off the inside through late turn, angled into the three path entering the lane,
caught the leader soon after then drove past and remained clear to the wire. LATIGO chased the pace while four wide through the turn, continued while in
the four or five path into the lane, stayed on well and was clear for the place spot. CLASSIC MAX hustled to the lead into the turn, cleared through the turn
and into the lane, was no match for the winner through the final eighth but stayed on to be clear for the show spot. KEEPIN IT CLASSY was in the two path
through the turn and into the lane and turned in an even effort. SAMURAI PRINCE was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and never was a
threat. CAP DE FUEGO chased the pace from the two path into the lane and weakened. STOP HAMMERTIME was brushed soon after the start, raced in
the four path through the turn and never was a factor. FLOWERPECKER never a factor while along the inside. FENESTRA was fast early to duel for the
lead then was empty through the turn.

SHADOW BELLE led in the two path, was headed in the stretch but came back under a strong hand ride. BOWS N LACE stalked the pace between rivals,
bid at the three-eighths pole, had a head in front but couldn't match strides late. JERSEY GOLD bore out at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, then
rallied late between foes. MORNING ANGEL hesitated and was steadied at the start, stalked the pace in the five path, rallied at the three-eighths pole, then
faltered in the drive. BANNED FROM MIDWAY hesitated at the start, raced in the three path, then rallied late inside and faltered. HAPPY SAILS pressed the
pace inside, then gave way inside. KNELCOCK was not a factor. DREAMING ALWAYS saved ground to no avail.
