Footnotes
PUMPITUPJUSTICE away alertly, stalked the pace while in the two or three path through the turn, swung into the lane in the three path while bidding for the
lead, lead and cleared before the eighth pole and was kept to the task. LILMISS SASSYPANTS set the pace along the inside through the turn, was
challenged by the winner into the lane, yielded to that one while straightening then stayed of for the place spot. MYGALJUSTICE saved ground throughout
and was up for the minor share while not a threat. FAR'S LAST ONE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the
leaders with an eighth to go then flattened. IMA N H LADY CAT was in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. NOW HERES THE PLAN
raced in the two to three path through the turn when in the back, continued into the lane from off the inside, was in the six path with an eighth to go then did
not respond.

between foes, angled four wide entering the backstretch, bid at the three-eighths pole but was no threat. CACAHUETE stalked the pace in the three path,
bid nearing the three-quarter pole but faltered on the far turn. HAPPY CAMPER raced in the four path and improved position late. MIDNIGHT J J stalked the
pace in the four path before fading. UNBRIDLED BEAST saved ground to no avail.

SWEET ALABAMA was bumped at the start and in a bit tight, raced along from the two path through the turn while chasing dueling trio, angled into the lane
to the six path while gaining momentum, straightened and rallied through mid-track to be up in time. WICKED FROST vied for the lead along the inside,
shook clear into the lane, was still clear in deep stretch then was caught. WHO RUNS THE WORLD vied for the lead from between rivals early, settled to
chase the leader into the lane then weakened near the sixteenth pole. PERFECTION SAVER was never a factor while in the three path throughout. MAGIC
BEAUTY vied for the lead three wide into mid-turn then was empty through the lane. ABSCONDER stepped in at the start and was straightened, raced
along the inside through the turn and and never factored. MY BUTTERFLY was done early while in the three path.

WHERE'S MOE pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane, continued between rivals through the final eighth and inched up late. PRINCE
SHIM set the pace while under pressure through the turn, continued with a short lead with an eighth to go, was still on a short advantage with less than a
sixteenth to go then yielded late. MIKIE O'PRADO chased the dueling pacesetters through late turn, bid three wide into the lane, drew to near even terms
inside the eighth pole then weakened late. SAN RONIN was three wide through the turn when in mid-pack, continued in the four path through the lane and
moved up while not a threat. JACK D was in the two path through the turn and into the lane then weakened. PORKYISMYNAME never a factor while in the
the three or four path. INEEDRELIEF was off alertly then settled back and was never a menace. SEMINOLE AUSTIN was outrun while in the two path. ZEN
JOURNEY hopped at the start to trail early, hustled up along the inside to mid-pack then was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
TAILLIGHTS settled off the pace while in the three path through mid-turn, angled closer to the inside into the lane, rallied from the two path through the
stretch and was up in time. OH SO SOCIAL chased the pace from the three path into the lane, was inching past the pacesetter late but was no match for the
winner. ON THE RAYDAR vied for the lead along the inside with two others, cleared in mid-turn, remained clear with an eighth to go then yielded late.
BASSCOAT trailed into the lane while off the inside, guided out looking for room into the lane, waited for space nearing the eighth pole, angled out sharply
just inside the eighth pole and finished full of run. J'S NAUGHTY BOY was checked back when put in tight early, continued in the two path into the lane,
came off the inside for the drive and rallied late. CORONA GRANDE was in the two or three path through the turn and needed more. KILLER HOTROD
settled back into the turn and raced evenly. TAPADERA was never a factor while off the inside. DREAM TRAVELER raced into the lane from the six path,
was bothered near the eighth pole but was never a serious factor. SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN vied for the lead into the turn while three wide and was empty
turning into the lane. INDIGO RICH chased the pace from the two path and faded through the lane. FOR MAMA was outrun while off the inside.

then couldn't close late. WOO WOO GIRL was clear early, then gave way late. SCRAPE raced inside, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered in the drive.
