Footnotes
OUT OF ALCATRAZ outrun in the early going three wide, advanced four to five wide into contention late in the final turn, lost some ground into the lane, late
bid, edged clear. IMPECCABILITY also lacked early foot, asked along in the two path second turn, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied through and outside
to traffic to be going well at the end to gain the place. FIVE O FOX broke well from the outside, showed the way in the two path first turn, headed, fell back
off the issue far turn, moved out three wide turning for home, rebid to gain the advantage, could not contain the top two in the late going. ROYAL AIR
FORCE forwardly placed and five wide into the first turn, remained within striking position off the inside while under frim restraint, advanced and put a head
in front three wide midway on the second turn, weakened in the drive. MR. WULLY BULLY lacked early after dropping to the inside first turn, continued to
save ground into and through the far turn, improved a bit into the lane then made little other impact. MR WORKS one paced off the inside, raced three to
four wide through the second turn, lacked a closing kick. DABOOGEYMAN shuffled break to be off a step slow, trailed for a half, picked off some tiring rivals
while not a serious threat. RIANTE SKY off a step slow, remained always back, failed to menace. SHOTGUN BILLIE set or forced the pace along the inside,
gave way. LOBO IRISH forwardly placed when slow to settle with the first flight, began to back up just off the inside far turn.

Footnotes

into the lane, drew out steadily to win ridden out. NAMESAKE off a step slow, lacked any early foot, angled out sharply to be six wide into the lane, willing
rally to annex the place, no threat winner. MAKE NOISE three wide in the first turn when well off the pace, moved inside and saved ground second,
improved into the lane, closest to the winner a furlong out, caught late for the place. EISENSTAEDT in mid pack while off the inside, came three wide for the
drive, went evenly paced through the lane. MOLIERE fell back after the start, dropped inside, saved ground into the lane inside to several foes to improve,
flattened out the final furlong. PEEKACHO within striking distance three wide, weakened after six furlongs. ESKENFORIT chased the winner for five furlongs
and gave way. GEORGIA DEPUTY off slowly, raced back and off the inside, came four wide for the drive, failed to muster a rally. TOMA TODO in the first
flight while five wide into the first turn, angled in, tired after six furlongs. THE HEAT IS ON in first flight four wide first turn, began a steady retreat before a
half, finished far back.

Footnotes
SEAS OF NORMANDY void of speed after breaking back, began a steady gain after a half, briefly waited far turn, advanced four wide midway on the
second bend, came three wide for the drive, bid outside the leader, edged clear under steady handling. GOLDEN BANDIT close from the start off the inside,
bid, took over second turn, continued to hold the advantage, gave ground grudgingly to the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. PERMAFROST
bothered a bit at the start, in the second flight while four wide through the first turn, between foes when moving slightly closer second bend, lacked a closing
response to come up empty. RUNNINGFORCASH broke in but alertly, set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way up the backsretch,
weakened when headed by the runner up far turn. GONE AGAIN raced inside and in the second flight into the first turn, steadied in traffic, fell back after a
half, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals. NEIGHBOR back off the pace, came four wide for the drive, had little in the way of a closing kick. RACHEL'S
CAPER forwardly placed toward the inside, had little for the drive. ITWASTHISBIG settled in the second flight off the inside, tired. HYPER SPEED balked at
loading, broke in, was straightened while racing well back, bothered, carried out turning for home, trailed in.

Footnotes
COACH ADAMS away in good order, raced forwardly first turn, got out a bit onto the backstretch, closer before a half, bid, took over midway on the second,
got out a second time entering the stretch, responded when the runner up challenged inside the furlong marker, held under firm handling. CHAPEL BARN
steadied into the first when in tight behind the leader, moved out, pressed the next quarter mile under a firm hold between, fell back after a half, asked along
late in the final turn, rebid past the furlong marker, could not get by the winner to be outkicked late. GOLD BUCKLE off a step slow, moved up to race in the
second flight inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, lacked a winning kick in the drive. BIG COUNTRY settled in mid pack off the inside,
three wide second turn, went one paced through the lane to also be found lacking. HANKS broke in good order, cleared toward the inside first turn, showed
the way along the inside onto the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage into the far turn, weakened when headed. MARK THE MOOSE steadied
early, trailed, improved slightly into the lane, never dangerous. HEZA WILD RIDE was never a factor. TWITTY CITY void of speed, backed up drive.

Footnotes
LUNDBERG came in early to help tighten up and bother a pair of inner rivals, vied into the turn, closest to the inside, disposed of that pair when straightened
for home, remained clear to the wire under steady handling. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL lacked early foot, saved ground while back through the turn, rallied
up the rail to earn the place. VIGANO was forced to check up when UNBOWED came out early, was attempting to recover when forced to steady when
REELED IN was forced into him from the outside as LUNDBERG was angling in, fell well back, two path through the turn, showed some belated interest to
improve position. IMPRESSOR pressed issue early from the outside, vied three wide turn, weakened in the drive. GUCCI BOY fractious in the post parade,
raced back off the early pace, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. INTO IT pressed early while between horses up the backstretch,
vied while still between horses turn, gave way in the drive. REELED IN bothered when LUNDBERG came in after the start, steadied and pushed in to in turn
bother VIGANO, recovered to race within striking distance off the inside, asked along late in the bend, came up empty for the drive. UNBOWED came out
soon after the start to bother VIGANO and causing that one to check, steadied when regathering soon after that, raced back, got out again to be five wide
into the lane, failed to rally. MALORIE'S BIG BOY in mid pack while off the inside, was finished after a half. CHARLIE WHISKEY stumbled badly at the
break, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF VIGANO AGAINST LUNDBERG FOR INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE
START, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH.

getting to that rival late. UNIFYING settled off the pace and the inside, three wide exiting the turn, edged clear for the show late. FEE within striking distance
outside, three wide through the turn when chasing the dueling leaders, lacked a closing punch in the drive. ALWAYS ANGELS lacked speed, improved
position a bit into the lane, traffic, altered course to the outside with just less than a furlong remaining, finished up evenly. CRYPTO MO last away, void of
speed inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. RING TWICE three to four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. EMPIRE OF
MY OWN lugged out early, forward and inside, again into the lane to be rank in upper stretch, stopped.

Footnotes
LARK'S MISCHIEF broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, clear through the turn, drifted in slightly to close the opening along the rail a bit, clear
again, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN) behind the pace in the two path, moved closer while moving to the rail
turning for home, saw an opening along the rail inside the winner shrink as that one drifted in a bit past the furlong marker, altered course to the outside of
that one and was coming late. MACHO VILLA broke back, raced in the two path through the turn, staged a belated rally to annex the show. APRIL FOOLS
ANDY in the second flight inside, tipped out a bit to be two path for the drive, closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out late to lose the
show. MISSIN HOLLYWOOD bumped at the start, raced back off the pace, moved closer four wide through the turn, flattened out in the late going.
MILLERS RITE away in good order, prompted the winner from the outside for a half and weakened. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ void of speed while racing in
the two path, was never a threat. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR broke out, bumped, raced in mid pack early, was finished before a half. SALINE RIVER off a
step slow, moved out to be four wide into the turn, showed little in the drive. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INITERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

KING PEANUT away with the leaders, vied up front closest to the inside, continued to battle along the rail through the turn, asked late in the bend, cut the
corner to be clear by the time he was straightened for home, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. BOHEMIAN BO broke on
top, vied up front while between rivals fell back by midway on the turn, moved out four wide for the drive, finished willingly to prevail for the place, no threat
to the winner. DEBATER with the pace while between horses and outside the winner, fell back off that one turning for home, chased top two home, clear of
the others while finishing up closest to the inside. CHOCTAW ZIP off a step slow, raced bac off the pace, three wide through the turn, improved position

TALLADEGA broke alertly, rated kindly in showing the way in the two path, continued to set the pace into the far turn, shook clear when called on for some
run into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire while kept to moderate pressure. BEN DIESEL in the second flight while off the inside, remained within
striking distance in the two path second turn, could do little with the winner after moving inside then back out upper stretch, fully extended to preserve the
place. ALL WEST within striking distance while racing three wide, moved a bit closer three wide in the second turn, long drive for the place, outkicked. THE
SKIPPER TOO lacked speed off the inside, three wide through both turns, lacked a significant closing response. LONG CROW broke back, saved some
ground in the first turn, moved out, three out to four wide second turn, improved position while also not a serious threat. JEWELSTOWN prompted the
winner after moving out to be three wide first turn, continued to apply pressure the middle half mile , weakened in the drive. HERN forwardly placed for five
furlongs, gave way. BACK BEAT off slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed most of the way and was never a factor. BELLAMYS ROAN mid pack
inside, traffic, shuffled back into the far turn, fell further back then continued to fade to trail home.

Footnotes
SHE'S STORMING broke with the leaders, vied between foes into and through the turn,shook clear when straightened for home, held runner up safe in the
late going under continued steady handling. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke on top, raced forwardly placed and outside, contested the issue four wide
through the turn, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, slowly getting back to that one late. MS CARROLL COUNTY mid pack, behind horses behind
the lead flight into the lane, angled in, bid for place late, outkicked for that position. FLY LIKE THE WIND in the main group while racing off the inside,
patiently handled behind traffic late in the turn, improved in upper stretch when clear then went flat late. SASSY LASS in the main body up the backstretch
outside, angled five down to the two path late turn, traffic into the lane, improved inside through the lane. SUMMORYA off slowly, raced back and in the two
path, improved inside of some rivals into the lane then went flat through the lane. COUNT IT ALL JOY broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the
backstretch closest to the inside, began a gradual fade after a half. DOUGHTY raced within contact of the lead pack well wide, five wide turn, failed to
muster a rally. UNBEARABLE off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, angled out to be four wide by midway on the turn, lacked a closing response.
LASSIE MY GIRL lacked speed well wide, six wide through the turn, failed to rally as well. BETTY JO pressured the pace from the three path for three
furlongs, stopped by late in the turn.

Footnotes
WOBBERJOD closest to the leader off the inside, two path into and through the turn, collared that one turning for home, drove clear. FIRERY TALE settled
off the pace and the inside, advanced into the lane, steered out, willingly, up for the place. FULL IMPACT broke sharp, soon clear, continued to show the
way through the turn, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that one in upper stretch, could not contain the runner up, saved the show.
CLASSIC KING unhurried while working way toward the inside, two path turn, improved position a bit, not enough for the show. TILLIS behind the leaders
inside, steered out three wide while within striking distance turning for home, had little left. POP'S BISCUIT one paced while three wide, moved out to be
four wide midway on the turn, angled in under a rival into the lane, also lacked a closing kick. BAKER'S MAN off slowly, trailed while just off the inside,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals. HOME BASE broke in, was straightened to race in the second flight, four wide into the lane, tired in the run to the wire.
AFRICAN WARRIOR off slowly bothered and remained always back.
