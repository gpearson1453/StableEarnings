Footnotes
MANCHESTER tucked behind horses while trailing early on, gained position inside of rivals nearing the turn, brushed an outer foe while splitting rivals two
wide turning for home, sustained a grinding charge to bid inside of the top pair at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage leaving that marker, and held
from an outer chaser late. KASIMBA stalked three wide, ranged up to the leader from the three path turning for home, produced a bid in midstretch along
with an inner rival, got outkicked by that one passing the furlong pole, ran on well in pursuit thereafter, but was kept at bay. ALL JOKES ASIDE set the pace
along the inside, shifted outwardly as an outer rival ranged up nearing the lane, held an advantage through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but
yielded to bidders on either side at the furlong grounds. PLATINUM GHOST laid off of the pace while caught in the five path into the turn, took a light brush
from an inner rival inside the three furlong pole, then sustained stride while hanging on his left lead throughout the lane, and lacked a bid. HYPER SPEED
raced at the rear, dropped back to trail in the two path entering the turn, moved up by splitting foes two wide entering the lane, but flattened out without
reaching contention. VALUABLE CARGO lacked speed in the four path and between horses, took light contact from an inner rival leaving the three furlong
pole, transferred that brush to an outer rival in the process, then failed to menace among foes through the lane. GIANT AWAKENING chased along the
inside and tired turning for home. LEVEL UP raced forward two wide and between horses into the turn, but gave way at the three furlong pole before being
brushed by an inner foe, and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
FANDOM (GB) quickly cleared, set the pace in the two path while well in hand, shifted out a touch entering the lane, responded readily to light right handed
shoulder taps in upper stretch, spurted away with a quick turn of foot, and widened under wraps through the final furlong. BLAST FURNACE moved forward
to stalk as the leader's closest pursuer nearing the turn, inched closer along with an inner foe turning for home, but swiftly proved no match for the pace
setter in upper stretch as his inner counterpart faltered, and held place from an inner bidder late. SAINT ROCCO broke slowly before taking contact from an
outer rival at the start, lacked early speed along the inside, launched an advance two wide turning for home, shifted inwardly in upper stretch to rally inside
of foes in the final furlong, but was fended off for place late. EARLY MUNNY tracked along the inside, vied for place turning for home, but gave way in upper
stretch while hanging on his left lead. THE RUSH IS ON was a bit hesitant to load, stalked two wide and between horses, chased while failing to sustain
forward position into the turn, and gave way turning for home. CALHOUN broke a step slowly before an outer rival forced him inwardly and to bump a rival
leaving the gates, recovered to track in the the four path, but faded through the lane. KEEPYOURPRANCEON got very rank under a tight rein while slow
away from the gates, steadied from restraint a few strides later, trailed in the two path around the turn, checked to alter course around a rival at the three
sixteenths pole, and was outrun. LAUGH NOW broke inwardly at the start, required urging while off of the pace in the three path into the turn, and tired.

ARDEN'S ASSAULT set the pace along the inside, drew away at the half mile pole, widened in hand in the two path around the turn, and was ridden out
under light urging through the lane. FAST N HAPPY trailed early on, gained in the four path and outside of rivals around the turn to gain place at the five
sixteenths pole, and was second best. PATIENCE WORTH chased along the inside, gave way at the three furlong pole, shifted out entering the lane, and
surpassed tired ones. BLUE TOPAZ raced at the rear along the inside, steadied hard behind a foe at the five sixteenths pole, shifted three wide at the three
sixteenths pole, and moved up. MILIEU tracked early on, was urged along in the three path while chasing, and tired. UNION HARMONY pressed two wide,
but failed to keep pace with the leader at the half mile pole, and folded along the inside turning for home.

Footnotes
CAMI CAT set the pace in the two path, drew clear under no urging at the three furlong pole, and was ridden out under very light shoulder taps. SOCIAL
MANDATE brushed the outer half of the gate while off a step slow, stalked along the inside, vied for place with an outer rival while in the two to three paths
around the turn, and held off an inner bidder for that position late. SWEET BEAUTY pursued from midpack two wide, failed to sustain that position nearing
the turn, then stayed on along the rail through the lane, but did not have enough to reach place. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE laid off of the pace in the three to
two paths, and lacked a bid between horses. PUGLIA chased from midpack in the four to five paths, and tired. SPIRITCATCHER trailed and never got
involved. PAPPYSAYSYES broke outwardly, raced forwardly three wide, vied for place with an inner rival while in the three to four paths around the turn, but
weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) saved ground off of the pace, moved forward to midpack two wide and between horses entering the final turn, sustained
progress to bid inside of the top trio at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ENGLISH CONQUEROR stalked outside of each leader from the three path, bid
between horses turning for home, dueled in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival leaving the furlong pole, and held off an outer foe for place.
SIR FOR SURE set the pace in the two path around the first turn, stalked after being headed entering the lane for the first time, shifted out to the three path
nearing the backstretch, bid outside of the top pair and in the four path turning for home, vied in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a rail bidder in
midstretch, and was denied place. KITTEN MISCHIEF tracked in midpack in the three path, pursued between horses around the final turn, tipped to the five
path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and chased evenly. MICROPHONE (IRE) tugged forward three wide around the first turn, struck the front in upper
stretch for the first time, settled into stride in the two path around the second turn, met outer bids turning for home, sparred until an inner rival also
challenged at the furlong ground, and yielded. SIX MINUS tracked in the two path, shifted outwardly down the backstretch, chased in the four path around
the final bend, and gave way in the five path entering the lane. WICKED FAST tracked from midpack along the inside, but gave way turning for home.
COOL RAGS trailed and never got involved. BLANKET OF ROSES was outrun.

YO PUEDO set the pace in the two path, sparred with an outer bidder around the far turn, shook clear of that one in upper stretch, and was driven home.
POUT stalked the leader from the three path, vied around the far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and remained clear of show. PENTAGON
laid off of the pace in the two path, improved under urging in the five path around the far turn, dueled for show with an inner DE JORIA through the lane, and
prevailed. DE JORIA tracked in the four path under snug restraint around the first turn, came under a drive around the far turn, but lacked a bid, dueled for
show with an outer rival while failing to keep pace with the top two through the lane, but was bested. LILY'S CREED was outrun. BYZANTINE stalked along

Footnotes
MISS RIDDLER set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, shook free of that on at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear,
and held safely from outer rallying rivals late. BE MY SUNSHINE tracked from midpack along the inside, smoothly vacated the rail around the far turn, spun
into the lane four wide, rallied in the six path in midstretch to gain place at the sixteenth pole, and held that position from an outer rival while slowly closing
the gap on the leader. VENENCIA (FR) spotted the field multiple lengths by breaking very slowly at the start, trailed two wide, quickened noticeably while
shifting to the three path turning for home, fanned five wide entering the lane, and rallied in the seven path through the final furlong, but was too late to gain
place. MISS PEABODY tracked in the four path under a snug hold early on, pursued three wide around the far turn, chased along with an outer foe to bid for
place nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked at that juncture. GROMANTINE (FR) stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn,
and lacked a bid. CLOUDY BAY pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and faltered between horses in the final furlong. DESERT
TEMPEST bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position approaching the
three furlong pole, and lacked a re-rally. PUFFIN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BOUDICA raced far back along the inside under firm grasps,
trialed around the far turn, and failed to factor. TAMMY TAP TAP TAP bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses,
but pulled keenly around the first turn, steadied at the nine sixteenths pole, then weakened in upper stretch. SWEET ALYSSA tugged while lacking speed in
the three path around the first turn, attempted to gain in the five path around the far turn, but was outrun. CHICA DE ORO laid off of the pace three wide, but
wilted in the four path turning for home.

Footnotes
BRAGANZA stumbled at the start, recovered to stalk three wide, pressed the top pair entering the turn, bid in hand turning for home, took charge in upper
stretch, and was driven home to seal the deal. TAKE CARE laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turn, fanned to the five path entering the
lane, and ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole. TALES OF HOME set the pace, vied with an outer pair of bidders around the turn, proved no match for
her outermost challenger in upper stretch, gave way, and lost place entering the final sixteenth. NON VIOLENCE pressed two wide, vied between horses
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her outer counterpart in upper stretch, and tired. STORY HOUR popped open the gate pre-race without leaving
it, then lacked speed along the inside, trailed before shifting to the three path entering the lane, an failed to factor. AIN'T BROKE trailed two wide, improved
in the three path and between horses turning for home, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but failed to sustain progress, and weakened through the
final furlong. SEND FOR ME chased along the inside, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
MONJID set a clear pace, kicked away entering the lane, and lasted safely. KING CURLIN tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the four path in
upper stretch, changed leads at the three sixteenths pole, and offered a grinding charge to gain place nearing the wire. CAROOM saved ground off of the
pace, rallied up the rail to gain place leaving the furlong grounds, but altered course outside of the leader while closing in late, and was costed place in the
process. GETTLEMAN stalked along the inside, gained place from an outer rival entering the lane, but yielded between horses leaving the furlong grounds.
MIRACLE ON ICE trailed, took the far turn two wide, improved between horses in upper stretch, tipped to the four path at the furlong grounds, and stayed
on. DR KRINGLE raced far back in the three to four paths, but bore to the eight path entering the lane, yet stayed on and moved up. BORDER WAR laid off
of the pace two to three wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and improved between horses in the seven path. SON OF THUNDER stalked outside
of the clear pace-setter, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened between horses. BEE WELL pursued from midpack two wide, fanned to
the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. QAADER brushed the outer half of the gate upon leaving it, then saved ground far off of the pace, but to no
avail. MISSIONAIRE tracked two wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane, and gave way. ROENICK hopped slightly while breaking a step slow,
steadied while far back approaching the wire for the first time, and was outrun thereafter. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.
