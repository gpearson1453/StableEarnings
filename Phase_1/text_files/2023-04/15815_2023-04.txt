ROSE OF EKITA settled at the back of the field early, moved three and four wide going up the backstretch to bid into the far turn and move clear through
that bend then was kept to a drive while widening. TAPIT'S LADY stalked the pace three and four wide, could not go with the winner but moved clear for the
place. SUE HAPPY was four and five wide through the first turn in reach of the pace, settled three wide to bid going to the final turn then could not sustain
the run. SATURDAY SERVICE was along the inside and weakened. CHERISH THE DAY made the early pace racing about the three path and tired.
MONGOLIAN DIAMOND was along the inside for a half, gave way going up the backstretch and was pulled up in the final turn but walked off under her own

SHWEET PERSUASION tracked the early lead three wide to bid through the second turn, remained out about the three path to draw clear in the far turn
and held the margin through the lane. G'S TURN made the early pace along the inside, dropped back through the far turn but came again to gain the place
late. FAKE SOLUTION saved ground back off the early pace, moved out to bid three wide going up the backstretch but lacked a final closing run. STAGE
DOOR was in reach four wide but lacked a solid closing bid. FORT KNOX stalked the pace from three wide and weakened. GOLD NOTE failed to mount a
bid two and three wide.

FOOLISH INTENT tracked the leader three to four wide throughout, responded when set down and was up through the closing yards. FABULOSITY moved
to the front early and made the pace about the two or three path then could not hold the winner safe late. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE stalked the pace four wide
and lacked the needed closing run. POPS GIRL ALEXA followed the pace three wide and made a mild gain while not a threat. ROLLIN BLACKOUT lacked
a rally three to four wide. LITTLE MORE LOVE was always back. RETRO RITA dropped out going up the backstretch and was eased through the lane.
