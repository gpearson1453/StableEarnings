ZIGGLE POPS (GB) reserved near the back of the pace, launched a sweeping move off of the hill on the final turn, forged command entering the stretch
and held gamely through the drive. CAINUDOTHETWIST was unhurried, moved with the winner off of the final bend and into the lane, kept on well but was
unable to best the determined winner. BALTIMORE KID (IRE) contended in hand, loomed a danger leaving the final turn, but flattened and settled for the
minor award. CROSS BORDER was nearest the pace, inherited command off of jump eleven, stayed on to the stretch, but weakened in the drive. TEASE
AND SEIZE (FR) was allowed to settle, moved up to make a mild bid, came up empty on the final turn, left the course entering the stretch but walked off.
LEFT BLANK was unhurried, pulled up after fence eleven but walked off. SORAMOND (GER) sprinted well clear, weakened into the backstretch the second
time, fell off of jump eleven but walked off. FRONTLINE CITIZEN (IRE) was close up, had the jockey lose his irons into the first turn, stayed on to jump six
but lost the rider.

Footnotes
ETERNAL STORY (FR) tracked the leader in hand, was suddenly near level terms when the pace setter fell off of jump eight, fought on doggedly from there
and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. BARBADOS (IRE) settled in hand, launched a bold bid leaving the final turn, continued on well but was unable to
best the determined winner. L'IMPERATOR (FR) was unhurried into stride, rallied four wide and kept on well to earn the show. PURE COURAGE stalked
the pace, assumed a narrow lead after jump eight, battled on but weakened during the drive. ADVENTUROUS GENT (IRE) failed to respond. ROYNE was
allowed to settle, lacked a response when asked, left the course entering stretch. LOOK NORTH contended toward the inside, came up empty on the final
turn and left the course after jump ten. FINDING FREEDOM pulled clear to dictate terms, fell over fence eight but walked off.

FREDDY FLINTSHIRE settled at the tail of the field, came under a ride into the final hill, reeled in the leaders swiftly down the hill, struck the front once
straightened for the drive and drew away to score as the rider pleased. COOL JET (IRE) opened clear to dictate terms, dug in to meet the challenge of
CARAMELISED (GB) after the opening mile, fought on doggedly, but was no match for the winner in the drive. CARAMELISED (GB) tracked the leader
three deep, ratcheted up the pressure after a mile, but flattened in the final quarter mile and gave way. PROVEN INNOCENT was forwardly placed to the
final turn and tired. HIGH MOUNTE (IRE) failed to respond. STEP TO THE BAR contended, came up empty on the final turn, left the course entering the
stretch but walked off.

GO POKE THE BEAR tugged to the lead between rivals, controlled the tempo thereafter, and drew away to score with something left. WEBB stalked the
pace, loomed large off of the final hill, but was unable to go on with the winner in the drive. LACEY UNDERALL was unhurried and well back, circled four
wide to make a late rally but failed to seriously threaten. AFTERMATH was forwardly placed through the final turn and tired. THUNDRA lacked a response
when called upon. KENYA ROAD opened clear, relinquished the lead after a mile, stayed on to the final turn, but came up empty entering the stretch and
left the course.
