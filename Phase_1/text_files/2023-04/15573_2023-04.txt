Footnotes
RIVER'S BEHEST took back off of the decent early pace, improved position while two wide on the turn, angled three wide for the drive, advanced at
mid-stretch, showed a good late kick in deep stretch, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. THE
SANDY SURPRISE showed speed and raced close to the early pace, pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, was
kept to steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off RIVER'S BEHEST in the final stages and was second best in the end. WHISPER AND
WINK lacked early speed, raced two wide to the quarter marker, made a steady gain in the drive, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but
stayed on to be clear for third. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased the decent early pace, raced outside of rivals on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
did not offer a late rally. GRIFFITH PARK broke in at the start, crowded FANTASTIC DREAM then ducked in leaving the chute and was off slowly, was
hustled to show speed in the early stages and set the decent fractions to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken by THE
SANDY SURPRISE in upper stretch, stayed on to chase that foe to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. MEMORANDUM chased the decent early
pace, lost position while three wide nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run. FANTASTIC DREAM was crowded then took up at the start and
was off slowly, lacked early speed, trailed to the quarter marker and did not factor. LET GEORGE DO IT was prominent early on, pressed the decent pace
to the quarter marker, dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SPEED GRAZY was unhurried in the early stages, was roused three wide along the far turn, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch, loomed nearing the
furlong marker, responded to firm urging nearing the sixteenth-marker, took command in deep stretch and kept to task late to prove best. NIGHT PROOF
was forwardly placed into the first turn, raced close to the moderate fractions while saving ground into the second turn, advanced to vie for the lead at
mid-stretch, could not match strides with SPEED GRAZY in the final stages and bested the rest. AFFIRM CHIEF was asked to show early speed and
dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions while pressured through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker while under
pressure, dug in in upper stretch and held foes at bay to the furlong grounds, yielded the lead inside of the furlong marker and was clear for third at the
finish. BROOKYS TAPIT was allowed to settle while not far back, saved ground into the backstretch run, raced two wide between rivals into the second turn,
came three wide into the stretch drive and did not offer a late rally. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE was unhurried while well placed in the early going, was caught
three wide along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, was coaxed three wide into the second turn, raced four wide into the stretch
run and lacked a late response. ROARING TIGER was prominent into the first turn, kept close attendance to the decent pace through the backstretch run
and into the second turn, lost position heading to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
TOP HARBOR stalked the quick early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, came to even terms with STAR RACER
in upper stretch, dueled to the outside of that rival through mid-stretch, took a narrow advantage into deep stretch and determinedly held the runner-up at
bay in the final stages to prevail. STAR RACER broke alertly, ceded the early lead to PSYCHO DAR and tracked that foe to the turn, advanced to press the
quick pace while between rivals nearing the quarter marker, drew to even terms with TOP HARBOR in upper stretch, dueled to the inside of that rival
through the furlong grounds and into deep stretch, was not able to get by the determined winner in the final stages and was gamely bested, while clear of
the rest for the place. UNRAPTURED was unhurried in the early stages, trailed heading into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, advanced to
come within aim at the furlong grounds, was outkicked in deep stretch and held safely in the end for the show. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD chased the fast early
pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch and could not muster a late response. PSYCHO DAR was hard sent leaving
the break, established the early lead and set fast fractions into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and faded in
the final stages.

Footnotes
SNAKE ISLAND was forwardly placed into the first turn, raced four wide into the backstretch run, was well placed to the half-mile marker, advanced three
wide nearing the top of the lane, came four wide into the stretch, closed well nearing the furlong marker, rallied determinedly in deep stretch, overtook
LIBERTY WOLF in the final strides and held over the oncoming runner-up to prevail. STRAMA was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide into
the far turn, swung widest into the stretch, mounted a five wide bid at the top of the lane, found his best stride late, came within aim in deep stretch and just
missed for the win, while getting up in time for the place. LIBERTY WOLF took back off of the early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run,
maintained position to the far turn, was asked for run four wide into the stretch, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, took command into the final furlong, kept to
task while under firm urging to deep stretch, was all out to hold off of the oncoming top pair in the late stages, was caught in the final strides and was clear
for third in the end. ONE BIG SMILE was prominent into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, took command while three
wide in upper stretch, held a narrow lead at the furlong grounds, could not keep pace in deep stretch and weakened late. MR MAKUNOUCHI hesitated at
the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed along the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the second turn,
came in tight nearing the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch, lost position at mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.
DADDY'SDARLINGBOY was a bit keen while forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate pace through the backstretch run and into the far
turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, lost position heading to the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU was sent to
establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, held foes at bay to the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the second turn
and faded in the drive. RACER REX took back off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn and did
not threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO SHINY showed good early speed from the inside, dictated terms to the turn while setting solid fractions, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter
marker, extended the lead to mid-stretch, was given a few reminder taps inside of the furlong pole and was hand urged to the wire as much the best.
MENDHAM MILL was prominent in the run to the turn and raced close to the early pace, chased the pacesetter to the quarter marker while two wide, was
no match for the winner in the drive and was best of the rest. LADY GREGORY stalked the fast early pace, lost position while three wide on the turn, was
not able to keep pace with SHE'S SO SHINY in the stretch, was outfinished for the place in the late stages and just held for the show at the finish. ADAM'S
CREED chased the fast pace from the inside, improved position on the turn, was steered four wide into the stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong, lacked a
late rally and just missed for the show. CREATING MEMORIES exchanged bumped with MANY MARKETS leaving the break, was slow into stride in the
early stages and spotted the field heading to the turn, raced along the inside to the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch and did not threaten in
the late stages. SPANISH CHANNEL was forwardly placed in the early stages and pressed the fast early pace, lost position nearing the quarter marker,
could not keep pace leaving the turn and tired in the stretch. MANY MARKETS traded bumps with CREATING MEMORIES leaving the start, recovered and
showed speed while chasing the quick pace to the turn, was outrun heading to the quarter marker, raced four wide into the stretch and gave way in the
drive.

EM N HOLL'S FIESTA broke alertly, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked GOLDEN PRAYER to the turn, chased from the rail to the quarter pole,
was roused two wide in upper stretch, caught GOLDEN PRAYER inside of the furlong marker, kept to task heading to the sixteenth-pole and drew clear in
the final stages. JERSEY SUNSET was forwardly placed in the early stages, chased the fast pace while two wide on the turn, raced three wide into the
stretch, came within aim at the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner in the final stages and ran on to secure the place. GOLDEN PRAYER
showed good early speed and set the pressured pace into the turn, shook free and drew to a clear lead heading to the quarter market, came under pressure
nearing the furlong pole, weakened in the late stages and was outfinished for the place, while holding safely for the show. ROSE OF MOONCOIN chased
the fast early pace, improved position while two wide on the turn, raced three wide into the stretch and ran evenly in the final furlong. BULLETPROOF TOO
chased from the second flight early on, saved ground into the turn, lost position heading to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. GRAZED N'
CONFUSED chased from the rear in the early going, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and did not factor. DRINK AND A
WINK was away a step slowly, was very green and erratic in the early stages, recovered to chase the pace to the turn, came three wide into the turn,
slipped to the rail in upper stretch and did not threaten.

TWILIGHT EMPIRE was allowed to settle in the early running, improved position along the backstretch run, was roused four wide nearing the top of the
stretch, loomed approaching the furlong marker, overtook PREMIUMONSATURDAY inside of the furlong pole and drew clear under steady urging in the
final stages. PREMIUMONSATURDAY was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the fast fractions through the backstretch run while closest to the
pacesetter, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, felt pressure from TWILIGHT EMPIRE nearing the furlong
grounds, could not match strides with the winner in the late stages and bested the rest. VRONSKY FEINT tracked the solid early pace, maintained position
through the backstretch run, advanced while three wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, weakened in deep stretch and held safely in the end for
third. BANDEENA was unhurried in the early stages, lost position along the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn and did not threaten in the
drive. FEELING FLUSH broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed speed while carving solid fractions to the half-mile pole, maintained a clear
lead to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. ESCAPE FREE (IRE) took back off of the fast early pace,
maintained position through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. AGREETODISAGREE lunged in the air at the
start and spotted the field leaving the break, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, saved ground to the second turn and did not factor in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
ROBIE was well placed in the early stages while saving ground, maintained a rail trip while not far back approaching the quarter marker, angled four wide
into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed fast in deep stretch, came to even terms with I'M DR. O inside of the sixteenth-marker and surged in
the final strides to prevail. I'M DR. O was forwardly placed in the early running, raced four wide into the turn then slipped to the three path nearing the
quarter marker, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch and battled with COMMANDER KHAI to the furlong grounds, raced on even terms with that foe to
the sixteenth-marker, met the bid of ROBIE in deep stretch and was gamely bested at the finish, while holding for second. COMMANDER KHAI was
prominent in the early going and pressed the fast early pace, dueled for the lead on the turn while two wide, battled with I'M DR. O to mid-stretch, raced on
even terms with the top pair in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final strides, while holding safely in the end for third. MR. MASON bobbled leaving
the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to chase the fast early pace, raced three wide into the turn, was steered four wide into the stretch, lost position
nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied in the final stages but was outkicked in deep stretch. WINDRIBBON threw his head at the break and was off slowly,
trailed on the run to the turn, was steered outside of rivals heading to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong
marker but lacked the needed late response and finished evenly. GREAT STORY showed good early speed and set the pressured pace to the turn, dueled
on the lead while carving fast fractions approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and faded in the late stages. LITTLE
CASINO was prominent in the early running, chased the pace while between runners heading to the turn, lost position while two wide nearing the quarter
marker and could not muster a rally in the stretch. RUNKERRY chased the fast early pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not factor in the
final stages.

Footnotes
ENJOY IT STRAIT broke sharply, contested for the early pace going into the first turn, had to settle for a three wide trip then raced in the three or four path
throughout, moved to challenge for the lead approaching he quarter pole, drew even in mid-stretch and drew off impressively in the end. JOHNNY DAR
hustled from the break then seized rail and the lead going into the first turn, was allowed to set moderate fractions on an unpressured lead, hit the head of
the stretch with plenty left, battled gamely with ENJOY IT STRAIT to the furlong pole but was no match in the late stages, holding on well for the place.
ENOS SLAUGHTER broke well then was kept mid-pack through the first half-mile while under a stout hold, was let loose with three furlongs to run, tipped
four wide into the stretch and finished up well to gain third despite ducking in and out under pressure. UNION GIG allowed to settle on the rail through the
early going, gradually improved position down the backstretch, remained inside through the far turn, got a perfect trip into the stretch but could not summon
the needed late rally. OH GREAT (IRE) hustled from the gate but outrun for the rail and the lead, tracked behind and to the outside of JOHNNY DAR down
the backstretch, came under a ride on the far turn, remained with a chance at the top of the stretch but was outfinished in the late stages.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP last away, quickly angled over to the rail before the clubhouse turn, bided time well behind the field to the far turn, came under a ride
past the half mile pole and was never a threat. STATE OF THE UNION near the back of the pack and wide through the first turn, made up a little ground
down the backstretch while still wide, made a brief bid from the three furlong pole then stalled at the top of the stretch under steady pressure.
