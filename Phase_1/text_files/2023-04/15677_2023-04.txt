Footnotes
MS SALLY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and drew off. LILA'S LUCKY LADY pressed
the pace of QUEEN OF LOVE while racing three-wide, moved up to take a brief lead nearing the quarter and gave way to the winner through the final
furlong. BACK TO BUSINESS tried to lug out through the first turn, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and was up for the
show. QUEEN OF LOVE broke sharply to pressured pace from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
COASTAL FOG pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with SCOPELLO into mid-stretch and
drew clear. JOHN'S KID was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and finished with good
late energy. SCOPELLO was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the
five-sixteenths marker, vied and gave way through the final furlong. DIXON TUFF was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished
evenly. HE'S INIT TO WINIT lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAPACITY was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not menace. SPLASH OF LOVE chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. DISRUPTOR MAN was off
slow and lagged far back throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ALLEVA broke sharply to duel for the lead with GOLD CRUSHER while racing four-wide, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and gamely held.
GOLD CRUSHER was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, vied through a
vigorous drive and just missed. XTREME MAYHEM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late
energy. MOSQUITO FLEET lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. STAY HAPPY vied
for the lead from the inside for three furlongs and gave way. FANTASTIC DAY lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EL
MAESTRO showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GRAZEN SUN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenth pole and quickly drew
off. PURE ROCKET settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. SIR
FLATTER lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. STREET HUMOR raced off the pacesetters early, moved
four-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. BRUIN MAGIC was forwardly placed from the inside and gave way in the
drive. ABRAAJ MIRAGE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. BURNLEY set a pressured pace from the inside and gave
way through the final furlong. MACCHIATO D'ORO pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied
and weakened after going a half. SARGENT KLINE stumbled at the start and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GODGUNSNCOUNTRY sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in
control through mid-stretch and held off the closing BIG BROTHER to gamely prevail. BIG BROTHER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn, could not reach the winner but was gaining steadily late. FLASHIN ACES chased the winner while racing three-wide
throughout and failed to gain late. SARGE'S SERMON lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, reached a contending position and
finished evenly late. NEXT JOURNEY was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and gradually gave way. LITTLE RED RIFLE raced off
the pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. TOUR THE WORLD was void of early foot, raced three-wide
through the second turn and did not offer a bid. MY SWEET LORD was off a step slow, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. FAST GALLITO raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to
rally. BLUES RAPPER lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. TIGER HUNTER raced four-wide through
the first turn, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. MINNESOTA RED raced off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
