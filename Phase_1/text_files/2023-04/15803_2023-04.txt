BIG TICKET pressed the pace while three wide, was moving up to duel shortly leaving the turn, took charge in the early stretch to kick clear under a strong
drive prevailing in the end. FIND NEW ROADS bumped foe at the start, then chased the pace while two wide, bid on the turn to rally in the early stretch and
was closing well and was up for the place prize. WINGS FOR ENO lead the way into the turn while two wide, was challenged for the lead by an outer rival
heading into the stretch, dug in gamely but could not retain bid and gave way in the end. GOLD DECLARATION raced behind the field while two wide, was
gaining throughout the turn while four wide to close well in the stretch but it was not enough. NEVER OVER ME was bumped at the start, then stalked the
pace from the inside, settled back throughout the turn to rebid again in the stretch but came up empty in the end. TWELVE PACK chased the pace while five
wide, bid from the three path on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. BRILLIANT COLORS settled behind the field along the inside and failed to
menace. GREYSTOKE bid for the lead early between rivals then dropped back and had no final bid in the stretch.

DARE TO WISH sped up the rail away from the gate to take command approaching the half mile pole, opened a clear advantage in the turn and drew clear
under strong urging as much the best. I AM UP tracked the leaders to the turn, commenced a three wide rally under a drive and finished willingly while
drifting out in the lane as the clear second best. GATHER THE FACTS dueled between horses for the lead for the first quarter mile, dropped back in the turn
and finished evenly. POWER TO PLAY broke alertly and flashed speed for three-eighths and steadily faded. SOLECITA trailed throughout as a non-factor.

HALE'S ANGEL vied to keep the lead from the inside into the turn then edged clear in the early stretch and held on grudgingly to prove best in the end.
PAISLEY CROSS chased the leaders while four wide, was gaining ground gradually throughout the turn to rally in the stretch, gained the place position and
was closing strong but it was not enough to catch the leader. COSTANARMANDALEG chased the pace under a easy stride while two wide, then bid
entering the stretch to close willingly in the end. SOUL SET FREE was under a hard drive to vie for the lead from the three path into the turn, then gave way
and continued to bid evenly throughout the stretch. IGNIS was unhurried early then bid while four wide on the turn and was no threat. METALLIC SILVER
was in a hard drive to bid for the lead between rivals into the turn, was used up in the stretch and tired in the end. SALACIOUSACUSATION trailed
throughout the course, eased in the early stretch and walked across the wire.

pole, rallied four wide and closed well to gain the place. FLIP THE COIN JAN checked off the leaders heels into the first turn, settled into an inside tracking
position to the far turn, waited for racing room at the top of the lane and finished up gamely along the fence to be coming late. MISHKO stalked the leaders
from three wide, loomed up boldly turning for home and was outfinished late. HOLY EMPEROR broke sharp to take the lead from the gate, dropped to the
rail into the first turn impeding FLIP THE COIN JAN, raced on the lead in a duel to the far turn and faded into the stretch. F J'S GEM raced evenly while
never posing a threat. CONVICTION TRADE trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
WAVING BYE moved up along the inside to set the pace heading into the turn, then drew clear in the stretch and held on well under a strong drive. MY
PATRIOTIC GIRL chased the pace from the inside, then rallied throughout the turn and into the stretch while two wide and was best for the place prize in
the end. FAST TRACK lead the way from the gate, then settled back to press the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then gave way in the
late stretch. CANDY BEE chased the pace in the middle of the field while two wide, then bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch. THE NEXT BIG
BLING raced while three wide behind rivals, then bid from the four path on the turn but came up evenly in the stretch. MOLA MIA settled along the inside,
then came out five wide on the turn and was no menace. SKY TIZZY bid for the lead early from the two path, then settled along the inside throughout the
remainder of the course and was no rally.

Footnotes
KELLEY SAID READY broke alertly to take command from the gate, well rated to the turn, drew clear when called upon and widened through the lane under
mild urging in a well measured trip. JIBE tracked the winner from the fence, rallied along the rail to finish willingly as second best. ITS A GEE THING lunged
at the start spotting the field several lengths, steadily advanced through the turn, angled out in the lane and finished full of run. STILL OF THE NIGHT
tracked the pace from between horses in the turn, rallied at the head of the stretch and flattened out late in the drive. MAZI trailed early and made a mild
rally in the stretch. HEAD OVER BOOTS rated in mid-pack while racing three wide throughout and failed to gain. A SONG FOR MICKEY pressed the pace
to the quarter pole and tired. GREY HALO dropped back into the turn and never threatened.

TAPITS KASH dueled for the lead from the inside throughout the first three quarters of the course, then kicked clear in the stretch and held sway till the end.
CINCO RICHIE was under a steady drive to duel with an inner rival down the backstretch and into the far turn, was over taken for the place position by an
outer rival mid stretch but re surged and was able to hold onto the place prize in the end. COWBOY RIDGE stalked the pace while three wide, was gaining
on the far turn to confront the dueling leaders in the stretch, gained to place position in late stretch but was out bid in the end and was best for third.
MOROLICIOUS saved ground while racing down the backstretch along the inside and into the turn, then rallied in the early stretch to close with willingness
in the end. TEXAS HOLDEM chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn to rally in the early stretch but came up evenly in
the end. FANDO chased the pace while two wide, then menaced on the far turn from the three path but came up evenly in the stretch. PHARME'S PHAITH
veered out at the start, then raced in the four path down the backstretch, bid on the turn into the stretch and was no threat. MR B QUIET was unhurried early
then bid while three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. LEGAL EAGLE raced in the the middle of the field while three wide, then dropped back on the

ALMOST DIALED OUT chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then dug in gamely in the upper stretch, gained command and held on well to prevail
in the end. ACCELERATE JUDY chased the pace while four to five wide down the backstretch, menaced on the turn, angled out in the early stretch to avoid
inner rival, then surged to the wire and was best for second place. OUR PASTOR set the pace along the inside, continued to bid from the three path on the
turn, drifted out in the stretch before giving way in the end. SAN MATEO KAT chased the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn while four
wide, angled in mid stretch then continued to close well in the end. CHOJO pressed the pace while two wide, then rallied leaving the turn, drifted out to the
five path mid stretch before giving way in the end. THEREFORE I AM broke outwardly at the start, then was unhurried early along the inside, bid in the
upper stretch but did not respond in the end. DAPHNE'S FIRE was in a hard drive to chase the pace while three wide, then faded throughout the turn and
had no final bid in the stretch. BELLE ELENA trailed throughout and was no factor.

SHEZA CAT awkward leaving the gate at the start giving the field three lengths, steadily improved under patient handling, angled out for the drive and
prevailed under strong handling. IRISH WRIT raced up between horses to duel on the lead, put away the pressers, took command, but was no match for the
winner late. VALLEY VERDE pressed the pace from the rail, loomed up to draw even turning for home and was outkicked to the wire in a good effort.
ROSITA LA CARINOSA dueled with the leader from three wide for a half mile and came up empty for the drive. PERSONAL ISSUES urged from the on-set
leaving the gate and lacked a response to be no threat.

SINGAPORE FLASH prominent early, moved up to press the pace from between horses down the backstretch, moved with CARLEA'S DREAM to take a
short lead in upper stretch, came out to bump that one midway in the lane when hit left-handed impeding his forward momentum momentarily, opened a
short lead and held off the late closer. CAIRO WARRIOR tracked the pacesetters to the far turn, rallied four wide down the lane and closed with a rush to be
up for the place. CARLEA'S DREAM stalked the leaders from three wide down the backside, moved with the winner to duel on the lead turning for home,
was bumped midway in the stretch when the winner ducked out briefly, was knocked off-stride, re-gathered momentum and finished gamely. LOGICAL
MYTH reserved near the rear of the field for a half mile, was forced to travel wide throughout and made late gains in the stretch. GO SPEED RACER GO
raced between horses in striking position to the head of the stretch and failed to sustain a bid. U S NAVY CROSS trailed for most of the way and passed
tiring rivals in the lane. TATANKA sped to an early clear lead, dropped back when challenged and tired. TRULY DANZIG never seriously threatened.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW OF THE REPLAY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE WINNER
INTERFERED WITH THE THIRD PLACE FINISHER AND THE WINNER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.
