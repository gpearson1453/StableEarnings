THAT'STONY'SSISTER set the pace on the inside while being pressed along early, briefly shook free at the quarter pole, then dug in gamely inside in the
stretch drive and determinedly held off the challengers. LOST LUGGAGE broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, angled
out for the drive, commenced a late rally farthest outside and surged in deep stretch. WARRIOR'S RANSOM pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid
on the far turn, dug in gamely in midstretch and rallied between horses late. AFRICAN ANGEL raced three wide on the first turn, stalked outside, chased on
the far turn and made a late bid between horses. SUPER DUPER FLY tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and tired. ALWAJD raced off the rail, off the
pace and was outrun.

MIDNIGHT IN ALASKA flashed good early speed for a clear lead, opened up on the turn, raced off the inside, was shown the crop through the stretch run
and geared down late, handily. SUNDRIA raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, rallied between rivals in the final sixteenth and got
second. VALIANT MAJESTY raced off the pace between rivals, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside rivals in the final furlong and was outkicked for
the place spot. ONTHISHARVESTMOON chased three wide early, chased on the turn, lacked a rally, then was outfinished on the inside for the minor
placings. BOSS LIKE BETH was bumped at the start, chased between rivals and tired. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS raced three wide off the pace and failed to
threaten. BIG TENTATIONS was bumped at the start, chased on the inside, chased on the turn and gave way.

WAGON BOSS set the pace on the inside, edged away on the backside, dueled with KITTEN STREET on the far turn, battled back gamely inside of that
rival past the eighth pole, regained the lead and edged away, driving. SOMEBODY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, then two wide,
advanced on the far turn, commenced a late rally outside in the final sixteenth and got up for second at the wire. KITTEN STREET pressed the pace early
