Footnotes
JACKIE B GOOD dueled outside, took over at the quarter pole, quickly extended her margin and drew away driving. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO saved
ground off the pace, angled out in the stretch and rallied while no threat to the winner. PEACH BE WITH Q earned a narrow advantage inside then proved
empty in the stretch. SAY NO MORE broke alertly and the pressed pace three wide then came up empty. MISBEHAVING LADY dropped well behind inside
and was never in contention. SIRENETTA trailed far behind then passed stopping rival. PRINCESS EMMA JO flashed speed along the rail then stopped
abruptly.

DOUBLE DEALER raced four wide into the first turn, settled close up stalking the leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, took over, pulled away under some
urging and was in hand late. HORNBEAM raced three wide early, settled off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and
dug in for the place spot. HE'SSOSUBTLE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, rallied mildly on the rail and was outkicked for second.
WHATA GUY traliled the field while saving ground, moved up at the quarter pole and closed belatedly on the rail. DADASHEV vied inside for the lead,
dueled on the backside, briefly dueled with the winner on the far turn, then tired. I SAW IT ALL vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the backside and faded.
TRANSFER THE FUNDS raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

in, weakened and was caught in deep stretch. SHIFTINGGEARS raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch, rallied mildly outside and was
along for the show spot. COFFEE WITH ALEX was bumped at the start, raced off the early pace, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied three wide into
the stretch, made a bid and was outkicked. LATE TO THE SHOW was bumped and off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane
and closed belatedly. JACKIE'S PRIDE showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled past the quarter pole and faded in the lane. BOYS AND BULLETS

Footnotes
DRONE SWARM set the pace on the inside while being pressed by HORSE BE WITH YOU, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused,
drifted out some in the stretch run and held well under urging. HORSE BE WITH YOU pressed the pace racing close up outside, chased two wide on the far
turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dug in gamely and held on late to save the place. WILL TAKE CONTROL was a bit reluctant to load, raced three
wide early, then settled off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and closed well late. GRIT'N'GRIND trailed the field, moved up at the quarter
pole and closed belatedly outside. OUTRAGEOUS BET stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and had no rally. ILLUSTRIOUS tracked on the inside,
chased inside on the far turn and tired. STAY HYDRATED raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way.

FINE ONE WON controlled the pace inside, lost the lead at the top of the stretch then came again through the final furlong. MISS DILLINGHAM stalked the
pace outside, bid to the front at the top of the stretch, moved well clear but weakened. MISS LOYALTY dropped far behind inside then showed some late
energy. LULI'S DANCER saved ground, moved closer before half a mile and faltered. IFIHADACHANCE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter outside
and was done on the final turn. SUGAR STREAK chased wide off the pace and gave way readily. GINGERS WISH failed to arrive in the paddock and was
ordered a late scratch. OBSTINATE injured herself in the starting gate and was ordered a late scratch.

Footnotes
DOCTOR DOOM tracked on the inside, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch, ran to the front, drew clear and then held on late,
driving. PREDOMINATE steadied after the start, trailed the field on the inside, advanced at the quarter pole, angled out, rallied outside in the final furlong
and dug in gamely to the finish. BEACHWALKER raced six wide into the first turn, stalked outside rivals, chased four wide on the far turn, rallied mildly in the
lane and earned the show spot. OUCH OUCH OUCH raced four wide early, then pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the far turn, dueled into
the stretch and weakened late. STORIED FELLA set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, dueled into the stretch,
dug in and then weakened. BIRD RULER raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, made a rail bid entering the stretch, then tired. SAINT MARCO
raced five wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to respond. TUANIS raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and did not factor.
