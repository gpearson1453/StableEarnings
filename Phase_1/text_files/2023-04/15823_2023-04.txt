Footnotes
HARD TO COME BY unhurried for five furlongs, swept up strongly to challenge late in the final turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, quickly clear,
drew off to win ridden out. BOLIVER closest to the early leader into the first turn, fell back the middle half, came in the two path for the drive after
encountering some traffic late in the final turn, dropped to the rail, proved no match for the winner, held sway late for the place. OFFSHORE TITHE broke
out, was straightened to settle off the pace, advanced to challenge in the three path midway on the second bend, offered little resistance to the winner upper
stretch, dueled with the runner up past the furlong marker, outkicked for the place by that one late, well clear of the others. HALLOW POINT void of early
foot while five wide into the first turn, remained back, improved off the inside second turn then flattened out through the stretch. MR WORKS in mid pack
and three wide, continued in the three path final turn, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. BORN ON FIRE fell back to trail after the start, steered
out to be four wide when improving a bit midway on the final turn, three wide for the drive, lacked a closing punch. THINKINGNDRINKING was finished after
a half when falling back to trail, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. SCOTT CITY sprinted clear to set the pace before a quarter, maintained
daylight up the backstretch then stopped when headed second turn. SHOTGUN BILLIE forwardly placed along the inside for a half, also stopped second
turn.

Footnotes
WORDS OF WISDOM drew out to a long early lead, extended that advantage in the run up the backstretch, shrugged off a brief and mild bid from the
runner up in the second turn, well clear again through the lane under steady handling. MAKE NOISE void of early foot in the two path, dropped to the inside
and lodged a middle move into the far turn, briefly tried the winner from the outside midway on that bend, proved no match through the lane, fully extended
to hold the second spot. JINGLE last away, moved up to mid pack, one paced along the inside early, moved out a got a bit closer three wide in the second
bend, stalled upper stretch, getting back to the runner up late. MOLIERE four wide into the first turn when lacking speed, continued to lag backstretch, three
down to two path final turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. ESKENFORIT chased the winner early while in the three path, four
down to three wide when beginning to tire far turn, continued to weaken through the lane. EISENSTAEDT five wide into the first turn, remained back in
failing to threaten. PRESS SNOOZE briefly pursued the winner while just off the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL BELLA broke alertly, dueled off the inside in the run up the backstretch, dropped inside turn when clear, drew out through the lane while being
kept to task. GRAYDAWN DAY lacked early foot, steered out to be four wide midway on the turn when beginning to advance midway on the turn, collared
the faltering other early leader inside the the furlong marker and edged clear off that one, no threat to the winner. THORN CROWN dueled early inside the
winner, could not keep up with that one late in the turn and into the lane, weakened further late, caught for the place. DIAL DISH fell back to trail after the
start, saved ground into the turn, two path exiting when improving into the lane, flattened out the final furlong. UNBEARABLE in the second flight early in the
two path, dropped inside midway on the bend, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. ADELE'S BLING steadied into the turn off the inside in
some traffic, angled inside, remained back. GO GO GO within striking distance early while racing three wide, began to tire before a half.

right handed crop. ATTA PARTY vied up front inside the winner into and through the turn, proved no match in the drive, clear for the place. THE HEAT IS
ON void of speed near the inside, swung out sharply to be widest into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip to be up for the show. HIGHTAIL
COWBOY away in good order outside the winner, set or forced the pace three wide, weakened through the lane. STOMPING HOTROD in the second flight
while racing outside, closer four wide midway on the turn, saw that progress stall in the stretch. OJITOS in the main group while saving ground, in tight,
steadied into the turn, fell back and went evenly to the wire. OBVIOUSLY TOO also in mid pack early, dropped inside to tighten OJITOS up into the turn,
continued to save ground into the lane, lacked a rally. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the turn, also came up empty
for the stretch run. WHENTHEDOVESCRY between rivals when with the main body, weakened from between horses. ROCK CITY ROCKET was always

TOWN CHAMP broke outward but alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, headed through the turn, battled back to regain the advantage from that rival
with less than a furlong remaining, dug in when confronted by the runner up from the outside late, held gamely final strides. DIAL IN FOR LUTE off slowly,
raced back and three wide up the backstretch, advanced into contention through the turn, challenged outside the winner late, denied. BRAVO BRAVO in the
second flight while between horses, continued behind traffic turning for home, angled in a bit for room, late interest to be up for the show in the waning
strides. CARL G bothered at the break, raced back and outside, four wide turn, outkicked for the show. NATE'S WAY dueled up front while outside the
winner, narrowly showed the way over that one into and through upper stretch, weakened in the late going. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS back off the pace and
the inside, moved to the inside turn, failed to produce a rally. FRANK THE MAYOR failed to menace while racing three wide. BAKER'S MAN broke back and
was never a threat. RELEASED forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch inside, encountered some traffic into the turn and began to fade.

Footnotes
PARTYINTHESTREETS lacked early foot, angled out sharply to be six wide when making a solid advance exiting the turn, drifted in a bit while continuing to
close the gap on the winner upper stretch, bid past the furlong marker, proved best. HIT SCENE away in good order, narrowly set the pace closest to the
inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home to be clear, responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong to run, proved
stubborn to the end. SIR PEEL in mid pack early while three wide, moved closer from the three path down to two through the turn, proved no match for the
top pair in the drive, held the show. CHALECO vied early three wide and between horses, shuffled back early in the turn, moved out four wide when
creeping a bit closer exiting the bend, outkicked late for the show. KISSOFTHENILE with the early pace outside, vied four to three wide through the turn,

Footnotes
BOAT SONG last to leave, moved up steadily the opening furlong to reach the second flight, came three wide for the drive, challenged between horses late,
narrowly gained the nod at the wire. EFFICIENCY broke back, lacked speed, four wide into the stretch when beginning to advance, challenged on the
outside late, led, missed nod. BETTYS CASH broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, continued to lead late, could
not contain the top two while inside that pair at the wire. ALPHA WHISKEY in the second flight while along the inside, went evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing punch. SINNER'S SIN dueled up front for a half off the inside then could not keep up. UNCAPTURED SKY dropped inside early in the turn,
saved ground to no avail. IGNITIS fell back to trail, steered out three wide by late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. K C ROCKET 2nd group, closer three
wide turn, faltered in the drive. SIR STERLING finished early, trailed home.

tough late to earn the dead heat. ULTIMATE settled in mid pack while outside, five wide into the lane, closed with good resolve to be in time for part of the
win. JACKMAN broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch inside, continued to contest the issue into and through the stretch, gave ground grudgingly
to the top two to prove stubborn to the finish. LAKE RADIO vied up front in the four path, weakened in the late going from between horses. SEVEN NATION

up in time. BRIARTOWN lacked speed off the inside after breaking a step slow, four to five wide when rallying into the lane, floated out and bothered at the
furlong grounds by a drifting TAP THAT DIAL, overcame that incident to challenge between foes late, bothered by WOODY'S CHOICE who came out, in the
waning strides, outkicked in the late going by the winner inside that one. WOODY'S CHOICE broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch and into the
turn, maintained daylight into the stretch, continued to lead inside the furlong grounds when he lugged out to impede the runner up, faltered to be overtaken
by the top two late. TAP THAT DIAL in mid pack early outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting when advancing, drifted out nearing the furlong
marker to tighten up the runner up, stalled late to finish up evenly. TUNGSTEN in the second flight while in the three path, moved closer late in the turn and
into the lane, came out upper stretch, weakened the final furlong. PERFECT THUNDER one paced throughout while racing three wide. WINDTAPPER WIN
hesitated at the start, trailed early when devoid of speed, steered 3w midturn, passed tiring foes late while not a serious threat. REELED IN remained back
while racing four wide. SPARKIN forwardly placed while off the inside, had little left for the drive. UNBOWED pressed early inside, continued to chase into
the turn, gave way in the drive. PINE COVE off slowly, moved up to race in mid pack the opening quarter, stopped early in the turn, eased stretch, walked
in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BRIARTOWN AGASINT THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
