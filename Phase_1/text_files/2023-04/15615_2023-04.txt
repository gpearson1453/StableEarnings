Footnotes
D K'S CROWN lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew clear. CALIBOGEE was away
in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, vied into deep stretch and gave way. TRIBAL IMPACT settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good late energy. DIAMOND WILLOW was away in good order to
dispute the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. LIVING VICARIOUSLY was reserved just off the leaders early, saved
ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, offered a bid in mid-stretch and gave way late. W. WHITEHOUSE lagged early, raced five-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. ZATTER was off a step slow, rushed to contend, moved four-wide through the turn, weakened and was vanned off.
THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

FOREST ACCLAMATION sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. ANOTHER TEN was away in good
order to chase the winner while racing four-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. THE COMRIE RULE
was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. ZARAGOZA lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
finished evenly. SLOWDOWNTOGOFAST bobbled at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, weakened and was eased
through the lane. TAKIN SHOTS was off a step slow, lagged throughout and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
AGADOR SPARTACUS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and wore down LIMITED HEATWAVE in the closing
yards to be going away late. LIMITED HEATWAVE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch,
remained in control through mid-stretch but could not match strides with the winner late. TWICE FOOLED chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
gave way through the final furlong. CAPIAT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished
evenly. UNUSUAL DANCER bobbled at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. YANKEE GO
HOME was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. THE O G showed brief speed and weakened, THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the leaders with a sixteenth to run but could not stay with the top pair. J
T'S A. T. M. was away in good order to duel for the lead with HIT THE SEAM while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and gave way
through the final sixteenth. GOLD RUSH CANDY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. MIRROR IMAGE lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HIT THE SEAM broke sharply to dispute the pace with JT'S A. M. T. from the inside and

Footnotes
PEPPER MILL was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. SHEZ OUR ARCH was
reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied late. SECRET MISTRESS broke sharply to
chase the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, led, vied and gave way through the final sixteenth. TWELVE STARS
lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole, bumped with FAT AND FURIOUS, then
finished with good energy. FAT AND FURIOUS showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, bumped with TWELVE STARS and finished
evenly. TA TA FOR NOW settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. GOLD COAST GIRL was void of early
foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. DREAMER GIRL sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and
weakened after going three-quarters. MISS GHISLAINE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
