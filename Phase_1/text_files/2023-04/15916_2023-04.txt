Footnotes
B D R DRAGSTER tracked pace along the inside, inherited lead when rivals carried out wide, kept to task in deep stretch to hold. B D R BAXTER led along
the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, began to lug out midway through the turn and into the lane, ended up in the five path
coming into the stretch, lugged back in the lane and came back in a game try. LAMPY bit slow and bumped in at the start, was on heels midway through the
backstretch, finally steading approaching the turn, stayed along the rail on the turn and rallied in between rivals in the lane. MONGOLIAN BOX chased
leader two wide on the backstretch, continued on the leaders flank on the turn, carried out into the six path late on the turn, and kept on in the lane to lose
third late. RUN JONESZ BEGONEZ came in at the start, tracked pace in between rivals, launched bid two wide entering the lane, and flattened out final
sixteenth. DIVINELY DIVERSE broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked pace three wide, floated out into the four or five path on the turn and lacked a
bid in the lane. RUN KING STUD RUN tracked pace three wide throughout and failed to respond when asked. OMAHA RUTSCH stalked pace four wide on
the backstretch, tried to hold position entering the turn but floated out by DIVINELY DIVERSE into the six path on the turn, after being passed went near the
rail and came up empty in the lane. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW B D R BAXTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED BEHIND MONGOLIAN

THOUGHTS TO REMEMBER bit slow and bumped on both sides at the start, bumped on hind end passing the gap, asked right handed midway, and
responded to edge away in a game effort. BASKING away well, lugged in passing the eighth pole, asked left handed, while being outkicked by inside rival.
TRENDING RIGHT bit slow, bumped into rival at the start, crowded and bumped passing the gap, kept in a tight position until the sixteenth pole, lugged out
late and earned third while under wraps. WATCHFULLY broke in and bumped rival twice at the start, leaned in lugged in first fifty yards, lugged out when
crossed over midway, and never asked for run. FERVENTS SPIRIT broke out and bumped rival at the start, drifted in two paths early, asked twice right
handed passing the gap and kept on evenly.
