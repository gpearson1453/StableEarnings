MAD GOLD raced in the middle of the pack, moved up around the turn, made a stretch bid, racing five wide and got up late. GENIUS pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, made a bid, took the lead down the lane, but was caught late for the win. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN raced in the middle of the
field, made a late wide bid, finished willingly and was outfinished by the top two. VEGAS GUY dueled on the front end, raced close throughout and lacked a
late kick. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE was an early factor, eased back and went to the wire evenly. MAJESTIC MANDATE lacked early speed, improved
position, but was no factor. MEAN CRUISER bumped at the start, raced near the middle of the pack and was no threat. FUNNY ACTOR bumped at the
start, raced in the back and showed little. MR ELVIN raced evenly near the back and was never close. COURAGEOUS TIMMY always raced near the back
and was outrun. MY LITTLE JUNIOR vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. MR LIBERTY showed early speed and

Footnotes
MAGEEZ lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied wide down the home stretch and was going away. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE raced within
contention, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead the final stretch, drove clear, but proved no match for the winner late. FREEDOMFI raced in the
middle of the field, racing outside around the first turn, moved up, made a bid and proved third best. BINDING raced evenly near the back, made a mild bid,
finished wide and was no factor. GUITARZAN sprinted to the front, drove clear and tired. PAYDAY TOO void of early speed, moved up, but was no factor.
FLASHING ANGELBABY pressed the pace and was finished early. TAKEN BACK always raced near the back and showed little. GRIEF raced near the
middle of the field and retreatedd. CYPRIANO raced within contention in the early going and made a steady retreat.

early speed, made a late wide rally, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. CUSTOM DESIGN pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, but proved no match for the top two. HALF PAGE raced near the middle of the field, eased back, showed late interest, but was no factor.
BUILDING HOME raced near the back in the beginning, came around the turn wide, moved up, but was no threat. SHEZA SALTY GAL lacked early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. ZEATRICAL void of early speed, moved up and hung. HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT always raced near the back and
showed little. MY LITTLE MIA was an early factor and faded down the home stretch. MISS TARGET raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back.
