Footnotes
ALTERNATE REALITY broke out at the start, settled well off the pace under some urging, saved ground while ridden along on the turn, gained in the two
path passing the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into the stretch, took the advantage at the three-sixteenths while remaining on his inside lead under a
left-handed crop, shook clear outside the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed crop while still on his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole, continued
on the left-lead to the wire and proved best under strong handling. MAJESTIC MICHAEL was hustled from the start, showed speed then chased the pace,
went around the turn in the three path, took the lead inside the three-eighths, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, kept on well in pursuit of the
leader in the stretch and earned the place. PHELPSY was bumped by an outside foe at the start then slow into stride, raced at the rear under urging,
traveled around the turn in the two path, came five wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop while moving into contention, held a reasonable striking
position under a strong drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick but finished willingly for the show. D HOPPER broke in and bumped with a
foe, was forwardly placed on the outside, moved closer leaving the backstretch, issued a challenge in the four path on the turn, took the lead outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. VENGE was a bit slow into stride, settled
off the pace then dropped well back, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor. FINN'S MOMENT went to the front then moved clear with six
furlongs to run, was challenged while in the two path early on the turn, lost the advantage inside the three-eighths pole, dropped back into the stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
YUKATA (IRE) settled unhurried tracking the front just off the inside from mid pack, tipped three wide three furlongs from home and came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. CANISY
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug
in under challenge rebuffing the threat of WONKA a furlong out confronted by the top one, dug in and was collared near the sixteenth pole, ran on to just
hold on for the place honors. ARINA (GER) tracked the pace along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped to the two path through
the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to kick on belatedly to the
finish just missing the place honors on the wire. BRAMBLE BAY coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish. WONKA just off the inside in pursuit in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, swung three wide into upper stretch and was heads apart for command briefly straightened away
before being shaken off inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. TONED UP broke a beat slow without incident, saved ground at the tail of
the field coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

DOT'S DOLLAR showed speed then dropped just off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path, angled five wide outside the quarter-pole,
rallied to the lead in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up until inside the furlong marker then drew away under steady urging. ROTKNEE was
hustled from the gate, showed speed on the outside then contested the pace, vied in the three to four path around the turn, lost the advantage to the winner
in upper stretch, battled with that foe until inside the furlong marker and proved no match then drifted in while well clear for the place. EXCELLENT TIMING
was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired while clear for the
show. PRESSURE was hustled from the outset, climbed into kickback at the rear nearing the five-eighths, was ridden along at the back, saved ground
around the turn and was no factor. BEZOS showed speed then dropped back late on the backstretch, fell further back in the two path around the turn and
retreated.

MAGICAL WAYS showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, swung four wide into
upper stretch and was roused straightened away, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in holding well and clear to the finish kept to task. SUCCEED coaxed
from the gate, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home cutting into that rival's margin late while along well clear of the rest and second best. STEADY
PROGRESS six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. FINANCIAL STRENGTH chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. GLOBAL IMAGE stumbled at the break and was
bumped by GOLDEN PURCHASE and then PEJA DU at the start, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the
three=-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. PEJA DU broke in at the start bumping the rear of GLOBAL IMAGE, chased seven to
eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then six wide through the turn, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
GOLDEN PURCHASE broke out at the start bumping GLOBAL IMAGE, chased six wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued six wide into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SPIKED raced in the three path around the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under strong urging late on the backstretch, raced inside to the
two path for most of the far turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, rallied four wide into the stretch, chased outside the leader into the final furlong then
made a bid and got up in the final sixteenth to narrowly prevail. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY went to the front, raced in the three path around the first turn,
showed the way with a clear advantage, remained clear in the two to three path on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, led under a drive
into the sixteenth, drifted out at that point and was caught while clear for the place. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN traveled around the first turn in the three path,
settled off the pace, was urged three wide around the far turn, gained under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to get the show. ANATOLIAN
saved ground on the first turn, was urged along towards the rear, fell back leaving the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, gained under a drive into
upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed response and flattened out. LIAM'S KISS raced inside to the
two path on the first turn, was well placed down the backstretch, moved out while asked at the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide around most the far turn
then moved to the four path, was driven five wide into the stretch and weakened. VEGAS WEEKEND was hustled from the start then caught five wide
around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, came up empty after going five furlongs, went around the far turn in the five path and retreated. INTO
HAPPINESS was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, retreated in
the four then five path on the final turn, floated six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
REFUAH prompted the pace seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole and took over command swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole under a right handed crop,
had the rider switch to the left hand and came outwards two paths herding INSPECTOR slightly near the sixteenth marker, dug in with that rival latching on
and came out once more under a left handed swat bumping that foe before holding safe to the finish. INSPECTOR eight paths off the inside down the
backstretch in aim of the front, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive rallying through the final furlong and getting herded a bit near the sixteenth marker while holding mostly to the path behind the leader rather
than altering out, latched on to the outside of REFUAH just inside that station and had that rival come out once more getting bumped in the left shoulder and
forcing the rider to pause and stand up in the irons in the final strides to the finish. METEORITE showed the way in hand four then three wide hounded by a
trio, tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths under challenge from RULE BREAKER to the inside, yielded the front with
five-sixteenths to go and swung four wide into upper stretch loosely between foes, dug in under a drive angling out a furlong out and came again to secure
the show honors in a good first effort. BATTLEOFLEXINGTON chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick to secure the last major share. RULE
BREAKER just off the inside in aim of the front, advanced to press the pace through the turn taking narrow and brief command placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, got headed and spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. I'M JUST bobbled at the break, chased three to
four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WANNA WINNA six paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no
rally. UNAFFECTED bobbled at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and
tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of INSPECTOR alleging interference against REFUAH in the
stretch. After review, it was deemed that REFUAH had interfered with INSPECTOR and therefore REFUAH was disqualified from victory and placed second
for that interference before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
UNION DOLLY was off a step slow, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, ranged up in the two path on the far turn, took
the lead at the quarter-pole then kicked clear while set down in upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and proved much the best under strong
urging. FROM HELLO brushed with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path,
was roused late on that bend, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out, was caught behind a drifting foe coming to the furlong marker then
altered course to the outside for room and finished with good courage to garner the place. UP HER SLEEVE went three wide on the first turn, settled off the
pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was given her cue inside the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch then chased the winner, drifted out
approaching the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. LADY OF THOROTON had her saddle adjusted behind the gate, leaned out at the start
then dropped well behind while sluggish early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved at the rear, advanced three then four wide on the far turn,
gained six wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed response. BRISKY FROLIC went to the front,
traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside under extra left-rein guidance around the final turn, lost the
advantage to the winner coming to the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch then came out further around the furlong marker and tired. GAME THEORY
broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with an opponent, was taken in hand early then reserved while saving ground, came under encouragement late on the
backstretch, lost her footing in the hindquarters at the three-eighths, moved closer along the rail passing the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and lacked the needed response. R GIRL FAITH broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded,
showed speed after breaking in front, was shut-off by BRISKY FROLIC just past the wire for the first time then steadied, stalked outside in the three path,
was asked on the far turn and came up empty. BELLA PRINCIPESSA went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty while
four then five wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
KHALI MAGIC showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down taking the two path into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive kept to task. SWEET
MYSTERY chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. THINKING IT OVER chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into
upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. AMITY ISLAND chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and improved position to the finish. STONE CREATOR stumbled at the start, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch advancing to
prompt the leader from the outside, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, continued three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. MIA BEA STAR chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and tired. BAVARIAN CREME chased
along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DON'T LET ME DOWN settled off the pace, saved ground while patiently handled around the turn, waited behind horses into upper stretch, was asked while
finding room along the rail inside the three-sixteenths, exploded through to take the lead just inside the furlong marker and powered away under a hand-ride
to prove much the best. NIEUWENDYK was hustled from the start, angled in while showing speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied near the
rail on the turn, moved to the two path under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and proved no match
while just able to get the place. FATHER OF LIES was fractious behind the gate, established a forward position early, was rated just off the pace on the
inside, came off the rail around the five-sixteenths then paused while wanting to move forward, gained to make a bid between foes into upper stretch,
battled under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place. BRASS MONKEY was taken in hand between
foes early then rated off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, brushed with a rival in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the
stretch, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and tired then brushed with a foe late. LEO FONG was off a step slow, settled towards the
rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and capitulated then brushed with a foe
late. SWAY'SINMYDNA moved in while showing speed then was taken in hand between horses, settled outside from that juncture, went three to four wide
on the turn, brushed with an opponent near the five-sixteenths, made a brief bid into upper stretch but came up empty. OLD POINT broke a step slow, was
hard ridden while well behind, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor. WEALLLIKEDHIM was hustled from the gate,
contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded.
