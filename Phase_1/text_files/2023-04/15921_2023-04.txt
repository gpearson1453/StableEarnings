Footnotes
HEART TO BEAT dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and edged clear late under strong handling. TOMMY'S UP dueled along the rail early on
and kept on to be second best. PRIVATE TRAX chased early on, raced three to five wide in the lane and moved up to improve position. LEAF OF WISDOM
raced mid pack early on, moved up from the inside into the lane and improved position. AL GRANO D ORO chased from the outside racing four wide, was
six deep near the eighths pole and weakened late. PINEY BLUFF dropped back early, raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no response.
PALICAT BOYS dropped back with the second flight early, raced five to six wide in the stretch and lacked a bid. R U TIZZIN' ME was off slowly and never
was a factor. CHA CHING CHARLIE was hustled along throughout, raced near the rail past the three sixteenths pole and faded.

Footnotes
REAL ME chased the early pace, moved up five wide and got up under all out pressure. ARIA APERTA dueled along the rail, dug in late and gave way
grudgingly. FAST AND FEVEROUS raced mid pack early on, was four wide in the lane, angled in and rallied willingly to the wire. CRIMSON T. was hustled
along, raced two to three wide and had not enough. MISS ABILITY dropped back early, moved up from the inside in the lane and improved position. LITTLE
PET KITTY was shuffled at the break, raced evenly and had no late response. HEAR ME ROAR dueled for the early lead from the outside and gave way.
SINGING DELIGHT was hustled along, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and weakened. STORMY DAME veered out sharply at the break,
dropped back early and never was a factor. IMAMONEYMAKER failed to respond.

Footnotes
WREXHAM pressed the early leader from the outside two wide, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and prevailed late under strong handling while racing
four wide. MISS JAX dropped back early, moved up from the inside in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. ANDREABANANAS chased early on,
raced from the outside in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. MARGOT raced mid pack early, fanned wide into the upper stretch and made a good
late gain. MIDNIGHT DARE was off slowly, raced two to three wide and raced even late. SUMMER PUDDING was quick to begin, had a clear lead early
and weakened the final eighth of a mile. REALLY A STORM raced mid pack early, was four to five wide in the stretch and had no response. LA DIOSA was
off slowly, raced five wide and never threatened. POW WOW lunged at the break and unseated his jockey.
