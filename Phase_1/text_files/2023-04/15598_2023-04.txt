Footnotes
WESTOVER unhurried early along the inside, began to advance when asked along midway on the second bend, in some traffic with a quarter remaining,
moved out into the two path and between horses into the lane, took over, clear, steady handling. BACKGATE RED devoid of early foot, three wide when still
trailing far turn, moved out widest for the drive, closed willingly to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. REUP took control along the inside past
the wire the first time, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way second turn, began to gradually weaken when headed by the winner in
upper stretch. STREET COMMANDER lacked early speed while three wide through the first turn, raced in the two path second bend, improved a bit down
the lane while not a serious threat. TOPF ROAD RULES within striking distance, came up empty for the drive. AL'S ROMEO in the second flight while three
wide, floated out four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. BRASKA last away, was never a threat. MO CHOCTAW chased the leader off the inside
for six furlongs, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
BEN DREAMING in the second flight for five furlongs along the inside, steered out three wide when advancing on the two leaders late in the final turn,
challenged turning into the lane, long duel to the wire, proved narrowly best under firm handling in a determined effort. KID SHELLEEN prompted the leader
in the three path, took over in the far turn, responded when the winner came alongside with a quarter to run, proved stubborn to the end but was outkicked
late. CHROME RUN lacked speed, rank while three wide onto the backstretch, settled in the run up the backstretch, four to five wide turning for home,
proved no match for the top two, comfortably clear of the others. ROYAL AIR FORCE off slowly, pulled while trailing early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while never a threat. HARD TO COME BY with the main body while five down to four wide first turn, tired after six furlongs. WELLWRIT broke alertly, set the
pace in the two path, stopped when headed.

Footnotes
SWEET NELLIE behind the rapid early pace in the two hole, asked along late in the turn, two path into the lane and between foes, challenged nearing the
furlong grounds, took over, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. INSENSITIVE in mid pack early while between foes, three wide through the
turn, roused for the drive outside, getting to the winner in the waning strides while too late. I'M BETH DUTTON broke sharp, allowed the leader to go early,
chased that one into and through the turn in the three path, lodged a brief bid outside the winner in midstretch, flattened out in the final furlong. VALIANT
PRAISE last away, lacked speed toward the inside, two path for the drive, improved through traffic while finding her best stride too late. I'M SO FUNNY
lacked speed, raced in the two path through the turn, improved inside of rivals upper stretch, also failed to sustain that advance the final furlolng. STAY
FABULOUS bac off the pace well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, failed to muster. SUPER CINDY in the second flight early inside, shuffled back
into the turn, remained back through the lane. SHE'S A ROCKET sprinted clear soon after the start while setting a rapid opening quarter, continued to show
the way through the turn, stopped approaching midstretch, returned bleeding. FREE WILL back off the pace and the inside, five wide turning for home, tired
through the stretch.

Footnotes
UPSTRIKER off a step slow, in the second flight inside, continued to save ground through the turn, slipped thru the rail inside the leader past the furlong
marker, edged clear under a firm hand ride. ACEHIGH ROYAL broke on top, dueled up front on the outside up the backstretch, continued to vie through the
turn, gained a larger advantage when straightened for home, could not match the winner late, clearly second best. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE lacked speed,
four wide through the turn, lacked a closing punch through the lane. RUM 'N TONIC away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to hold a
narrow advantage through the turn, allowed the winner the inside into the stretch and began to weaken. GRAPNEL off a step slow, in the second group
between foes, traffic with four and a half furlongs to run, clear for the drive, lacked kick two path. TITLE SHOT off a step slow, raced back while well out in
the strip, five wide into the lane, not a threat to the wire. YACHT ROCK (IRE) within striking distance three wide, bit closer in the turn, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
JUILLIARD away in good order, pressured the leader in the two path under firm restraint for five furlongs, advanced and challenged between foes second
turn, held a slight advantage past the furlong marker, proved best in the late going in a determined effort. NYQUICK stalked the pace from the three path,
continued in a forward position up the backstretch, advanced on the two leaders in the three path in the second turn, vied on the outside into the lane,
outkicked by by the winner in the late going while holding sway for the place. UNLOAD took control along the inside into the first turn, set the pace while
rating in the run up the backstretch, responded when confronted by the top two in the second turn, weakened the final furlong, saved the show. SOUTHERN
SUNSET settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground into and through the final turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to be gaining for the
show spot late. GATLINBURG angled in midpack first turn to be in the two path, three wide through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch in
lacking a closing kick. SIMOVIC within striking distance in the first turn in traffic and toward the inside, two path second turn, lacked a closing kick to also
finish up evenlly. TEXAS PRIDE off slowly, trailed well back and along the inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late after the issue had been decided.
MAD HUSTLE remained back while racing five wide through the second turn. CITIZEN lacked speed outside, tired.

Footnotes
TRAFALGAR four wide through the first turn when lacking speed, advanced three wide to a forward position second turn, outside bid just inside the furlong
marker, drew clear under pressure. PATS PROPERTY sprinted clear from the two path first turn, pace, responded when challenged turning for home,
headed, a furlong out, proved no match for the winner late, came back in game fashion for the place. CONSPIRACY FACT forwardly placed while just off
the inside, challenged in the two path turning for home, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, weakened in the late going to be outkicked for the place.
ANTIGRAVITY lacked speed, raced outside, four wide through the second bend, improved position through the lane without posing a serious threat.
MAJOR GENERAL went one paced in the two path, lacked closing kick. SAQEEL in mid pack while racing three wide, moved inside for the second bend,
failed to make an impact through the stretch. MAGOO with the winner early, fell back and moved out into the two path, chased up the backstretch and
began to weaken far turn. CHARTER OAK raced back off the early pace, finished after a half. WINTERWOOD off slow, fell back to trail, made some
progress upper stretch, gave way late, jogged across and was vanned off.
