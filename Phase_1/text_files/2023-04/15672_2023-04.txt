Footnotes
ABHAILE controlled the pace inside, was never challenged then remained clear throughout driving. VALERIE FIRST raced in closest pursuit of the
pacesetter then went evenly late to easily hold the place. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD dropped back early then passed rivals without threatening. JUST STAY
HOME settled far back outside and lacked a solid rally. CANOOCHEE trailed early then passed fading rivals. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE dropped back after
the start then moved wide on the final turn. JULIET'S MUSIC raced off the pacesetter inside and gave way after half a mile. MANI PEDI gave way readily
losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
EMPEROR'S CAUSE raced five wide entering the first turn, angled over, tracked on the inside, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail, closed
steadily in the final furlong and dug in gamely late to get up. SENSIBLE JIM vied inside for the lead, dueled with ESOR on the backside, gave up the lead at
the half mile marker, re bid two wide on the far turn, took over, moved away, then dug in gamely in the two path in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly at
the end. LIBERTY RUNNER was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, rallied mildly inside and earned the show spot. MORE THAN A DANCE raced five
wide early, then stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. MAJOR CAM raced off the rail, off the pace,
advanced on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and had no rally. ESOR dueled two wide for the lead, took over past the half mile marker, then dropped
back on the far turn and weakened. PETER G. FOX raced off the pace, saved ground throughout and failed to threaten. EXCLUSIVE ORDER was outrun
early, came three wide into the lane and did not factor. LUCKY MUCHO MAN raced off the pace between rivals and tired. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE raced
four wide early, settled off the pace, chased four wide on the far turn, six wide into the lane and faded. CONNECTING raced four wide on the first turn,
settled three wide off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
TILSA raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled with CABRA CHICA passing the sixteenth
marker and then drew clear. CABRA CHICA tracked the leaders racing along the inside, rallied four wide into the stretch, made a solid bid in midstretch,
then dueled with the winner and came up second best. TAKE CHARGE ERICA dueled between rivals for the early lead, dueled two wide on the turn, briefly
lost her path at the eighth pole, then dug in and held well for third. HIGHTIME VALENTINE trailed the field, moved up five wide at the quarter pole, rallied
mildly outside and was outfinished for the show spot. THIS ROUND'S MINE dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, drifted out nearing the furlong
marker and tired. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD raced off the rail, off the pace, went four wide at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. TIZ GRACIE stalked outside,
chased on the turn and had no rally. MAZAL EIGHTEEN dueled three wide for the lead and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
CARPE ALL DAY pursued the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch and pulled away under moderate urging. ALMOND CIDER hustled to a clear
advantage, was collared on the turn and proved easily second best. RUN FOR KARL raced close up near the inside then flattened out in the stretch. NET
WORTH saved ground off the pace and gained late on the third finisher. UNCLE MARK dropped well behind and was never in contention. ASH OF MY
ENEMY lacked speed and was never a factor. PAGETT raced wide, moved briefly closer on the turn then faded. ALIGNMENT trailed for half a mile and was
always outrun. SHARP SENSATION flashed speed along the inside then stopped abruptly.

BIG CHEEKS content to trail the field, moved up on the far turn, came wide into the stretch, rallied steadily outside, finished willingly in the final sixteenth
and won going away. FLASHNDYNAMITE vied inside for the lead, maintained a short advantage on the backside, shook free on the far turn, drew clear,
then was no match for the winner and dug in to save second. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED raced two wide off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn,
closed belatedly inside and earned the show spot. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM vied two wide for the early lead, pressed BIG CHEEKS along on the backside,
chased on the far turn and weakened. BILLIEANNE raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and then lacked a stretch rally.

OUT DANCING forced the pace outside, led at the quarter pole, brushed with rival in deep stretch and held that one safe. ET'S MOON MAIDEN stalked the
pace inside, angled wide into the stretch, brushed dueling with the winner and could not get by. TITANIC ROSE lagged far behind then offered some late
energy to gain show. SCINTILLATING STAR was urged three wide just off the pacesetters and proved empty in the stretch. COACH HAS SIX ACES earned
a narrow advantage inside, vied through the turn and faltered. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run and the rider of the second finisher
claimed foul against the winner but the result was allowed to stand.

MIA TOSCA settled off the pace, bid outside into the stretch then wore down the leader in the final stages. OUR UPTOWN GIRL reserved just off the
pacesetters, rallied clear in midstretch, continued willingly but was nailed. CHELSEA WALL dropped far behind, advanced wide and closed with a rush too
late. CAUSE I SAID forced the pace outside, remained close to the top of the stretch and weakened. JEZEBEL JADE dropped far behind inside early then
passed rivals while no threat. DANCING ON MY OWN saved ground close up then began fading on the turn. MOONBOOTS hustled to the front inside, vied
through the turn then faded. ARUMA raced off the pace in the two path and was never a factor. DARLING DONNA dropped back along the rail and
