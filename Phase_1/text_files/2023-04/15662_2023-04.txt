Footnotes
SHANGHAI WARRIOR bumped mildly with the horse to his outside at the start, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming
around the turn, kicked clear in the lane and held that margin to the wire while drifting late. ROYAL SQUEEZE raced off the pace between horses early,
continued around the bend in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SMASH FACTOR led the way up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, and weakened in the final furlong. SHED A TEAR bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, settled off the pace on
the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and never threatened. BOURBON OVER ICE raced off the pace on the
inside through the opening quarter mile, navigated the turn from the two path and showed no kick.

FAMILY BAND raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming
around the far turn and kicked clear in the lane. TEA'S DREAM raced in the two path early, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the five path coming around the far turn and gained ground late. AFTER A FEW raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path and gained ground late. FROSTY SECRET saved ground
around the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the three path and chased on to the wire.
AMORE MOON stalked the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the four path around the far bend and kept on in the lane. PLANE
JANE was reluctant to load, broke well and saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn
and weakened in the final furlong. NO MORE FIRE saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around
the second turn and never threatened. SYLLABUS raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up
the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. BLACK KARMA raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch at the
back of the pack on the outside, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and was empty from there. MARTINI'S AMICA reared up at the start,
never left the gate and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE ONE,
MARTINI'S AMICA, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.
