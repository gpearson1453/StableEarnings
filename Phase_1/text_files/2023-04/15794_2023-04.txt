Footnotes
RAY AREWETHEREYET moved three and four wide to bid into the far turn, moved clear nearing the lane and held the margin under steady handling. R
ONE WINE rallied four wide in the far turn to have aim but could not close on the winner. CHIVE UP moved four wide to bid into the far turn but could not
sustain the move nearing the lane. JACK'S PARTY GIRL was on the early pace three to four wide outside rivals and weakened. WILDWOOD MAGGIE
dwelt at the break and came away well behind the field, saved ground and moved up while never a threat. NINA EN FUEGO was not a factor. CELTICS
WILDCAT showed some early speed but was finished before the far turn. BAYLEYWICK was briefly involved three wide and tired.
