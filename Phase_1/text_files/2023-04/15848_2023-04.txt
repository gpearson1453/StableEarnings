Footnotes
J T'S A. T. M. pressed the pace of TIM'S BUDDY while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run and edged away late. TIM'S BUDDY
was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch and gave way late. KELLER'S GOLD was off a
step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. LONELY PRIVATE pressed the pace from the inside and
gave way in the drive. PERFECT FANNY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was up for the place. SCOPELLO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn,
reached a contending position but failed to sustain his rally. BIG WAY chased the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and lacked the needed
closing response. KNOCKOUT GUY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. REKLEINING chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. CROWN PROSECUTOR was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. GRANITIANSEVENSIX was off slow and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
PRAYER OF JABEZ was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off.
ALLEVA sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not match strides with the winner
late. BEDROCK settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. RONAMO
chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. GRAZEN SUN broke sharply to chase the leaders from between foes
and gave way after going a half. HEY NOW was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. SO CAL MEMORY was
void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. ROSE GIRL lagged, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
