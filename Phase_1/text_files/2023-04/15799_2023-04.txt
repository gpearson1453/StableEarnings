Footnotes
MOST WANTED MAN saved ground well off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane, closed outside and was up in
deep stretch. ADMIRAL'S WAVE saved ground in range, checked near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide in
upper stretch, closed inside of the winner and was outkicked. CHENTI stalked the pace two and three wide, steadied near the three-eighths pole, churned
on three wide and was up for the show late. MONEY MAP led early, settled back inside when ACAMAR was intent on the lead around the first turn, tipped
out to stalk that foe down the backstretch, re-bid two wide around the far turn, regained command near the quarter pole, inched ahead in midstretch, led
past the sixteenth pole and was swallowed up late. ACAMAR set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared off down the backstretch, vied inside
around the far turn, fought on past the sixteenth pole and weakened late. FEELING saved ground and failed to menace. AMERICA'S GUEST was bumped
after the start, raced three wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. NORFIE bumped with ROCK THE WEEKEND at the start, chased the pace three
wide, angled in midway around the far turn and faded in the stretch. LIEUTENANT JACK was outrun inside. RULE IT bumped with VOICE AN OPINION at
the start and then when AMERICA'S GUEST soon after, raced four wide and never threatened. ROCK THE WEEKEND was bumped at the start and again
soon after, raced two wide and made little impact. VOICE AN OPINION was bumped at the start and shut off soon after then was never close while saving
ground.

Footnotes
THE MRS rated in the two path, was under coaxing passing the three eighths pole, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, rallied outside a trio of
adversaries into the final furlong, and was up for the win in closing stages. SOPHIA'S STORM chased around the five path, was driven along while tipping
out to the six path into the stretch, ran on and briefly led nearing the sixteenth pole, but was quickly overtaken by an outer foe to finish with place honors.
SONICUS prompted the pace in the three path into the turn, took command from the two path passing the three eighths pole, opened up slightly from the
four path into the stretch, but evened out passing the eighth pole, and was caught by a pair of outer foes to show. ADIOS BABE trailed from out in the seven
path early, shifted in to the five path rounding the turn, but did not factor while back out in the seven path down the lane. GITANA stalked in the four path but
flattened from the three path down the stretch. BUC N BEAUTY set the pace from the two path into the turn, but lost the lead early around the turn and
gaveway into the stretch.

in upper stretch and kept on well enough to secure the show. COMPETITIVE SAINT raced off the pace three wide, fanned seven wide in upper stretch and
improved position widest. UNIFIED CONQUEST failed to menace while racing three and four wide. LUNAR ROCKET chased the pace two wide and was
one-paced through the lane. TIGER BLOOD chased the pace four wide and faded in the drive. ASSERTIKO trailed in the four path.

BIG DATA raced wellback in the five path, moved up and circled a pair of inner rivals rounding the turn, was cued left handed while in the six path at the top
of the lane, bid passing the eighth pole, took the lead and drew clear. STRAPPED tracked in the three path, was under a heavy drive along the rail early
around the turn and in the two path entering the lane, kept on inside of foes thru the lane, and was up for place. EXUDE trailed in the three path, was driven
in the two path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. JONAS' DREAM set a clear pace in the two
path, extended that advantage under a nudge rounding the turn, was roused from the four path into the stretch, but gaveway in the final furlong. MR BRIZEL
prompted the pace in the four path but yielded turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
VLADISLAV stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, kicked clear leaving the
eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and dug in gamely to hold off multiple challengers late. WICKED FINN settled off the pace while racing two
wide, circled five wide around the far turn, rallied widest and was up for the place late. FREDO advanced three wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared
late on the bend, set the pace along the rail from there to the quarter pole, fought on inside of the winner and held on for the show. STAT raced in range
three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch, could not gain while sticking on the left lead through midstretch,
switched over nearing the sixteenth pole and was in tight on the winner's heels through the later yards. GUARANTEED SPECK raced off the pace four wide
and had a mild stretch gain. LAKER MAMBA tracked the pace two wide around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn and was one-paced
through the lane. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR failed to menace while racing three and four wide. PENNER ASH (IRE) played no factor while racing two and
three wide. CASHIER CHECK had early speed inside, became extremely rank around the first turn, checked repeatedly, dropped back and never
recovered. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND REVIEWED AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
STAT AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

SASSY BEAST set the pace in the two path, was cued while just off the rail approaching the quarter, opened slightly from the three path into the lane, and
was driven clear. CHROMEPLATED HEART pressed in the three path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and chased on to hold place. NIKEE
KAN was in tight between foes and bumped early, raced in range around the two path, was under a nudge inside of foes around the turn, remained inside
into the stretch, and kept on for show. DESIGNED BY KITTEN stalked in the five path, was driven around the turn and fanned out to the nine path into the
stretch, altered further outward to avoid a fallen foe nearing the eighth pole, and did not factor. SHES THE NORTH trailed in the four path, was cued from
the seven path into the stretch, steadied and altered course to avoid a fallen foe in upper stretch, and did not threaten. STRONG SILENT brushed with an
inner foe early, rated in the three path, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, was steadied but lost the rider while stumbling trying to jump a fallen foe
just before the eighth pole, and was euthanized. LIONESSOFBRITTANY prompted the pace in the four path, was in the six path entering the stretch, fell just
before the eighth pole, and was euthanized. TACTICAL PAJAMAS got bumped by an outer foe early, chased inside, was ridden in the two path around the
turn, shifted out to the five path into the stretch, lost the rider and fell just before the eighth pole trying to avoid a fallen foe, and walked off. THE STEWARDS
HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE STRETCH RUN AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

cleared then held safe. HERCULES raced off the pace four wide, rallied outside and was gaining on the winner late. HEY PORTER lacked early speed,
raced four wide and was along for the show. MAN ON THE MOON chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed stretch kick. BOLDNESS dueled two
wide and weakened through the final furlong. LOOKIN AT ROSES was outrun inside. HIGH YIELD KITTEN played no factor while racing five wide. SUN
VIKING dueled at the rail and retreated through the lane. UNCORK THE BOTTLE chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GET THE CANDY set the pace in the two path, was under rousing midway around the turn, opened slightly along the inside in upper stretch, and held sway.
CHOOSE JOY stalked in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, was in the three path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place.
FULMINATE raced up close along the inside, steadied slightly into the turn, tipped out to the five path under coaxing into the lane, and kept on for show.
TALKIN TIPSY rated inside and was under a hold into the turn, was put to a ride in the two path around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper
stretch, and stayed on. JUMEIRAH trailed around the two path and steadied into the turn, was cued right handed from the two path into the stretch, but was
no factor. DAVID'S ROSE prompted the pace in the four path, was roused between foes midway around the turn, but flattened from the six path down the
lane. LADY RADLER tracked between foes in the three path, steadied and clipped heels passing the three eighths pole, and was no threat around the
seven path in the stretch. FULTON MARKET was wellback in the four path early and never threatened. TREVESS was held up in the four path, steadied
into the turn, and was empty down the center in the stretch.

Footnotes
NATURE BOY set the pace along the rail, was headed by RARE JEWEL near the quarter pole, fought back inside and edged ahead of that foe late. RARE
JEWEL stalked the pace three wide, took a short lead near the quarter pole, vied outside of the winner from there to deep stretch and was turned back.
PACIFIC LEGEND saved ground off the pace and rallied for the show. MAJOR KING chased the pace five wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole but
weakened in the lane. RUNAWAY TOM hit the starting gate, raced four wide and went evenly. DANLEY was shuffled back soon after the start, raced three
wide and never threatened. ALLAGASH RUN hit the starting gate, raced five wide and made little impact. ACTION DREAM chased the pace four wide
between foes and came up empty in the lane. I FOUND IT played no factor while racing two wide. ASTRAL WEEKS had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
WIDE WEST (IRE) set the pace in the three path, opened slightly in the two path rounding the turn, maintained a clear advantage and was cued from the
four path at the top of the lane, began to shorten stride inside the final furlong, but held on. TIME PASSAGE stalked in the two path, was along the rail
rounding the turn, angled out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. OH DARLIN prompted the pace in the four path, was in the three path
around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on for show. CLAY SOLDIER tracked in the four path, was ridden in the seven path into
the stretch, but flattened. VAI BELLA brushed the side of the gate, chased in the two path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but was no factor.
SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL raced off the pace in the five path but did not threaten from the six path in the stretch. IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) trailed in the three
path and was no menace around the two path down the lane. ONE OF ONE hit the outer side of the gate, rated along the rail but was empty from the three
path into the stretch.

Footnotes
MS. CLEMENTE saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead to deep stretch, closed outside and was up late. NO
ACTION set the pace along the rail, repulsed a bid in upper stretch, held clear to deep stretch and was nailed. MOONLIGHT VISION pressed the pace two
wide, was turned back in upper stretch and kept on well enough to just last for the show. DEFINITE DIVA came in and slammed into DANCING DEB at the
start, turning herself sideways in the process, edged closer three wide around the turn and rallied to just miss third. DANCING DEB was slammed and
pinched back at the start, raced well back three wide and ran on through the lane. EVERY TIME raced in range three wide and faded in the lane. LA
BEFANA hesitated at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. MISS SENSIBLE played no factor while racing two wide. AMARULA SUN was
bumped between foes and squeezed back at the start and played no further factor while racing two wide. WILDCAT LUNITA bore out into about the eight
path around the turn and was never a threat. FAMOSA broke out and bumped at the start, checked not long after, chased four wide around most of the turn,
bore out nearing the quarter pole and had no further bids. INCLUDE THE MUNNY trailed inside.
