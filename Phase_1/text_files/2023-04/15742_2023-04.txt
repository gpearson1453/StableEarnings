Footnotes
SURPLUS got put in tight early, chased outside rivals early, bid three deep nearing the turn, fought three wide into the stretch, dueled outside the runner-up
through the lane and got up. BOB'S SNIPER set the pace and crossed over early, got pressured nearing the turn, held a short lead through the turn along
the inside, dueled with SURPLUS down the stretch and got nailed at the wire. RESTLESS RAMBLER forwardly placed off the inside, bid between foes
leaving the backstretch, lost touch with the top pair late on the bend and stayed on to secure the show. SHARP WARNING had to steady between rivals
early, came four wide into the lane and summoned a mild response. TIME IS GONE chased along the inside into the turn, moved off the rail around the
bend and failed to rally. STREET BEHAVIOR got shuffled between foes early, asked two wide into the bend and lacked the needed response. JAY BOY
broke well but lacked early speed and dropped back, got bumped four wide entering the turn, spun three wide into the lane and failed to menace. RUN
KING STUD RUN dropped back early, raced three deep then got bumped and put in tight entering the turn, angled down to the rail around the bend and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUIET FOREST dueled for command from inside into and around the bend, then shook free into the stretch and drew away. NAP TIME was fractious in the
gate, chased outside a rival, two then three wide on the turn, put in a mild rally and got up for second. LA CROIX brushed while fighting with QUITE
FOREST early, dueled from outside into and around the bend, lost touch into the stretch, churned on through the lane and got nailed for second. QUEEN
VERRAZANO brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, climbed early while dropping back, went three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane,
summoned a mild rally and missed the show. NASHIRA'S FIRE brushed and lost her path at the start, trailed to the stretch near the inside and never got
involved. PAWNEE paused behind QUIET FOREST then angled to the inside, chased a bit off the rail then along the fence on the turn and weakened in the
drive.

HOLYJAZZ broke out and bumped rival, went up to duel for the lead inside a rival, cleared with a furlong remaining and held well to the wire. MACHO SAM
bumped leaving the gate, dueled outside HOLY JAZZ, lost touch with that rival at the eight pole, stayed on through the lane and was clearly second best.
HAKUNUI chased two wide through the turn and finished evenly for the show honors. NOT GONNA LAST chased along the rail then got shuffled back by
HAKUNUI early on the turn, remained inside to the stretch and kept on for a minor award. WATER'S FOR FIGHTN got pinballed leaving the gate, tracked
three then two wide around the turn and weakened. OMAHA RUTSCH was off slow to begin, climbed at various points up the backstretch, went two wide
into the lane and was not a factor.
