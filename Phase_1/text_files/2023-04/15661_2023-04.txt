TIME IS PRECIOUS was well rated two wide, advanced on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid to edged clear late to prove
best, driving. ZIVA DA'VID stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid to duel for command on the turn, then gained a short lead by the
sixteenth marker but could not hold off the winner late, second best. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY set the pace on the inside, then dueled for command on the turn
and faded the final furlong, held show award. LATENITE SLEWZY was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the
lane but had no kick in the lane. LITTLE SAMURAI was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn but lacked the needed late rally. ALLERGIC TO
LOGIC was four wide into the first turn, settled three to four wide and had no rally. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was settled on the inside and lacked a rally.
ROBTHEQUEEN was off a step slow, then was not a threat. ZIPPIN BY U was not a factor.

MASSIVE ROAR was well rated early on the inside, then shifted out and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then remained clear to the wire to
prove best, driving. ATTILIANNO was reserved early, made a six wide move on the turn but hung late, held place award. SHINING SOURCE was settled
back early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the lane and rallied. DELBERT TOO was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn and
had a mild late rally. STRAWBERRY WHISKY was settled three wide and lacked the needed winning bid. ALL CHROME was settled back early, came five
wide into the lane and had no rally. DESERT REWARD chased the early pace, then saved ground on the turn and tired. NO PASA NADA was fractious in
the gate, settled on the inside and failed to respond. ON A WARPATH pressed the pace three wide and tired. TUCUM set a pressured pace early and then
gave way on the turn.
