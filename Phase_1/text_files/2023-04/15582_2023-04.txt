while four wide but it was too little too late. IRISH WRIT was in a steady drive to chase the pace while four deep, bid on the turn then flattened out in the

Footnotes
TWITTER TRAFFIC showed the way into the first turn and onto the backstretch, then was well rated along the rail throughout the second turn, dug in
gamely in the early stretch then surged to the wire to be up in the final strides. FLAT OUT FREDA stalked the pace while three deep, was moving up on the
far turn to gain the lead in the upper stretch then continued to rally gamely throughout the final furlong but was out finished in the end. GUITAR GROUPIE
settled behind the field while two wide then made a mild bid on the far turn to close willingly in the home stretch. BUD GIRL was allowed to settle along the
rail throughout the first three quarters of the course then rallied in the stretch from the two path but it was too little too late. JULIE'S PASSION raced while
four wide down the backstretch, then settled back heading into the far turn, bid from the two path in the stretch and was no threat. MISSINGYOUCRAZY
was moving up through the first turn to press the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then gained the lead at the five sixteenths pole, was in a
hard drive entering the stretch, was used up and weakened in the end.

wide into the turn, made a bid but raced evenly in late stretch. CARBON STRYKER chased the early pace while three wide into the turn, made a bid but was
no menace in the stretch. FLIP THE COIN JAN was unhurried early then rallied two wide in upper stretch, was gaining ground but was no threat. PINKY

saved ground on the turn, made a bid in the stretch but faltered. CAYMANS COBRA raced four wide on the turn making a bid to upper stretch then flattened
out in the drive. LITTLE AVENGER showed brief speed then stopped. YANKEE INDIAN was unprepared for the start turning his head as the gates opened

rival in the final furlong and was up just in time. BUXTERHOOTER was moving up along the rail while racing down the backstretch, then continued to dig in
gamely throughout the far turn and into the home stretch, dueled for lead in the final sixteenth but was out bid in the end and was second best. RANDELLO
set the pace on the first turn, was in a long drive down the backstretch, cleared the far turn then gave way in the final furlong. NAUTICAL MOON chased the
pace while two wide, then bid between foes on the far turn to rally in the stretch and was closing well in the end. BRICKBAT settled in the three path while
racing down the backstretch, then came out to the five path to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. DEANOS CAPE was allowed to settle along the
inside from the first turn and into the second turn, then made a mild bid in the late stretch but came up empty. G'S TURN settled in the two path throughout
the course and was no menace. PAST VISIONS pressed the pace while two wide, was in a long drive down the backstretch and into the far turn then gave
way in the late stretch. EPIC RUN was unhurried early, then chased the pace from the inside, then slowly faded throughout the second half of the course
