Footnotes
ALL OUR MUNNY raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a bid from the three path
coming around the far turn and dueled to the wire to just get up for the win. UNEXPECTED (JPN) saved ground early, settled off the pace on the inside for
the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and dueled in the stretch to just miss. JAWBREAK raced in the two path
around the first bend, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the four path around the far turn, began a second bid
near the eighth pole and gained ground late from there. SCARAB raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid
from the two path coming around the far bend and dueled in the stretch, giving way in the final strides. FAST FIXER led the way while saving ground around
the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend and faded in the stretch. MINTENON raced in the two path early, chased
the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and tired in the lane.

HELLO SUCKER pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path, dueled
down the lane, drifting out and bumping lightly with THE BEARRISH ONE multiple times near the eighth pole and edged clear from there. THE BEARRISH
ONE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged
from the two path coming around the far bend and dueled to the wire from there, bumping with HELLO SUCKER several times in midstretch and giving way
late, the best of the rest. UNXPECTED TIGER raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the
backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position mildly late. BIALYSTOCK
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. MIRO raced in the
two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far bend in the four path and never threatened. SAGA saved
ground around the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and faded in the
stretch. RED OCTOBER raced off the pace on the inside early, trailed the field headed into the far turn, raced in the two path from there and showed no
kick. BARONS BLITZ led the way while saving ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second
bend and tired in the stretch. EL BUFFALO bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there. THE RIDER OF HORSE
FIVE, THE BEARRISH ONE, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE FOUR, HELLO SUCKER, CITING INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE SAME INCIDENT. UPON REVIEW, HORSE FOUR, HELLO SUCKER, WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE WITH HORSE FIVE, THE BEARRISH ONE, NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE.

PLENTITUDE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the far turn and in upper stretch and pulled clear in
the final furlong. HARD TO PLEASE veered out leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came
around the turn in the two path, challenged in upper stretch, lost the whip while dueling near the sixteenth pole and chased the winner home from there.
LONGING FOR MINTS chased the leaders off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the bend, gained ground in upper
stretch and was outkicked late. BURN THE BREEZE dueled on the inside through the early going, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn
and faded in the stretch. ROMPING trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. JULIANNA'S RUBY raced off the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the lane.

the back of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, swung out to the five path for the run around the second turn and gained ground late.
JUST PRAISE saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path, dueled in the lane
and gave way late. MAJOR DEAL saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the second bend and made no bid. DISTORTED TIMES led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path
around the far turn and weakened in late stretch. ANVIL raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
