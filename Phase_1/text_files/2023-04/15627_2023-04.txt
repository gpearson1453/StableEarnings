Footnotes
MACHEN'S RIDGE stalked the earlier pace from the three path, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead past the pole, came under
pressure approaching the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. WINDSOR'S
TRACKER rated close off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn,
entered the stretch at even terms but reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. BERNIE THE GAMBLER settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then dueled through the stretch for third. FELICIAS CASTLE settled in the four path on the first turn, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, came in across the path of Maddeye Moody nearing the eighth pole
and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. S S SPARTAN ENERGY settled off the rail, eased out and picked up the chase into the backstretch,
rounded the far turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. MIO GRACELAND took over nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to
rate the pace, came under pressure and was met leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn.
MADDEYE MOODY rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn three wide, was shut off
nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the lane. ROCKET J. rated close inside on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.
YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN saved early ground. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul for alleged interference in the stretch, lodged by the
rider of Windsor's Tracker, against the rider of Machen's Ridge. The Stewards also reviewed a claim of foul for interference nearing the eighth pole, lodged
by the rider of Maddeye Moody, against the rider of Felicias Castle, and as a result, disqualified the the latter to seventh place for interfering with the former
in the vicinity of the eighth pole.

Footnotes
LEG UP rated close to the early pace in the two and three paths, gave chase into the backstretch, contested even terms two deep on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to eke out the advantage over SPIRIT OF WINDSOR in later strides. The latter raced with the early pace three wide and took the lead into the
backstretch, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was met at even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely before reluctantly
ceding late strides. SEATTLE SAILAWAY settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn about the four path and came along for third later yards. MODERN DAY ROMANCE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths then flattened later yards. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS saved ground well off the pace
and showed little response through the backstretch. SIENTE EL AMOR raced with the early pace two deep, took a brief lead between horses on the first
turn then gave chase from the half mile pole, but faded at the rail on the far turn. JEFFERSON SECURITY was hustled along to take a brief early lead, gave
up the lead midway on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LOGSTRADAMUS raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead into the backstretch and came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled to hold on well. CHASENJOHNATHAN stalked off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and raced off the rail on the turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. GRUMPY'S BUDDY saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. I'M THE MONEY MAN stalked from the three path
the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. NEVERFOLD rounded the opening turn
about the five path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and flattened in the lane. IN HIGH
GEAR rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response. NEVERPOPTHECORK
raced in the six path on the first turn, left the turn outside and never factored. SWISS LEGACY rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and

OFFICER STONE gave chase and took the lead two deep midway on the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE broke
awkwardly then gave chase, was carried outward on the turn, entered the stretch widest but finished well to take second the final strides.
