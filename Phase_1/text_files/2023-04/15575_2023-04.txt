Footnotes
MALIBU ROCK STAR settled just off the pace and off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and challenged FANEUIL HALL nearing the
three eighths, contested a close disadvantage near the rail on the far turn, took the lead toward the eighth pole and was steadily handled in the lane. The
latter stalked the early pace three wide then pulled himself to the front approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge off the rail most of the far
turn, was met toward the head of the lane but stayed on to the finish. MOSES WATER stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and
raced in the three path of the turn, ran evenly to late stretch but flattened toward the wire. MAJOR NELSON saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. AWESOME STRIKE dropped well off the early pace in the two and three paths, left the
first turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. AFLEET AIRO came away
awkwardly but took over and rated a short lead inside, was met approaching the three eighths pole and gave way past the pole.

Footnotes
BAAGY saved ground close to the pace on the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, closed to the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole,
drew clear toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn and was kept sharp through the lane. PYEONG CHANG rated a slim lead inside, was met
leaving the first turn and dueled from that point, but dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter pole and had to settle for second. LIKE SEGAL
rounded the first turn in the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, eased outward leaving the turn and
came along for third later yards. NIGHT BOSS rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and weakened in the lane. PRINCE OF FENTON rated close four wide on the first turn, challenged into the backstretch but dropped back past the
five sixteenths pole and faded in the three path of the far turn. SANTO was not a factor. FEARNOUGHT saved ground on the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.

NEVER COMPROMISE stalked off the rail on the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the nod between horses approaching the five
sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, recovered the lead past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to eke out a win
over the game challenge of GOLDEN APPEAL, who stalked three wide and challenged toward the three eighths pole, took a slim lead two deep on the far
turn, but was met past the eighth pole and ceded; grudgingly. AUBURN MILL raced boxed at the rail into the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, left the turn outside and finished well while gaining on the top two. REY O REYES took over and moved to the
inside to rate the pace, was met and dueled approaching the three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the
lane. STRINGFELLA rounded the opening turn in the three path, left the turn outside and bid toward the three eighths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
RIDICULOUS stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear toward
mid-stretch and widened with steady handling. HAPPY CHAMP rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met at the
rail toward the top of the lane, remained close through the upper stretch, flattened stride and just held the nod for second. BEYOND THE BEND stalked
from the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and dug in, but just missed the nod for second.
SHOULDA HAD IT raced off the rail on the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the six path and ran evenly to late
stretch before flattening stride. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
flattened in the four path on the far turn. TOP HAT TREASON rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and showed little response through the
backstretch. AUTS REVOLUTION rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. THE IRON BANK saved
ground well off the pace on the first turn and showed little response. CAYENNE CREEK lunged from the gate, raced wide and was never in competition.
HAIR OF THE DOG saved ground on the opening turn, was pulled up with a fatal injury leaving the turn and was euthanized on the track.

yards. CAJUN FUN gave chase outside, raced six wide on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and took second the final strides. I ONCE STOOD ALONE

to set the pace, came under pressure at the rail on the turn, was met nearing mid-stretch, flattened inside the sixteenth pole then nipped from third under the
wire. PRIMETIME JET steadied at the start, picked up the chase through the backstretch but flattened stride mid-stretch. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND chased

Footnotes
C R'S MANDATE saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and angled five wide approaching the eighth pole, lugged in while taking
the lead under left hand urging mid-stretch and lasted well under steady handling. OVERLY CRITICAL broke outward and into Run To Daylight and raced
off the rail on the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch but was
outfinished from that point. HOT FUDGE SONDE was bumped outward and into Overly Critical leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and finished well outside. JUBA'S NOTION settled in the three
path on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced three wide on the far turn, was forced in and shut off mid-stretch, then nipped from third
under the wire. BRISTOL CHANNEL rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point,
contested the rail on the far turn, was met and bumped toward mid-stretch and flattened stride. HUMPTY GRUMPTY raced with the pace two deep,
challenged from the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn but was pinched back and roughed mid-stretch. RUN TO DAYLIGHT
was bumped at the break, rounded the opening turn off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn,
but weakened in the lane. TARAASHOQ saved ground. STORMIN ROCKET ducked outward and into Hot Fudge Sonde leaving the gate, raced in the three
path on the first turn and showed little response. HE ROLLS stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened on
the far turn. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Juba's Notion for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider
of Humpty Grumpty. Also, a claim of foul was levied against the rider of C R's Mandate for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Juba's Notion. As
a result, C R's Mandate was disqualified to sixth place for causing the chain reaction in mid-stretch.
