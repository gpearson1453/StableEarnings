Footnotes
THE CALLING STONE reserved near the back in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, entered the stretch six wide and got up late
for the win. SURREY raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished for the win and was just up for place. LAST OF THE NILE vied
for the early lead, saved ground, was outfinished by the top two and proved best of others. CALIFORNIA BELLE went to the front, drove clear, came around
the final turn three wide, weakened and lacked a finish. SIKARA SIKARA bobbled at the start, racing in the back of the pack and was never a factor.
MARMO MOON raced evenly near the back and was never close. BABY LOCKOUT pressed the early pace and dropped back.

evenly in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST raced near the back, finished wide and was no factor. SR. CLARKY

Footnotes
LUNAR MODULE pressed the pace, racing behind NACHO BIZ in the early part, took command down the home stretch and was kept to the task. FATHER
RED unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, made a late inside bid, finished willingly and was a clear second. CHICKEN TRUCK lacked
early speed, came around the turn wide, made an outside gain and got up for show. HARD CANDY raced near the middle of the field, within striking
distance, lacked a rally and was caught for show. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. CAT FIVE void of early
speed and showed little. D T'S DREAM pressed the early pace and dropped back. NACHO BIZ showed brief speed, saved ground and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR GENERAL went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was kept to the task. HYPERBOLIST pressed the pace, followed the winner and
was a clear second. STRONG EAGLE raced within striking distance, forwardly placed throughout and proved third best. MOTATAABEQ void of early speed,
moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a mild bid, racing wide, but was no real factor. RIGHTANDJUST raced within contention, faded and
was no threat late. FORTUITY raced evenly near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was outrun. DUST EM void of early speed and was
never close.

Footnotes
MIZSPELT pressed the pace, moved up around the turn, took the advantage, drove clear before the wire and finished well. CARLOS PUNCH vied for the
early lead, saved ground around the turn, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but held on for second. SWIFT N TRAFFIC raced within striking
distance, made a late bid and missed second. CORN SOUP raced in the middle of the field, moved up down the home stretch and was outfinished for show.
IDE LIKE HAWAII raced evenly near the back in the early part, made a mild bid, racing wide, but was no factor. EASY CHANCE raced within contention,
weakened and was no threat late. SABERMAN lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn and was no threat late. CARLOS'S MAMA raced
evenly near the back and showed little. MR. E EDWARDS always raced near the back and showed little. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER dueled on the front end
and dropped back.
