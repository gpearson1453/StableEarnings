Footnotes
CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE raced with the early pace inside but dropped back and eased out into the backstretch and settled close, started a bid approaching
the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide nearing the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and
held on well. STROLLINGINTHEWIND saved ground on the first turn, started a four wide bid leaving the half mile pole and contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn and remained a factor through the upper stretch before relenting. S S ALASKAN CRUZ saved ground on the first
turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, angled out into the lane and finished evenly to take third inside the
sixteenth pole. ORANGEBURG raced with the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened inside
the eighth. NICE BUT NAUGHTY settled inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened
in the lane. RED HOT TODDY stumbled at the break and rounded the first turn two deep, showed little response through the backstretch and raced in the
five path of the far turn. HILLBILLY ROCK settled two deep on the opening turn, gave chase into the backstretch then weakened in the four path of the far
turn. TWO ROOM SCHOOL tapered in and raced with the early pace, took a brief lead three wide at the nine sixteenths pole but gave up the advantage
approaching the five sixteenths and weakened in the four path of the far turn. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul for alleged interference
on the far turn, lodged by the rider of Orangeburg, against the rider of Chippewa's Castle.

Footnotes
LOVE OF GRACE ducked in and hit the gate at the break then settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced
close off the rail on the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game effort of JUBASLILBALLERINA,
who stalked from the three path and challenged at the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, raced clear midway on the far
turn, was met past the eighth pole but dug in gamely to the finish. SNEAKY LYNK rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and finished evenly at the outside flank of the runner-up. S S FRONTIER ANGEL saved ground, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly down the lane. SMOKIN LADY raced with the pace through the
front stretch and moved to even terms leaving the half mile pole, took the nod at the seven sixteenths, came under pressure toward the three eighths but
was met at the rail at the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. ODINA rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. CLOUD MOVER rounded the first turn in the four path and showed
little response through the backstretch. JUST HAVE FAITH hesitated at the break and saved ground. S S CASINO GIRL raced with the pace inside through
the front stretch, was met leaving the half mile pole and gave chase from that point but gave way approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
ROYAL CRUSADER was unprepared for the break and shuffled back after the start, rounded the first turn off the rail, bid past the seven sixteenths pole,
steadily improved at the rail on the far turn and dug in for the lead mid-stretch. TWEET THIS settled off the pace inside on the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out approaching the eighth pole, finished well to take second later yards and was
gaining on the winner. ONE MORE FACTOR set the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn,
was met mid-stretch then flattened later yards. HEARTNESS stalked the earlier pace from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. FUTILE raced well off the early pace in the three path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well. SAN ANTONE saved ground, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. JAMMIN STILL rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, showed little response through the backstretch
and raced in the seven path of the far turn. ELVIRUS rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in
the five path of the far turn. CHARITABLE SPENNY ducked out at the break then stalked two deep, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in
the five path and weakened. MINE TO HOLD saved ground.

Footnotes
MOJAC KAT gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and dueled to the front mid-stretch, drew clear later yards and held on well. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN
chased outside, rounded the turn in the four path and finished well to take second later yards. NO FOOLING DUDE chased through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the four path and finished well. MAJESTIC SEAS pressured the pace inside, took the nod at the rail midway on the turn, raced clear into
the lane but flattened the final sixteenth. WIDGET FACTORY chased the early pace toward the inside, angled to the eight path on the turn and passed
rivals. BERHANU gave chase, raced in the two and three paths on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. FIT BUT FAT gave chase inside, lacked room at the
rail approaching the top of the lane and flattened stride. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL was hustled to a slim lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave up the
edge two deep midway on the turn, dropped back into the lane and weakened. IMPETUOUS set the early pace but was met approaching the five sixteenths
pole and weakened in the five path of the turn. TANELEER was never a factor and angled widest into the lane.
