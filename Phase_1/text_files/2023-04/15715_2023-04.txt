SLUSHY broke outward and bumped with rivals at the break, stalked three wide, angled out going up the backstretch and brushed with a rival while moving
up, bid four wide into the lane and edged clear. TRICKY MOM was bumped between rivals at the start, dropped inside to stalk the pace, bid into the lane but
could not go with the winner late. HOT CAVIAR contested the pace three wide outside rivals and came up empty in the drive. CHAOS MAGIC contested the
pace inside rivals and came up empty in the drive. T R'S FIRST was bumped and shuffled back at the break, saved ground and could not rally late.
TOURIST LIKE ME was just off the early leaders four wide, leaned on the winner as that one angled out going up the backstretch and weakened in the far
turn.

SAMS TIME moved to challenge three and four wide into the far turn, edged clear into the lane and drew off under steady handling. RECORDER moved
four wide to bid outside the winner into the far turn, continued with that one into the lane but could not match strides. SUBSCRIPTION showed the most
speed to cross over and gain inside position about the two path but weakened into the lane. JUST RIGHT MIKE failed to mount a rally inside. YOUNG
PHILLIP was not a threat. KLIMCO was not a factor. CAPTAIN DON saved ground and failed to mount a bid.

JOEY'S VALENTINE tracked the early leader three to four wide, challenged into the lane and slowly edged clear late. TOO LATE made the pace on a short
lead about the two to three path then could not handle the winner through the lane. KNIGHTED was five wide in the first turn, stalked the leaders four wide
and could not produce the needed late run. OREGON COUNTY stalked the pace from along the inside and lacked a rally. I SEE CLEARLY NOW dropped
off the early pace, moved up three to four wide but could not threaten late. NEW STRIPE bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground and failed to mount
a bid. WEBCAM bumped with a rival at the start, attended the early pace four wide and tired.

HANK'S GAL was on the lead inside rivals about the two path, shook off the challenge of JOCOTE and edged away under mild urging. JOCOTE tracked the
winner from three to four wide and could not go with that one in the lane. SHES STEEL DREAMIN stalked the leaders four wide, came six wide into the lane
and lacked the needed closing bid. JUDGE JENNINGS was along the inside and steadied in a bit tight along the rail going up the backstretch when trying to
bid inside the winner, remained in reach and weakened in the lane. The rider of JUDGE JENNINGS lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging
interference going up the backstretch which was not allowed. JOSIES SCORE was not a threat. WHAT'S THE SCORE weakened three wide. HOLY
CANNOLI was always back.

OURBESTFRIEND D L moved three and four wide to bid going to the far turn, came out to about the six path into the lane and held clear to the wire.
STEPHEN'S ANSWER went five wide in the first turn, stalked the leaders to bid four wide outside the winner into the far turn, continued outside that one to
fan seven wide into the stretch and could not go with that one late while holding the place. WAGER NO MO settled back three wide off the early pace,
moved up while angling in the far turn, altered out to be seven wide into the stretch behind the top pair and missed the place late. DOUBLE THUNDER
saved ground while well off the early pace and moved up through the far turn but could not threaten late. WYOMING CONQUEST was close to the early
pace three or four wide and weakened in the far turn. RICKEY B showed some early speed racing out from the rail and tired. PARALISSFRMANALYSS was
always back and fanned widest into the lane. WRATH tired racing three wide.

FOR RANSOM tracked the pace four wide to bid into the far turn then could not handle the winner late. DEBONNAIRE DUDE dropped back off the early
pace and rallied four wide to gain third. MOST AMUSING stalked the pace four wide to bid into the far turn and could not sustain the move. KING OF
ANYTHING angled four wide in the far turn to move up but could not threaten. TALE OF A STORM weakened from along the inside. MR. WALSH failed to
mount a bid four wide. GIO SAMMY weakened racing three wide. BANJO BILL was always back.

Footnotes
GOLD BEAR settled off the leaders three wide, moved inside going to the far turn and rallied up the rail into the lane then dueled inside rivals to be up in the
closing jump. SPEEDY FELLAR stalked the pace three and four wide, oved six wide to bid into the lane, dueled late and just missed outside rivals.
RECKLESSNESS stalked the pace out from the rail, bid into the lane, dueled between foes late and just missed. ZCAT'S CHATAIN was on the pace
throughout and weakened in the lane. BIG HEARTED FACTOR lacked a rally three wide. ALARM SYSTEM saved ground and moved up while not a threat.
WANT TO BE COWBOY contested the pace along the inside and tired. FINDING SILVER was not a factor. RANDOM AFFAIR prompted the pace three to
four wide and tired. GIMME SPACE was pulled up in the far turn and vanned off.
