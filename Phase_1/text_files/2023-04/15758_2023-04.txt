Footnotes
YOUALMOSTHADME brushed with an outer rival a few strides after the start, dueled for the lead two wide, assumed command leaving the three sixteenths
pole, and drew off under moderate urging. BARAYE dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match for that one at the three
sixteenths pole, gave way while hanging on her left lead, yet lasted safely for place. KRICKLE chased two wide and between horses, then sustained stride
along the rail through the lane to gain show at the sixteenth pole. LATE NITE MISTRESS brushed with an inner rival in the early stages, tracked four to
three wide entering the turn, then lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. AIM HIGHER raced forwardly along the inside before being taken in hand
approaching the three furlong pole, got subtly shuffled back inside of a rival turning for home, and improved along the rail late. GLORIETTE sprinted for a
furlong with the rider having his feet out of the irons following the post parade, pursued from midpack early on, checked lightly at the three furlong pole, took
the turn in the three to four paths, shifted ground further out in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS pressed three wide early on, chased his
inner pair of counterparts around the turn, and gave way. FOOLISH FRONT FIFI was off slow, trailed three wide, and moved up. PROGNOSTICATE broke
a step slow, raced keenly while hustled between horses out of the gates, steadied out of tight quarters leaving the chute, fanned to the six path at the three
furlong pole while far back, and made little impact. BINGO'S DREAM was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
CALL OF HONOR set the pace inside of a strong presser, shook loose of that faltering foe with nine sixteenths to go, widened his margin under light urging
nearing the lane, and was wrapped up through the late stages. HEIRLOOM KITTEN tracked in the three to two paths around the first turn, claimed place at
the half mile pole, chased the clear leader as that foe's only pursuer around the far turn, and was only second best. CARTIER CAT lagged behind in the four
path around the first turn, then improved between horses around the far turn to gain show nearing the lane. CAROM lacked speed in the five to four paths,
and made little impact. PANORAMA TRUCK vied for the lead two wide around the first turn, but weakened after a half mile, and was eased through the
lane. HARD LOVE tracked in the four to three paths around the first turn, came under urging approaching the far turn, but lacked a response before coming
in hand with five sixteenths to go, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
I'MHEREFORTHEPARTY pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses around the turn, ranged up in the six path turning for home,
sustained a grinding charge in pursued of a bidding BRYLEE through midstretch, bid outside of that new leader at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead.
BRYLEE tracked two wide, took aim in the five path entering the lane, bid and struck the front at the furlong grounds, but was outfinished by an outer bidder
in the closing stages. COEXIST broke slowly, saved ground far back after getting slightly shuffled into the turn, spun into the lane in the four path, altered
course to the six path leaving midstretch, and rallied between horses late. GORMLEYESQUE set a clear pace around the turn, repelled a mild bidder
entering the lane, but was headed by another challenger at the furlong grounds, and weakened. GET BY lacked speed two wide, took the turn in the four
path, and improved among foes in midstretch. WEST COASTER took a bump from an inner rival at the start, saved ground after loosing a bit of position
entering the turn, and failed to factor along the raill. KALL KAT broke slowly before taking a bump from an outer rival soon after, and made little impact from
the four path. ICY STARE broke out and bumped a rival, stalked outside of the pace setter, ranged up to attempt a bid in the four path at the quarter pole,
but was turned away entering the lane, and weakened nearing midstretch. CARMEL SUNRISE broke slowly and never got involved. RAZZALUNA was
briefly disjointed with her rider finishing the post parade, then pursued from midpack along the inside, and faded. MAHOMEBRED chased briefly two wide,
but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
UP AND DOWN tracked two wide, loomed a danger while ranging up three wide around the far turn, vied turning for home, then kicked away with a good
turn of foot in upper stretch. OKAY FINE tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, spun into the lane in the four path, then
rallied while chasing the clearing leader to gain place at the sixteenth pole. PAINT ME PERFECT steadied out of crowded quarters between horses passing
the wire for the first time, settled off of the pace along the inside, inched closer around the far turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, stayed on
between horses in the final furlong, and held show from an outer rival late. JUST SAY SO tracked from midpack four to three wide, spun into the lane in the
four path, but lugged in slightly while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over once successfully guided to the five path in midstretch, and
offered a mild kick. FANCY CABER NEIGH stalked along the inside, bid for the lead two wide along with an outer menacing rival around the far turn, proved
no match for that one in upper stretch, and caved through the final furlong. MAKE THE BOYS WINK saved ground while unhurried along the inside, and
improved in upper stretch. MORETHANANYONE cleared off around the first turn, met a pair of outer bids entering the far turn, and weakened in upper
stretch. MASTERFUL MEG steadied when pinched between horses early on, and failed to factor along the inside. LUNA MOTH lacked speed while hung in
the six to five paths around the first turn, and tired in the three path around the far turn. OH SUZANNA laid off of the pace two wide and between horses,
and tired. KENTUCKY REIGN shifted in while keen among foes early on, put a pair of inner rivals to tight quarters at the thirteen sixteenths pole, chased
three to four wide, but stopped after drifting to the six path entering the lane. SILENT STORY showed little.

Footnotes
THE HONORABLE ONE rushed to set the pace along the inside, shook free of a prompting foe while spinning into the lane in the three path, hung on his
left lead thereafter, met an outer bid at the sixteenth pole, and held. RAYMOND tracked two wide and between horses, inched closer around the turn,
fanned to the five path while ranging up to the leading pair, chased the clear eventual winner through midstretch, offered a bid a sixteenth from home, but
hung. SAIL AT SUNRISE vied for the lead two wide, but yielded in the four path entering the lane. INVISIBLE WAR chased along the inside and lacked a
bid. GROUP EIGHTEEN prompted the pace three wide, chased the top pair around the turn, and faded. LONGSHADOW stumbled at the start, trailed in the
two path around the turn, and was outrun.

FOREIGN RELATIONS stalked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, bid three wide entering the lane, but lugged inwardly soon
after, clipped an inner rival's heels while gaining an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and drew clear. WIND TWIST raced forward two wide and
between horse, retreated to midpack along the fence into the second turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and chased the clear leader home.
BOLD LOOKER settled off of the pace three wide, inched closer around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, then stayed on in the seven path.
MOUNT RUNDLE tracked three wide, but yielded in the six path in upper strech. EVAN HARLAN vied along the inside while well in hand, but was outkicked
by an outer bidder while being brushed by a falling horse in upper stretch, and gave way. ALWAYS ABOVE laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out
to three path around the second bend, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. EL AHIJADO broke erratically and never got involved.
SMOKEY LEE stumbled into an inner rival at the start, lacked speed two wide before saving ground around the final turn, and failed to factor. SILENT
STEVE took a bump from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, was urged along in the three path around the far turn, then avoided
a fallen rival while no factor in upper stretch. MASTER OF THE RING vied for the lead two wide, sparred between horses entering the lane, but clipped
heels with an outer rival when that foe lugged across his path at the three sixteenths pole, fell, and was vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH, FOREIGN RELATIONS WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED LAST

Footnotes
FILM STAR showed the way with a loose margin, felt mild outer pressure from a rival around the far turn, drew off entering the lane, and was ridden out
under hand urging. BRIGHT SPARK lagged behind, launched a rally along the inside into the far turn, shifted out turning for home to surpass an inner rival,
then sustained his charge to claim place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and subtly cut the gap on the clear leader while hanging on his left lead.
LIL BRO COOP stalked two wide, applied light pressure around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. CHILENO tracked along the inside, but only
managed to chase turning for home before fading. PRINCELY laid off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the five path, and failed to factor.
GROUP HUG tracked in the three to four paths, and weakened around the far turn. ROYAL KING stalked three wide and caved between horses entering
the far turn.

Footnotes
WORK OF FICTION set the pace, inched clear turning for home, and held firm from an outer chaser through the final furlong. CALLIE'S GRIT tracked along
the inside, gained place turning for home before taking aim outside of the clear leader entering the lane, but was fended off through the late stages.
FRONTAL ATTACK saved ground off of the pace, paused his advance behind foes in the two path turning for home, tipped in entering the lane, gained
show from outer rivals at the furlong grounds, and chased the top pair home. STAY LOST pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted three wide in
upper stretch, chased into midstretch, and faded. LADY DYNAMO was floated out and forced to make contact with an outer rival at the start, tracked two
wide and between horses while keen around the opening bend, settled into stride before fanning four wide nearing the lane, but lacked a bid. RECONSIDER
ME (IRE) broke slowly, saved ground towards the rear, and improved entering the lane. BEL ROSSO was pinched back between horses at the start, lacked
speed two to three wide, and improved between horses in midstretch. SUPER LUXE pursued from midpack two to three wide, but was floated to the seven
path entering the lane, and faded. FLOWERDEW never got involved two wide. KINGMAKING (GB) tracked from the four path, but drifted to the seven path
nearing the lane, and caved. NOW SHOWING stalked two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.
