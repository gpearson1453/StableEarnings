Footnotes
CHIEF BRADY pressed the pace from four wide to the turn while slightly drifting in, took control at the quarter pole and drew off down the lane as much
best. UNION DATA dueled early from between horses early, dropped back off leaders while hesitant in close quarters, angled into the clear at the head of
the stretch and finished well to gain the place. FEDERAL HILL broke a tad slow to be at the rear of the field, ranged up on the turn while circling and made
steady gains in the drive to just miss second. RED BIRD'S STORM reserved off the pacesetters, angled five wide in the turn and made a belated rally.
RUSH THE COLORS pressed the pace from the rail in an early five horse duel for the lead, challenged gamely to the quarter pole, and flattened out in the
stretch. MALIBU THUNDER dueled with the early leaders from three wide to take a brief lead, drifted out in the turn, and steadily gave way. BRAHMS BOY
flashed brief speed to be part of a five horse duel on the lead through the first quarter, was in tight between horses entering the turn, and dropped out of
contention from there. THE RIDER OF BRAHMS BOY RAISED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN,
UPON REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
STANS HOME RUN chased the pace from the inside, was urging steadily throughout the turn to kick clear in the upper stretch and was kept to task till the
end. VILLAGE WAY dueled from the inside into the turn continued to rally gamely but was headed at the top of the stretch by an inner rival and was best for
second in the end. WILL THE THRILL chased the pace between rivals, then made a mild bid along the inside on the turn, came out three wide ot rally in the
stretch and was closing strong just missing the place prize. LUCKY PROMISE dueled for the lead while two wide, was in a hard drive throughout the turn,
then gave way in the stretch. HELLO HELLO MISTER chased the dueling pair while three wide, steadied slightly while heading into the turn, re bid then
flattened out in the lane. TEXAS GOLD RUSH broke outwardly at the start, then was out run and no factor.

CONFLICTING TALES broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, dueled from the fence to the top of the lane, put away the pace pressers and held the
late closer safe to the wire while drifting out late in a well measured ride. VIVACIOUSLY taken in hand shortly away from the gate to settle off the leaders,
rallied up the rail to the top of the lane, angled out for the drive and finished fast to be gaining late in the lane. PIVOSKY pressed the pacesetter for
five-eighths, loomed as the primary challenger turning for home and was out-finished in the stretch in a good effort. MIZ CALI trailed the field to midway on
the turn, commenced a five wide rally to the quarter pole and failed to gain ground. LO PROFILE broke outward to be well wide leaving the gate, tracked the
leaders to midway on the turn and finished evenly lacking a response. GUN RUNNIN GIRL pressed the pace from between horses to the turn and steadily
gave way.

Footnotes
DOBBINS G stalked the pace from three wide in the first turn, steadily gained on the pacesetters through the far turn and took command with a clear lead in
upper stretch, dropped to the rail and held off the late closer. BRICKBAT settled along the fence to track the leaders down the backside, rallied up the rail in
the lane, switched out late in the drive when the leader dropped to the rail and finished gamely as second best. CONGA BOY sped to the lead into the first
turn, settled nicely while well rated between horses to duel on the lead, responded when challenged but weakened in the drive. BIG POWER RED reserved
off the leaders in the first turn, lacked racing room in the first turn checking off heels, was taken wide for the run down the backside, and finished evenly
when called upon. BLING'S BELLWETHER trailed for the first half mile and showed mild late interest down the lane. THE GRAY BLUR showed speed for
the first half mile while dueling from the fence and gave way. REACH THE CIRCLE was prominently placed early on and tired after half a mile.

BAY BE GONE taken in hand to settle at the back into the first turn, steadily picked up the field along the fence down the backside, angled out four wide at
the head of the lane for the drive and closed with a rush to be up in time under strong handling. IBERIAN RUNNER pressed the pace for the first half mile,
took the lead in the far turn, opened a clear advantage in the stretch and finished gamely to be caught in the final strides. KING ARTHUR RIDGE trailed to
midway down the backstretch, began to pick up horses through the turn working his way through traffic and finished with a good belated rally. BULLS IN
THE BRONX reserved off the pace through the far turn, swung six wide for the drive and made a late gain to hit the board. GOD'S GOLD prominently
placed in a three wide stalking position to the top of the lane and leveled off for the drive. PUNTO RAFFA VOLO sped to the lead in the first turn, set the
pace while dueling on the lead into the far turn and tired down the lane. VALDINA DREAMS rushed up along the fence to chase the pace for a half mile and
steadily gave way. GOLD CAPO showed speed for a half mile to be well placed and was finished early.

Footnotes
DEANOS CAPE chased the pace while two wide down the first half of the course, was gaining on the far turn from the three path, dueled shortly with an
inner rival, gained command in the upper stretch then drew off to prevail in the end. VANGILDER was allowed to settled along the inside down the
backstretch, was urging steadily throughout the far turn while three wide, then rallied in the late stretch to close gamely for the place prize. WITT'S
TAQUITO tracked the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters of the course then menaced in the early stretch to close well in the end.
SAMURAI CAUSE was brushed at the start, then was unhurried early, was moving up to split rivals heading into the far turn, then rallied in the stretch to
close well in the end. LAB RAT brushed foe at the start, then set the pace into the first turn and down the backstretch, then took a bad step around the three
eighths pole, rebid but eventually gave way entering the home stretch. GOLD ACCOUNT tracked the pace while two wide, then dropped back in late
backstretch, bid on the far turn while six wide and was no threat in the end. NAUTICAL MOON chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was
in tight heading into the far turn, bid mildly then flattened out in the stretch. FREDONIAN tracked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then faded
throughout the far turn and had no final bid in the end. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of NAUTICAL MOON claimed
interference on the rider of DEANOS CAPE heading into the far turn. After review, there was no change made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
IMA SKY TRAVELER pressed the pace after breaking mid-pack, dueled on the lead, put away the frontrunner to take charge at the head of the stretch and
dug-in gamely to prevail. MISS DISTINCTIVE reserved off the early pace, circled in the turn and closed with a rush to be gaining late in a good effort. BLING
ON THE LIGHT stalked the pace through the turn, loomed up boldly at the head of the lane and was out-finished late. THINKITASADONATION tracked the
leaders from two wide into the turn, rallied three wide to threaten turning for home and could not sustain his bid. SUMMER LIGHTNING rated in mid-pack off
the leaders and went evenly. AUSTIN CITY GIRL trailed to the turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. JAN'S TURN TO WIN showed speed for a quarter,
dropped back and never threatened. SHE'S AN ANGEL flashed speed for a three-eighths and tired turning for home.
