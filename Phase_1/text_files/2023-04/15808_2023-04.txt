Footnotes
WARRENS CANDY GIRL unhurried in the beginning and trailed along the inside early, tipped out leaving the far turn and widest in upper stretch, closed fast
in the final sixteenth and got up at the wire. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) stalked from inside, got put in tight briefly early on the far turn, remained inside and was
coaxed along past the quarter pole, moved out a bit to launch a bid between rivals with a furlong remaining, took over in the final sixteenth but got run down
by the winner. SWEETEST ANGEL tracked along the inside then two wide on the clubhouse turn, was on the move three wide around the second bend, had
the rider lose his whip in upper stretch, challenged three deep into the final furlong but was outfinished by the top pair. PHENOM quickly cleared and
crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, was challenged with a furlong left to run, clung to a narrow lead approaching the sixteenth pole, then
relinquished command and yielded late. SHARED FUTURE broke well then stalked in the two path to the outside of the leader, lost ground between rivals
late on the far turn, kept to task through the lane and but was unable to summon the needed response. FOUNDER'S DAY was fractious in the gate, chased
three then two wide on the first turn, coaxed along between foes on the far turn then three deep at the quarter pole, offered a mild response but lacked the
needed late punch. SYMPHONY PERFECT (IRE) turned her head just before the gates opened and broke a step slow, traveled four then three wide around
the first turn, chased three wide into the far turn, four deep at the quarter pole and needed to find more late.

Footnotes
SHVERE ARBETER dueled three wide on the first turn then moved ahead from inner rival, set the pace under a hold up the backstretch, padded the lead
along the inside on the far turn, put to left and right-handed urging in the drive and held safely under steady handling late. FLATTERWITHJEWELS dueled
for the lead from inside into the first turn then stalked leaving the clubhouse bend, raced along the rail then two wide on the far turn, finished willingly down
the stretch but could only whittle the gap on the winner late. A BROKEN BREEZE stalked along the rail then angled out around the clubhouse, moved back
inside for the far turn then tipped out to three path again and finished evenly for the show. ROMAN EMPRESS settled two wide then moved inside, saved
ground through the far turn and never threatened. STARSHIP SKY chased three to four wide early, moved back in some and traveled two wide into the far
turn, started to weaken while easing out into the four around the bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
IN VRONSKY STYLE stalked along the inside into the turn, tipped out to challenge two wide at the quarter pole, dueled and took over at the eighth pole,
continued to battle SIX FEET through the final furlong and maintained a short advantage to the line to prove best. SIX FEET set the pace under pressure
early, cleared leaving the backstretch, showed the way along the inside around the turn then met the challenge from IN VRONSKY STYLE at the quarter
pole, relinquished the lead at the eighth pole but stayed on gamely to the wire. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT took a bump leaving the gate, stalked outside rivals
then had to steady nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, inched closer three to four on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SQUARE
CAT brushed outer rival at the start, stalked between foes then outside a rival, got boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker,
steered to the rail for a clear path and could not summon the needed rally in the lane. CHICK'S DIG IT got bumped and crowded between rivals in the
beginning, chased two wide into the turn, gained while angling out to the four path around the bend but flattened out in the lane. SAULS CALL slipped badly
in the hind-quarters to start, trailed two then three wide on the turn and passed a tired rival. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING pressed the pace from outside early,
chased two wide into the turn, three deep at the quarter pole, moved back inward leaving the bend and retreated.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE sped to the front, led in the two path then moved over to the rail on the turn, entered the lane two wide, remained clear into deep stretch
and held well over the runner-up. ANARCHIST raced up close from inside early, tipped out around the bend and took aim three wide into the stretch,
finished determinedly to draw alongside BRICKYARD RIDE late but could not get by. POSITIVITY stalked three deep to the turn, coaxed along three wide
then steered to the two path late on the bend and was along for the show. ARMAGNAC stalked between foes behind BRICKYARD RIDE early, chased
outside ANARCHIST on the turn then spun four wide into the lane and flattened out. TRUMPED stalked four deep in the early going, lost ground four then
three wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED MARY was off a bit slow from inside, stalked along the rail on the turn, moved off the fence leaving the bend, angled out and rallied three deep
in the final sixteenth and won the bob. PRINCESS ADALEIGH dueled with RAKASSAH (IRE) while along the rail to the stretch, battled down the lane, dug
in gamely but lost the bob at the wire. RAKASSAH (IRE) dueled for command outside PRINCESS ADALEIGH down the hill and into the stretch, battled
through the stretch and between rivals late to finished a game third. KITTY KITANA (GB) got knocked into inner rival at the start, chased two to three wide
around the turn, came out across the dirt, rallied four deep late but was not enough. ONE SILK STOCKING took a bump in the beginning, settled on the
inside, moved out across the dirt and came three wide into the stretch, steered out further and rallied five deep in the final sixteenth but needed more late.
PAMMY'S READY stalked in the two path outside a rival, moved out crossing over the dirt, steered back in some in the drive and lacked a bid. MUSIC
FESTIVAL broke in and bumped rival, trailed two wide into the turn, came out crossing the dirt and was not a factor.

TENACIOUS LADY tracked two wide out of range through the turn, rallied inside the top pair and took over in midstretch, kicked clear shortly after and won
going away. CASIA broke out and bumped rival, stalked off the inside, asked two to three wide into the lane, reached the front at the eight pole, was
overtaken by the winner in midstretch and stayed on to secure second. SUGAR SUGAR coaxed along early from the rail while off the pace, saved ground
through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and gained third. MIDNIGHT SUSI was off slow in the beginning, trailed two wide around the bend, summoned
a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. BALENCIAGA BETTY got brushed from inside at the start, raced off the pace four then three wide around the
bend and improved placings in the lane. GREY MAGIC broke a step slow, chased from inside to the stretch and weakened down the lane. RUFA RED
KNOT sped clear and opened up a comfortable lead early, held a diminishing advantage into the stretch, relinquished the lead with a furlong left to run and
weakened in deep stretch. SAPADILLA got bumped leaving the gate, stalked three wide around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
DEFUNDED leaned back and hopped at the start, trailed two wide early, continued at the back in the middle stages, angled out and was on the move four
wide then took aim at the the leading pair three wide into the stretch, took over entering the furlong grounds and drew away in the final sixteenth. ROYAL
SHIP (BRZ) was forwardly placed three deep early, moved up to apply pressure from outside on the backstretch, dueled outside MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH
around the far turn and into the lane, vied between foes in upper stretch, could not kick on with DEFUNDED in the final furlong and stayed on to secure the
place. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH dueled outside MR. IMPOSSIBLE into the the first turn then inched ahead around the bend, showed the way with rivals on
both sides up the backstretch, moved over to the rail for the far turn while dueling with ROYAL SHIP (BRZ), fought back inside outer rivals to the eighth pole,
then flattened to third. KISS TODAY GOODBYE stalked in the two path early, chased between rivals into the far turn then two wide leaving the bend and
lacked a bid when called upon. PARNELLI got crowded a bit shortly after the start, tracked in the three path early, raced three deep into the second bend,
spun four wide into the lane and failed to respond. MR. IMPOSSIBLE dueled from inside early then pressed around the clubhouse turn, lost touch with the
leader and chased into the far turn, had to check inside a rival approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
