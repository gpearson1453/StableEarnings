Footnotes
DOWNBURST raced prominently in the four path, stuck a head in front passing the half and opened up under rousing from the three path into the far turn,
was cued around the four path into the lane, and was kept to task while much the best. STARSHIP SKITTLES rated in the three path, circled an inner trio
under coaxing from the five path rounding the far turn, was in the six path entering the stretch, and chased on for place. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL hopped at
the start and trailed around the three path, was ridden around the far turn while tipping out and in the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for
show. MO TOWN MADISON stalked in the three path, was under rousing between foes early around the far turn, urged from the five path into the stretch,
but was tired. LEIPZIG tracked in the four path, was under coaxing between foes around the far turn, but had to steady just before the quarter, and was
empty along the inside entering the lane. NOBLE LADY set the pace along the inside into the backstretch, but yielded early around the far turn.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN OF SPEED vied between foes down backstretch, dropped back around the turn, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths marker, re-bid in the
lane, was up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. HUNTER was devoid of speed under a hustling ride, saved ground far back, angled out near the
quarter pole and finished with belated interest. FEDERAL EXCHANGE settled off the early pace while racing in the two path, rallied through the lane but
was outkicked for the place. EXALTED CHARM vied three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth marker and weakened.
HELLO JACK failed to menace while racing four and five wide. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR dueled inside of foes while racing a bit off the rail and tired in the final
furlong.

EVENTFUL chased in the two path, was driven around the turn, began to rally while angling out to the six path into the stretch, surged past a leading inner
duo nearing the final sixteenth, and drew clear. GOTTA LIKE HIM broke out at the start, raced up close around the six path, bid in the five path rounding the
turn and was cued right handed approaching the quarter, was in the four path at the top of the stretch, and outlasted the inner pacesetter for place. JAY'S
DELIGHT set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside rounding the turn, dug in from the two path into the stretch, was overtaken by the outer
eventual winner nearing the final sixteenth, and evened out late to show. BARFLY prompted the pace in the five path, was coaxed between foes in the four
path around the turn and in the three path entering the stretch, but flattened passing the eighth pole. INSTINCTUAL pressed in the four path, but dropped
back between foes passing the quarter and was empty at the top of the lane. BROOKLYN DREAMS trailed throughout from the two to five paths.

Footnotes
COCO settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and
powered clear. GOLDEN HAVEN raced in range three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, bumped with RACHEL'S SONG in upper stretch, took
the lead between rivals leaving the eighth pole, could not match strides with the winner late but dug in gamely to win the place duel. RACHELS SONG raced
three wide in midpack early, advanced four wide around the far turn, bumped in upper stretch, kept on but was outdueled for the place. RANSOM STYLE
set the pace in the two path to midstretch and tired in the final furlong. GREY PRINCESS was bumped just after the start, raced off the pace two wide
around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, checked near the quarter pole, angled out turning for home and never threatened. CONFER failed
to menace while racing three wide. GREEK MOJO was up close while pulling in the five path around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch, angled
back out four wide early on the far turn, angled back in in upper stretch and faded. FAR ABOVE was outrun inside. YANKEE STORM broke in a tangle and
bumped at the start, raced three to five wide and made little impact. GOOD VALUE played no factor while racing two wide. NOVELLIE chased inside and
had no response. NEWTON'S STAR (IRE) was up close at the rail and retreated nearing the lane.

KAEKO broke out at the start and stalked in the six path, ranged up and bid under rousing from the four path around the turn, took command approaching
the quarter, opened up into the stretch, and was driven clear. HEIRESSINDY broke in a tangle and chased from the five path, was driven around the turn
and in the six path at the top of the lane, and was along for place. DISCO QUEEN tracked in the four path, was under a ride in the two path midway around
the turn, under urging from the three path into the lane, and got up for show. BULLET ON TAP set the pace in the three path but was overtaken by the outer
eventual winner while in the two path nearing the quarter and faded down the stretch. LITTLE BELITA prompted the pace from the five path into the turn but
weakened in the stretch. RAISON THE GLASS trailed in the four path and never threatened around the eight path in the stretch. KATIESDREAMGIRL was
unhurried from the seven path into the turn and never menaced.

LORD OF WAR raced off the early pace three wide, was urged late on the first turn, made a quick bid down the backstretch, took over near the
five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. EMPIRE ATTRACTION raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran
on to gain the place. SWASHBUCKLE set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner midway around the far turn and was outfinished for the
place. MY MAN FLINT saved ground off the pace, made some progress three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. NANTASKET
BEACH played no factor while racing two and three wide. RED'S REVENGE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
IMONRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced prominently in the four path, bid under a nudge and took over approaching the quarter pole, was cued
right handed while opening up along the inside into the lane, and was driven clear. LITERATE chased in the five path, was under right handed urging
midway around the turn and in the six path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for place. PRINCESS TENKO bumped with an inner foe just after the
start and raced off the pace around the six path, was under a drive in the four path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, and was one
paced for show. NOTHING BUT PUMPS bobbled at the start, raced wellback around the two path but was no factor from out in the center down the stretch.
WHAT'S GOOD stalked in the five path, was driven between foes in the four path around the turn, but flattened out in the center down the stretch. LOVE
RHAPSODY set the pace in the three path, lost the lead in the two path approaching the quarter, and gaveway into the lane. WRITTENINTHESTARS
bumped with an inner foe at the start, was prompted along inside of foes but empty entering the lane. UNIFIEDS PRINCESS bumped with an outer foe after
the start, was unhurried in the five path early and never menaced.

Footnotes
GATSBY pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under
right-handed encouragement and drew clear. POWERFULLY BUILT set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of the winner but settled for second best.
CELESTIAL GLAZE was off a bit slowly, advanced four wide around the turn but was one-paced in the lane. DOC AMSTER raced in range three wide and
lacked the needed rally. ROYAL URN failed to menace while racing five wide. IN DUE TIME tracked the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane
and faded. YES I'M A BEAST had only brief speed inside.
