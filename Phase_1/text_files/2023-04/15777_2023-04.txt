Footnotes
LAST NATIVE CAT dueled on the early lead inside EXOTIC GENTLEMAN, put that one away nearing the lane and moved off under steady handling.
MOJITO chased the leaders three wide and rallied clear for the place. EXOTIC GENTLEMAN dueled outside the winner to late in the turn and weakened.
LOVE OURS lacked a rally four wide. AFTER BURN had no rally three wide. JAMAICA MISTAICA was not a factor. RUNNIN BUFFALO was always well
back. SIR BARNABUS was outrun.

Footnotes
MASTERPIECE DAY was on the pace off the rail and inside a rival, kicked clear through the far turn, was roused into the lane and drew off. SPORTY
FLYER stalked the lead pair inside and rallied to gain clear for the place. SILVER MAKER was last away, moved in entering the first turn and rallied through
the far turn to gain third. LADDIE BOY saved ground to move up going to the far turn but weakened while gaining position. TWICE THE PRICE weakened
three to four wide. RUN FOR MATTY forced the pace inside the winner for a half and weakened. THAT'S D 'CAT was always back. HATTIES JEWEL
weakened four wide.
