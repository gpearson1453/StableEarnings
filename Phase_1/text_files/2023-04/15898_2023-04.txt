Footnotes
TONY'S BABE vied inside for lead on the backstretch, held the rail on the turn and into the stretch, shook clear in upper stretch, implored in the final
sixteenth and lasted. COUSIN NIECEY tracked duo a bit off the rail on the backstretch, continued to track leaders on the turn, launched bid outside of clear
leader in the lane, all out late and surged to just miss. SAI PHAR away well and briefly cleared field exiting the chute, rider chose not to press the issue and
allowed TONY'S BABE to achieve rail position, continued two wide on the turn, unable to match strides into the lane and managed to save third. SISKIYOU
SKY settled well off the tepid pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid off the rail in the stretch and showed mild
run to threaten for show money. SHEILA'S CHARLIE tracked pace in hand three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in
range and failed to show any response and steadily faded. PLEASE NOTE, DUE TO MALFUNCTION, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
