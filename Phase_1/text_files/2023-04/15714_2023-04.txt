Footnotes
COOL INDIVIDUAL lacked early speed, made a late gain, rallied wide down the home stretch and drove clear. APPLEWOOD raced near the back in the
early part, made a steady gain, dueled three wide, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. OVERTHOUGHT raced in the middle of the field,
came around the final turn on the outside, made a bid, took the lead and was caught late for second. LIKEN IT vied for the lead, forwardly placed
throughout, saved ground and lacked a finish. BASSETT raced evenly near the back, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was
no factor. TAPPED OUT dueled on the front end and faded. SOCIAL AFLEET raced within contention, came around the final turn three wide and was
finished early. M AND M'S CUSTOM pressed the pace, racing outside around the first turn and dropped back. OCTOBER SURPRISE void of early speed,
was never close, lost contact with the field, distanced and walked off.

Footnotes
TRIPLE FOUR trailed in the early going, moved up around the second turn, angled out down the stretch, rallied from the outside and proved much the best.
MISS ST. CLAIRE raced within striking distance, made a bid down the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MIDNIGHT FAITH
showed early speed, racing outside around the first turn, made a bid, took the lead down the home stretch and weakened. TENSAS BERTIE pressed the
pace, raced close throughout and lacked a finish. GRACEFUL STREET was bumped at the start, racing in the back, had a wide trip, moved up, but was no
factor. HOT GOLDEN GIRL went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. TAP IRON FIST raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
GLAMOROUS STAR raced in the middle of the field and dropped back. SMART IZZY broke out, bumped rival and was never a factor. CALCITE broke thru
the gates before the start, raced within contention and dropped back.

MY MAN LOUIE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, was all out and just held on for the win. LODE OF BLARNEY lacked early speed, made a
late rally and just missed. BIG BELLA BROWN unhurried in the beginning, made a late bid, and finished willingly. B W P SPECIAL raced in the middle of the
field, made a bid and hung. HOSTILE AFLEET raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. GLENN'S JUMPER went to the front, drove clear
and faded. HALFMOON REEF always raced near the back and showed little. BIBLEMAN showed early speed and dropped back.
