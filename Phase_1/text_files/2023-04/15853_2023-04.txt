Footnotes
MY KIKI had speed three wide then vied between rivals under rating mid turn, was roused clear approaching the quarter pole, widened a bit near mid
stretch, kept on on under left handed asks inside the sixteenth pole then lasted over a charging BE A BANDIT. BE A BANDIT , urged in the clear and off of a
contested early pace, swung five wide into the lane, leveled off when switching over to her correct lead near the sixteenth pole, closed gamely and simply
ran out of ground. PEACEFUL VISION forced the pace between rivals into the turn, chased past the five sixteenths, shifted in and kept on with some
interest. LAURIEANN bobbled at the break, was hustled up inside soon after to contest the p[ace, eased back off the leaders mid turn, came out for room
bothering foes entering the lane, chased and faded. BLONDIE LOX BABE was shuffled back near the five and a half furlong marker, saved ground into the
stretch and lacked a bid. PRINCESS TRINA flashed speed, angled out into the turn, moved up four wide nearing the quarter pole, was carried out by
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY after that one was floated out by LAURIEANN and weakened. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY was rated back from between rivals
early, bid four deep into the turn, pressed three wide mid turn, was carried out some by LAURIEANN soon into the stretch and gave way. Following an
objection by the rider of PRINCESS TRINA against LAURIEANN, LAURIEANN was disqualified from fourth and placed sixth for causing interference
entering the stretcn.

Footnotes
SWEET CHABLIS attended the pace between rivals, poked a head in front five furlongs out, was nicely rated leaving the far turn, turned away a rail
challenge from LAST OF THE NILE near the five sixteenths, spurted clear soon after, widened under some asking in mid stretch then was steadily hand
ridden to prove clearly best. LAST OF THE NILE had speed between foes, prompted towards the inside through the backstretch, challenged along the rail
mid way on the final turn, came out for the drive and kept on willingly. MISS ST. CLAIRE vied inside rivals early then was rated back, edged up between
runners near the five eighths, pursued four wide nearing the lane and faded. CALIFORNIA BELLE lunged at the break then steadied, recovered and moved
up to stalk, came five wide for the drive and weakened. ALABAMA QUEEN saved ground and failed to respond. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW , four wide with
the early pace, chased through the backstretch and tired. TAKING PICTURES , four wide, tired.

Footnotes
CIGAR VAN vied outside a rival, moved clear into the lane while four wide, responded to solid asks and widened. CORN SOUP rated outside early on,
gained five wide to loom into the lane, gave hard chase from there and stayed on well to preserve the place. SABER STORM stalked the early pace three
wide, pursued between runners mid turn, came four wide into the lane and churned on between foes to gain the show. CLEVER PRINCE , four to five wide,
had a mild response. CALLEN FEELS GOOD , three wide, edged up between foes around the turn, dropped in to briefly threaten in upper stretch, failed to
kick on past mid stretch and faded. SWIFT N TRAFFIC saved ground with aim mid turn and weakened. IDE LIKE HAWAII , off the pace, angled out for the
drive and failed to menace. KINGS WAGER vied inside the winner, failed to keep pace nearing the lane and tired. K R TARGET lagged back, raced four
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BARNEY'S PASSION rated behind foes early on, came under a ride mid turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BRITE OUTLOOK cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, switched over to his left lead nearing
the sixteenth marker and maintained comfortable advantage while ridden out. FREE RAMBLING MAN stalked the winner while off the inside, was under
heavy pressure pursuing into the lane, failed to make inroads but kept on gamely to the wire. FIRST CLASS HARLOW saved ground in range, was under
asking into the lane but failed to seriously respond. DEFINE broke a step slow, raced three wide and between runners approaching the stretch but lacked a
late kick. SONYA KNOWS BETTER lagged well back early on, made some progress four wide past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and
gave way. TACTICAL VISION , three wide early, angled in and weakened. FREE FALLING NATE saved ground and faded.

DOUBLE ON THE RED rated behind rivals early, edged up to the inside of foes leaving the far turn, eased out for room then worked between runners into
the stretch, straightened away with sights set on the leader, leveled off under left handled asks, closed stoutly to reel that one in past the sixteenth marker
and eagerly drew clear. BLEEP BLEEP was sent clear early, dropped in and set a rated pace towards the inside, widened two wide after being set down in
upper stretch, kept on willingly but could not fend off the winner's charge through the final sixty yards. MARVINS' POSSE saved ground pursuing and kept
on with effort to the wire. OUR HEATSEEKER saved ground early, eased out and edged up between runners leaving the far turn, awaited room near the
quarter pole, altered in for the drive and churned on. SEA OF LIGHT , four wide, took closer order between rivals around the final turn, chased into the lane
and faded. IRON MOON , allowed to settled, lost ground five wide outside runner past the three eighths and came up empty. ZINGING BAYOU , three wide
stalking, was under pressure between foes near the five sixteenths and gave way. CREOLE REB failed to menace. COMPUTERIZED was not a factor.
CUSTOM CADILLAC stalked the pace, raced between runners around the final turn and tired.

Footnotes
HEI HEI CUSTIVITY showed speed then was rated back off the leaders and stalked between foes, eased out to be four wide around the turn, closed
determinedly under left handed asking and forged ahead in the final yards. ROSE PALACE set a pressured pace towards the inside, shook clear two wide
and under a drive past mid stretch, shied from the rail inside the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but just could not resist the winner. ZYDECO MUSIC stalked
inside, was stymied awaiting room behind an erratic ROSE PALACE near the sixteenth marker, eased out a bit and continued with effort. SIENNA BREEZE
saved ground, took closer order mid turn, eased out soon after, swung out from behind rivals leaving mid stretch but came up empty. BROKE FINANCING
rated well off the rail, gained five wide approaching the stretch then flattened out. INAWIC , four wide nearing the lane, failed to menace. MAESTRIA broke
poorly and was away a couple lengths last, was taken wide and rushed up nearing the turn, dropped in a bit to dispute the pace outside ROSE PALACE,
failed to go on in mid stretch and retreated. CONDESA'S HANDMAID forced the early pace outside the leader and tired.

Footnotes
PAC THE PULPIT settled in the clear and off of a contested early pace, gathered momentum three wide mid turn, angled five wide into the stretch,
sustained under left handed encouragement, wrested command from MULETRAIN in deep stretch and edged clear at the wire. MULETRAIN , four wide,
gained ground past the five sixteenths, bid to engage in upper stretch, gained a slim lead past the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but could not hold off the
winner's charge. ADMIRAL AFLEET checked at the break, moved up under a ride and well removed from the rail mid turn, circled six wide into the stretch
and rallied. RUNAWAY JIM stalked the pace, moved through along the rail to challenge near the quarter pole, battled past mid stretch and weakened late.
HALF CRAZY , vied five wide early on outside a rival, shifted in some and gained command past the three eighths, cleared briefly then was taken on from
the inside nearing the stretch, dueled and maintained a short lead between runners in mid stretch, kept on to the sixteenth pole and faded. ONE MORE
SLEEP chased the pace, angled in for the drive and weakened. D'FESTIVE CAT , four to seven wide, was not a factor. ST JOE lacked speed, angled out
mid turn and was not a threat. WAR KING sped to the early lead while well off the rail, was joined from the outside and dueled from the five eighths into the
turn, dropped in a bit then ceded the advantage near the three eighths, pursued to upper stretch and tired. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY was steadied near the
half mile marker and failed to menace. AMANDAS NEW MAN , towards the inside, faltered around the turn, was eased late and walked off.
