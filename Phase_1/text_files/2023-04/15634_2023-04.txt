Footnotes
TOMMY TSUNAMI was shut off as a rival broke in at the start, chased the leader to rally inside through the turn and went clear under steady handling.
GUCCI BLING rallied four wide and was just up for the place in the last jump. EXOTIC GENTLEMAN broke inward, sprinted to a clear lead out from the rail
and had nothing left nearing the wire. AFTER BURN was two to three wide and lacked a solid closing bid. DANUBE was three to four wide to move up into
the lane but lacked a final closing bid. SIR BARNABUS was four to six wide through the turn into the lane and weakened. IMMAFUNNIFOLKLORE bumped
with a rival at the start and was not a threat inside. CHAN was along the inside and had no rally. JAMAICA MISTAICA was bumped and steadied while
shuffled back at the break then had no rally four wide.

PALM COURT stalked the early leaders three wide, came four wide into the lane to bid and edged away under steady handling. REMARKABLE CHARM
saved ground and moved up inside through the far turn, angled three wide into the lane and gained the place. HIGH VALUE TARGET moved up four wide
with a mild bid to gain third while clearly best of the others. JACK'S PARTY GIRL contested the pace outside DAKAMO ROSE to the far turn and weakened
in the drive. NEBRASKA RED lacked a rally four wide. DAKAMO ROSE contested the pace out from the rail while inside a rival and tired. SHEZA SAVAGE
dropped back going up the backstretch and was pulled up nearing the lane but walked off under her own power.
