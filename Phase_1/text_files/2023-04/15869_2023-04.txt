Footnotes
SING CHARMER SING moved along the inside to get within reach through the far turn, briefly awaited room midway of the bend then came through on the
rail into the lane and was up in the closing jump. TELLITTOTHEJUDGE was on the pace about the two to three path to move clear in the far turn but was
caught in the closing jump. JUST LUCK was just off the early pace to angle out going up the backstretch, remained in good position but lacked the needed
late run in the lane. P R GIRLFRIEND forced the pace outside TELLITTOTHEJUDGE to the far turn and weakened. SHES STEEL DREAMIN followed the
pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
OREGON COUNTY made the pace on a short lead off the rail, was headed and cleared in the far turn then rallied back inside to collar that rival and be
going clear at the end. NEW STRIPE stalked the pace three to four wide to bid outside the winner and move clear in the final turn then could not sustain the
run in the lane. RECKLESSNESS tracked the pace three and four wide but lacked a final closing bid. OH SNAP settled back off the pace three wide, moved
six wide into the lane improved position to just miss the show. KEARNEY followed the pace three wide and lacked a rally. NUGGET OF GRACE was along
the inside and failed to threaten. GERDY'S BOY tired four wide. GENOMIC trailed throughout and dropped out after a half.
