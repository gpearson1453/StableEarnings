Footnotes
SILVER TUNES broke sharp to dictate the pace down the backside, continued to set the fractions uncontested through the turn, opened up at the top of the
lane and had enough left in reserve late to hold off foes at the wire. MISS BOBBIT was rated inside in the early stages, angled out widest near the back of
the field for the drive in the stretch, was gaining steadily while not changing leads and just missed when they hit the finish line. MIDNIGHT MEADOW
tracked inside just behind the winner in the beginning, was shuffled back briefly on the fence with three eighths to run, was looking for clear running room in
mid stretch and showed good interest to get up for third in a close photo. TICKLE HER TOE took a stalking position early mid pack between rivals, rallied
between horses three furlongs from the prize, had dead aim when they entered the lane and could only finish up evenly just losing the show bob at the line.
TAKE IT EASY had a stalking outside trip down the straight away, waited to pounce three wide outside foes on the turn, loomed boldly four wide as they
entered the top of the stretch but needed more late to be a factor. GORMLEY GIRL was unhurried early settling at the back of the pack down the backside,
offered a mild burst of energy mid point on the turn but could not reach contention throughout the final furlong.

Footnotes
MY FINAL TRICK got away alertly, was soon engaged by an outside foe, dueled inside that one on or just off the rail, was headed by the quarter pole,
fought back to regain a narrow advantage in mid-stretch, exchanged minor brushes and held that rival to get the nod. CHASING JOY was bumped after the
break then encouraged forward to force the pace, dueled outside the winner two to three wide, took a narrow lead coming to the quarter pole, dueled
gamely through the stretch while exchanged light brushes late and missed the nod. MORE SAVVY tracked from inside, moved out gradually late on the turn
coming four wide to the top of the stretch, ran on to secure show honors. MI TORMENTA was bumped into a rival a few strides out of the gate, settled at the
rear, was encouraged along on the turn racing near the rail, kept on in the stretch but needed more. SUBZERO PLUS bumped a rival after the start, raced
between foes into and on the turn, was forced five wide leaving that bend, failed to rally in the stretch. ERRATIQUE stalked from outside travelling four to six
wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART sat off the top two while comfortably in hand waiting to pounce into the turn, engaged three wide for the lead at the quarter
marker, assumed command outside foes when they straightened out for the drive and was edging away the final sixteenth. CELTIC REVIVAL kept a close
eye just outside of the early speed down the backside, took up the chase between foes two furlongs from the wire, could not match strides with the winner
into the stretch and finished up well to be a clear second. FOREST MAIDEN rated on the rail in mid pack in the beginning stages, could not gain on the
dueling leaders throughout the turn and finished up well enough to be a clear but non threatening third in the end. DELILAH'S REVENGE broke sharp
between rivals then was shuffled back near the rear at the half mile marker, was scrubbed on for more run with a quarter to run four wide as they entered
the stretch and passed a tiring runner late to get a minor share. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN broke inward brushing the gate to trail down the backside, was
nudged along early to keep the leaders in sight, could see them all at the top of the lane and finished with some run the last sixteenth. FAST'N SEXY was
away alertly to clear and get to the rail early on, lead the field into the turn, was collared by outside foes with a quarter left to run and folded on the fence in
the final furlong.

KINETIC STONE set the pace inside rivals early, moved clear soon after, turned back a challenger and held the advantage while being kept to the task.
MENDELJOHN (IRE) stalked the early pace from outside, went about three wide on the turn a couple lengths back of the leader, put to urging in the stretch
but could make no headway on the leader while securely holding the place. SWOOP veered in at the break, settled toward the back, went two to three wide
on the turn beginning to pick it up, angled out for room at the top of the stretch then lugged in a tad, was gaining but too late. FOREST STAR pressed the
pace briefly then continued to chase despite dropping back two to three wide, kept on in the stretch to obtain a minor placing. BARWICK settled off the
leaders, advanced inside saving ground on the turn but could not sustain the effort in the stretch. WICKEDBLACKBULLET raced outside foes four to five
wide on the turn and toward the rear, was never near enough to threaten. JIM'S HOPE broke a step slowly and awkwardly, fanned nine wide coming into
upper stretch, was not a threat. LEGS LIKE GIZMO broke a bit awkwardly perhaps brushing the gate in the process, advanced between runners heading
into the turn going three to four wide on that bend, flattened out in the drive. MIAH SAID chased outside runners mid-pack, went four to five wide on the turn,
dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
THEODOROPOULOS broke outwards to start, pressed the pace initially down the backside, was content to hound the pacesetter just outside throughout
the turn, took control three wide down the lane and was kept to the task holding safe by a diminishing margin when they hit the finish line. HEKLA'S AURA
had a stalking trip four wide at the half, was tracking in the second flight two off the fence around the turn, roused between rivals as they turned for home,
switched leads in mid stretch and then found her best stride late to make it interesting at the wire. LADY XI was squeezed at the break, trailed inside down
the backside, angled off the fence when they turned for home, ran on between horses in the five path through the lane and finished with energy to pass
rivals and garner the show award. KIMONO KATE tracked on the rail settling in mid pack in the beginning, kept in touch with the contesting leaders on the
turn, but could only offer an even finish inside late to settle for a minor role. JAB was allowed to settle at the back early on, continued to be unhurried racing
four wide three eighths from the wire, put in a mild rally while in the six path at the top of the lane and could not find more late to get involved. I'M A
BOURBON GIRL lead from the break, set the early fractions running on the fence through the turn, was headed outside by the winner when the
straightened out for the drive, fought on until the sixteenth pole and then retreated.

Footnotes
BASALT STREET was prominent between runners early but was soon eased back off the leaders content to track in behind racing two to three deep, lacked
room in behind foes from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, angled in from three or so wide to be about two deep in upper stretch, split rivals and
surged past inside the leading pair late. BOTTA SWING settled off the pace, moved out from four to six wide on the turn commencing an advance, struck
the lead outside by mid-stretch, dueled and held that sparring partner but was outkicked by the winner. VERDEJO stalked early, moved swiftly five wide on
the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, was challenged and overtaken, dueled gamely but was outkicked. BILLYJANE bumped with a rival at the start and
was shuffled back when in tight, moved out from three to five wide on the turn put to urging coming to the top of the stretch, angled out further for room and
kicked on with late interest. OL' BLONDIE chased the pace from between runners going three to four wide into the turn, was urged along on that bend,
came out a bit further for the drive and ran on evenly. DIAMOND CRUSH was forced out at the start, settled at the back inside runners but off the fence
moving to the three path on the turn, came out further in upper stretch and improved position. MITZI was outpaced trailing early, swung seven wide and
passed tired rivals. TAKOTA broke outwardly, attended the early pace inside, came off the rail at the top of the stretch and faded. FIRENSPICE bumped
with a rival at the start then was encouraged forward to set the pace two wide facing pressure, faded through the stretch. GIVERNY was
forwardly-positioned, pressed three wide on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
ALLEN DIGGS pressed the early frontrunner in the beginning just outside, took over the top spot racing on the turn, was collared outside to briefly lose the
lead a the furlong marker and rebid to gamely fight on to win the bob at the finish. COHERENCE waited near the rear entering the far turn, started to rally
four wide with three furlongs to go, took command in the five path momentarily at the furlong marker and fought on bravely but lost the nod at the wire.
ZAKHARI broke sharp to lead racing on the rail in the early stages, chased the winner on the fence throughout the turn but could not find another gear for
the drive and could not challenge the top two late but still held well for the third place money. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE trailed early, was unhurried as they
raced down the backside, was roused for more at the quarter pole, raced in the five path with an eighth remaining and could only pass a tiring runner in the
end. AMBER LIGHT was throttled back to sit in a good spot watching the top two runners battle at the start, loomed three wide between rivals with three
sixteenths to run and could not match strides with others late and gave way.

Footnotes
SACRED DANCER settled off the pace, advanced inside a rival but off the fence past the five-sixteenths moving out four wide and gaining between runners
coming to the top of the stretch, obtained the lead past mid-stretch while drifting out a bit at that juncture but edged clear. UNABLE settled off the leader
stalking that one from outside, went three wide on the turn, floated five wide coming out of that bend, was carried out a bit in mid- to late-late stretch but
kicked on to get up for second. LIVIN ON LUV stumbled at the start, advanced inside through the stretch, missed the place. MAGNILOQUENT moved clear
to set the pace racing near the rail, drifted out leaving the turn, lacked the needed late kick. SPEEDY RIVER broke outwardly and a step slowly, was allowed
to settle, shifted out from three to seven wide late on the turn, needed more late. SPANISH BEAUTY bore out on the turn, was not persevered with in the
lane, ducked in nearing the wire, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF UNABLE AGAINST
SACRED DANCER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH VINO was off slow to trail the field down the backside, was urged three eighths from the finish, still could see them all when they turned for
home, began to rally in mid stretch and burst on through in the three path late to get up for a well timed closing finish victory. NORTHERN PASSAGE broke
out at the start, settled near the back in the early stages, weaved her way to the outside to rally in the seven path at the three sixteenths marker and offered
a good finish to just miss out on the victory in the end. KNOW HOW (GB) rated in mid pack between rivals, took closer order running three wide at the
quarter marker, was in the five path finishing well entering the stretch, poked her nose in front at the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the closers and
settled for third in the end. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ was reined back sitting nicely on the rail behind the early speed, advanced smartly inside on the turn, tried
to angle out for a clear run in upper stretch, could not find a path and settled for a minor share at the finish. SNEAKY REBEL had a nice trip watching the
engaging leaders go at it into the turn, loomed three wide entering the lane, briefly leading in upper stretch but could not sustain her bid and faded the last
sixteenth. FOREST CHOICE contested the pace in the two path between runners on the turn, tried to match strides with the leaders when they hit the top of
the stretch and was empty for the drive to the wire. MURDER HORNET settled four wide outside horses at the half near the rear, was urged for more run
midway on the turn, offered little response and was not a factor through the lane. QUIET MADDELENA battled on the rail for the leading in the beginning,
continued to fight inside for the top spot on the turn and folded at the furlong marker on the fence.
