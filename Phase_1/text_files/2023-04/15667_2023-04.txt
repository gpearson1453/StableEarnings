Footnotes
SLEEPY CAT broke outwardly then moved forward outside rivals up the backstretch, drew even outside the leader three deep about the five-sixteenths, was
in command at the top of the stretch, edged clear then held sway under steady but moderate urging. MISS MIA tracked from inside, moved out a bit early on
the turn, continued to shift out fanning six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place. TENSE broke a step slowly while brushing the gate then
steadied when in tight leaving the stalls, switched out racing off the inside up the backstretch, began to advance some leaving the turn in the four path
before moving back in a bit, advanced between runners in mid-stretch and ran on. JEMEZ FALLS shifted in tracking the leaders inside, saved ground on the
turn, angled five wide turning for home and ran on evenly. LUTION raced near the inside off the leaders, passed a rival two wide running on evenly. MISS
HIGH N MIGHTY was urged forward to set the pace racing on or just off the rail, gave way in the stretch. TIS SYRIAN KITTY was outpaced, distanced,
walked off.

Footnotes
HER GOLD MINE moved clear but six wide entering the first turn, shifted in on the early part of that bend to set the pace racing in about the two path and in
the clear, responded when asked and drew off. KITTEN ROCKS was caught five then four wide on the first turn moving up outside rivals, stalked the
pacesetter and eventual winner, edged a bit closer three to four wide on the far turn looming a threat coming near the top of the stretch, drifted out in upper
stretch, was headed for second but fought back to regain the place while no threat to the winner. TWELVE RED ROSES was brushed at the break, caught
four wide into the first turn then taken back and shifted in saving ground the remainder of that bend in behind the second group, tipped out up the
backstretch, advanced three to four wide on the far turn looming a threat turning for home, was carried out six deep in upper stretch by a drifting rival, put a
head in front of that one into second place but was outfinished and settled for show honors. WEEKEND PASS was unhurried early, swung six wide into
upper stretch ran on. QUEEN EKATI raced between foes tracking the leader two wide into the first turn, dropped back and tipped out for the run up the
backstretch, began a rapid move about the five-sixteenths four wide, swung six wide into upper stretch then altered inside drifting rivals about the
three-sixteenths, ran on evenly. AH LEAH tracked from inside, saved ground, steadily dropped back and failed to rally. ZANDREA'S brushed a rival lightly at
the start, stalked three wide between runners on the first turn, steadily dropped back two to three wide on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) got away alertly, set the pace in the clear racing near the inside, drew off when asked under steady hand urging. FOGGY
KITTEN switched outside the early leader, stalked that one going two wide into the turn, was no match but held the place. SILVERA settled inside a foe off
the pace racing off the inside, moved in a bit going three wide on the turn, asked for more about the five-sixteenths, swung six deep into upper stretch, kept
on late to narrowly miss second. AUNT STELLA was a bit fractious in the gate, broke outwardly, gained forward position tracking from inside, angled four
wide turning for home, made no late bid. ARCH FLYER was a step slow and in tight then steadied just slightly at the start, brought up the rear, swung off the
inside turning for home and passed tired rivals. IRISH HALO shifted in early, saved ground, failed to rally. PRINCESS CONSUELA was caught outside a
rival early going four wide into the turn, fanned seven deep for the drive and failed to rally.

Footnotes
TIME HEIST pressed from inside then engaged the leader more thoroughly to duel inside, took command just past the three-sixteenths and forged clear
under urging. RESTORING HOPE broke a half-step slowly, switched outside rivals and moved up four wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to get up for
second. ACT OF BOB broke outwardly quite a bit then moved forward and clear to force the pace from outside, was engaged by an inside foe up the
backstretch, dueled with that one, yielded in upper- to mid-stretch and lost place late. EASTER MUSIC switched off the rail early, raced toward the back,
angled six wide turning for home, drifted out a bit, ran on. DEVIL'S RULE broke inwardly, moved out off the inside to race about three wide early on the turn,
fanned seven wide put to strong urging and beginning to pick it up, was carried out a bit in upper stretch before shifting in, ran on evenly thereafter.
WILLOW RIDGE tracked from the two path inside rivals mid-pack, failed to rally. SPEEDY G chased from between runners three wide into the turn, dropped
back and moved out five wide coming out of that bend, failed to rally.

Footnotes
ACT A FOOL was lightly bumped and stumbled at the start, recovered to move forward and clear dictating the pace on or just off the rail, shook off rivals,
kicked clear and was kept to the task. WESLAN shifted in early on the first turn, tracked the leaders inside advancing quickly to take closer order up the
backstretch, lost ground dropping back on the far turn but kept on in the stretch to gain the place over GEM COLLECTION, who was encouraged forward to
stalk the eventual winner two to three wide, was floated a bit wider by the leader into the stretch, could not kick on with that one and lost place. SIVAKO
broke a bit awkwardly, was forced out four wide into the first turn, moved in up the backstretch racing mid-pack two to three wide through the far turn, ran on
in the lane but needed more. MONGOLIAN BEE broke inwardly bumping a rival with a bit of force, lacked early speed bringing up the rear, angled out in
upper stretch and ran on with mild interest. EL RAYO stalked just off the pace three to four wide, came up empty. FAITHFUL KING was bumped hard and
squeezed back at the start, rank early fighting the rider and drifting out on the first turn, tired.

Footnotes
WINGING WAYS was urged clear to dictate terms, set the pace inside, drew clear in the stretch and was kept to the task. CHICKS FOR FREE was bumped
at the start, raced at the back, began to advance outside foes four then five wide on the turn, altered inside a drifting rival for room near the sixteenth pole
and captured the place. PUBLIC SAFETY raced just off the leaders mid-pack going three to four wide on the turn, came out further for the drive and ran on.
CHRISTMAS PRESENT saved ground and ran on evenly. SOUPER FORTUNE was forced out at the start then coaxed forward, chased the leaders racing
just off the rail in about the two to three path, had no extra. JACK VAN BERG was urged at the break but outsprinted early, chased the eventual winner just
off that one, could not kick on and drifted out in mid- to late-stretch while weakening. KING TITO broke outwardly bothering a rival, switched out racing at the
back off the inside, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, was never a threat. RENEGADE BOB bumped a rival at the start, dropped back two to three wide
and failed to rally. C C'S KITTEN was bumped into a rival at the start, chased from between foes three wide into the turn then moved in a bit, faded in the
stretch.

SHARP HERO pressed the pace just off the leader, bid outside the five-sixteenths, was in command by the quarter pole, forged clear in upper stretch and
held sway. STOPSHOPPINGAMY was brushed lightly at the start, outsprinted early, raced near the rail through the turn, rallied between runners in mid- to
late-stretch for the place. RACETOTHEFINISH bobbled outwardly just slightly at the start brushing a rival, pursued the pace from outside four wide, needed
more. WAY TOO SMARTE was outpaced early racing outside well back of the leaders through the turn, raced three to six wide throughout and improved
position. DOCS SEVEN attended the early pace three wide and between, weakened. INDICIA was outpaced and not a factor. JUST A WONDER set the
pace inside facing some outside pressure, gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
MODIFIER broke a half-step slowly, moved forward under some coaxing going three to four wide on the first turn stalking the pace, edged closer leaving the
backstretch, launched a bid three wide and took charge outside the five-sixteenths, drew clear by mid-stretch and was eased up late. GOLD SMOKE
switched off the inside early racing in the three to four path at the back into the first turn, advanced heading to the far turn, moved out from three to five wide
on that bend, ran on to be second best while no threat to the winner. KITTEN'S CLOWN raced off the pace two to three wide early, continued well back of
the leaders two deep on the far turn, kept on in the drive to get show honors. HIGHLY UNLIKELY was forced out four to five wide by a rival at the rear
entering the first turn, settled up the backstretch racing two to three wide into the far turn, came out a bit in upper stretch then lugged in, ran on to improve
position. WICKED SUPRISE pursued the pace two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. SUMMER COUNTRY was caught four to five wide through
the first turn, raced well-positioned up the backstretch into the far turn off the leaders three wide, failed to rally. FITZEA saved ground on the first turn,
switched out racing well off the inside up the backstretch, was never a factor. LIMA ZULU brushed the gate lightly, was urged clear to set the pace inside,
wilted.
