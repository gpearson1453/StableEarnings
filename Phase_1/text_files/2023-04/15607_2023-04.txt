confident handling. CATCHING MAGIC stalked the early pace, offered a bid three wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path late and finished clear for
second. CAJUN BAYOU with the second flight, between horses, swung wide and finished with good courage in the seven path. BAY DEFENSE pressured
the winner two wide into the stretch and weakened late. PRETTY LOUD was hustled along, stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch and gave way
late. AWESOME BREAK dropped back from an alert start and was no threat.

through the final yards. KING OF THE RING stalked the pace three wide, dropped inside at the top of the stretch and finished clearly second best. BLOOD
MOON close up from the start four wide, moved up three wide into the far turn then leveled off. ROYAL DRAGOON was shut off at the start, trailed into the
stretch, swung wide and had a mild late rally. ENJOY BASEBALL pressured the winner two wide into the far turn then weakened. JACK'S ADVANTAGE
well placed, failed to respond. HARD N'SWEET stumbled outward at the start and was through after a half.
