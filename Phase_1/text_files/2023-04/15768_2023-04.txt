Footnotes
THE LAST FACT moved clear to dictate the pace racing inside, widened. IRONMAN RICHIE chased the eventual winner from the two to three path, held
the place. BOURBON TEDDY settled off the pace, raced outside three to four wide on the turn, kept on to get the nod for show. TAPIT SAM raced off the
leaders going two to three wide on the turn, lost the nod for show honors. PIRATE BIRD saved ground inside, failed to rally. TRIPLE CHROME reared at the
start spotting the field about fifteen lengths, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BOURBON DELIGHT prompted the pace outside the leader, continued to prompt two wide through the far turn, swung four wide and went to a drive in
upper stretch, continued to give chase even as TROY OUNCE opened up to midstretch, found his best in the final furlong, led near fifty yards out and
opened up late. TROY OUNCE was quick to the lead, set a pressured pace, kicked clear from upper stretch when pushed along, but was reeled in past the
furlong mark and no match for BOURBON DELIGHT late. BEHAVIN MYSELF broke outward, chased midfield through the first turn, advanced to join outside
of DEVIL'S RULE to stalk the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the three path around the far turn, was driven in upper
stretch, and chased on while proving no match for the leading pair in the lane. DEVIL'S RULE tracked the leading pair, raced very keenly around the first
turn and down the back straight, was pushed along in the four to five path on the far turn, went to a drive near the quarter, and lacked the needed rally in the
lane. KRAMDEN broke inward, settled near the rear, continued toward the rear in the two path on the far turn, and offered no rally. GAGOOTS was bumped
between BEHAVIN MYSELF and KRAMDEN in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the far turn while driven, and had no
response.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED ANNSLEY was rated outside of foe to draft just off the early leader down the backstretch, challenged through the far turn, dug in late and just
got up under all out pressure. SUMMER BELLE showed good early foot from the inside of foe, asked to take control early down the backstretch, dug in
gamely late and just missed in a game effort. MAIDEN ROCK stalked the top pair, raced four to five wide in the lane, kept on but was no match for the top
pair. THIS MASQUERADE dropped back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. NOT TO BE DENIED was off slowly, raced
five deep past the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. QUEEN EKATI settled off the early going, lost ground and was eased up on through the
stretch run .Stewards denoted that Queen Ekati bled per state vet.

NEPAL UP raced off the dueling pair down the backstretch, moved up from the inside nearing the quarter pole, split rivals near the eighth pole and edged
clear late under strong handling while racing two deep. DANVILLE stalked the duel, took aim for command racing from the outside of foes five deep near the
three sixteenths pole and kept on willingly to the wire. JEFF THE LION dueled for the early lead from the inside and agave way grudgingly late. DIAMOND
DAVE raced near the back of the pack early on, moved up two wide nearing the quarter pole, shifted out six to seven wide through the upper stretch and
raced evenly with no closing run. BAKENEKO dueled from the outside of foe and weakened in the drive. PERFECT WAGER settled off the early going, hard

Footnotes
I DON'T KNOW MARGO quick to begin from the outside, set all the pace and held safe late under steady handling. BEG BORROW N STEAL stalked the
pace, raced three wide just past the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire while racing four to five wide. TIME BREAK was hustled early from the
inside and kept on to the wire. GHAALEB'S RANGER raced off the early going, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and improve position to move
up from the outside. WILDWOOD DREAMER tracked the early leader from the outside and weakened. QUILTING PARTY raced off the early pace, was five
deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. MUD HUT was slow early, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no late response while
racing two wide. CAT ROYALE chased the top trio, raced four wide near the quarter pole and weakened. FROSTED ECLAIR was shuffled back at the start,
raced five to six deep in the lane and never threatened.
