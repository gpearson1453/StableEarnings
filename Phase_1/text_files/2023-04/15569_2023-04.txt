Footnotes
AFJAN came in slightly at the break then bumped soundly with a foe, went three wide around the opening bend, moved up to make a bid with five furlongs
to run, vied in the three path while between foes on the far turn, took a short advantage late on that bend, inched clear while drifting in under a right-handed
crop inside the three-sixteenths, came out under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, was given one final pop of a left-handed crop into the final
sixteenth and proved best under a strong hand-ride to the wire. SALTO DE TIGRE bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, was rated in the two
path early on the first turn then shifted four wide, settled just off the pace on the outside, made a bid under urging in the four path around the final turn,
turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, kept on well in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong but was outfinished while willingly securing the
place. SMOKE AND HEAT went around the first turn in the two path, settled well off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, gained while
moving from the two path to the four path around the final turn, spun five wide into the stretch under a drive, chased outside in a good striking position into
the final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show. GUT FEELING bumped soundly with a rival at the start, prompted the pace on the inside, was
urged along late on the backstretch, vied along the rail on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and weakened. NORGAY bumped soundly with rivals
on both sides at the start, went to the front, raced in hand in the two path around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch with company to both
sides, was asked in the two path while between horses on the far turn, lost the lead late on that bend and gave way. DONTBELATE drifted out shortly after
the start, floated from five to seven wide around the first turn then dropped back to the five path, fell well behind the rest of the field and was eased but
walked off.

Footnotes
ALWAYS CHARMING coaxed from the gate, showed the way through swift splits in hand just off the inside, shook away through the turn and went three
wide into upper stretch, then drew off under a drive getting wrapped up through the final sixteenth to the finish. CENTRAL PRIDE coaxed from the start,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to
secure the place honors. CLASH A. J. hustled from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three to four wide for home and improved position to secure the show honors. JUGGLER four then three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. GOT THE GOLD hesitated at the start
standing momentarily in the stall when the latch was sprung and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TREVOR BARDETTE coaxed from the start, chased
along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

FOOLISH GHOST came out just after the start then bumped soundly with a foe, went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled
the action in the two path around the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, drifted out under a right-handed crop in the final furlong
and held under steady urging. MAJESTIC TIGER was urged along off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide, swung
five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. BRONX BOMBER showed speed then switched out near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the
three to four path around the turn and weakened while able to get the show. RUNNINGWSCISSORS broke out at the start, showed speed then chased the
pace, saved ground around the turn and tired. QUICK RETURN broke out then was bumped solidly by a foe after the start, settled outside under some
urging, went around the turn in the three path, dropped to the two path coming to the quarter-pole and failed to rally. MASKED MARAUDER was urged
along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the three path, had the rider lose his crop into upper stretch and failed to threaten. GANDY DANCING was
urged along off the pace, went four to five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LAFITTE'S FLEET coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking two to three wide through the turn, angled out
seven wide into upper stretch nudging JUMPSTER eight wide, rallied in tandem with that foe to issue a challenge a furlong out, overthrew the leader a
sixteenth from home, traded some minor leans and gamely prevail at the end. JUMPSTER five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got floated eight wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe
to overthrow the front just inside the sixteenth pole, traded minor leans late and just missed at the finish. LOST IN ROME taken in hand briefly at the start,
settled three wide in pursuit, advanced on the front taking over command when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive and was displaced a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors. GENTLEMAN JOE chased five then four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighth, swung six wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive but was outkicked. BLAKE B. hustled from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside through swift splits, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths floated out briefly three wide near the three-eighths marker before
being corrected, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PETE N BILLY was away alertly, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path around the turn, reached even terms with the leader under a
drive in upper stretch, took the advantage inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. FREUDMEIN was hustled from the start, moved
up to take the lead then set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn, was asked for his best while remaining on
his inside lead in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, lost the advantage inside that marker, continued on his
inside lead and was outfinished while clear for the place. CALDO CANDY was forced out at the start and off a bit slow, angled in early on the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and finished with late energy to garner the show. BOURBON CHASE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the
pace, moved out outside the five-eighths, went six to seven wide around the turn and failed to threaten. Z DANCER veered out at the start, was urged along
off the pace, climbed after dropping in behind a rival near the five-eighths then leveled out when taken back outside, was urged five to six wide around the
turn and failed to rally. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL leaned out at the start then bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on
the turn and tired then had the rider lose his crop coming to the wire. FLUORESCENT BAY dropped well behind, went three to four wide around the turn
and was no factor.

on even terms for the lead, responded well under the crop in the drive and prevailed under strong urging. AMERICAN LAW broke out then brushed with a
foe while corrected by the rider, was urged along just off the pace, chased three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, was driven five wide into the
