Footnotes
PRIME EXAMPLE was away alertly to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace,
increased that margin into the lane and drew off as the easiest of winners. REGULATION DAZED broke sharply to chase the winner from off the rail, was no
match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. FUN CITY chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and finished with good
late energy. MIGHTY TIGER was off slow, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. BIG VANILLA settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BIG PEN TEN lagged far back early, moved five-wide through turn and was eased
through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BOLD VOYAGER broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command inside the sixteenth pole and held BARNFIELD
safe late. BARNFIELD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not get by the winner late but finished with
good energy. MR LOVE MUFFIN raced four-wide through the first turn then raced just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and
finished with good late energy. OUR VALLEY sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way late. GHOSTER was
forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. LIGHTNING STAR raced off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. MANFORALLSEASONS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. TWO SOCKS MAC lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

PARTY POLICE broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, was well rated through the back-stretch, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and held sway to the wire. IMPULSUS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into
the stretch and finished with a steady bid. YOUONLYLIVETWICE raced four-wide through both turns, was forwardly placed throughout and failed to gain
late. SASSY EINSTEIN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. SHE'S MY
RIDE was off slow, raced unhurried early and lacked the needed rally. LATER DAYS chased the winner while racing four-wide, drifted out through the
second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MONGOL ALTAI settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached THICK HAZE with a sixteenth to run, vied with that rival
and edged away late. THICK HAZE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch, vied with
the winner but could not match strides with that rival late. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out
further into the lane and finished with a steady rally. ZUMURUDEE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached
a contending position but failed to gain late. CIBERTRUCK was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with
some late run. UNCLE JEFF pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. MOONLITE GRAHAM sprinted clear at
once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened through the final furlong. KALINE hopped at the start, raced four-wide through the first turn,
lacked early speed and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
