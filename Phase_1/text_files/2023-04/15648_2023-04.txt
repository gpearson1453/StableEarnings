Footnotes
PATRICK THE GREAT was coaxed to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, maintained a safe advantage under the crop until outside the
sixteenth-pole then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much the best. UNION LIGHTS brushed with a foe at the start, dropped back under
urging early then settled while held together, moved out outside the five-eighths then came back under urging, raced in the five path around the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no threat to the winner. DEE'S SPEEDSTRE tracked the pace down the backstretch,
chased in the three path around the turn, raced under the crop late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no
match then lost the place while clear for the show. ROMANOATSEE settled on the outside then dropped well off the pace, was urged along in the three path
around the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed to threaten. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR was
hustled from the gate then urged along towards the front, saved ground around the turn and came up empty. GRAND MANNER was hustled from the gate,
moved out leaving the chute, settled under some urging, chased in the four path around the turn and tired. KONG LOVES A FIGHT brushed with a foe at
the start, showed no speed, raced inside to the two path around the turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor.

STOLEN FUTURE three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning three wide for
home, rallied to take command straightened away, dug in under a drive under lone threat and held gamely to prevail. LOON CRY chased three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately
repelled at the end while along clear of the rest and second best. CERRETTA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until set down angled out six
wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. MZ BIG BUCKS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish to secure the last major share, then lost rider when returning from the
gallop out, briefly ran off before being apprehended by outrider. MY CARA MIA MINE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CENTRAL SPEED four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, bid five wide into upper stretch, got put to a right handed crop and ducked in directly in front of AUTUMN at the three-sixteenths, had that foe
clip the back of her heels and fall heavily forcing LADY LAOBAN to then fall over her, then weakened to the finish. BUSHWICK chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PHINNEYS HARBOR coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand through swift splits just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and folded. LADY LAOBAN bobbled at the start, recovered to tracked the pace along the inside
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, had AUTUMN fall heavily directly in front when clipping
the heels of CENTRAL SPEED when that rival ducked in at the three-sixteenths and had no chance to avoid the fallen foe falling directly over her and into
the railing, recovered to her feet sans rider and ran off briefly before being apprehended by the outrider and was subsequently vanned off. AUTUMN just off
the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside through the turn coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, had
CENTRAL SPEED duck in sharply under a right handed crop with three-sixteenths to go and clipped heels with the back of that rival falling heavily into the
fence before LADY LAOBAN fell over her, got up under her own power and ran off clockwise and was apprehended by the outrider and subsequently
walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the incident at the three-sixteenths. After review, CENTRAL
SPEED was disqualified from sixth place and placed last before the result was declared official.

PROMISEHER AMERICA broke out and bumped lightly with a foe, went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace down the backstretch,
made a bid under urging in the three path on the far turn, took the lead coming to the five-sixteenths, responded well under a left-handed crop in the stretch
and gamely prevailed under strong urging. GAMBLING GIRL dropped to the rear after the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the
rear of the field, was urged in the two path early on the far turn, moved to the three then four path later on that bend, shifted five wide outside the
quarter-pole, came six wide into the stretch then drifted out under a left-handed crop while making a bid around the three-sixteenths, fought outside in the
final furlong, moved in under a right-handed crop around the sixteenth-pole and missed while able to get the place. SHIDABHUTI rounded the first turn in
the three path, settled under some restraint, was roused near the half-mile pole, raced three wide early on the far turn then was asked for more while shifting
five wide, gained to make a bid in upper stretch, battled on even terms for the lead into the final furlong but was out-kicked while clear for the show.
CAPELLA was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked under threat inside the three-eighths then lost the advantage coming to the
five-sixteenths and weakened. OCCULT bumped lightly with a rival at the start, raced in the four path around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the
outside, made a bid in the four path midway through the far turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled under a drive into the final

Footnotes
TRYINMYHEARTOUT raced in the four then three path around the first turn, prompted the pace loosely between foes, vied in the two path on the far turn,
was asked near the five-sixteenths, battled on even terms under a drive in upper stretch, took the lead just inside the furlong marker, fought outside of two
foes to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. UTILIZATION RATE (FR) went to the front, lugged out a bit into the first turn, went around that
bend in the two path, showed the way with company to the outside down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole,
battled inside of two opponents under a drive in the stretch, fought on well to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. MONETIZE IT (GB) was
well placed in the pocket while saving ground, drafted inside around the far turn, shifted to the two path when asked at the quarter-pole, made a bid between
horses in upper stretch, fought with those two rivals to the wire and missed while able to get the show. ZAPPERA settled off the pace while saving ground,
was roused on the final turn, chased the leading trio in upper stretch, moved out behind those foes inside the furlong marker and finished with good courage
to get the last spot in the superfecta. SHE'S MO BUBBLY moved in down the opening straightaway, settled in the two path, drafted behind horses around
the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, altered out for room outside the furlong marker and finished willingly but just missed the superfecta. BOLLINGER
was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, went three then two wide around the first turn, settled at the rear, raced under restraint in the two path on
the far turn, was taken up outside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the
needed response. BILOXI BLUES was taken back under restraint early, lugged out while tugging at the bit into the first turn, went four wide while keen
under a hold around that bend, tugged extremely hard at the bit while very rank under vigorous restraint entering and early on the backstretch, leveled out
while outside approaching the half-mile pole, was roused three then four wide on the final turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. UNDOUBTEDLY traveled around the first turn in the five then four path, stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on
the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

JOEY FRESHWATER coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took over command swinging four wide
into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to prevail. GILMORE traded a bump at the start with VICTORY WAY, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and closed well in the late stages to just get up in the very last jump for
the place honors. VICTORY WAY traded a bump at the start with GILMORE, pressed the pace of PROVE RIGHT from the inside while just off the rail,
tucked to the fence into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced to take over narrow and brief command at the five-sixteenths, got
headed spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive running on and was nailed on the wire for the place honors. EXPECTED VALUE broke out
at the start bumping PROVE RIGHT in the hindquarters, chased three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled seven wide at the head of the
stretch and offered up late foot to close in concert with GILMORE to his inside but got out-finished in the late going. DAYDREAMING BOY five then four
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. PROVE RIGHT got
bumped in the hind end at the start by EXPECTED VALUE, who broke outwards, established the front shortly after and showed the way in hand three then
two wide under pressure to the inside from VICTORY WAY, came under coaxing at the three-eighths now under threat from flanking rivals, yielded the front
with five-sixteenths to go and angled five wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off, then weakened through to the finish. ARREBATO coaxed
from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DOPPELGANGER away well, quickly dropped back and chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge nearing the final sixteenth, overthrew
a trio seventy yards from home to take over, then prevailed edging away to the finish to score. REPO ROCKS hustled from the gate, received intermittent
taps down the backstretch to the right shoulder, continued five wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs out, went five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining and ran on to just secure the place honors on the wire. EXPRESSMAN coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace
three wide between foes down the backstretch, had LITTLE VIC tuck inwards and was bumped in behind the leader TODAY'S FLAVOR and forced to
steady off that rival's heels just inside the half mile pole losing about three quarters of a length to a length of ground as a result, tipped back out three then
four wide coming under coaxing near the three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just miss for the place honors.
TODAY'S FLAVOR coaxed from the start, cut the pace just off the inside under pressure from a pair, lost one of those rivals when LITTLE VIC decided he
wanted to be the lone pace pressure and pinched EXPRESSMAN out just inside the half mile pole, knocked heads with LITTLE VIC through the turn and
was set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shaking off that rival confronted by a pair, dug in and was overwhelmed with
seventy yards to the finish and was out-finished in the late stages. BOLD JOURNEY chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing
just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. LITTLE VIC prompted the pace outside a
pair four paths off the inside, tucked three wide bumping EXPRESSMAN to the two path in behind the leader forcing that rival to steady off heels, advanced
to duel for command three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch on near even
terms, got shaken off a furlong out and weakened through to the finish, then was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
VERONICA GREENE was bumped at the start then forced out, came under restraint early, went around the first turn in the three path, settled towards the
back while unhurried, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path around the final turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to
get the lead coming to the furlong marker, fought outside of the runner-up to the sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. EXPAND THE MAP
(IRE) was taken in hand early then taken back, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved of the pace, came under urging while two then three wide
around the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid nearing the furlong marker, battled with the winner to near the sixteenth-pole
then was outfinished while clear for the place. CANDLE traveled around the first turn in the three path, settled well behind the runaway leader in second
position, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, gained three wide into the stretch, made a bid outside the furlong marker but was out-kicked while
able to get the show. CAIRONI settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, came further out near the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response. YO CUZ was sent to the front, opened up a sizable advantage while inside to the two path, shortened stride in the two path
around the far turn, was swallowed up while under the crop outside the furlong marker and tired. INTO HAPPINESS settled at the rear, saved ground on
both turns and was no factor. GEYSER ROAD broke out and bumped with a foe, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, dropped back
three then four wide around the far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
LORD MILES bumped with a rival at the start, established a forward position early, went three wide around the first turn, raced up close on the outside, was
asked in the four path on the far turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, made a bid outside of three foes inside the three-sixteenths, came in slightly
under a right-handed crop and jostled with the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole, jostled again with that foe inside that pole, rubbed saddles while battling
with two opponents to the wire and gamely prevailed at big odds. HIT SHOW moved in some early, went four wide around the opening bend, settled just off
the pace, was given his cue in the three path while inside of the winner on the far turn, moved out for room under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, made
a bid between foes inside the three-sixteenths, jostled with the winner outside the sixteenth-pole then again inside that pole, continued to fight between foes
while rubbing saddles to the wire and was denied while just able to get the place. DREAMLIKE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand nearing the
first turn, traveled around that bend in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, issued a challenge under urging in
the four then three path on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, fought on gamely inside of two opponents in the final furlong, rubbed
saddles some with the runner-up starting outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed while well clear for the show. ARCTIC ARROGANCE was hustled from
the gate, angled in while going to the front, saved ground on the first turn, set a joint pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path under pressure on the
far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. CLASSIC CATCH dropped back between foes early, rounded the first turn in the four
path, was urged along towards the rear on the backstretch, moved from four to six wide around the far turn and failed to threaten. SLIP MAHONEY bumped
hard with a foe while bumping with another rival into the first turn then checked sharply, settled off the pace, moved from the inside to the four path under
urging on the far turn and came up empty. SHADOW DRAGON traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, angled from the three
path to the five path while roused on the far turn and was no factor. KNOX was bumped in the hindquarters into the first turn, raced in the three path around
that bend, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. CRUPI bumped with a rival at the start then
was snatched up with the right-rein, moved in early, dropped from the three path to the rail on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and never reached contention. GENERAL BANKER bumped hard with a rival while also making contact with another opponent
into the first turn then checked sharply, settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide around the far turn and came up empty. MR. SWAGGER
bumped with a rival into the first turn then was taken up in tight quarters, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled four wide under
urging on the final turn and failed to respond. UNCLE JAKE was in tight just after the start, became rank behind foes while under tight restraint early then
moved out, went five wide around the first turn, pulled his way forward late on that bend, set a joint pace on the outside, came up empty while dropping from
the three path to the rail on the far turn and retreated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH
