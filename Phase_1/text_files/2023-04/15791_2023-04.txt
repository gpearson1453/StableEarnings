Footnotes
MADDIE'S GRACE pressed the pace of SPOOKY LADY from the two path early on before dueling with that foe through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home, dug in continuing the duel through to the finish and gamely prevailed at the end. SPOOKY LADY broke
in at the start, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure before dueling with the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, continued to engage in head to head combat through the stretch widening away as a
tandem to the finish fighting on game but was ultimately bested at the wire. PAUCILOQUENT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors well clear of the rest while never threatening the top pair.
PIMENOVA chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. APRIL
FIRST chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DANCE WITH ME BABE chased
along the inside until tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. SPOILS
OF WAR chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WAR MUSEUM chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. MARY KATHERINE chased six then five wide
coming under light coaxing midway on the turn, got carried out ten to eleven paths when outside the injured BANDULU QUEEN who was being eased up
and guided outwards through the latter portion of the turn to the quarter pole before being able to escape that rival, then was unable to make an impact.
VIRTUAL BEAUTY chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home and tired. REIGN OF THUNDER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and made no impact. BANDULU QUEEN chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped three
wide near the three-eighths and suffered an injury bobbling a bit and was placed under a protective hold and guided outside through the latter portion of the
turn carrying out MARY KATHERINE to the ten or eleven path when she was marooned to her outside through it all, got eased up through the stretch and
was eventually pulled up near the sixteenth pole and subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
BALANTYNE bumped solidly with a rival at the start, went three then four wide around the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked near
the seven-sixteenths, issued a challenge in the three path on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, responded well in the stretch and edged clear
under steady urging. RIDE UP broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, passed
the seven-sixteenths on even terms for the lead, gained the advantage under urging at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner into the stretch and
was outfinished while able to get the place. SHREVEPORT went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat at the seven-sixteenths,
lost the lead near the five-sixteenths then dropped back, moved out in upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. KAON bumped solidly with
an opponent at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four wide on the far
turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FIRST MONEY rounded the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the
pace, came under urging before the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide around the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out inside
the three-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response. PIONEERING SPIRIT bumped solidly with a rival at the start, raced in hand while off heels into
and early on the first turn, went four wide around that bend, settled near the back, went two then three wide on the far turn, drifted out in the stretch and was
no factor. HUNTINGTON traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled towards the rear, dropped back inside on the far turn and faltered then
was distanced in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLEETFOOTED broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, moved clear leaving the backstretch, extended
the advantage while inside to the two path around the turn, cruised into upper stretch under her own power then was asked at the three-sixteenths,
remained clear under the crop into the final sixteenth and held sway under strong urging. SIKUM steadied outside the nine-sixteenths then moved in, jostled
with a foe late on the backstretch then dropped back some, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the
final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy but was too late while narrowly able to get the place. IM JUST KIDDIN brushed the
hindquarters of a rival at the start then was taken up and dropped back, spotted the front several lengths, moved from three to five wide around the turn,
angled out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths and finished fast to just miss the place while clear for the show. BERN ROSEY BERN was hustled from
the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn, raced between foes into the stretch, chased while remaining on her
inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed kick. U SHOULD B DANCING settled towards the rear, moved from the two path to the four path around the
turn, spun six wide into the stretch and improved position. LISA'S VISION settled towards the front, dropped back under restraint in the vicinity of the
half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TIS A PITY was coaxed along off the
pace, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to impact. MASTEROF THE TUNES settled towards
the back, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, came out a bit more under a drive into upper stretch, angled out outside the sixteenth-pole
and failed to threaten. ROYAL DANCER tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three to four path on the turn, chased under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. SARATOGA GAZE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start then taken in hand between foes early, angled to the rail around the
five-eighths, jostled with a foe late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, raced behind foes under
some urging in upper stretch, had a small gap into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. THREE UNIONS had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was
well spotted towards the front, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. HARLAN'S BOND was grabbed with the
left-rein at the start then dropped back, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor.

ADDICTED TO YOU broke near the back of the field then was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground under restraint around the first turn, was rated
off the rail down the backstretch, came under urging in the two path on the final turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail. OCTOBER BLISS went three then two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside,
turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole then spun three wide into the stretch, led under a drive
into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the place. MAYTHISBETHEONE angled in after leaving the chute, went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved for the show.
NO REGARD was well placed on the inside, came under urging while continuing to save ground on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. MYLES went to
the front, showed the way near the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner coming to the quarter-pole, dropped back under
a drive into the final furlong and gave way. IN MY SHADOW went three wide on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, moved from the two path to
the four path while roused on the final turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. OVER THE CAP broke a step slow then
ducked in sharply and nearly unseated the rider, had the rider lose his left iron while dangling over the outside of his mount, regained the center of the
saddle while using the right-rein as leverage, put his foot back in the iron shortly thereafter, went two wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back, went
three then two wide on the far turn and failed to impact. METAMORPHOSES traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back,
saved ground on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. CAMPBELITO had a shoe repaired in the paddock, broke out at the
start, went three to four wide on the turns, paused near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. FORWARD CAST was taken under a tight hold between
foes early then rated just off the pace in the two path, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide early on the turn then was carried five wide off
heels at the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. AULA was keen under restraint early, went four wide around
the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under encouragement in the three path on the far turn and failed to respond. VOLCKER RULES settled on
the inside, dropped back late on the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn and faltered.

LIFETIME OF CHANCE chased the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, gained late on that bend, came out a path in upper stretch
then made a bid outside of the pacesetter, fought with that foe into the final furlong, gained the advantage near the sixteenth-pole and held under strong
urging. BANK FRENZY bumped with an opponent at the start while last to commence, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn then driven
four wide into the stretch, came out and bumped with a foe near the three-sixteenths, had the rider drop his right-rein outside the eighth-pole then gathered
the rein back up while lugging out into the final furlong, continued to lug out, had the rider drop his right-rein again before the sixteenth-pole, gained fast on
the outside late and just missed while clear for the place. EAST COAST GIRL was hustled to the front then sped clear, showed the way while well off the
inside, controlled the action in the three path around the turn, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, led under heavy threat from the winner into
the final furlong, was switched to a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole, lost the advantage at that juncture while swapping back to his inside lead
and was outfinished while clear for the show. DR. KRAFT bumped with a rival at the start, lacked speed under urging from the outside, angled in with five
furlongs to run, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three then four wide while gaining later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch then bumped
by BANK FRENZY near the three-sixteenths, came out while forced out off the heels of a shying TEN CENT TOWN shortly thereafter, chased into the final
furlong, was carried out again by BANK FRENZY outside the sixteenth-pole and flattened out. GENERAL BANKER settled off the pace, was roused in the
two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. TEN CENT TOWN was urged along on the outside, chased in
the five path around the turn, shied out off the heels of the leader near the three-sixteenths and tired. KERNESS was hustled from the gate, chased the
pace down the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn and capitulated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
STERLING SILVER chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for home, closed well to overhaul the
leader inside the final seventy yards and was up in the late stages to prevail. TO A T chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung six wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors in the late going. CHASING CARA hustled from the gate, dueled four then three
wide with ASSET PURCHASE to her inside, widened away through the turn as a pair and got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, took narrow
command a furlong out, shook off her main pace rival before being caught inside the final seventy yards to the finish. CUPIDS GIRL chased five then four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ASSET PURCHASE dueled from the two path
with CHASING CARA to her outside, widened away as a tandem through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in clinging to the front until headed a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. MASHNEE GIRL chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, tired. ARGENTINA GIRL coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. AWILLAWAY got bumped at the start by CHAMPAGNE POETRY, chased
five to six wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. CHAMPAGNE POETRY broke out at the start bumping the
aforementioned foe, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.
