Footnotes
DOCTOR ABBIE chased the early pace, then made a three wide bid on the turn and took over leaving the furlong marker and drew out to prove best under
mild left handed crop urging. SHUTUP AND HANG ON was bumped into the first turn, then settled into stride three wide, advanced on the far turn and came
five wide into the lane, lugged in leaving the three sixteenths and then finished willingly to be clearly second best. SPECTACULLARI was bumped and then
checked in between rivals into the first turn, reserved early, then came three wide into the lane and was along for the show award late. GINGERS WISH was
reserved early, moved up between rivals on the backstretch, then remained between rivals while advancing on the turn but flattened out the final furlong.
DANCE A LITTLE JIG was settled back early, came widest into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. DWELLER set the early pace while clear, then ran off
and opened up a big margin on the backstretch and then was headed leaving the turn and gave way the final furlong. TROPICALDEPRESSION drifted a bit
into the first turn, then settled on the inside and weakened in the drive. HELLO GRACIE was four wide into the first turn, settled on the outside, came four
wide into the drive and then was bumped by the three sixteenths and was empty. The jockey on SPECTACULLARI claimed foul against the number seven
SHUTUP AND HANG ON for interference into the first turn, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the race was left as is.

COLONEL BOWMAN stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, shook clear off the turn and then widened the margin in the final furlong
while being flagged left handed, ridden out. MARTINKELLY was well rated on the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and
finished willingly to get the bob for the place award. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY set the pace on the inside and was two wide into the lane while dueling for
command then faded, lost bob for the place award. PRACTICAL WAY chased the early pace and made a mild four wide bid on the turn, came five wide into
the lane but flattened out. GRAB THE GOLD stalked the early pace in between rivals and then dropped back on the turn on the inside.

HIS NAME IS SUE set the pace in the two path, then was challenged off the turn by two rivals, turned back both bids and drew clear in the final furlong to
prove best under a drive. CALCULATED THINKIN was well rated early four wide, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly off the turn, but hung
the final furlong, won battled for place. I SEE THE STARS was well placed early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn, made a three wide bid
between rivals off the turn but hung late, missed place. SCREEN STAR chased the pace on the inside, waited on the turn and swung out five wide leaving
the turn and had no kick. LEAVE 'EM LOADED lacked a rally. MAD GENIUS stalked the early pace three wide and stopped.

SYNONYM chased the early pace four wide, angled in leaving the three eighths marker and made a inside move on the turn to take over, then drew off
leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the best. QUINCY ADAMS was reserved early, came three wide into the lane, angled out nearing the
sixteenth marker and rallied well, second best. ROUND ROBIN was settled early, made a inside move on the turn but flattened out late, bested rest. BARN
SWALLOW pressed the pace four wide and then weakened in the lane. NEVER TOO MUCH was slammed hard by DANNY'S WINKSTER leaving the
chute, then set a pressured pace in the two to three path while riding cautiously to avoid the loose horse, then weakened on the turn and stopped in the
drive. DANNY'S WINKSTER veered in sharply bumping a rival and lost the rider leaving the chute, walked off once collared after the race. STEWARDS
INQUIRY concerning the run out of the chute, after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.
