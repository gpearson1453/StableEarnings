Footnotes
LA BRODY was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. RIPLEY
EFFECT was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide to launch a bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to stay with the winner late and
continued on well for the place. PROVOCATIVA saved ground stalking the pace, angled out five-wide for room nearing the quarter pole but lacked the
needed late response. DEESSE prompted the issue for six furlongs while racing two-wide and weakened. R D BLESSING dropped back early, came
four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BLUSHING KEYLEN set the pace for five furlongs from along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
STARSHIP PRECIOUS was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied three-wide on the turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe
advantage. TRULY A DREAM was unhurried early, moved forward on the turn while racing four-wide and into the stretch and finished full of run.
GLEAMING BRUTALITY was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead after three furlongs, opened clear and then gave
way after being headed nearing the eighth pole. BOURN WILD AGAIN dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SO
SOFTLY saved ground chasing Raw Honey, steadied briefly nearing the seven-sixteenths pole running up on that one's heels, angled out for room and then
weakened. RAW HONEY saved ground setting the pace for three furlongs and tired. JUST LIKE INDY dropped back early and failed to seriously threaten.

ALL ABOUT LUCKY stumbled at the start, then moved up to vie with More Drama for the lead from along the outside, gained a slight advantage nearing the
quarter pole and drew clear late. DISCREET DEVIL stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid entering the stretch, could not reach
the winner but finished well for the place in a steady effort. CAPE COD SUMMER was off a step slow, then was unhurried early, rallied four-wide the final
quarter and finished strongly. MORE DRAMA saved ground setting the pace under pressure and weakened during the drive. HELLO SUCKER settled in the
middle of the field while saving ground and lacked a rally when asked. MOCCASIN BEND dropped back early and failed to seriously threaten. BARONS
BLITZ was hard to load, then broke a step slow and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WELL CONNECTED stumbled at the start, then was prominently placed racing along the outside, was five-wide the final quarter, took command at the
eighth pole and gradually drew clear. FLIPPING FISH was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast. BAZOO vied for the lead into
the stretch while racing two-wide and held on fairly well for the show. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved
forward entering the stretch and then went evenly late. KITCHEN FIRE dueled for the lead into the stretch from along the inside and weakened.
TAPSOLUTION dropped back while saving ground and failed to menace. SCHOCHOH prompted the pace while racing three-wide and tired during the
drive. HIT BY A WAVE raced three-wide on the turn and was four-wide entering the stretch while failing to threaten and was vanned off following the race.

IRISH KITTEN was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide, moved up quickly to take the lead entering the stretch and drew off to win with something
left. LOOKIN AT KISSES was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the stretch, could not threaten the winner but continued
on well for the place. HURRY UP DEAR was unhurried early, rallied four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly. MORENA DANCER dropped
back early, came three-wide into the stretch and improved her position during the druive. LIVELY REMARK hopped in the air at the start, then settled in the
middle of the field and lacked a rally. BYZANTINE EMPIRE set the pace while racing removed from the inner rail to the stretch and tired. SOPHIA LAUREN
was forwardly placed for a half mile and gave way. QUEEN DE LA CREME prompted the issue for a half mile from along the inside and stopped.

CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage. ESTILO MAGICO was
never far back while racing three-wide and earned the place in a steady effort. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU was fractious in the gate, then saved ground talking
the pace, slipped through entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. ROSES BY LIAM dropped back and saved ground, angled out for the
drive and was gaining slightly late. DAWGMENTALITY was fractious in the gate, then hopped slightly at the start, came four-wide into the stretch and failed

DAMASO prompted the pace set by Explosive Exchange from along the outside, took the lead nearing the quarter, opened clear and then was all out to
prevail. FACCIA BELLA was forwardly placed from the start while racing three-wide, responded during the drive and was getting to the winner late.
EXPLOSIVE EXCHANGE saved ground setting the pace under pressure and held on well for the show when headed. TALL GIRL saved ground stalking the
pace, angled out for the drive but lacked the needed late response. HEAVENS EXPRESS was unhurried early while racing two-wide, moved up to offer a
mild bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out. DANCE STEP dropped back early and failed to menace. GO MIKA ducked in nearing the first turn
to hit the rail causing his rider to lose the irons, he was able to regain them midway down the backstretch but was unable to recover the lost ground. YES
DAY was close up for a half mile and gave way. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE FIRST TURN BUT
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
THE SWAYZE EXPRESS was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up along the inside to join the leaders nearing the quarter pole, gained the led nearing
the eighth pole and gradually edged clear. HAPPYIZE prompted the pace set by Peinadito early, moved up to gain a slight advantage nearing the quarter
pole, responded when challenged by the winner but was unable to stay with that one late. GOD GIVEN RIGHTS saved ground while being unhurried,
slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. NOT A DANCE dropped back and saved ground, steadied briefly while in tight nearing the
three-eighths pole, angled out to be five-wide coming to the quarter pole and improved his position late. DEACON ELI was forwardly placed to the stretch
while racing three-wide and weakened. MY BIG DRAMA raced four-wide and lacked a rally. PERFECT MOON settled in the middle of the pack and lacked a
response when asked. PEINADITO saved ground setting the early pace and gave way readily when headed. OZAH faded after showing brief early speed.

Footnotes
JUSTIFIABLE BELLE prompted the pace while racing two-wide, gained a slight lead at the quarter pole and proved narrowly best in a prolonged drive. SUN
BEE was allowed to settle in stride racing along the inside, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished fast to just miss. ROMAN FLAME
saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed and held on gamely from that point in a determined effort. ENGLISHED was bumped on the first
turn by Missmollyorbit, then was unhurried, slipped through along the inside during the drive and was gaining late. MYSTERIOUS STARE was forwardly
placed racing along the inside, angled out slightly for the drive but lacked a rally. ONE VIOLENT AFFAIR settled in the middle of the pack, moved up
three-wide nearing the quarter pole and then weakened. FLYLIKEABUTTERFLY (IRE) lacked early speed and was not a factor. OSCAR GAZE dropped
back early and failed to threaten. MISSMOLLYORBIT checked in tight along the inside on the first turn and came out to bump Englished and failed to
menace thereafter.
