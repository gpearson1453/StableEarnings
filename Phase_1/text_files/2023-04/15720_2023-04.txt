Footnotes
SPICY MARGARITA had speed between rivals then dropped in to secure the rail into the turn, dueled under rating, moved out to a clear lead when asked
soon into the lane, was given one ask with the right stick near mid stretch then eagerly widened while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. DULCE
KIARA drifted out at the break and bumped with a foe, corrected and chased outside a rival, shifted in through the drive and nabbed the place inside foes.
BRUSHING had speed inside then drafted back off the leaders, saved ground mid turn, awaited some room near mid stretch, altered out and finished well.
THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) disputed the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on with that one near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly between
foes. GOLD TIME VIXEN drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, chased three wide between foes around the turn and churned on. TIZ SUSAN ANN
, four deep around the turn, came up empty. AWESOME VIEW , bumped soon after the break, eased back from between foes then failed to muster up a
response. QUEEN OF CLASS , bumped at the break, settled well back, angled out in upper stretch then ran up on heels near the sixteenth marker. BATH
AND TENNIS (IRE) , bumped at the start, had speed between runners then rated off the duelers, tracked in the two path, shifted out past the furlong
grounds and faded. MAGICAL ANNA broke outward, lost ground and failed to menace. FACTORINTHEHEAT , bumped soon after the break, flashed some
foot then was rated back, raced in a bit tight between foes mid turn and gave way.

Footnotes
O SHAUGHESEY stalked the pace outside horses, moved up three deep leaving the turn, was fanned five wide by BALLYKEEN turning for home, remained
on heft lead and drew off under urging. LOVELY LIZA , well placed in the two path around the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch, angled back
to the inside approaching the eighth pole and rallied. BALLYKEEN , under urging after stumbling at the start, advanced two wide to gain the lead
approaching the stretch, angled to the four path in upper stretch and gradually weakened. CAMELIA ROD lacked speed, swung to the seven path in upper
stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. POET IN MY HEART raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. EARLEY ROSE , four
deep on the turn, was not a factor. CONDUCTANCE sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail nd faltered after a half mile.

Footnotes
DART bobbled slightly at the break, recovered and edged up three wide nearing the half mile marker and stalked, shifted out a bit wider on the turn, ranged
up four wide outside the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths, came under a ride soon into the lane, took over heading to mid stretch, briefly went clear,
drifted in a bit but held firm under left handed asks. SHACKINTHEBOX , off a bit slow, drafted back off the lead and settled, advanced along the rail leaving
the far turn then was put to hard urging in pursuit of the leading trio, kept on under a hustling ride while cutting the corner into the stretch, slipped through
along the rail past the eighth pole and continued gamely to cut into the margin. LORD UHTRED accelerated to the lead after a furlong, set a pressured pace
towards the inside, came off the rail around the turn, battled on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. GRAND ESCAPE drifted out a bit at the break
and bumped with a foe, had speed then prompted under rating just outside LORD UHTRED, was put to coaxing while pressing between runners mid turn,
failed to kick on with the leaders leaving mid stretch and faded. STRONG FINISH was bumped off stride soon after the break, regrouped and moved up
wide between foes, gave hard chase to the inside of rival around the turn and faded. RASCALLY REBEL , five wide into the turn, remained wide and failed
to respond.

Footnotes
THATAWAY , between horses leaving the backstretch, raced inside rivals on the turn, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, swept to command in
mid stretch then drew away. RUNNING RIVER disputed the pace outside SWIFTY DEVIL and faded in the drive. PARKERNESS , steadied in tight quarters
between horses entering the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and rallied between horses. R B'S THE BOSS , checked in tight quarters along
the rail entering the turn, saved ground on the turn and failed to menace. LOST WEEKEND raced between horses on the turn, was taken to the five path in
upper stretch and gave way. SWIFTY DEVIL showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to mid stretch and gave way. REJOICE , five deep down the
backstretch, drifted in a bit on horses entering the turn, circled the turn three wide and faltered. An objection by the rider of R B'S THE BOSS against the
winner for alleged interference leaving the backstretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
BASSANIO (GB) rated kindly while saving ground, edged up to take aim into the far turn, tracked the dueling leaders near the five sixteenths, eased out
about four wide into the lane, responded to a few right handed asks and forged clear approaching the eighth pole, moved out a bit more with a sixteenth to
go then held firm while confidently handled the final sixty yards. TOOFAREASTISWEST , in a bit close at the break, regrouped and settled well off the early
pace, raced in the clear mid way through the backstretch run, picked up some steam when ridden along leaving the far turn, advanced to the inside of a rival
approaching the quarter pole, eased out then back in, worked between foes near the sixteenth pole then finished full of run to the inside of the winner.
FERAL'S JOY settled in mid pack while saving ground, came under a ride and gained some past the five sixteenths, worked outward continuing progress in
mid stretch then flattened out late. POLSAR angled off the inside early and tracked the leader, moved to engage into the far turn, dueled and gained a slim
lead under a strong ride into the lane, failed to fend off the winner past the three sixteenths and faded late. AWESOME STRIKE , four wide early, chased
outside the winner into and around the final turn but lacked a serious stretch kick. CLASSIC LEGEND sped to clear lead into the first turn, dropped in to set
the pace, was engaged into the far turn, sparred to upper stretch then gave in through the final furlong. MONEY ROOM , three wide, gave way. SUPREME
BEING was outrun.

Footnotes
BETH'S DREAM stalked the pace outside horses under confident handling, advanced four wide leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch,
remained on her left and was under some urging in the drive. PASS THE CHAMPAGNE , in hand in the two path waiting for room around the turn, found an
opening near the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. AWARD WANTED advanced along the inner rail to gain a short lead near the half mile pole,
drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. MOMA TIGER stalked the early pace, was well positioned in the three path leaving the turn and weakened.
MAVILUS circled horses four wide on the turn and was not a factor. DECO STRONG stalked the pace in the two path for six furlongs and gave way.
HYBRID ECLIPSE , under urging along the inner rail on the turn, retreated through the stretch. HASHTAG LUCKY showed speed outside AWARD
WANTED, and faltered after six furlongs.

ALWAYSINAHURRY , three to four wide pursuing the pace, shifted five wide into the lane, closed outside rivals heading to the furlong grounds, drifted in a
bit then was corrected with left handed encouragement, sustained to forge past HELLO HOT ROD leaving the sixteenth marker and drew clear late. HELLO
HOT ROD rated kindly tracking three wide and from the outside, moved to engage the leader mid turn, struck the top soon after, shook clear under a drive in
upper stretch, braced for the winner's challenge leaving mid stretch, ceded a sixteenth away then gave way grudgingly. YODEL E. A. WHO , forced out a a
bit at the break, saved ground off the pace, was under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths, swung out five wide for the drive and leveled off nicely through
the final furlong. BANKIT , between rivals near the half mile marker, eased out a bit and edged up between foes leaving the three sixteenths, was soundly
bumped when in tight quarters in mid stretch, regrouped near the sixteenth marker and kept on with effort. FACTOR IT IN stumbled outward at the break,
corrected and edged up to stalk toward the inside, came out for room nearing the lane, advanced four wide soon after, drifted in bumping with BANKIT,
altered out and came up empty. AL LOVES JOSIE steadied at the break and was away towards the back, moved up between foes then dropped in, eased
out advancing into the lane, was checked sharply when roughed near mid stretch then failed to seriously recover. KENNY HAD A NOTION was sent clear
early, set the pace just off the inside, was joined leaving the three eighths, sparred with HELLO HOT ROD to the top of the stretch, stayed willingly to about
mid stretch then gave way. INFORMATIVE , well wide, failed to respond. EASTERN BAY drafted back from along the rail early on, failed to kick on under
pressure around the turn, was eased through the lane and reported by the stewards to have bled. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run. No
action was taken.

the eighth pole and was kept under urging. CRYPTO MAMA disputed the pace outside GRIL TROUBLE, opened a clear lead approaching the stretch, was
hooked in upper stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and battled gamely. SIX THE HARD WAY , a bit rank behind horses entering the backstretch, angled out
side on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA stalked the pace near the inner rail down the backstretch,
was taken to the three path mid way on the far turn to reach a striking position and gave way. GINGER GIRL advanced in the three path leaving the
backstretch, drifted to the four path mid way on the far turn and gave way. GIRL TROUBLE showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid way
on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PERFORM stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled well off the early pace while saving some ground, edged up then moved to the two path leaving
the far turn, sat patiently behind a foe near the five sixteenths, cut the corner into the lane, steadied when blocked leaving the three sixteenths, angled out to
work between horses in mid stretch, dove back inside to continue progress heading to the sixteenth pole, altered out in deep stretch, kept on relentlessly
under right handed asks and surged to victory in the the final stride. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE prompted the pace three wide outside COFFEEWITHCHRIS,
moved to near even terms leaving the far turn, sparred while under some rating, was fanned out a bit entering the lane, straightened and was roused clear
while on his left lead, switched over to his correct lead inside the sixteenth pole, was fully extended and just failed to withstand the winner's charge.
SUMMER CAUSE , a bit keen off heels around the first turn, stalked the early pace removed from the rail, was under a hustling ride to stay in touch past the
five sixteenths, edged up between runners in mid stretch and churned on to earn the show. ELDEST SON bobbled at the break, recovered and moved up
four wide into the first turn, settled in range through the backstretch, circled five wide into the lane, gained past the furlong grounds then flattened out very
late. COFFEEWITHCHRIS took a short lead early and set a pressured pace just off the inside, dueled under asking from the three eighths, drifted out a bit
entering the stretch, stayed on to the three sixteenths, shifted out a bit and gave way grudgingly. PRINCE OF JERICHO broke a bit slow, settled off the
pace and towards the inside, advanced two wide nearing the lane, gained inside rivals past the sixteenth marker then was out finished. CIRCLING THE
DRAIN broke slowly, rated in the clear and off the rail early on, raced two wide leaving the far turn, swung five wide for the drive but failed to mount a
serious run. TIME TO CRUISE bobbled and bumped at the break, was forwardly placed saving ground leaving the three quarter pole, dropped back under
asking around the far turn, swung out for the drive and came back on. FLETCHER , bumped at the break, edged up early stalked towards the inside, was
pushed along chasing the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
BLAME D RULE MAKER , rated well off the rail down the backstretch, moved up in the two path on the far turn, found room between horses entering the
stretch, closed steadily outside COAST ALONG and was up near the finish. COAST ALONG set an easy pace along the inner rail and was caught late.
HERE'S LIAM , three wide the first turn, chased the pace, was fanned four wide on the far turn and weakened in the drive. LONG RAP SHEET , a forward
factor along the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch and tired. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE , along the inner rail around the far turn and in the stretch,
was never a factor. UNION LEAGUE chased the pace outside foes down the backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn and gave way. SERGEANT
SHERMAN was not a factor. SILK PRINCE , wide both turns, gave way. DELACROIX , steadied when getting in at the break, was outrun. FAZZANI ,
outrun, pulled up on the far turn and walked off.
