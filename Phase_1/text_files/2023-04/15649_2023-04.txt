Footnotes
LITTLE MORE LOVE tracked the pace three wide to bid through the far turn and show in front turning for home, continued outside FLYWHEEL EFFECT
and held the edge to the wire. FLYWHEEL EFFECT was on the pace about three wide, dug in when challenged nearing the lane and went well but came up
short. AUNT CARI moved up three and four wide to gain the show while no threat to the top pair. FIRST RATE ROMANCE was three and four wide in the
first turn, moved inside on the far turn but failed to mount a bid. STREET RINGER was with the pace along the inside and weakened into the lane. RIO
LADY lacked speed and dropped well off the early pace while saving ground, moved three wide in the far turn and improved position while never a threat.
CHAMA weakened along the inside. CLASSIC FAREWELL was four and five wide in the first turn and weakened. TUZITA was always back.

Footnotes
ZIPPORAH stalked the pace four wide in good position, moved to challenge going to the far turn, dueled inside TAPIT'S LADY into the lane and slowly
edged clear late. TAPIT'S LADY attended the pace set by MONGOLIAN DIAMOND three wide to challenge going up the backstretch, was joined by the
winner into the far turn, dueled that one into the lane and could not handle the winner late. ROSE OF EKITA angled out in the second turn and moved up
with a mild bid going up the backstretch, rallied clear for third in the lane but could not reach the top pair. T R'S FIRST saved ground and moved up going up
the backstretch then could not produce the needed late run while gaining clear for the show. SUE HAPPY moved four wide with a mild bid going to the far
turn but weakened into the lane. KNOCKON followed the pace along the inside and weakened. REINA DEL SUR saved ground to move up through the
second turn but tired. MONGOLIAN DIAMOND moved a short lead out from the rail to set the pace and tired through the far turn.

Footnotes
QUEEN CORDELIA tracked the pace three to four wide to bid into the far turn, continued outside RAY AREWETHEREYET and kept that at bay through the
lane. RAY AREWETHEREYET was on the pace while out from the rail, resisted the winner and held well in the lane but came up short. WILDWOOD
MAGGIE hesitated at the break and dropped off the early pace, moved up three wide into the lane and gained the show late. SABER QUEEN was just off
the early leader three wide, regained position through the far turn but was outfinished for the show. BAYLEYWICK lunged at the break, saved ground and
weakened. CHIM CHIM GEMINI moved four and five wide to make a mild bid into the far turn and weakened. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN lunged at the break,
moved up five wide going to the far turn and weakened. ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD was not a factor.

Footnotes
GURL YOU FINE stalked the early leaders three to four wide to bid into the far turn, continued outside JULIARD HONOR into the lane and went well to gain
the edge in the drive. JULIARD HONOR was on the pace three wide to gain a short advantage inside the winner into the far turn and could not keep that
one safe. UNPLUCKED GEM dropped back off the early pace, rallied five wide in the far turn and continued to improve through the lane to gain the show.
UNUNDERSTANDABLE moved up four wide to bid into the far turn then could not produce the needed late effort. OLIVIAN dwelt to spot the field several
lengths at the break, moved up three wide in the turn but could not sustain the run. STUNTING stalked the pace from along the inside and lacked a final
closing bid. BOLD LEGEND was in reach three wide early and weakened. D'WILD MUFFIN saved ground and was not a threat. RED RED WINE gained the
early lead along the inside and tired.
