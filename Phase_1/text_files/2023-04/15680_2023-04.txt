Footnotes
MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT showed the way via a loose and uncontested advantage, showed the way in hand around the turn, and drew off through the lane.
ABITIBI stalked outside of the loose leader and from the three path around the turn, attempted a bid turning for home, but proved no match entering the
lane, then lasted for place late. EDGEE ANGEL saved ground far back, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied outside of rivals, but was too
late to reach place. APRIL'S NO FOOL pursued from midpack in the four path, gained show from inner rivals at the five sixteenths pole, but tired.
SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI trailed two wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane, and moved up. REVS RUN laid off of the pace in the three path, and
tired. DOROTA tracked two wide and between horses, and weakened. PRINCESS NINA chased along the inside, and stopped.

Footnotes
HIBERNACLE broke sharply, shifted in and made contact with an inner rival leaving the chute, stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path around
the turn, loomed a danger while ranging closer in upper stretch, then swept past approaching the furlong grounds, and drew off with good energy under
strong hand urging. HAPPY BAYTOWN took a bump from an outer rival leaving the gates, then a bump from a different outer rival leaving the chute, dueled
two wide around the bend, but offered little resistance to an outer bidder's challenge nearing midstretch, tired in the final furlong, yet lasted for place.
MIDNIGHT ANGEL pursued from midpack in the three path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, rallied along the rail through midstretch, tipped two wide at the
sixteenth pole, sustained her charge to bid for place inside of a rival late, but narrowly missed. BOOTSY'S MERLOT broke in and bumped a foe at the start,
lacked speed well back in the four path, then stayed on outside of foes in the late stages. UNHEARD dueled for the lead along the inside, but was no match
for an outer bidder approaching midstretch, and weakened. HOLLYWOODBOULEVARD broke a beat slow, tracked from the four path around the turn, but
hung on her left lead through upper stretch, changed over once asked to do so at the furlong grounds, but lacked a bid. GREENTEAZE chased from behind
the top pair in the two path around the turn, but yielded. JOIA RARA steadied out of crowded quarters when pinched between rivals leaving the chute,
trailed two wide, and made little impact. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT leaned outwardly and was off slow at the start, lacked speed while hung in the five path
around the turn, and failed to factor. MY SWEETHEART DANI broke slowly and was outrun along the inside. NEXT DOT chased from midpack along the
inside, and weakened.

Footnotes
AMARETTI rushed to set the pace along the inside of a vying rival, drew clear from that foe entering the lane, and cruised away well in hand. KID'S LAST
LAUGH laid off of the pace along the inside around the turn, fanned four wide in upper stretch, and rallied. KIKI KRAZY chased along the inside and kept
on. HEART HEADED WOMAN broke slowly, lagged behind into the turn, shifted outside of tiring rivals in the final furlong, and improved. THE PRINCESS
SAYS vied two wide, proved no match for her inner counterpart nearing the lane, and weakened. PREEMPT broke outwardly, was urged along off of the
pace in the four path, then shifted in and brushed a rival at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. BLAME THE TOLL tracked in the three path and
between horses, but was brushed by an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
HEARTBREAKER pressed three wide, bid two wide turning for home, and edged clear. DON'T WAIT UP rushed to set the pace along the inside, but was
headed entering the lane, and proved second best. KEEN HEIR pursued from midpack three to two wide, gained show from an outer rival at the furlong
grounds, and was best of the rerst. BABY QUINN prompted the pace two wide and between horses, failed to keep pace at the three furlong pole, chased
them from the three path turning for home, and tired. COLOR FIELD lacked speed in the four path, and moved up. BORN FLAWLESS trailed along the
inside, then fanned out to the five path while improving entering the lane. FRENCH COMPOSER tracked from midpack two wide and between horses,
cleared to the rail entering the turn, and faded. HEADLINE REPORT raced far back in the three path and between horses around the turn, and failed to
factor. MR. CUNNINGHAM lacked speed in the three path and between horses, but failed to sustain that position entering the turn, and got outrun.
OXWOOD chased from midpack along the inside, and faded entering the turn.

Footnotes
DRIPPING GOLD prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, dueled gamely through the lane, and prevailed. F FIVE set the pace along the
inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, dueled gamely through the lane, but was narrowly bested. JARREAU stalked along the inside, remained
pocketed in the two path around the far turn, tipped outside of the embattled leading pair with multiple lengths to find in upper stretch, but failed to progress
on them in the final furlong, and saved show from an inner rivals late. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in
the two path, rallied along the inside through the lane, and missed reaching show while gaining fourth at the wrie. WHAT SAY THEE tracked two wide and
between horses, then in the three path around the far turn, and chased evenly. POLICY OPTION broke half a beat slow while subtly tossing his head, rated
at the rear two wide, the improved between horses. SPIN WHEEL pulled while rank along the inside racing through the lane for the first time, steadied into
the first turn, saved ground in midpack after settling around the first turn, but tired. NICHOLAS JONES saved ground while unhurried, encountered traffic in
the three path in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. ICONIC ADVENTURE laid off of the pace three to four wide, then faded after being floated five wide in
upper stretch. MAINTAINER tracked three wide, but faded four wide in upper stretch. EXPLOSIVE got hung in the five path while far back, attempted to
circle inner rivals around the far turn, but tired without reaching contention. JR'S GIFT lacked speed in the four path, and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
STREET SWAGG set the pace along the inside, got headed by a trio of outer bidders at the three furlong grounds, sustained a battle while regaining an
advantage entering the lane, sparred gamely inside of CAPTAIN JACK, took a bump from that foe at the sixteenth pole, and held. CAPTAIN JACK was
bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, stalked three wide and between horses, tugged forward to bid for the lead in the four path at the three furlong
pole, dueled with a game inner STREET SWAGG through the lane, but subtly shifted in and bumped that foe at the sixteenth pole causing his rider to lose
balance, and was kept a bay late. FIGHT FIERCELY pressed four wide, vied in the five path around the turn, but gradually failed to keep pace with an inner
pair in midstretch, and chased them home. COUNTERSPY vied two wide and between horses around the turn, but yielded entering the lane.
ODDSONTONY lagged behind around the turn, cut the gap on the rest while swinging to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on. HILL OF TARA
bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, and lacked a bid. SOFT PANTS made little impact two wide. CHAMBERS BAY was outrun along
the inside. MONEY RUN bumped an inner rival at the start, was urged along in the three path in midpack, and weakened entering the lane. THE RIDER OF
CAPTAIN JACK CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECITON WAS DISALLOWED BY
THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
FLIRTING BRIDGE (IRE) tracked in the three path, claimed place while taking aim on the clear leader entering the lane, closed in through midstretch, and
kicked past that rival at the sixteenth pole. SISTER LOU ANN set the pace along the inside, drew away to a clear margin in the two path around the far turn,
held sway from an outer pursuer through midstretch, but was collared by that one entering the final sixteenth, and remained well clear of show. ONE TIME
MO saved ground far back, rallied while splitting foes two wide in midstretch, gained show a sixteenth from home, and held. UNDER ONE SKY settled off of
the pace along the inside, rallied four wide and between horses in the final furlong to bid for show late, but was denied. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE settled far
back two wide, came into the lane in the four path and stayed on in the five path between horses in the final furlong. SWEET SERENADE trailed along the
inside, spun into the lane in the six path, and stayed on willingly seven wide and outside of foes. BHOMA saved ground while tracking from midpack, gained
show from an outer rival in upper stretch, but faltered late. BLISSFUL pursued from midpack along the inside, then two wide and among foes around the far
turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, but gave way. LADY PUCHI pursued from midpack two to three wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, and tired.
CHOCTAW BINGO stalked along the inside, spun into the lane in the two path, and faltered between horses in midstretch. MADEMOISELLE NOVA
pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader around the far turn, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP stalked behind the top pair and from the two path, tipped outside of them at the top pair to loom a danger turning for home, assumed
command approaching midstretch, and drew off under a drive. TWO WORLDS pressed two wide, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane,
and kept on to gain place late. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET set the pace along the inside, proved no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch, and weakened on
his left lead. TIZ OUR TURN chased from the three to four paths around the turn, and gave way. HIGH HEATER failed to factor from the four to five paths
around the turn. IMPROBABLE STORY took back from a bit of crowded quarters between horses at the start, and was outrun along the inside.
