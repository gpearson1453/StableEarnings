Footnotes
POWER IN NUMBERS went to the front, set the pace under pressure from the runner-up to the outside, was asked along the rail on the turn, came under a
left-handed crop in upper stretch, responded gamely while fending off the runner-up into the final sixteenth and determinedly prevailed under a strong
hand-ride in the shadow of the wire. CLOUD FOREST moved out early then pressed the pace on the outside of the winner, was asked in the three path on
the turn while opening up in unison on the rest of the field, came under a right-handed crop while tussling outside the winner in upper stretch, switched to a
left-handed crop nearing the furlong marker, continued to fight into the final sixteenth then switched back to a right-handed crop and missed while well clear
for the place. PIONEERING SPIRIT was bumped hard at the start, dropped well behind early then angled in outside the five-eighths pole, saved ground
under urging around the turn, came out four wide into the stretch and safely secured the show while no threat to the top two. PREDICTED was bumped in
the hindquarters at the start, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the four path, dropped to the
three path into the stretch and capitulated. GOLDEN PURCHASE broke out and bumped hard with a foe, was urged along on the outside, went five wide
around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GOLDIENESS coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home inhaling the
top pair straightened away and drew clear under a drive to prevail. JOEYBIGNOSE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and offered up a mild kick. JOEY THE FISH devoid of any speed in the
early going, grew detached at the tail of the field five paths off the inside, tucked three then two wide through the turn, swung three to four wide for home
and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. WILL BE FAMOUS prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide
advancing on that foe into the turn to duel while widening away as a pair from the rest, took over command at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch forcing the backing away PRETTY MISS KEENS to steady now in behind her when overhauled by the top one and tired to the finish. AUDIT
COMMITTEE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, tired. PRETTY MISS
KEENS coaxed from the start, showed the way just off the inside under pressure from WILL BE FAMOUS to the outside, had that rival advance into the turn
and dueled with that foe widening from the rest, yielded the front at the five-sixteenths, faded and cut the corner into upper stretch steadying off the heels
now of WILL BE FAMOUS as that foe tucked in front straightened away and folded.

Footnotes
AFILADA moved up to race just off the pace, made a bid between foes at the nine-sixteenths, advanced to the front with a half-mile to run, vied near the rail
early on the turn, shook clear inside the three-eighths, extended the advantage while cruising away late on that bend, was given one pop of a right-handed
crop in upper stretch and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride to the wire. WELCOMETOMYWORLD settled just off the pace on the outside,
chased in the four path around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was clearly second best. GERMANY JAYVO stalked the pace on the outside,
was asked in the three path near the three-eighths, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and tired while well clear for third. SHAYMYNAME went to the
front then showed the way, relinquished the lead easily at the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and stopped. EXTESSA stood in the gate at the
break and dwelt, spotted the field about fifteen lengths, went two to three wide around the turn, came out some into the stretch and trailed.

BOURBON'S HOPE hustled from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before advancing to vie five then four wide into the turn,
tucked three wide midway, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, took over command with three-sixteenths to
go outside a pair, dug in gamely to fend off those rivals to the finish. STAR ATTITUDE coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed just off SOUTHERN
PASSAGE in the early stages before knocking heads with that rival briefly, then vied inside a quartet into the turn, had a pair get shaken off a bit when
GINNSU WARRIOR tucked inwards from the outside and got placed to coaxing at that station, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and was
headed for the front with three-sixteenths to go, fought on inside to preserve the place honors. GINNSU WARRIOR coaxed from the gate, raced five wide in
aim of the front before advancing to vie four then three wide into the turn, tucked to the two path near the three-eighths placing VIVE BIEN and SOUTHERN
PASSAGE in tight and forcing that pair of rivals to pause briefly, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
between foes and ran on to be along clear for the show honors. RAW COURAGE chased just off the inside at the tail of the field, the lone member not to
engage in a pace dispute with nine-sixteenths to go, tipped out to the four path steadily at the midway point on the turn placed to coaxing, angled five wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. VIVE BIEN coaxed from the start, raced four wide down the backstretch before briefly vying four then
three wide into the turn, had GINNSU WARRIOR tuck inwards an paused briefly at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened in
the stretch. SOUTHERN PASSAGE coaxed from the gate, led early on before briefly knocking heads with STAR ATTITUDE, then vied three then two wide
pausing at the three-eighths when put in tight inside of VIVE BIEN due to pressure from GUNNSU WARRIOR, faded and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY lunged at the start and was off slow, spotted the front two to three lengths, moved up to track the pace on the outside, ranged up in the three
path around the turn, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths, had her hindquarters make contact with FREDDYMO FACTOR while taking the lead in
the five path coming to the three-sixteenths then was turned in, drifted in while moving clear shortly thereafter, responded well under a left-handed crop in
the final furlong and just held. MIA BEA STAR moved out at the rear then settled on the outside, was urged three wide around the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, gained fast in the final furlong and finished well to just miss while up for the place. AMITY ISLAND was hustled from the gate then
taken under light restraint, came back under urging before the five-eighths pole, moved from the two path to the three path early on the turn, shifted four
wide later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside
lead late and finished willingly but missed the place while well clear for the show. FREDDYMO FACTOR attended the pace on the outside while in hand,
took a short lead late on the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, floated four wide into upper stretch, bumped with the hindquarters of the
winner while losing the advantage near the three-sixteenths and was taken up then weakened. CURLY GIRL had the rider fall back in the saddle some
while taken under a tight hold near the seven-eighths pole, showed the way with company while in hand, lost the advantage late on the backstretch, vied
inside under urging on the turn and tired. CARAMOCHA was taken in hand early, dropped back near the five-eighths, saved ground around the turn and
was no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF FREDDYMO FACTOR CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BUSTIN BAY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
UPPER STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the compact field, tipped out three wide nudging his way to a
clear path at the expense of INCANTATION just outside the three-eighths marker, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went three wide into upper
stretch getting brushed by GOING IN STYLE straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong seizing narrow command just inside
the sixteenth pole, then dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. WINNING CONNECTION chased along the inside from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter portion of the turn to take command inside a trio cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under
lone threat through the final furlong and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker, fought on gamely to the finish. KINGFISH STEVENS chased four then
five wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. GOING IN STYLE coaxed
from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat from a trio, yielded the front and spun just
off the inside into upper stretch floating out briefly to brush with INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER, then weakened through to the finish. INCANTATION three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got nudged four wide near the three-eighths pole by INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER looking for a clear path
from in behind the leader, faded through the latter portion of the turn under a drive, went four wide for home, folded and was eased home to the wire.

Footnotes
FALCONET was hustled from the gate, shifted from the rail to the three path early on the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside, moved closer in the
three path around the far turn, made a bid while asked at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, fought outside of
TIMELESS JOURNEY under the crop to near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. KATHLEEN O. was off a step slow then urged
some early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, passed the nine-sixteenths under a strong hand-ride, went four then five wide around
the far turn, chased outside in the stretch, gained gradually late and got up for the place while no threat to the winner. TIMELESS JOURNEY dropped back
nearing the first turn, moved from the two path to the rail early on that bend, was well placed just off the pace, drafted near the rail on the far turn, was given
her cue with a clear opening at the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid then took a short lead outside the quarter-pole, fought with the winner under a drive
until near the sixteenth-pole then weakened and lost the place but was clear for the show. LET HER INSPIRE U went three then four wide around the first
turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.
MOMMASGOTTARUN went to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the
quarter-pole and gave way.
