Footnotes
KEBA LUCKY DAY dueled for the lead with DOZO from the inside, vied with that rival through a long vigorous drive and gamely prevaled. DOZO broke
sharply to dispute the pace with the winner through a prolonged drive and just missed. SHESAHEATWAVE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and finished with a steady bid. ATLANTIC PRINCESS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive.
SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI was off slow, lagged, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. SHOE GAME was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TIMBERLAKE GAGE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further
nearing the quarter and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DEVOTED TO YOU sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased his margin into the lane and was ridden out to the wire. EAST
RAND was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. COASTAL WATERS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. BOB'S ALL IN settled off the
leader early and finished evenly in the drive. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. CATS TOUCH chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MAHI MAHI broke sharply to stalk the pace of FRANKS FIX IT while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down that rival in
the closing yards to be clear late. FRANKS FIX IT was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter but could not
resist the winner late. ELUSIVE LOVE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with good
late energy. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. REDACTION was off slow, lagged
far back, raced off the rail through the turn and finished with a belated bid. MO GEE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave
way. THAT'S BIND BABE showed brief speed from off the rail and weakened. FLY BUDDY FLY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did
not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. KETANJI sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way
through the final sixteenth. IDA NEEDA DRINK lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. DANIELLE'S SECRET showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. GYPSY ROSIE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
