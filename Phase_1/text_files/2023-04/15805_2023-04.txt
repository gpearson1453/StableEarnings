Footnotes
WILD ROSEY broke forwardly, raced closest to the leader while in the two path, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, crept a bit closer turning
for home, collared that rival inside the furlong marker, drew clear under steady handling. REAUX BINA in the second flight while racing outside, three wide
through the first turn, continued in the three path through the second bend when moving slightly closer, could not match the winner's late kick while edging
clear for the place. MO WANNA GO broke sharp, soon cleared, set a moderate set of early fractions, slowed down before six furlong while continuing to
lead, faltered the final furlong when confronted by the top pair. BOOTLEGGING GIRL away well, settled in the second flight along the inside, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing response. ALTAR GIRL off a step slow, remained void of speed for six furlongs, came in the two path for the drive,
shifted out a bit and improved position while not a serious threat. PAT'S GAL settled off the pace just off the inside early, four wide turning for home, came
up empty for the stretch run. ARDEN AR in mid pack and off the inside, lacked a closing punch as well. PETULA went one paced while racing toward the
inside. SOPHIE'S STAR lacked speed while four wide through the turn, failed to menace. DR. WOODS MIRACLE off a step slow, raced back, encountered
traffic midway on the second turn, lacked rally when clear. TIZ A STRATEGY had nothing for the drive. DIXIE GIRL TO off a step slow, mid pack, stopped
second turn three wide.

Footnotes
OUT RUN'M forwardly placed early in the two path, raced in the second flight up the backstretch, bit closer second turn, in traffic late in that bend, set down
between horses, proved best late in a determined effort. CONSPIRACY FACT bothered in the first turn when LAMUTANAATTY got out when rank, stalked
in the second flight three wide, ranged up to challenge on the outside into the lane, briefly clear past the furlong marker, outkicked by the winner late,
remained clear for the place. GREATHEART bothered when four wide midway on the first turn, remained outside and raced four wide through most of the
second bend, displayed a mild amount of late interest to annex the show, not a threat to the top two. CHARTER OAK last away, saved ground in the second
group, continued inside second turn, lacked a closing punch to miss the show. RUM 'N TONIC broke on top, set the pace toward the inside early, continued
to lead while remaining just off the inside second bend, began to weaken when headed by the runner up entering the stretch. JAY VEE BEE steered out to
be four wide in the first turn, second flight, dueled, gave way in the drive. LAMUTANAATTY rank, got out in some traffic first turn, fell back to trail, showed
little.

Footnotes
CYBERTOWN broke back, lacked speed out in the strip, ranged up with a strong move four wide second turn, challenged on the outside, long drive to the
wire, between horses, proved narrowly best while under stout pressure through the wire. PEARCY ROAD settled in mid pack off the inside, followed the
winner in the four path in the second turn, challenged outside that one turning into the stretch, vied to the wire while remaining widest of the first flight,
outkicked late to miss. STORM STRATEGY broke back, moved up; to race in mid pack, crept closer in some traffic second turn, waited briefly late in that
bend, moved inside for the drive, rail bid, not enough for the top two late. RUDIANO forwardly placed along the rail first turn, remained in mid pack the
middle half, angled out four wide when advancing into the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. MADMARTIGAN last away, rank in some traffic early,
continued back in the run up the backstretch, three wide second turn, improved position. FOUR DICE within striking distance, moved inside for the second
turn, had little for the drive. MORE MONEY MO in the main group just off the inside, angled in 2nd turn, brief traffic with three sixteenths remaining, empty
when clear. LOUD BOY a bit washy, set the pace in the two path, gave way when headed by the top two turning for home. OTHER TIMES fell back after
start, four wide first turn, continued outside to race four wide through the second turn as well, remained back in the run to the wire. CADILLAC COWBOY in
the second flight outside, gave way after a half. SEEKING CHROME within striking distance, stopped second turn, jogged in. WILLIE WIN chased early,
stopped, far back, also jogged in.

stretch, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. FREEDOM FOR ALL lacked speed while racing outside, four wide second
turn, rallied on the outside to gain the place, not a threat to the winner. PERFECTLY GOLDEN in mid pack while outside, four wide turning for home, mild
rally, outkicked for the place. BARSTOOL BABE within striking distance off the rail, challenged outside the leader late in the second turn, briefly raced on
equal terms with the winner into the lane then could not keep up, weakened late to lose the place. INSENSITIVE in the second flight early, tracked the pace
while saving ground, tired in some traffic turning for home. ORNATELY briefly vied into the first turn, fell back and chased the leader for the next half mile,
had little left for the stretch drive. ROYAL LAUGHTER lacked speed in the three path, failed to muster a rally. SCARLETTA in mid pack early, also failed to
respond when called for in the drive. CANDY COOP broke in and steadied to be off a bit slow, remained back. GOLD TICKET keen early when setting the

Footnotes
SEIZE THE NIGHT unhurried while racing off the inside, asked along, advanced late in the final bend, tipped out four wide into the lane, finished with good
energy to be up in time. SPEED BIAS took command after the start, rated while setting the pace inside, headed into the stretch, fought back late to regain
the advantage, could not contain the winner in the final strides. LIFE IS HARD closest to the leader, challenged that one in the second turn, took over,
faltered in the late going. DISC JOCKEY bothered in the early going, lacked speed, moved out to be four wide midway on the first turn, four wide again
second bend, set down drive, mild late interest. PRESIDENTIAL in traffic first turn firmly in hand, moved out and was three wide into the far bend, advanced
with LIFE IS HARD to the front, vied on the outside nearing the furlong marker, faltered from between rivals to lose several posiitions. GUNTOWN came in
early to bother DISC JOCKEY, fell back before a half, went evenly to the wire. TRAFALGAR off a step slow, void of speed, picked off a couple of rivals while
never a threat. ICARUS in mid pack toward the inside, two path into the lane, had little for the drive. EASTSIDE COOL within striking distance along the
inside, faded after six furlongs. ZOOMER fell back to trail, always outrun.

Footnotes
BOLZY forwardly placed while off the inside, allowed the speed to go onto the backstretch, advanced and challenged three wide in the second turn, took
over, edged clear under firm handling. QUALITY CHIC slight bobble, broke out to be off slow, unhurried, advanced four to five wide far turn, closest to the
winner when straightened for home, could not match that one to the wire, clearly second best. STAND PROUD off slow, lacked speed, advanced three to
four wide inside the runner up second turn, could not keep up with that rival the final furlong while clear of the others. ANDY CANT back off the pace after
moving outside first turn, closer four wide in the second bend, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. WINNEMAC AVENUE chased the leader
while off the inside, engaged that one into the far turn, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. GATLINBURG broke on top, quickly
well clear, quick early, faltered when headed. SOUTHERN SUNSET in mid pack early, had little left for the drive while along the inside. THE HEIGHTS in
the main body while racing off the inside, three wide through the second bend, came up empty for the drive. GO CATS shuffled back in the first turn from
along the inside, showed little. CAIRO BREEZE in mid pack inside, shuffled back in the two path into the far turn, continued to fade through the stretch.

Footnotes
YESTERNIGHT moved up early along the inside to contend before a quarter, dueled into and through turn, kicked steadily clear through the stretch. FLYIN
BESSIE broke alertly, fell back to mid pack, angled in a bit midturn, came back out to be three into the stretch, rallied for the place, not a threat to the
winner. D'ORO STREET away in good order, with the early pace, dueled outside the winner through the turn, first to blink into the stretch. RUBIA within
striking distance while three wide, lacked a winning response in the drive. BEAUTIFUL BOLT one paced in the main body up the backstretch outside, four
wide into the turn, dropped inside, traffic 1/4, continued evenly through the stretch. PERFECT WISH chased the dueling leaders toward the inside, gave way
after a half. GUSTAVI broke back, lacked speed, shuffled back along the rail early turn, did not recover. TARA'S TIME last to leave, was green early while
moving out, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SHARP ATTITUDE began a steady retreat before a half. KAMIKAZE BLUE
was also finished early, to be always outrun.

Footnotes
KANTEX in the second flight inside, raced in traffic into the turn, continued behind horses through the bend, shifted out for room when straightened for
home, roused, responded, solid finish to be edging clear at the end. WILDWOOD BYE in the second flight while between horses and outside the winner,
came on the on the outside of that one for the drive, late push to be up for the place. OFF RAMP lacked speed off the inside, three wide turn, moved out a
bit for room in the drive outside the runner up, found best stride late to miss the place to that one. PERFECT HAPPINESS vied up front while racing three
wide after an alert break, continued to contest the issue up front three wide through the turn, showed the way past the furlong marker then faltered to the
wire. PISTOL with the pace while between horses despite bobbling slightly after the start, also weakened the final furlong to lose several positions.
UNBRIDLED TWISTER away well, also was with the pace up the backstretch while closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage through the turn then also
relented the final eighth. LI'L GRAZEN lacked speed, three down to two path turn, made little impact through the lane. FAST AND FEMININE last away,
trailed for a half, passed tiring rivals without posing a serious threat. MUSIC APP failed to menace. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT finished after a half.
VIOLENT POINT in the second flight on the outside, four wide turn, gave way.

Footnotes
MERLAZZA allowed to settle off the inside, continued under patient handling the middle half, asked along in the three path into the lane, firm handling to the
wire to be in time with a well measured ride. PINK ACE broke in but alertly, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, set an ultra slow pace while
continuing inside, quickened a bit into the lane to expand that advantage, nailed in the late going while saving the place. EXPONENTIAL STAR also content
to set back off the soft fractions while outside, three wide through the second turn, three into the lane in front of the winner, could not match that one late
while getting to the runner up. KLASSY BRIDGETTE bobbled at the start when in a bit tight, back off the pace and the inside, angled out to be four wide into
the stretch, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position, not a serious threat to the top three at the wire. UNSTABLE PRINCESS squeezed
back break, trailed, called on for run late in the second turn, improved inside of rivals into the lane, also was not a serious threat. SANTA FE GOLD broke
out, lacked speed, came five wide for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not making an impact. SUNSET PAYNTER chased those soft
fractions in the two path and had little left. STELLAR LILY also in the second flight, saved ground throughout, gave way drive.

Footnotes
PROXY broke out to help tighten up SENOR BUSCADOR, was straightened, moved out to be four wide midway on the first turn when off the pace,
continued outside, floated out six wide into the stretch, set down and closed with good resolve to be in time outside the two late leaders. LAST SAMURAI
settled off the dueling leaders while all alone on the rail, continued to track that pair while saving ground, moved closer after being asked along in the
second turn, challenged along the rail when straightened for home, brushed with STILLETO BOY soon after, dueled with that one to the wire, gained the
nod over that same foe for the place while unable to contain the winner. STILLETO BOY broke on top, narrowly showed the way in the two path, continued
to hold a small advantage up the backstretch off the inside, dueled second turn, put that rival away into the stretch while he allowed the runner up the rail
entering the stretch, came in slightly, brushed with that foe nearing the furlong grounds, came out soon after to help tighten up a tiring CLASSIC
CAUSEWAY, continued to duel to the wire, also was unable to hold off the winner, missed the place while between the top two at the wire. SENOR
BUSCADOR pinched back at the start, trailed just off the inside, angled out five wide when beginning to advance into the lane floating out the winner, could
not match that one in the run to the wire, mild finish. CHARGE IT broke in to help tighten up SENOR BUSCADOR, stalked the dueling leaders three wide,
advanced on that pair turning for home, lugged in badly nearing the furlong marker to tighten up CLASSIC CAUSEWAY and lost all momentum. CLASSIC
CAUSEWAY away in good order, pressed the leader from the three path, continued to apply pressure to that one through the final turn, was beginning to tire
when bothered and put in tight a furlong out, continued to weaken. RATED R SUPERSTAR lacked speed, lugged out badly when not contending through
the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RED ROUTE ONE broke with the field, fell back and raced unhurried for five furlongs, began to be asked for some run far turn just off the inside, angled out
to hit a large seam when gathering momentum into the lane, continued with good resolve past the furlong marker and launched a late surge to be in time at
the wire. TAPIT SHOES in the second flight outside, edged closer three wide late in the final turn, drifted in slightly past the furlong marker, bid, late duel,
nailed at the wire while between foes. VICTORY FORMATION broke alertly, narrowly set a pressured pace through some legit fractions, shook off nearest
pursuer nearing midstretch as the runner up was moving to challenge, found more to duel with that one to the wire, proved stubborn to the end while
remaining closest to the inside of the first flight. TWO EAGLES RIVER away well just behind the early pacesetter, pressed that one from the outside,
continued on through the second turn and into the lane, faltered the final furlong. INTERLOCK EMPIRE last to leave, trailed well back, angled out four wide
turning for home, improved position while not a serious threat. ARISTOCRACY in mid pack and in the two path, continued evenly through the lane in lacking
a closing kick. LINE TO GAIN in traffic into the first turn, remained in the first flight for six furlongs, tired in the drive. MAZING MARK fractious in the gate,
remained back in lacking a response. POWERFUL forwardly placed for a half, retreated, finished well back. PER RULING #2023-OP-53 FROM THE
ARKANSAS RACING COMMISSION, ARISTOCRACY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 6th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
NINJA WARRIOR lost footing at the break, was used to move up and contest the issue early, continued to vie along the rail turn, shook clear of the other
speed nearing midstretch, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. NAVY SEAL behind the pace while saving ground, tipped out a bit to the
two path into the lane, advanced two path into the lane, held sway for the place late, no match for the winner. SPEND BENJAMINS broke back, lacked
speed, swung out five wide into the lane, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. OMAHA RED away in good order, vied up front between
horses, weakened the final furlong, caught late for the show. BEST OF GREELEY behind the pace in the second flight in the two path, continued evenly
down the lane in lacking a closing kick. RACE DRIVER off the pace while racing outside, four wide into the turn, lacked a closing response. MYSTERY MAN
broke alertly, vied up front while three wide for a half, gave way in the drive. BRESLAU lacked speed, in some traffic four wide late backstretch, five wide
into the lane, remained back. OCELOT was finished early while off the rail.
