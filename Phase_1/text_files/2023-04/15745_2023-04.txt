clear to prove best, drviing. GOLDEN BAND set a pressured pace two wide early, then dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn, fought gamely to the
wire while being clearly second best. STYLE BENDER pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened. LEAD MONTEREY was outrun.

LET THERE BE PEACE vied for the early lead three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn and drew off in the drive to prove much the best, ridden
out. E. Z. PAPA moved up four wide to press the winner but proved to be no match for that rival, second best. SHE HAD A SECRET was settled early on
the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to best the rest. EMPERIAL EAGLES showed speed on the inside
and weakened. ROCHESTER'S FINEST showed good early speed in between rivals and checked out of there and shuffled to the back, then improved late.
HEART TO BEAT vied for the early lead in between rivals and weakended. TEE ROY was reluctant to load, off a beat slow and raced wide on the turn and
had no rally. AL GRANO D ORO vied for the early lead in between rivals and stopped.

best, driving. HELLO HELLO MISTER pressed the early pace on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and closed well to just miss. DANZ AT
COLFAX set a pressured pace two wide, then dueled for the lead to the inside of the winner on the turn, then fought gamely to the wire to just miss, tough
beat. MORO APPEAL tracked the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and faded. MONTEREY SECRET chased the pace towards the inside
and had no kick. HE'S NO YOKE was settled on the inside and had no rally. SECRET'S DOUBLE failed to menace. GOGO OXBOW was not a factor.
