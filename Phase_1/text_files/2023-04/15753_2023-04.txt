LATE CALL angled out after quarter mile, bid on the final turn, led into the stretch, dueled then edged away driving. CATTY'S UNCLE set a measured pace
inside, was collared at the quarter pole, resisted the winner then tired. SEIVER awaited room inside after half a mile then offered a mild rally when clear.
SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE forced the pace outside for half a mile and weakened. LONG LEGGED BOY prompted the leader along the inside and
gradually faltered. RUNNIN JOKE fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide and was no factor. KING SWANSBORO settled wide just off the pace and
gave way readily.

RELISHMENT raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid on the far turn, took over, drew clear, pulled away and was kept to the task. DRENA'S
BULLET stalked between rivals, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied and was clear for the place spot. SON OF A SAINT tracked on the inside, chased
on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. MY TRAIN set the pace on the inside, dueled entering the far turn, dropped back and tired.
LONG GRAY LINE raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. ACKER raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. WEEKEND
IN COURT dropped far back and was outrun. DRONE SWARM raced four wide early, stalked three wide, chased and gave way.

COMMINGLING vied inside, shook loose on the turn and drew away to a commanding advantage under moderate urging. STORMY FIRE trailed far behind
then advanced near the inside with late energy. RUN FOR KARL forced the pace three wide then faltered in the final furlong. IT'S A PITY raced wide
throughout then flattened out in the stretch. JSK PHARAOH'SREIGN steadied along in tight into the far turn then lacked a bid. LET IT FLOW JOE raced
extremely wide on the turn and failed to menace. UNION REWARD forced the pace between rivals to midway on the turn and faded. WIRED TO GO was
urged close up inside early then began weakening on the turn. SECRET THUNDER dropped back early in the two path and was never a factor. CAYMAN'S
SECRET lacked speed and weakened steadily.

BEYOND A MILLION urged close up outside, bid to the front at the quarter pole then edged away under steady urging. JUST STAY HOME dropped back in
the two path, moved wide in the stretch and offered a strong finish. ELUSIVE RYDER made a menacing three wide move on the final turn then flattened out.
SUMMARY JUDGMENT hustled to the front inside, was collared at the quarter pole and weakened. LIL MISS HOTSHOT raced close up inside then gave
way on the final turn. OUI MADAME trailed saving ground then passed fading rivals. SUGAR STREAK rated three wide early and lacked a response.
MARIANNA QUEEN chased wide throughout and was never a factor.

NORTHERN EXPRESS stalked the pace, made a strong three wide bid at the quarter pole, took over, responded, drew clear and was kept to the task.
WINDSOR GOLD bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied and
finished well for second. MAXIMUS AURELIUS raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, came through on the rail and rallied mildly for
third. BOX OFFICE WARRIOR stumbled at the start, raced off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, went five wide past the quarter pole and rallied
mildly outside. MY IMAGINATION was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and closed belatedly. PINE VALLEY raced three wide early, cleared the
field, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and gave way. AMUSING MISCHIEF tracked the leader racing close up outside, bid two wide
entering the far turn, dueled and gave way in the lane.

far behind, advanced inside and gained the place late. STARSHIP LAOBAN settled off the pace, tried to go with the winner on the turn but flattened out.
EMPRESS DEONA broke alertly and sprinted away, widened on the turn then shortened stride in the stretch. MIDTOWN ROSE dropped off the leaders
outside and was never in contention. LADY ZETA flashed speed along the inside and gave way on the turn.
