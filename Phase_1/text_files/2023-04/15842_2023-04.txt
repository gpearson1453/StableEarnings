Footnotes
SILVER MOON ROAD stepped out at the start, straightened and moved to the front at once, cleared through the first turn, remained on a clear lead into the
lane, had his largest advantage outside the eighth pole then geared down late when result was determined. IMPROBABLE STORY chased the pace from
the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and kept on to be clear for the place spot. ENGLISH CHALLENGE saved ground throughout and
moved up to be clear for the place spot while not a threat to the top two. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was four wide through the first when never far back,
continued in the four path through the far turn, bid into the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole. INHERENT POWERS raced in the two path through
the turns, swung into the five or six path into the lane and lacked a closing response. BLESSED WITH LUCK was never a factor while in the three path
through the turns.

Footnotes
CINDERELLA STORY chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid three wide through mid-turn, cleared into the lane while still in the
three path then inched away to the wire. BETYAR AZETS chased the pace from the inside through the turn and into the lane and kept on well to save the
place spot. FREE TIME was two wide through the turn when between rivals, continued in the four path through the lane and finished best of the rest.
LADYONTHEHILL hesitated and hopped at the start spotting the field about four lengths, raced well back down the backstretch and into the far turn, was
under a drive into the lane when angling into mid-track then offered a belated gain. REINA BELLA set the pace on a clear lead into late turn then gave way
turning into the lane. CAPTIVE STAR chased the pace from the two path through the far turn and was empty after turning into the lane.

Footnotes
SMOOTH LIKE ICE stayed in contention while sitting patiently in the three path through the turn, bid from the four or five path near the eighth pole and
steadily drove past. Z ZS RED chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead inside the eighth pole, still maintained
the advantage with a sixteenth to run but could not hold the winner safe while clearly second best. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE set the pace on a clear lead
into the lane, was joined by another near the eighth pole, yielded to that one approaching the sixteenth pole. MISS SOVELIA raced in the two path through
the turn and and into the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole while drifting out a couple of paths. DALTON'S LOVE trailed through the turn while off
the inside, angled into the six path for the drive and never was a threat. RISING HEAT chased the pace four wide through the turn and into the lane then
tired. TALKTOMEJUSTICE was close up early while along the inside then shuffled back and never responded.

outside the eighth pole, remained on top inside the sixteenth but was caught very late. HOLIDAY DECISION pressed the pace two wide through the turn
and into the lane then weakened. DUNVEGAN DOLL was never a factor while moving off the rail in late turn. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP tired while saving

Footnotes
CHIMES chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, methodically reeled in the leader inside the eighth
pole and quickly clear late. CASTLE MAGIC chased the leader from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, was steadied just
inside the sixteenth pole when losing her path then stayed on for the place spot. ALWAYS BLOSSOM set the pace from the two path, was clear through the
turn and into the lane, was still clear nearing the sixteenth pole then yielded to the top two late. ARRINGTON in the two path through the turn, came into the
lane from the five path and gained energy late while not a serious threat. AMERICANA ANNA was forced in at the start, raced off the rail through the turn
then offered a belated gain through the final eighth. WILLADEAN raced in the two path into the lane, had aim on the top ones but weakened. EXPLOSIVE
SKIES was near the rail while well back through the turn then passed tired ones. SHARP HEELED GIRL was close early while in the four path into the turn
then backed up. PADDI'S WISH never was a factor inside. ZIINZI close up through the turn while four wide then was empty turning into the lane. INDIAN
ZARA was in the six then the five path through the turn when never far back then was done after entering the lane. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #7
MOLLY'S WARRIOR AGAINST THE RIDER OF #10 TIZZY JOJO FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.
