Footnotes
OGLETHORPE tracked in the three to four paths, bid three wide entering the far turn, vied around the far turn, battled with a game inner TRUMPTASTIC
through the lane, and edged a narrow advantage late. TRUMPTASTIC set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival down the backstretch, then
inside of a pair of different foes around the far turn, sparred gamely with OGLETHORPE through the lane, but was bested grudgingly. MAGICAL POWER
laid off of the pace in the four to five paths, took closer order approaching the far turn, pressed within striking range outside of the trio of leaders around the
far turn, but failed to keep pace with the eventual top two entering the lane, yielded on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the sixteenth pole, and
held off an inner rival for show. BRAGGADOCIOUS laid off of the pace in the two path, stayed on in hopes of bidding for show inside of a rival in the late
stages, but was kept at bay. ARTWELL tucked from the five path to the two path around the first turn while achieving tracking position, split the leaders
nearing the far turn to offer a bid, vied between horses around that bend, but weakened turning for home. BOONE'S PATH pressed in the four path around
the first turn, vied while tucking to the three path down the backstretch, but remained a path away from his inner counterpart, which allowed for ARTWELL to
split them entering the far turn, and weakened shortly after.

Footnotes
PLEASE BE KIND pressed three wide, vied around the turn, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and kicked away. GOOD TOHAVE AROUND broke a
step slow, tracked three wide and between horses, floated five wide in upper stretch, ran on to bid for place at the furlong grounds, and secured that position
in the final sixteenth. ITSABLINGTHING was fractious in the starting gate, then broke slow, recovered to stalk just behind the leaders in the two path, tipped
four wide at the three sixteenths pole, bid for place along with an outer rival in midstretch, but got outkicked. MIDNIGHT GRIND dueled for the lead two wide
and between horses, but proved no match for her outer counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened between horses in the final furlong. DOT
MARIE was void of early speed, laid off of the pace along the inside, and moved up. ZIPPIN PIPPIN dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes around the
turn, and gave way in upper stretch. KATE'S CONCERTO stalked four wide, floated five wide entering the lane, and faded. BINGO STAR broke a step slow,
chased two wide and between horses, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
VIVAR trailed along the inside, moved out of last two wide around the far turn, came into the lane in the four path, tipped five wide in midstretch, rallied in
the final furlong, and drove past the leading trio in the final sixteenth. JAMES ALOYSIUS tracked in the two to three paths around the first turn, failed to
respond to urging to gain three wide around the far turn, was brushed four wide by an inner EASY TIME while getting outkicked by that one entering the
lane, yet offered a rally soon after, ranged up to bid outside of the newly-leading aforementioned rival leaving the furlong grounds, vied through deep stretch,
but was outfinished by an outer bidder in the closing stages. EASY TIME tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, brushed his
way three wide entering the lane, offered a bid coming to midstretch, led at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the final
sixteenth. PORTFOLIO COMPANY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, awaited racing room among foes around the far turn, inched closer
while well blocked behind rivals through upper stretch, tipped in to find room passing the furlong pole, but lacked the needed kick in the closing stages.
ALTAZOR (ARG) settled off of the pace two wide, saved ground around the far turn, but encountered traffic off of the rail in upper stretch, and lacked a bid.
EYES ON TARGET rated off of the pace three wide, moved between horses approaching the far turn, took that bend in the four path among foes, got
outmoved turning for home, shifted out to the six path in midstretch, and stayed on. BULLSEYE BUN pursued from midpack two to four wide around the first
turn, chased in the five path around the far turn, and tired on his left lead. MY ROMEO LIMA vied inside of a foe around the first turn, allowed that one to
clear entering the backstretch to stalk from the outside, pressed two wide into and around the far turn, but weakened between horses in midstretch. PUNCH
HARD saved ground off of the pace, but found traffic off of the rail through the late stages. MUTAKATIF (IRE) pursued from midpack three to five wide, and
faded. BLESS THE KITTEN rushed forward to vie two wide around the first turn, cleared and crossed over entering the backstretch, felt pressure from an
outer rival around the far turn, then got headed by bidders approaching midstretch, and weakened. COMMON BOND lacked speed three to four wide early
on, but was hung six wide around the far turn, and tired.

Footnotes
IMPLEMENTATION took a brush from an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, chased the embattled leading pair through
upper stretch, slowly closed in on them in the final furlong, offered a late bid nearing the wire, and forged an advantage at it. COURTHOUSE COVE shifted
in slightly and brushed a rival soon after the start, stalked three wide, moved closer to press the leader two wide turning for home, bid and sparked a duel
entering the lane, battled through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, wrestled a narrow advantage in the final sixteenth, but was nailed by an outer
bidder at the wire. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer rival's bid entering the lane, sparred gamely through
midstretch, but gave in grudgingly approaching the wire. C'MON MAN brushed the gate while breaking slow, trailed in the five path, surpassed inner rivals
while improving turning for home, and leveled off without reaching contention. GEAUX YOSHKA tracked along the inside, but scraped the inner railing while
getting shuffled back behind foes turning for home, slipped through along the fence in upper stretch with too much to do, and failed to menace. INSIDE
STUNT stalked along the inside, but gave way turning for home, and weakened between horses through the lane. WELLMAN chased two wide and
between horses, and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
DESERT DUKE set the pace along the inside while well in hand, responded readily once set down leaving the quarter pole, and kicked away with good
energy. CLASSIC CREATION tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, shifted out at the three sixteenths pole, but drifted to
the five path in the process, and ran on to claim place entering the final sixteenth. STONEMONT REUNION laid off of the pace along hte inside, steadied
while rank around the first turn, was roused for run around the far turn, chased in the two path through midstretch while vying for place, and narrowly lasted
for that position. BABY BILLY pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position at the half mile pole, shifted to the five
path in upper stretch, then improved between horses in the final sixteenth. ESCAPOLOGIST tracked from midpack three wide, spun into the lane in the five
path, drifted out to the seven path nearing midstretch, and stayed on between horses. MYREDWHITEANDBLUE saved ground towards the rear, and
offered a rail grind. CLEVER THOUGHT raced far back two to three wide, came into the lane in the six path, bumped an outer rival while tipping to the eight
path in midstretch, and lacked a bid. REALLY GOOD settled off of the pace two to three wide, came into the lane in the six path, but was bumped to the
nine path by an inner foe in midstretch, and failed to factor. THREE ON THE TREE stalked two wide, bid turning for home, but proved no match for the
clearing clear in upper stretch, maintained place to the sixteenth pole, but faltered late. EMPEROR'S APPEAL was a bit reluctant to load, tracked two wide
and between horses, but gave way around the far turn. FIRST STRIKE raced at the rear three to four wide, got herded from the seven path to the ten path in
midstretch, and was outrun. DARK SIDE (IRE) tracked three to two wide, but shifted from an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, hung on his left lead,
and stopped late.

Footnotes
SCYLLA broke a beat slow, gained from off of the pace in the five path around the turn, loomed a danger outside of the new leader in midstretch, and kicked
past that one at the sixteenth pole. ZEITLOS pressed two wide, bid turning for home, drove clear in midstretch, but offered little resistance to an outer
challenge at the sixteenth pole. MISS ARLINGTON set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist a bid nearing the lane, but yielded in midstretch. NIKKI M
P stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail, and gave way. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES lacked speed two wide, and moved up. HURRY UP
HANNAH pursued from midpack along the inside, but faded nearing the lane. WATCH THIS BIRDIE tracked four wide, but was outmoved by the eventual
winner turning for home, and weakened on his left lead. OLDEST SISTER tracked three wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position
approaching the far turn, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, and failed to factor, then was quickly pulled up in the gallop out, and vanned off.
BRENDA made little impact three wide. AMERICAN MAESTRA got fractious when an outer rival popped open the gate, broke a step slow, and failed to
factor along the inside. BOLD ICE broke slowly, lagged behind around the turn, and was outrun. PICK ME GURL popped open the gate pre-race, raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, then weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
BARBER ROAD tracked along the inside while a path off of the rail around the first turn, produced an early move to split the leaders in the three path with
five furlongs to go, vied two wide and between horses around the far turn, dueled with his inner counterpart through the lane, took a bump from that one
entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. PRINCIPE D'ORO set the pace in the three path, shifted down to the two path at the eleven
sixteenths pole, sparred with a pair of outer vying rivals around the far turn, dueled gamely inside of BARBER ROAD through the lane, but drifted out and
bumped that foe at the sixteenth pole, and was bested late. GRAPHIC DETAIL tracked in the three to two paths, gained show from an outer rival
approaching midstretch, and chased along the rail. CRUMP was brushed by rivals on both sides at the start, lagged behind early on, improved inside of
rivals turning for home, and stayed on two wide to gain fourth at the wire. YORK TAVERN stalked along the inside, and gave way. MASTER GAME broke
out at the start, stalked in the five path, moved forward to vie three wide around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. TEPEU bobbled slightly while
brushing an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, got a bit keen from kickback approaching the far turn, and failed to factor. HUSBAND
MATERIAL pressed the leader from the four path, but weakened between horses entering the far turn.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed outside of the leader, took the turn in the three to four paths, pursued under
confident handling in upper stretch, responded readily to a right handed shoulder tap approaching midstretch, quickly took charge passing the furlong
grounds, and was ridden out to the wire. QUEROBIN DOURADA laid off of the pace in the three path, was a bit green to shift to the seven path and outside
of rivals in upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong, and gained place at the wire. STAR DEVINE (IRE) stalked in the four path, chased in the five path
in upper stretch, bid for place in the final sixteenth, briefly gained that position late, but was caught by an outer rival at the wire. HAPPY SOUL raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, was urged along in the three path around the far turn, came into the final furlong in the four path, and stayed on
between horses. LITTLE JEWEL bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack three wide, spun into the lane in the six path, and lacked a
bid while chasing evenly. MAMBA WAMBA (IRE) broke slowly, trailed two wide, fanned out entering the lane, and stayed on in the eight path and outside of
rivals late. MINAUN (IRE) was bumped by rivals on both sides before being pinched out of tight quarters at the start, raced far back in the two path, and
moved up between horses in the seven path. MINER'S QUEEN set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge in
midstretch, and faltered. OEUVRE was fractious in the starting gate, then bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace along the
inside, but had no rally in the four path. OPENING BUZZ bumped an inner rival multiple times at the start, raced keenly between horses at the nine
sixteenths pole before gaining midpack position, but gave way. TRAIN TO ARTEMUS saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. CREATIVE CREDIT stalked
in the two path, but faltered between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
FIRST MISSION stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, claimed place at the seven sixteenths pole, chased the leader under urging from the
three path around that bend, moved in as the leader floated out nearing the lane, produced a rail bid while being put to tight quarters coming to the furlong
grounds, got brushed at that marker, yet sustained stride to edge ahead in the final sixteenth. ARABIAN LION set the pace in the two path, showed the way
uncontested with his ears pricked down the backstretch, remained in hand while shifting out to the four path turning for home as FIRST MISSION gave
chase, tucked down to the two path to engage that bidding foe approaching the final furlong, brushed that rival at that station, and was bested in the closing
stages. DISARM laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the three path around the first turn, gained show from between horses approaching the
final five sixteenths, but failed to keep pace with the top pair entering the lane, yet held show thereafter. DENINGTON broke a step slow, raced far back in
the two path, picked up stride while fanning to the five path entering the lane, stayed on in hopes of bidding for show, but was kept at bay. DEMOLITION
DUKE tracked along the inside, but lacked a response to urging around the far turn, and failed to bid. PRAIRIE HAWK pressed the leader from the three
path early on, backed off to stalk from the four path down the backstretch, then gave way between horses around the far turn. EMPIRESTRIKESFAST
tracked in the three to four paths, then in the five path around the far turn, and faded turning for home. BASELINE BEATER was last away, lagged behind,
and improved along the inside around the far turn. REINVEST laid off of the pace in the three path, and faded around the far turn. CURLY LARRY AND MO
pursued from midpack in the two path, but failed to sustain position with five furlongs to go, and weakened.
