FILLY FATALE broke sharply and cleared the field midway through the first turn to take a clear lead from along the inside into the backstretch, maintained
her advantage while saving ground through the final turn, repelled a challenge from TEXAS LEGACY leaving the turn, and proved best. TEXAS LEGACY
away alertly and stalked the early pacesetter while racing two wide entering the backstretch, launched his bid two out from the rail entering the final turn, but
failed to sustain his bid in the drive while finishing four out from the rail late to get the place. MILO'S COMMAND tracked the leader into the backstretch
while easing one off the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and fought on gamely through the lane from along the rail to just miss the
place. THERE GOES MY HERO stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, trailed the field into the final turn, but failed to mount
a serious late bid when called upon.

MR. QUALITY broke sharply and eased off the dueling leaders to gain a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly while being carried five wide in deep stretch to prove best. KNOPFLER away alertly and dueled for the
lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue in the run down the backside from the outside of RACING RIVER, took a narrow advantage
into the lane, but was unable to fend off MR. QUALITY late in a game effort. JUVEE TOO settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail,
rallied smartly from just off the rail through the final turn, tipped six wide entering the lane, and finished with late interest while racing in tight quarters in deep
stretch. APPELLANT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final
turn, and found his best stride late while finishing three wide in the drive. RACING RIVER away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of KNOPFLER in the run down the backside, continued to battle from the inside of that rival through the final turn,
but faded in the stretch drive. YOU DON'T OWN ME through his head in the opening strides to get away poorly, and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
EDDIE WHO was bumped and steadied from along the inside in the run to the first turn, worked his way into a tracking trip one out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, collared the pacesetter entering the final turn, and wore down that rival in deep stretch to prove best. STORMY BLUE broke sharply
and rushed to the lead from along the rail to open a clear advantage entering the backstretch, battled from the inside of EDDIE WHO through the final turn,
and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch while proving clearly second best. PRINCE CAIRO away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to trail the field
into the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. EARS TO US was put in tight quarters
and forced to steady approaching the first turn, raced into a stalking trip two out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but lacked a finishing response when called upon. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul, the rider of EARS TO US
lodged a claim of foul against the rider of STORMY BLUE for alleged interference in the run to the first turn. After review the claim of foul was upheld, and
STORMY BLUE was disqualified from second and placed fourth.

BIG UNION away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of BLACK METAL entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of
that foe in the run down the backside and through the final turn, got the better of that rival entering the lane, and drew clear as much the best. HE'S
RELENTLESS settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and
closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. SMART LAD away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. STAR ENTRY unhurried early
while trailing the field into the backstretch, saved ground throughout, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. FORT LANGLEY settled
off the early pace while racing five wide into the backstretch, continued four wide while trying to commence his bid, but needed more late while racing six
wide in the drive. BLACK METAL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BIG
UNION in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival entering the lane, and weakened in the drive. PARKER
POINT settled off the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, continued to save ground into the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon.
