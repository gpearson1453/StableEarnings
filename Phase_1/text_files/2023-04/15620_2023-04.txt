ARROW BOLT chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and dueled gamely to the wire
to hold the win. BROKEN HEARTS BAY tracked the pacesetter on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, switched out to the four path for the run
around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the finish but could not get by the winner. STELLAR NOVA bumped lightly with the
horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and improved position mildly in the
lane while never threatening. SEAWITCH bumped mildly with the horse to her outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses in the
early going, navigated the bend from the two path and made no bid. SHEZANARCTICQUEEN led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. THE MONSTER IRUS trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn
in the two path and was not a factor.

MACHISMO chased the leaders up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position late.
HAPPY CAJUN raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and never threatened. BUMPERDOO trailed the
field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and made no bid. JOYFUL HEART dueled between horses through the early going, dropped
back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire from there.
