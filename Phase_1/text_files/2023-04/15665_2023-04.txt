Footnotes
LUCKY LOCKETT broke alertly and established the early advantage, was well rated through the backstretch run while prompted, set moderate fractions to
the quarter marker, shook free in the drive, kept to task in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prove best. SPORTS FOR WOMEN took back off
of the moderate early pace, was roused two wide nearing the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker,
could not reel in the winner in the final stages and was up in time to secure the place. I'M GONNA SHINE was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended
to the pace into the backstretch run, pressed LUCKY LOCKETT to the far turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter pole, lost ground in
upper stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the place, while clear of the rest for the show. THE RIVER MANGITA was unhurried,
improved position while four wide on the far turn, was unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch and offered a mild late rally. NOMI LACKEE was
prominent into the first turn, raced close to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, lost position while saving ground on the far turn and gave
way in the stretch drive. LOOKOUT PASS chased the moderate pace, raced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, came three wide into the second
turn, dropped back at the quarter marker and tired in the stretch.

QUE SERA SIR RALPH broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions through the backstretch run while well handled, showed the way
to the quarter marker, quickened in upper stretch and drew clear at the furlong marker, was kept to steady urging in the late stages and drew off in deep
stretch to be much the best. PORT O' CALL was allowed to settle while not far back, raced three wide into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not
muster the needed late response, was outkicked by the winner in the drive and ran on to secure second. DANNY MICHAEL was hard to load, brushed with
CARSON'S LEGACY at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the stretch, finished evenly in
the final furlong and was clear for third at the finish. MONEY MUNCHER chased the moderate fractions from the inside, ran evenly to the furlong pole and
gave way late. CARSON'S LEGACY brushed with DANNY MICHAEL at the start, stalked the early pace then advanced to prompt the pacesetter along the
backstretch run, kept attendance to QUE SERA SIR RALPH to the quarter pole, lost ground in the drive and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
BLOSSOMING took back off of the decent early pace, raced in the clear while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, slipped to the two path entering
the far turn, came in a bit tight in upper stretch, found room approaching the furlong marker, loomed at mid-stretch, kicked clear heading to the
sixteenth-marker and drew off under hand urging in the final stages. PRANCIN N THE PARK settled in the early going while not far back, maintained
position through the backstretch run, gained ground while two wide on the second turn, vied for the lead with BLOSSOMING to the furlong marker, was no
match for the winner in the final stages and was best of the rest. RELUCTANT was caught wide into the first turn, took back off of the decent pace and
tracked through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid to come within aim at the quarter pole, chased to mid-stretch, weakened in the late stages
and held for third. CREATING MEMORIES took back in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn,
steadied while in tight quarters midway through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. LADY BLACKBIRD broke alertly and was
sent to establish the early lead, drifted three wide into the first turn and carried out a rival, showed speed through the backstretch run, was pressed to the
quarter marker, overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong pole and faded in the final stages. PETE'S INFERNO was forwardly placed into the first
turn, was carried four wide by the drifting pacesetter early, kept close attendance through the backstretch run, was tiring on the run into the far turn, steadied
while shuffled back nearing the quarter marker, lost contact in upper stretch and was not persevered with in the drive.

DAMN THE TORPEDOES broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace to the turn, shook free along the bend, drew to a clear lead
heading to the furlong marker, was kept to steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the finish to
prevail. LADY IN A HURRY was forwardly placed in the early running, rated off of the pace approaching the turn and saved ground to the quarter marker,
advanced at mid-stretch, rallied in the late stages, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and was second best. SMOKIN HOT
BOBBIE was a bit keen in the early running while close to the pace, pressed DAMN THE TORPEDOES to the turn, took back to stalk that rival on the turn,
drifted out a bit nearing the top of the stretch and floated out CROWN KITTEN, ran evenly while chasing the winner to mid-stretch, weakened late and held
safely in the end for third. DANIELA BELLA chased the early pace, raced two wide between runners along the turn, swung three wide for the stretch run and
lacked a late rally. CROWN KITTEN chased the early pace while outside of rivals, came three wide to the quarter marker, was floated out a bit by her
stablemate at the top of the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and did not offer a late response. BLUSHING BAY lacked early speed, saved ground
on the turn and did not factor.

SNIP was hustled to be forwardly placed in the early going, assumed command heading to the turn, slipped to the rail midway through the bend and set the
pace to the quarter marker, extended the lead heading to mid-stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up, dug in in the final sixteenth and held off CAT
BANDIT to prevail. CAT BANDIT broke alertly, pressed the pace into the turn, kept close attendance to SNIP heading to the quarter marker, lost ground in
upper stretch, shifted out to the two path nearing the furlong pole, rallied in deep stretch and pressured SNIP, could not reel in the winner in the final strides
and bested the rest. A PERFECT PATH rated off of the early pace and saved ground into the turn, was unhurried to the quarter marker, made a steady
advance to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the final stages and ran on to secure third. STANFORD MISS chased the early pace while
outside of rivals, raced three wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. CHEATER'S WALTZ chased from the second flight in the early going,
advanced while two wide on the turn, lost ground while still within aim at mid-stretch and tired in the late stages.

NOLDE was unhurried in the early running, advanced nearing the half-mile marker and was well placed into the far turn, continued to gain while saving
ground heading to the quarter pole, took command in upper stretch, extended the lead nearing the furlong marker and kept to task in the late stages to
prove best. ANITANEWMERCEDES was prominent in the early stages, was engaged along the first turn by AMERICA GREAT and was pressed by that
rival through decent fractions to the far turn, shook free nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by NOLDE at the top of the stretch, ran in pursuit to the
furlong grounds, could not make headway in deep stretch and held safely at the finish for second. KODIACTION was allowed to settle while never far back,
raced three wide into the stretch run, made a mild late rally and was up in the final strides to secure third. HOUSE OF LORDS was allowed to settle in the
early stages, saved ground to the far turn, advanced in upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response and was just edged for third in the final
strides. AMERICA GREAT was forwardly placed in the early going, engaged with ANITANEWMERCEDES along the first turn and pressed that rival through
decent fractions to the half-mile marker, lost position nearing the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. LOVE CANDY tracked the decent early pace while
outside of rivals, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground while three wide on the second turn, raced four wide into the drive and gave
way.

GENTLEMAN'S SECRET raced close to the early pace while outside of rivals, loomed four then three wide on the turn, took command nearing the quarter
marker, drew to a clear lead in upper stretch while angling to the rail and drew off under mild urging in the final stages. AWE contested the early pace,
pressed the decent fractions to the turn, chased GENTLEMAN'S SECRET into the stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the drive, battled with EL
CHARRO CHAMP for second in the final furlong and won the nod for place on the wire. EL CHARRO CHAMP showed good early speed and disputed the
pace while between rivals, raced three wide into the turn, was overtaken by GENTLEMAN'S SECRET midway through the turn, chased that foe to
mid-stretch, battled with AWE for the place spot in the final furlong and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. EMERALD MAGIC was
unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the stretch run and did not threaten. ZOE'S PAPA CEE showed brief
speed from the inside and disputed the pace heading to the turn, dropped back midway through the bend, Flores lost his crop approaching the top of the
stretch, lost contact in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SHERILINDA broke well then tracked just behind and to the outside of MIRACLE IN MOTION while well in hand through moderate fractions, got on even
terms at the top of he stretch while still under wraps, responded when roused in the stretch and held on while drifting out in the final sixteenth. ZABAVA last
away, reserved near the rear of the field to the far turn while racing three wide, began a sustained bid passing the nine-sixteenths pole, made a sweeping
move around the far turn while three to four wide, continued the rally through the stretch and was gaining on the winner but ran out of ground. MIRACLE IN
MOTION hustled to the front, attempted to slow down the pace but was pressed from behind by SHERLINDA to the top of the lane, responded when
challenged in the stretch but was unable to match strides in the late stages. SHANGHAI MIST outrun then shuffled back to the rear of the field going into the
clubhouse turn, worked to the outside for clear run into the far turn, launched a four wide bid that carried six wide into the stretch and finished up well while
never a serious threat. GOING TO SHABOOMS came away well but was caught wide into the first turn, advanced through the turn to gain a good tracking
position three wide down the backstretch, loomed a threat turning for home but stalled and finished evenly. DR WYSONG was not asked for speed early
and saved ground while racing mid-pack early, began to improve position down the backstretch, lost some ground when the pace quickened on the far turn
but re-rallied a bit but was unable to improve from that point while getting leaned on by TEAM CONCEPT down the lane. TEAM CONCEPT got off a step
slow, was boxed in through the first turn and shuffled back to near the rear of the field, moved up into contention in tandem with and to the outside of DR
WYSONG, dropped back some on the far turn then was unable to improve position, keeping that foe in tight quarters while lugging in through the stretch.

Footnotes
GABBY HAYES was sent from the rail after a good beginning, dueled with STANFORD BAY to the quarter marker while carving solid fractions, shook free
in upper stretch, was set down for the drive and held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, felt pressure in deep stretch and gamely dug in in the final strides
to prevail. AUTISM BLUE took back off of the solid early pace, improved position while outside of rivals on the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch,
ran evenly to the furlong grounds, rallied in deep stretch, pressured GABBY HAYES inside of the sixteenth-marker but could not reel in the winner and held
safely for second. WINTER FALCON was allowed to settle in the early going, improved position while three wide nearing the quarter marker, slipped to the
two path in upper stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, waited behind runners inside of the furlong pole, shifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker,
closed well in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA chased from the second flight in the early going, ran
two wide into the turn then slipped to the rail approaching the top of the lane, advanced from the inside at mid-stretch, was gaining in the late stages and
was just edged for third at the wire. THUNDER OF ZION was unhurried in the early stages, improved position while two wide midway through the turn,
swung five wide for the stretch run and found his best stride late. STANFORD BAY showed good early speed, disputed the pace to the turn, dueled with
GABBY HAYES to the quarter marker while setting solid fractions, continued to battle to upper stretch, lost a bit of ground to GABBY HAYES approaching
the furlong pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch and weakened. MOB BOSS chased the solid early pace, raced three wide into the turn, lost position in
the drive and tired in the final stages. EL BERRINCHES was fractious at the starting gate and unseated the rider prior to the start, broke in good order,
showed brief early speed in the turn to the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and tired in the drive.
