Footnotes
BONNIE BLUETOOTH came away awkwardly and exchanged contact with Creedibility then stalked off the rail, closed to the front past the three eighths
pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. HAD THE NOTION rounded the first turn in the three path, started a bid toward
the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second best. CHIT CHAT GIRL rounded the first turn in the five path then moved
to the inside leaving the turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole.
MOJO MATTERS raced in the four path on the opening turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride.
UPSY DAISY DO stalked in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path but showed little in
the lane. CREEDIBILITY became anxious in the gate then ducked out hitting the stall door while making contact with Bonnie Bluetooth, and never factored.
MOONLIGHT MISS took the lead at the rail nearing the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, but dropped
back at the five sixteenths and faded readily.

Footnotes
SECRET CASTLE stalked off the rail on the opening turn, closed to the front approaching the three eighths pole and drew briefly clear toward the quarter,
contested the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to edge out the challenge of JAMESTOWN ROAD through the lane. The latter stalked inside on
the first turn, took aim approaching the quarter pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn and stayed on through the lane. MISS WAVE moved to the inside
and raced with the early pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and raced evenly to late stretch
before flattening stride. MISS LAUREN steadied lightly at the start and raced well off the early pace, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths
pole, improved off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. GRACE ELIZABETH bobbled at the break and settled off the rail on the first turn, picked
up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths then flattened in the lane. CASTLE OF CAYLEE broke a step slow, raced
well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. LADY MADISON ducked out leaving the gate then saved ground, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE raced with the pace two deep, was met toward the three eighths
pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn.

QUIET IMAGINATION settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths then
dueled through the stretch to get up later yards. MY FLICKER rated close inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod while
drifting leaving the far turn, but was met and relented in later yards. SOMEDAY IS TODAY stalked two deep, challenged approaching the half mile pole and
took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths, drew clear toward the three eighths, kept the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met leaving the turn and
flattened the final sixteenth. MANAROLA rounded the opening turn in the two and three paths, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven
sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the five path and weakened in the lane. TIMEISGOLDEN saved ground and showed little response through the
backstretch. REIGN ON AND ON took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the
half mile pole but was met approaching the seven sixteenths, dropped back at the three eighths and faded at the rail.

FULL AHEAD took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved inward to show the way, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. ANGELUS DIAMOND rounded the first turn about the three path, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths but steadied off the inside of the riderless Sloe Gin Biz in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, recovered stride toward the five sixteenths, raced
at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly to close the gap. TRIPLE AMERICANO settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and
bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths then flattened the final sixteenth. BET ON BITZ showed little response
through the backstretch. MEGALODON'SREVENGE rated close to the early pace inside then faded past the three eighths pole. LOOKA LOOKA raced off
the rail on the opening turn and showed little response. SLOE GIN BIZ stumbled badly and lost his rider at the break. The three quarter time and final time
were adjusted to compensate for the loose horse breaking those two beams.

Footnotes
THEWITCHISGONE stalked off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide midway on the far turn, drew
clear into the stretch and was steadily handled to the wire. THUNDERINREADYRICK broke a step slow then stalked three wide on the first turn, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and took a brief lead two deep toward the quarter, was met midway on the turn, angled outside the winner past the
eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. GET OFF MY CLOUD settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. REY O REYES took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the rail nearing the quarter and weakened leaving the far turn. LEG UP saved ground, picked up
the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. ROCK FILE saved ground. HARPERSGONEFISHING
became fractious in the gate, raced three wide on the opening turn and never factored.

Footnotes
DE'S CASTLE raced with the pace and took the nod midway on the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. MONKEY WRENCH gave chase,
rounded the turn in the three path, dug in for second mid-stretch and finished well. UNCLE PRESS bobbled slightly at the break then gave chase toward mid
track, rounded the turn about the five path, left the turn outside and finished well to take third late yards. BOO TOO contested the pace, was met midway on
the turn and flattened toward mid-stretch. SMALL PAW steadied at the start then gave chase, but flattened in the five path of the turn. J. WICK gave chase,
raced in the four path of the turn and showed little in the lane. BAND TOUR gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path.
LASTWALKTOFREEDOM was shuffled back on the chute and saved ground. RIVER ROYALE R V F gave chase inside but dropped back at the rail
midway on the turn and weakened.
