Footnotes
REAPER set the pace inside, was roused in the two path early around the turn, kicked away after a right handed cue and opened up into the lane, and was
much the best. SAINT NO MORE was prompted along around the four path into the turn, under a ride between foes rounding the turn, and chased home the
clear winner from the five path down the stretch to place. NORTHSHORE DRIVE raced off the pace in the four path, tipped out to the six path in upper
stretch and finished evenly for show. AVELLINO pressed the eventual winning pacesetter in the two path, was under a heavy drive between foes midway
around the turn, and yielded turning into the lane. ZAINO trailed from out in the six path into the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and was
no factor. KINGY was hustled off the pace around the three path into the turn but never threatened while angling out to the seven path in upper stretch.
QUIVER OF FEAR broke out at the start, chased in the five path, ranged up under coaxing early around the turn, but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) stalked the pace two wide, reached even terms approaching the quarter pole, vied to midstretch and drove clear. SISTER NELL
broke awkwardly, saved ground well back early, advavnaced between foes down the backstretch, angled back to the rail midway around the far turn, bulled
through a tiny opening late on the far turn, hit the rail and bumped COUNTRY JEWEL in the process, angled out near the eighth pole and finished willingly.
RIGBY set the pace along the rail, resisted inside of the winner to the sixteenth pole and lost second late. ZISISIT (IRE) went evenly while racing two and
three wide. ONE TRACK MINE was off slow then in tight at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. ANDIE ONE
chased the pace three wide and faded through the lane. DULCE AMBICION saved ground off the pace, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and and
never threatened. COUNTRY JEWEL raced in range inside, was bumped turning for home and faded.

at the top of the stretch, took the lead just before the eighth pole, and drifted out after a left handed cue inside the final furlong while drawing clear. SHE'S
AWESOME set the pace in the two path, was nudged along rounding the turn, cued while floating out to the five path into the lane, yielded to the winner
passing the eighth pole, but held on to place. VITA DE VITO had an awkward start and trailed in the four path early, was under coaxing in the five path
around the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and was along for show. SPOUTY'S GIRL prompted the pace in the three path but was empty

Footnotes
WIND NINETY NINE stalked in the four path, was under a ride around the turn and bid from the six path at the top of the stretch, brushed with the inner
pacesetter in upper stretch, took a narrow lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under steady urging. ANOTHER DUKE was brushed by an inner foe
at the start, chased in the six path, was under right handed urging around the turn, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for place. WALL
STREET TRADER set the pace in the three path, was confidently handled rounding the turn, cued while floating out to the five path into the lane, brushed
with an outer foe just after, and yielded in the final furlong to finish with show. BOURBON THUNDER rated in the four path, was under urging in the two path
around the turn, tipped back out to the four path into the stretch, but was no factor. SOUPER ROYAL MOON was wellback in the two path early but never
threatened. STRASBOURG broke out and brushed an outer foe, tracked in the five path but was done after a half.

I'LL FIGURE IT OUT stalked in the five path, ranged up in the four path early around the turn, bid from the six path into the lane, stuck a head in front
passing the eighth pole, and inched clear under right handed urging. OLD TOWN ROAD set the pace in the two path, was coaxed from the five path at the
top of the stretch, lost the lead to the outer eventual winner passing the eighth pole, but kept on for place. AEQUOR rated in the six path, was driven around
the turn, swung out to the seven path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. SMALL REASON brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed around the
three path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the turn, but was one paced from the two path in the stretch. INCITATUS tracked along the inside, was
roused from the rail around the turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, but faded. BEN COPENHAGEN brushed with an outer foe at the start,
chased around the three path but dropped back around the turn, and never threatened. PRIDE AND PASSION prompted the pace in the four path but
backed up around the turn and was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
SOLAIR was pinched back at the start, advanced three wide around the turn, steadied off heels nearing the quarter pole, waited in traffic the rest of the turn,
angled into the two path in upper stretch, kicked in, closed inside and was up in deep stretch. FLIP MY ID set the pace in the two path, drew clear around
the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. DANNYHILL stalked the pace two wide, steadied midway around the turn, tipped
three wide in upper stretch, had aim outside of the pacesetter but finished evenly to hold the show. DEMURELY stalked the pace three wide between foes
and lacked the needed stretch kick. WINNING AT EASE saved ground in range, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and was one-paced through the lane.
HEIR TO THE ROAR was off slowly, launched a quick six wide bid around the far turn but failed to sustain it in the stretch. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) failed to
menace while racing four wide. LEXINATOR played no factor while racing five wide. LA COSTA was reluctant to load then trailed outside.

Footnotes
MISS M M stalked in the four path, was roused around the far turn, bid from the eight path into the stretch, headed the leader into the final furlong, and
edged past late. CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead under a nudge midway around the far turn, floated out to
the six path into lane, dug in gamely while challenged by an outer foe thru the final furlong, but was edged out late to place. ARTIFACT (GB) tracked in the
two path, waited for room along the rail around the far turn, angled out to the five path in upper stretch, and finished evenly for show. RECONNECTING
brushed with an inner foe at the start, settled in range between foes around the three path, was under right handed urging in the four path entering the
stretch but flattened. STUCK IN MALIBU was unhurried in the four path but no factor from the seven path down the lane. BEST SELLER rated around the
five path, was cued early around the far turn, but never threatened. KENTUCKY KISS set the pace inside but yielded turning into the stretch. VAI VIA
brushed with an inner foe at the start and trail throughout from the four to six paths.

Footnotes
GRANDE SOIREE stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch and widened while ridden out. SIR GOOSA set
the pace in the two path, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but dug in to save the place. IMPETUOUS SOUL raced off the pace two wide,
angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed second. EMBER was bumped repeatedly in the early stages, trailed inside, made a rail bid
nearing the head of the lane then flattened out. HOLIDAY FANTASY saved ground in midpack, chased two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed
rally. CLASSIC BOURBON prompted the pace in the three path and tired in the drive. BLUE SOLDIER failed to menace while racing three and four wide. W.
P. CADET broke outwardly and bumped foes at the start then was bumped again soon after, steadied into the first turn, raced two wide in midpack, wnt four
wide around the far turn and never threatened. TAKEMETOTHEMOON was pinballed between foes at the start, raced three wide around the first turn, went
six deep rounding the far turn and was never in contention. DONTKISSDAMINISTER played no factor while racing three wide. COOL SLIPPERS (IRE) was
outrun while racing four and five wide.
