Footnotes
CHLOE'S TOY set the pace in the two path, angled to the rail leaving the eighth pole and held clear under a drive. HOT FOOT SUSIE prompted the winner
between foes in the three path, was unable to seriously gain on that foe in the lane but won the place duel. FACE THE MUSIC stalked the pace in the four
path, lacked the needed rally and was narrowly outfinished for the place. FELINE chased the pace inside and was one-paced through the lane. NEVER
(IRE) raced in range three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and finished evenly. SAYONARA SISTER failed to menace
while racing two wide. MARILYN steadied early, raced four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
HIHELLOHOWAREYOU set the pace in the two path, opened slightly into the far turn, extended that advantage when roused from the three path into the
stretch, and drew clear under right handed encouragement. KITTY QUICK tracked around the four path, was under a nudge while circling inner foes from
the five path rounding the far turn, and held place from said position thru the stretch. EXTRA INDY prompted the pace in the four path, lost ground and was
ridden between rivals early around the far turn, received a right handed cue from the two path at the top of the lane, and held on to show. ZOSTEROP was
out in the seven path rounding the first turn and stalked in the five path down the backside, was driven from the four path turning into the stretch, but
flattened. HOAX trailed in the four path down the backside, fanned out to the six path turning into the lane, but was no factor. LUCK IN THE DUSK rated in
the two path, advanced inside of rivals into the far turn, but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
MAMA MARIA settled off the early pace outside, moved five wide around the turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane
and drew off under a drive. BURNAWAY was off a bit slowly, trailed inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole and finished with interest. MINXY pressed
the pace three wide between, foes, led nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled to the rail near the quarter pole and was no match for the winner in the lane.
SPLURGE prompted the pace four wide, bid between foes near the five-sixteenths marker and faded through the lane. FORTUNA BELLE set a pressured
pace in the two path, yielded near the five-sixteenths pole, was checked near the quarter pole and had no further bids. PRINCIPIA played no factor while
racing two wide. MY CHUTZPAH was off a bit slow and outrun while racing three and four wide. RATIONAL KATE had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
ARTIFACT (GB) got bumped by an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, tipped out and circled inner foes from the six path around the far turn, bid
under coaxing from the seven path into the stretch, took the lead in upper stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. TOTAL BLISS set the pace in the two
path early, was headed by an outer foe passing the half and allowed that foe to lead into the far turn, was put to a ride along the inside rounding the far turn,
cued right handed into the lane, and held on to place. BIG BEE tracked around the five path, was driven around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path
into the stretch, and got up for show. MAJOR PRYCE was prompted along from the three to four paths down the backside, under right handed urging
around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the lane, but was one paced. BUILT DIFFERENT bumped an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the
five path, ranged up under a nudge around the far turn, but flattened down the stretch. ASKNOTWHATYOUCANDO raced prominently in the four path,
stuck a head in front passing the half, was roused in the two path rounding the far turn and in the three path at the top of the lane, but faded. I BELIEVE IN
MAGIC raced off the pace in the six path, advanced down the backside and was coaxed to bid from the four path into the far turn, but weakened down the
stretch. MIA CAMILA stalked in the three path but dropped back along the inside early around the far turn.

gate then veered out at the start, saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch, made good progress, steadied near the eighth pole, altered
out and gained the show. MABEE LUCKYNWILD dueled at the rail to midstretch then weakened. ISLAND MAGIC failed to menace while racing five wide.
SAMMY'S TOWN chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. LITTLE RED BUTTON prompted the pace three and four wide and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
UNDALAY set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the turn, cued right handed from said position in upper stretch, opened slightly
passing the sixteenth, and held off a late closing outer foe. PAPA KATZ raced off the pace in the two path, was under coaxing around the turn and angled
out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on outside of foes for place. GLORIOUS BUSINESS stalked in the five path, was under a nudge in the four
path around the turn, urged left handed from the six path into the lane, and was one paced for show. COURAGEOUS COPPER pressed in the four path,
was driven in the three path around the turn, back in the four path at the top of the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong to miss minor rewards.
BADBADBOBBY trailed along the inside early and never threatened from out in the center down the stretch. MORETHANICANHANDLE chased in the four
path early but was no menace.

Footnotes
KHOZEIRESS prompted the pace two wide, took over leaving the three-eighths marker, and drew clear through the final furlong. LOCO ABARRIO brushed
at the start, advanced three wide around the turn, bid outside of the winner near the five-sixteenths pole but was turned back and settled for clearly second
best. BIG JOHN was bumped at the start, raced four wide in midpack and was along for the show. DIAMOND COOL chased the pace three wide and lacked
a closing bid. UNCAPTURED STAR brushed at the start, set the pace along the rail and was through after a half. D COLDEST played no factor while racing
four wide. SHAQ DIESEL broke inwardly and bumped MAXIMO into BIG JOHN, checked off heels soon after, steadied nearing the half-mile pole, saved
ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and had no response. MAXIMO was bumped between rivals at the start and never reached contention while
racing two wide.

Footnotes
KATZ THAT GAL settled off the early pace while racing five wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command leaving the
five-sixteenths marker, vied outside of LOVE UNLIMITED and drove clear late. LOVE UNLIMITED was bumped at the start, raced in range four wide, bid
three wide between foes around the far turn, vied inside of the winner through much of the stretch and settled for second best late. CARAVANA raced off
the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. KIT CAN RUN chased the pace three and four wide and stayed on
between foes for a minor share. REACHING STRIDE raced off the pace four and five wide and had a mild rally. ANTRIM moved four wide to the lead
around the first turn, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and around most of the far turn and gave way leaving the five-sixteenths pole. FOR
THE THRILL chased the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. HEART OF THE BEAST hit the starting gate then bumped LOVE UNLIMITED, raced
well back two wide, made some progress four wide around the far turn, lugged in nearing the eighth pole, steadied off heels and offered no further bids.
MISS TONES was outrun inside. SPRINT BREAKER had her head turned at the start and was never involved while racing three and four wide. MY
INSANITY chased the pace five and six wide, had no response, was eased in the lane and vanned off after the finish. D CITY GIRL set the early pace in the
two path, settled back when ANTRIM took over midway around the first turn, angled out early on the backstretch, pressed the pace between foes from
there, faltered late on the turn and was eased through the lane.
