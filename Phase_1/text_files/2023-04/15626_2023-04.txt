Footnotes
BUMPER GIRL exchanged a bump at the break and another one soon after, was encouraged along three furlongs from home going three to four wide on
the turn, moved out a bit further leaving that bend, struck the lead in the vicinity of the furlong grounds and drew clear. EVIE JEAN broke outwardly then
veered in a bit, switched off the rail going two wide on the turn, swung six deep for the drive, ran on to get up for place. STRONGENOUGHSTORM chased
from inside, saved ground on the turn dropping back, came out a path for the stretch run gaining on the leaders then kept on evenly late. SHORT STRAW
bumped a rival just after the start, sped clear despite some restraint from the rider to dictate terms racing off the rail, was collared in mid-stretch and faltered.
PRINCESS TONI got away alertly, shifted in to chase the pace from inside, saved ground on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. HURRYUPANDBYE
raced off the inside, swung six wide, failed to rally. YOU'RE A DANDY exchanged some bumps at the start and was in tight early, encouraged forward after
that to chase two to three wide through the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
DREAM ISLAND obtained forward position stalking or pressing the pace from between runners three wide, moved to challenge and took the lead in upper
stretch, kicked clear then held sway under steady handling. KEEP ATTACKING bumped a rival at the start and was in tight and shuffled back to last, settled
racing in about the three path, began to pick it up on the far turn racing three wide, moved in a bit in mid-stretch while advancing on the leader then kept on
evenly and couldn't reach that one while clearly second best. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR stalked from outside racing four wide, was within range leaving the
far turn but could only kick on evenly in the stretch. STRIKE PRICE rated in behind the leaders racing on the rail, was in a bit tight on heels near the
seven-sixteenths, kept on along the rail but needed more. STORM'S REFLECTION was urged forward, set the pace racing just off the rail, gave way in the
stretch. AWESOME WILLY was bumped at the break, taken back off the leaders into the first turn, moved out from two to four wide on that bend under light
rating tactics, was guided out wider still up the backstretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
BIRDIE BE GONE bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, moved forward outside the early leader to force the pace, raced two wide into the turn, kicked
clear in the stretch under urging. PALACE MAGIC was lightly bumped by the aforementioned at the start, stalked from outside going three wide into the turn,
was within range turning for home but no match for the winner while keeping on to be second best. GO STORMIN GIRL had the early lead but was
overtaken after a little over a furlong, chased from inside saving ground on the turn, kept on evenly in the lane. SAMARITA broke a bit awkwardly and slowly
while being steadied just slightly, switched out and made a rapid sweeping move outside rivals four to five wide on the turn to reach contention turning for
home but could not sustain the effort. RANK AND FILE raced off the pace three wide into the turn, swung five wide turning for home, failed to menace.
MEDWAY QUEEN railed to rally racing near the inside.

TEA AFTER BALLET moved clear along with OPTION and shifted in heading into the first turn to stalk as that one went on with the lead, raced in pursuit
roughly three wide, took closer order turning for home, obtained a narrow advantage in upper stretch and held it while being kept to the task. OPTION sped
clear and shifted in on the first turn, set the pace from inside, was just overtaken in upper stretch but kept on gamely to be second best. WHERE'S LUCKY
stalked from outside three to four wide on the turns, was within range coming to the top of the stretch but no match for the top pair. RIP IT RYAN exchanged
some light bumps at the start, was caught outside foes off the pace three to four wide early, continued three to four wide on the far turn and ran on.
BRODY'S FLY exchanged some light bumps at the start, tucked in behind the leading trio tracking just off the leaders just off the rail, was well-positioned
into the far turn, failed to rally. DASTARDLY DEEDS brushed the outer rival lightly at the start, moved in two wide entering the first turn, raced well back of
the leaders, swung six deep turning for home and failed to rally. KEEN RESPONSE was bumped, stumbled and steadied entering the first turn, swung six
deep into upper stretch then shifted to the rail, failed to menace. DARE GOES DA DEVIL was in tight entering the first turn, bumped the inside rival and
steadied, moved out then back in nearer the rail on the first turn, was never near enough to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
FIRST TURN NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
FIT AND FAMOUS moved forward to force the pace, dueled then edged clear by the midpoint of the turn, went two wide on that bend, drew off when
roused. POSITIONDUMONI got away alertly, dueled inside the eventual winner, switched outside that one three wide late on the turn, chased but could not
kick on but was kept to the task to hold the place. JOYZELLA raced off the pace between runners early, went two to three wide on the turn, ran on to
improve position. BLAZE BEAUTY broke a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, rapidly advanced in the early going three wide and between runners, pursued
three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. OLIVE'S CANDY failed to threaten while racing off the inside four to five wide on the turn. CLIMB
TO GLORY was urged at the start, chased inside, weakened.

Footnotes
CAN MAN DO got away alertly, set the pace shifting nearer the inside while in the clear, extended the advantage in mid-stretch under urging and held sway.
COMISKEY PARK was forwardly-positioned, pursued the winner two to three wide on the turn, could make no headway but was clearly second best.
BASEBALL POLITICS broke outwardly, chased in behind two wide into the turn, gradually moved out on that bend coming five wide into upper stretch and
ran on for show honors. ON K P broke outwardly, moved forwardly up to track the leaders, saved ground inside, ran on evenly. DUST DANCER was forced
out at the break, raced about mid-pack two to three wide on the turn, drifted out and in a bit in the stretch. BLUE NORTHER raced outside mid-pack four to
five wide on the turn, needed more. MUD ISLAND was bumped at the break, shifted in racing near the rail saving ground on the turn, moved out for room in
upper stretch then back in soon after seeking room. BEEALEA broke a step slowly, raced near the inside off the pace, came into upper stretch three wide
then was guided to the rail seeking advancement inside but lacked room and had to alter out approaching the sixteenth pole. OVER CALENDARED chased
from outside going four to five wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. FREDDY J was forced out into a rival at the start then steadied just after, raced
well back, swung six wide for the drive and was never near enough to threaten. MAC PANDOWDY moved out from two to four wide on the turn racing well
back and was not a threat. JUSTICE ONCE was toward the back early, swung seven wide and failed to rally.

Footnotes
GOLDEN HORNET sped clear soon after the start, set the pace near the inside, held sway. WILDWOOD SICILIAN pursued the leader two to three wide
through the turn, could make no headway in the lane while drifting a bit. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was in tight after the break and bumped with a rival,
chased three wide into the turn, moved nearer the rail into upper stretch and ran on evenly. HELA raced off the inside in the two to three path through the
turn, needed more. TETSU raced at the back, went two then three wide on the turn, came out a bit for the drive and improved. KENNESAW bobbled slightly
at the start, chased from inside, came out in upper stretch and continued to weaken. BLAZEN ROAD brushed with a foe at the start, chased from outside
four to five wide through the turn and came up empty. BOCA BOY raced at the back three to four wide on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
MOMENT bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward to press from inside, took the lead early on the far turn, was clear into late stretch, eased up late
and just held. HIGH BROW bumped with the outside foe at the start, settled off the pace inside, switched out for room and with aim on the leader in upper
stretch, kept on urging strong urging and just missed. ASTI SKY hopped at the start but moved forward to set the pace racing off the inside with pressure
from an inside foe, began to lose ground on that rival through the far turn, drifted four wide into the stretch and continued weakening. GLOBAL EMPIRE
raced at the back three wide through the first turn, moved nearer the inside and saved ground on the far turn before swinging out five deep turning for home,
rallied in the stretch but was too little too late. SUPER WISE stalked from the three path, weakened. PISTOL BOX saved ground racing inside early, moved
out and raced two wide still well off the leaders through the far turn, failed to menace. SCAT SHACK hit the gate and was away about five lengths slowly,
caught four wide through the first turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
D'ARCHER bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the loose leader, took over from that one in upper stretch, drifted out through the lane under left-handed
urging, met the bid of a rival and held sway. ONE WAY HOME stalked from outside, went four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five deep, drew
nearly even about the eighth pole, was forced out by the drifting leader shortly after and was second bgest. RISKY BOY raced between foes into the turn,
went three wide on that bend, kept on to hold show honors from FIXICO, who raced off the inside three then four wide on the turn, was moved out in upper
stretch and continued to drift, finished willingly but just missed show. TAKE ME UP BRADY saved ground on the turn, needed more. BOOM FIVE
THOUSAND bumped with a rival a the start, shifted in and saved ground racing midpack, failed to rally. FORT RIDGE was bumped and squeezed back at
the start, failed to threaten. CHOPPER bumped with a foe at the start, was urged forward and cleared to set the pace, faltered and faded.
