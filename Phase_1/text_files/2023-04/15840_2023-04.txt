Footnotes
WEST JET settled at the rear, swung five wide into upper stretch, swept past near the furlong grounds and drew clear under moderate urging. SAZON was
reluctant to load, raced off the pace two wide on the turn, found room to split rivals in upper stretch and rallied inside for the place. OKIE CHROME moved to
within range four wide on the turn, made a brief bid in upper stretch, evened out and lost place. BABY LIAISON chased the pacesetter two to three deep,
lacked the needed late kick. OUR MOON PIE broke a step slowly, saved ground to no avail. GIT AROUND BROWN set the pace in the clear on or just off
the rail, weakened.

COMPUTATION brushed the outer rival at the start, set the pace inside facing outside pressure, tussled through the far turn and was put to a drive coming
to the top of the stretch, responded by drawing clear then held safe. LITTLE SOLDIER BOY attended the pace three wide early, pressed and prompted the
eventual winner, asked for more coming to the quarter pole, was no match but kept on well to be second best. J R ORCHESTRATE bumped the inside rival
at the start, pressed briefly in the early part of the first turn, dropped back to race between the second flight up the backstretch, went two to three wide on
the far turn and kept on evenly in the stretch. CLASSIC SHINE was bumped on both sides at the start, tracked in behind inside on or just off the rail, failed to
rally. SHINE JACK'S DREAM lacked early speed and failed to menace. MR GYPSY broke outwardly, chased from outside about three wide, was done past
the half, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SPELL FREEDOM stalked in behind two to three wide, shifted four deep leaving the turn, took aim and drove past the final sixteenth. HAPPY IN HEELS
moved from between runners to take the lead about the nine-sixteenths, set the pace two wide with inside and outside pressure, asked for more past the
quarter pole, was clear in mid-stretch, lugged out a bit nearing the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner. DODGEBALL had the early lead then
continued to press from inside, needed more late. JADE ENVY settled off the pace, raced two to three wide on the turn, came out a bit for the drive and
improved. ELIZA ROSE stalked from outside, moved in from four to three wide on the turn while dropping back, weakened. ELENA MAE stalked the pace
from between runners to the turn going three then two wide on that bend, weakened thereafter. SWEETASLIFECANBE raced near the inside and failed to

SMOKING GUITAR switched off the rail, was held up in behind runners lacking room three wide at the five-sixteenths, found a seam in upper stretch, bid
inside and kicked clear then held well. LENA'S SHADOW settled while shifting in a bit up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn coming out five
deep for the drive, gained late but was too little. PEARL'S CODE stalked early from outside, bid five wide leaving the turn, was outkicked. SERENDIPITY
COCO attended the pace three to four wide, bid and vied for the lead turning for home, was outkicked. NAUGHTY NATALIE moved forward inside a rival,
was bumped lightly by that one about the nine-sixteenths, edged closer to vie for the lead at the half, weakened. NOODLE SALAD was forwardly-positioned
four wide into the turn, steadied slightly and altered in at the quarter, failed to rally. JAN'S BABY moved to the lead about the nine-sixteenths lightly bumping
a rival at that point, contested the pace between runners, gave way.

Footnotes
MARCH WEST advanced four wide on the turn, took the lead outside the three-sixteenths, drifted in a bit when clear, held sway. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE
settled in behind off the inside, angled six wide turning for home, was gaining but too late. FREER tracked in behind two to three wide on the turn, came out
four to five deep at the top of the stretch and gained some but needed more. DEPUTY LAW stalked the pace, bid three wide and between runners about the
quarter pole, flattened out. WHO'S BIG DADDY raced well off the leaders early racing wide, finished up willingly to improve. SCHLEICHER was outsprinted
early trailing the field, passed tired foes. ELUSIVE FREUD pressed briefly from inside, dropped back and faded. STREETSTER was fractious in the gate,
urged forward at the start, set the pace, gave way.

Footnotes
CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK stalked the leading pair into the turn from outside, ranged up willingly three wide leaving that bend, took command in mid-stretch,
was clear coming to the sixteenth pole and edged away under steady handling. ERNIE BANKER pressed the pace then further engaged for the lead two
wide on the turn, took a narrow advantage and was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, overtaken while drifting out in mid-stretch but kept on to hold the
place. DAME PLATA set the early pace inside, dueled through the turn, kept on but needed more. TOMMYHAWK bumped with a rival at the start, settled at
the rear shifting in, angled four wide turning into upper stretch and ran on. MESA MOON bumped with the aforementioned at the break, settled off the pace
racing two wide into the turn, moved out six wide coming out of that bend, was not near enough to threaten. CANADIAN PRIDE was mid-pack off the
leaders, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LITTLE RIVER JEWEL got away toward the back, steadily advanced between rivals up the backstretch, moved four wide commencing a bid leaving the
turn, took command and kicked clear. CAT TALE BREEZE got away alertly, pressed the pace from outside going two to three wide on the turn, was no
match for the winner but fought on to maintain the place. MYSTICAL CODE was reluctant to load then urged forward from the break racing off the inside,
shifted five wide leaving the turn, kept on in the lane but needed more. GRACE THE LADY settled off the pace racing mid-pack, forced five to six wide on
the turn, kept on in the lane. HOORAY FOR CREDIT moved forward inside to force the pace, needed more. SAVE BALE MONEY raced off the pace and off
the inside going in about the three or four path through the turn, was never near enough to threaten. SURFER GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, came
into upper stretch six wide, was never a threat. COMPUTER VIRUS chased inside, dropped back and faded. FLIP FLOP FLY bumped with a rival a the
start, raced wide going seven deep into upper stretch and was not a threat. RIDE ME HOME chased just briefly, tired.
