Footnotes
ICY REPLY was bumped at the start then pushed into another rival, showed speed while forced in early then steadied when the pacesetter crossed in front
outside the five-eighths, regained stride and established a good position just off the pace, drafted in the two path around the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, rallied four wide into upper stretch, closed well under a brisk hand-ride to get the lead approaching the furlong marker, disposed of the
runner-up under a continued brisk hand-ride into the final sixteenth, was given one pop of a right-handed crop about forty yards from the wire and proved
much the best under good handling. GREATEST LOVE pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, gained a short lead
outside the quarter-pole, was asked for her best in upper stretch while put to the crop, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong marker and
proved no match while clear for the place. SCOTT ALAIA broke out then bobbled, moved out under coaxing, was roused for more late on the backstretch,
traveled three wide around the turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch and narrowly earned the show. TRADE SECRET was hustled from the start,
chased the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened then just missed the show. BEAUTIFUL KAREN bumped soundly with a rival at the start, angled in fast while going to the front, reached the rail
before the five-eighths, showed the way on the inside of foes, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the runner-up outside the quarter-pole, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail late on
that bend, drifted out in the final furlong and was no factor. KEEN DANCER broke out and bumped with a rival then dropped back in tight quarters, dropped
well behind the rest of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead to the furlong marker then
swapped to the proper lead and never reached contention. GRINGOTTS was urged along on the far outside, went five wide around the turn, came seven
wide into upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
TRASH TALKER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then four wide widening away through the latter portion of the turn, angled five wide
into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in and held clear to the finish. RISK PROFILE broke out at the start bumping JALEN JOURNEY in tandem with
STRIKING SPEED, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be
along clear of the rest and second best. BRONX BOMBER chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through
the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show honors. JALEN JOURNEY bumped
between foes at the start who each came his way, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and stayed on
one paced to the finish. STRIKING SPEED bobbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping JALEN JOURNEY in concert with RISK PROFILE, chased
three to four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, tipped five wide into upper stretch and tired. CHOWDA chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch until tucked quickly to the inside placed to urging near the half mile pole, rode the rail through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
MR PHIL was hustled while breaking in front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, was asked near
the quarter-pole, came out some while put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker and held under
strong urging. STAGE LEFT broke in then bumped hard with a foe and was off a few lengths behind the leader, steadied while rated in tight quarters near
the five-eighths, settled outside at the rear under some restraint from that point, was let out in the five path on the turn, gained six wide into the stretch under
stronger encouragement, pursued the winner on the outside into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but was too late while able to get the place.
TOPS THE CHART stalked the leader on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend, pursued the winner while
remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and was outfinished while clear for the show. BIG ENGINE lunged inward at the start then brushed the gate and
was off a few lengths behind the leader, raced on the outside under urging, chased four wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, drifted in
near the sixteenth-pole then bothered a foe and lacked the needed response. WENDELL FONG came away in good order, was well placed just off the
pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened. RUNNINSONOFAGUN bobbled at the start then
bumped soundly twice with a foe, was off a few lengths behind the leader, raced off the pace under some restraint, went two then three wide around the
turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, was shut-off while out of contention at the
sixteenth-pole then checked and had nothing left.

ELECTORATE (IRE) coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied getting
a clear lane with help from WELCOMETOMYWORLD who angled out to give a clear path near the eighth pole, came on through to take narrow command a
sixteenth out, then dug in leaning on JET CITY WOMAN and bumping that rival in the last jump to the wire while holding game at the end. JET CITY
WOMAN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was leaned on
and bumped by the aforementioned foe while gamely just missing for it all. KARA PARA chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. NIGHTSABER (GB) coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, took
over command near the quarter pole and was roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, got caught a sixteenth out
and kept on to the wire. GEOMETRIQUE chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, kicked on
belatedly to the end. WELCOMETOMYWORLD chased just off the inside, came under coaxing inside at the three-eighths, was alongside the eventual
winner and tipped out to open a seam a furlong out, then steadied briefly as that rival came in front, and was outkicked to the finish. OAK LOVES A FIGHT
coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. ACCEL ROSE broke in
at the start bumping SHAYMYNAME, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
SHAYMYNAME bumped at he start by ACCEL ROSE, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired. MY INNER VOICE chased three to four wide, then tucked to the two path through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

MANDATORY stalked outside the leader down the backstretch, took the advantage in the three path with three furlongs to run, responded well when put to
a right-handed crop in upper stretch, was headed just inside the furlong marker, came out about a path shortly thereafter then made light contact with
SALTO DE TIGRE, battled back gamely inside of that foe, was carried in slightly while still a head behind inside the sixteenth-pole, came out slightly nearing
the wire then brushed at the line and narrowly prevailed in a head-bobbing finish. SALTO DE TIGRE settled off the pace, was asked leaving the backstretch,
chased in the three path around the turn, turned four wide into upper stretch under a drive, made a bid inside the three-sixteenths, gained a short lead just
inside the furlong marker, was bumped lightly by MANDATORY shortly thereafter, fought with that foe while leaning in some into the final sixteenth, brushed
with him at the wire and was denied. LONG TERM bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, went four
wide under urging on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened while clear for the show. BREADMAN settled off the pace, was urged four wide
on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. ACHILLES HEEL was urged along at the rear, started the turn in the two path, shifted four then
five wide later on that bend, spun six wide into the stretch and was no factor. NORGAY showed early speed then was well placed just off the pace, dropped
back leaving the backstretch, saved ground under urging around the turn and capitulated. CHARLIE FIVE O bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while
going to the front, was asked under threat in the two path early on the turn, lost the advantage at the three-eighths, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole
and faded. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF SALTO DE TIGRE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MANDATORY AND THE STEWARDS' POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, MANDATORY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE
IN THE FINAL FURLONG.

Footnotes
AFTER FIVE was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, rallied three wide into the stretch then made a
bid outside of the pacesetter, gained the lead just inside the furlong marker then shook clear and held under steady urging. KAWHI ME A RIVER dropped to
the back then moved out while settling at the rear, was urged two to three wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, founded his best stride while
outside in the final furlong and finished fast to garner the place. SOSUA SUMMER was rated just off the pace, lost position while taken back between foes
late on the backstretch, was roused in the two path early on the turn then moved to the three path, chased four wide late on that bend, pursued the winner
under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. IKIGAI was away alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage
to the winner just inside the furlong marker and weakened. WINTER SON bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to
the two path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ELUSIVE EDGE bumped soundly with an opponent at the
start, settled on the inside of a rival, tucked into the two path for the run around the early portion of the turn, shifted three then four wide later on that bend
and failed to rally. LEONIDS stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the two to three path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired.
FLASH KISS settled on the outside, dropped to the rear while four then three wide around the turn, moved to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and
faltered.

Footnotes
BARONE MARCHIS seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command from the embattled leader near the eighth pole, then drew clear under a drive kept to task. IRON HORIZON
six paths off the inside giving chase down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and loosely split rivals to get up for the place honors in the final jumps. MR. BUSTA stumbled at the start and came
under coaxing to duel from the five path down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn widening away from the rest as a pair, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and briefly shook away before getting collared just outside the eighth pole, then weakened
in the late stages. GENTLEMAN BURGLAR hustled from the gate, dueled from the four path with the aforementioned foe to his outside, floated briefly to the
five path near the half mile pole before tucking to the two path into the turn while widening away from the rest of the field as a tandem, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch getting shaken off straightened away, drifted out weakening a furlong out, then weakened to
the finish. THOMAS S P coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch
and trailed throughout.
