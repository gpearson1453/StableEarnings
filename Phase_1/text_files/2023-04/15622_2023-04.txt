Footnotes
SWEET ALEX went to an early pressured lead to set all the pace then inched away at the quarter pole to be an easy winner. BABY LIAISON was off the
pace down the backstretch then was asked at the five sixteenth pole and made a three wide bid but was no match for the winner. WHAT ABOUT JIMMY
pressed the pace from the two path to the seven sixteenths pole and flattened out. NORTHERN ORBIT saved ground to no avail. ROWDY GALE was
unhurried and never a factor.

BROTHER AARON stalked the pace from the four path then made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole to engage the leader at the three sixteenths
pole, dueled down the stretch but wore down the leader to prove best. ROWDY RIVER was off the pace in the three path around the turn then took the lead
at the top of the stretch and was challenged by outside rival, fought gamely to the wire but was second best. EURO SUPRISE pressed the pace from the
inside down the backstretch then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole but gave way grudgingly. ONOMATOPOEIA tracked the leaders from the inside to
the turn then made a mild rail bid and faltered. OKIE UNION was hustled to the lead from the two path, held that position to the five sixteenths, stopped and
jogged in.

pole and finished evenly. GOTOTHEWINDOW was pinched back at the start then was allowed to settle down the backstretch, made a mild rail bid on the
turn but was not a threat. RIVER BLING bobbled at the start and jockey lost her outside iron and drifted out trying to regain iron.

PALUXY was off the pace on the inside down the backstretch then launched his bid at the five sixteenths pole going three wide into upper stretch and
cruised by the leaders at the sixteenth pole to prove best. COWBOY MISCHIEF was unhurried around the first turn and down the backstretch then started to
gather momentum going into the final turn to make a rail rally but was too late. ROYALLY tracked the leaders around the first turn then moved up on the
backstretch but lacked a response on the final turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. NEWPORT BEACH stalked the pace from the two path down the
backstretch then engaged the leader at the five sixteenths pole and matched strides to mid stretch but was out kicked. ROWDY RASCAL had an
unchallenged lead from the inside to the five sixteenths pole then matched strides with outside rival to mid stretch and tired.
