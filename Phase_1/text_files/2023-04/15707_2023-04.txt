Footnotes
STAR OF TOMORROW away in good order, clear along the inside before a quarter, continued to maintain daylight through the turn along the rail,
responded when confronted from the outside nearing the furlong marker, dug in late to gain the nod. ROWDY DAISY forwardly placed while off the inside,
raced three wide through the turn, moved closer late in the bend then lost some ground to the winner into the stretch, got back to the winner.
PREORDAINED bothered slightly at the start, lacked speed three wide, steered four wide into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. COROMANDEL in the
two path in the second flight while just off the inside, continued in the two path through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
response. HONEYCAMP broke well to briefly duel with the winner, chased that one into the turn while in the two path, weakened in the drive. PEACEFUL
MOMENT saved ground to no avail. BROOKE'S ALL IN off a step slow, raced back throughout and failed to menace. TWINKLING IRISH was finished early
while in the two path, trailed home, vanned off.

Footnotes
SPACE ODESSEY closest to the leader, asked along and inched closer midway on the final turn, continued to be ridden along into the stretch, put a head in
front in midstretch, wore that rival down late while holding the runner up safe in the waning strides. JINGLE off step slow, dropped inside first turn, tracked
up backstretch, waited briefly in traffic with five furlongs remaining, saved ground through the second turn, angled out past the furlong marker, steadily
gaining late while widest of the first flight. PRIMER DIMER broke well, got clear to show the way into the first turn while in hand and a bit keen, continued to
show the way up the backstretch in hand, continued to show the way up the backstretch, responded when challenged late in the final turn, headed past the
furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. MAJOR KONG fell back to trail after the start, continued to be devoid of speed for five furlongs,
moved out to be four wide midway on the final turn, improved position while not a threat to the top three. ZOFFA broke with leaders, prompted the issue
from the three path for six furlongs and weakened. EGOMANIAC lacked speed off the inside, three path through the second bend, failed to muster a rally
down the stretch. STUD PUPPY never menaced while racing off the inside. GENERATOR in mid pack and inside, retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
COST BASIS with the pace from the start, dueled up the backstretch under light restraint, disposed of the other speed by midway through the bend,
maintained daylight through the lane while being kept to task. MORNING SNOW in the second flight off the inside, chased the winner through the turn and
into the stretch, could do little with that one through the lane to prove no match, clearly second best. SAHM TEQUILA behind the pace and the inside, four
wide late in the turn, along for the the show, no threat to the top two. TAPPIN FORA DANCE went one paced along the inside in lacking a closing response.
SHANGHAI'S DREAM lacked speed, continued back while racing in the two path through the turn, not dangerous. MEET JOE moved up to duel inside the
winner for three furlongs and gave way. CRYSTAL CRESCENT failed to menace while racing three wide. JUNE GLOOM broke in the air to spot the field a
couple of lengths, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LORI'S EYES broke in, was straightened to race close from the start, pressed the issue three wide into the lane, put a head in front entering the stretch,
clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. WREAKING HAVOC last to leave, raced back off the pace, steered out
early in the far turn to be four wide, roused for the drive, gaining late on the outside of the winner. FLASH OF CHEROKEE floated in break, pressed the
issue while off the inside, dueled late in the turn inside the winner, chased that one past the furlong marker and weakened. MAY DISCO broke back, raced
in the two path through the turn, shifted out a bit when straightened for home, improved position while not a serious threat. TRUEBLUEGIRL void of speed,
steered out three wide around a tiring foe late in the turn, picked off a couple more faltering rivals while never a threat. QUARANTINED narrowly showed the
way early along the inside, continued to hold the advantage through most of the turn, gave way for the drive. NELLY LARKIN in mid pack off the inside,
three wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. MISS DOUBLE in the second flight toward the rail, faded.

LOOKIN FOR LOKI forwardly placed while racing outside, four wide through the turn, late bid, powered clear. ATRAS broke alertly, scooted clear in the run
up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the turn toward the inside, still clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner late, held
sway for the place. SIGNOFTHECROSS void of early foot, angled out to be four wide for the drive, rallied widest down the lane, getting to the runner up
late. BEND IN THE RIVER in the second flight while racing off the inside, dropped inside for the stretch run, moved a bit closer, finished up evenly. BLACK
STORM pressed the pace in the two path for four furlongs, had little left for the drive. ROCK N JUNE BUG went one paced along the inside. J. E.'S
HANDMEDOWN remained bac throughout in failing to menace. LESLIE'S GOLD prompted the pace while racing three wide, in some traffic late in the turn,
retreated through the stretch. ORBITAL STARR off slow, fell well back.

Footnotes
SINGING EMMA broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, dueled through the turn, put that foe away into the stretch, steadily drew out under pressure.
COURAGEOUS CAPPEN lacked early foot, dropped inside for the drive, staged a mild rally up the rail to prevail for the place, no match for the winner.
TOTAL DISCRETION in the second flight outside, moved closer five wide turning four home, flattened out a bit late to be outkicked for the place.
BAYSHORE FOXES off a step slow, moved up to the second group, closer in the turn, also went flat through the lane to finish up evenly. VEGAS BLUE
pressed early on the outside, dueled in the two path early turn, three wide into the lane, faltered. FUNTIMEGIRL forwardly placed for three furlongs in the
three path, weakened late in the turn. ELI'S GIRL dwelt at the start to be last away, four wide late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. KANCANCUTIE
dropped inside to save ground through the turn, also lacked a bid. HALF SCOUT off a step slow, trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RYVIT in mid pack and off the inside, two path in the second flight turn, steered out three wide into the lane, roused on the outside and kicked down the
clear leader to finish with good resolve. AMERICAN OUTLAW sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, continued to enjoy a daylight advantage
through the turn and upper stretch, could not contain the winner late inside that one, remained clear of the others. EASY ACTION within striking distance
while off the rail three wide, went one paced through the stretch to finish up best of the rest while lacking a closing punch. AXTON off a step slow, trailed
early, came four wide out of the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. CALL ME Q back off the pace along the inside, in some traffic late in the
turn, came up empty for the drive. COMMERCE COMET chased the runner up for a half off the inside, gave way for the drive. PROTEGE broke back, failed
to menace while three wide. ROCKING ROCKET in mid pack and inside, tired through the stretch. MISTER MULDOON finished early, well back.

Footnotes
C. C. HARBOR off a step slow, far back along the inside, continued to lag while saving ground second turn, moved out a bit in some traffic approaching
midstretch, split foes, dropped back down to the rail and finished with good resolve to be up in time. COURTNEY FAY settled off the pace and the inside,
four wide into the far turn, advanced through that bend to challenge on the outside into the lane, put a head in front past the furlong marker, led late, nailed
by the winner in the waning strides. WAR MUSIC void of speed, moved out to be four wide onto the backstretch, continued well wide, four wide through the
second turn, mild rally through the lane to be up for the show. MOCHA KISS behind the pace while racing in the two path, advanced before a half, took over
and led in upper stretch, could not last in weakening late. EARLY DISMISSAL bumped at the start, void of speed for five furlongs, steered out five wide
when advancing late in the final turn, improved position with some mild interest. FORTIBUG jostled at the break to be away slowly, void of speed, four wide
into the lane when moving closer, flattened out the final furlong. GOLD STRATEGY in mid pack and off the inside, three wide through the final turn, went
evenly through the lane to lack a closing response. HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL broke in and bumped FORTIBUG, was straightened to chase the leader into
the first turn, fell back before a half, weakened in the drive. LITTLE ROCKER broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace for over six furlongs, faltered
when headed into the lane. SHE BE SHEEHAN within striking distance on the outside, gave way far turn. GUEST IN MY HEART four wide through the
turns, was finished before six furlongs. DANCIN N THEPULPIT in mid pack, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in, distanced at the wire.
