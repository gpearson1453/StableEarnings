Footnotes
DOLCE SERA broke a half-step slow then was hustled, raced towards the back under urging, moved closer near the half-mile pole, went three wide early on
the turn, shifted five wide in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, rallied outside coming to the quarter-pole, closed fast to get the lead into upper stretch,
responded well into the final furlong and edged clear under steady urging. MOONEY MOONEY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, tracked the pace
down the backstretch, chased in the four path around the turn, made a bid into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong was outfinished while
able to get the place. GRACEFUL lunged at the start then bumped soundly with a foe and was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, settled near the
back under some urging, went four wide early on the turn, shifted six wide near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished
willingly for the show. NOBLEANDGREENOUGH followed the leader while off the rail down the backstretch, chased in the three path under a bit of extra
left-rein guidance around the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into upper stretch and weakened. BALENTINA was hustled to the front, showed the way
with some company, vied inside while asked for more on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and tired. HERECOMES SCARLETT
lacked early speed and dropped back on the outside, raced under urging on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and failed to threaten. GERMANY JAYVO was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went five
wide early on the turn then was carried seven wide later on that bend and capitulated.

Footnotes
DERRYNANE broke out at the start bumping the shying out MOONAGE DAYDREAM into SHINFULL against pressure outside from PATRIA and ROAD TO
REMEMBER, chased three then two wide before tipping back three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a good
kick to rally and take command a sixteenth from home, dug in and prevailed on the wire. PATRIA crossed directly to the inside forcing ROAD TO
REMEMBER to alter inwards at the start and crash into STARSHIP LAOBAN against pressure inside from DERRYNANE, forcing the two middle members
of that quintet to get squeezed out, continued crossing until able to show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on willingly to secure the
place honors. STARSHIP LAOBAN got squeezed out between foes at the start and was briefly taken in hand conceding four lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to secure
the show honors in the late stages. MOONAGE DAYDREAM shied out slightly at the start in reaction to the breaking out DERRYNANE and was bumped
between foes conceding three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside under light coaxing to be forwardly placed, came under urging at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, stayed on one paced tipping out near the sixteenth marker and was along for the last major share. SHINFULL got
bumped between foes solidly and was squeezed out and steadied at the start getting away last and conceding four to five lengths to the front before being
able to settle into stride, chased along the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to
be three to four wide a furlong out closing in late, then had MOONAGE DAYDREAM tip out near the sixteenth marker to her inside and was taken back in
hand and not persevered with late despite having a clear seam and finished under her own power. TEMPERMENTAL chased along the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on but was outkicked. ROAD TO REMEMBER broke in at
the start as PATRIA tucked in from the outside and bumped STARSHIP LAOBAN into SHINFULL against pressure inside coming from DERRYNANE,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry
into the start as well as a claim of foul by the rider of STARSHIP LAOBAN alleging interference by PATRIA at the start. After review, the claim of foul was
dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
ALWAYS LAUGHING got bumped at the start by ROSEMARY POTATOES, who broke inwards and in turn bumped and pinched back ANILEATE in tandem
with SMOKIN' HOT KITTY, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied
up the inside with good energy to take command near the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to score. ANILEATE got bumped between foes
and pinched back at the start getting away last and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling along the inside at the tail of the field, tipped two
then briefly three wide through the first turn before settling three to four paths off the rail down the backstretch taking up the rear, began to steadily advance
in the clear from the half mile pole into and through the far turn moving into prominence nearing the quarter pole now under coaxing, swung six wide into
upper stretch and was floated out and bumped seven wide by SNOW LOVES A FIGHT straightened away before displacing that rival from the narrow and
brief command she held nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a drive under threat to the inside, got guided in to get a look at her main danger and was
overtaken a sixteenth out, ran on with good courage to be along clear of the rest and second best. HEARTBURN established the front and showed the way
in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared straightened away into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages while prevailing in the battle for the show honors. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT just off the inside tracking the leader in
closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and floated six wide bumping ANILEATE straightened away,
seized brief and narrow command before being overtaken by ANILEATE near the eighth pole, dug in weakening in the late going. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY
broke out at the start bumping ANILEATE and pinching that rival back in concert with pressure outside from ROSEMARY POTATOES, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
ROSEMARY POTATOES broke in at the start bumping ALWAYS LAUGHING into ANILEATE and causing half the pressure that pinched that foe back,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. CROSS ISLAND two to three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and came up empty. RICELLE tracked the pace
along the inside, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch, had the rider look back over their right shoulder and tipped out one additional path
straightened away, then weakened to the finish. CRYSTAL ORB three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
DONTBELATE prompted the pace between horses, took the lead inside the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path around the turn, responded well when
asked for his best in upper stretch, fought on gamely when challenged by the runner-up at the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed. COOL QUARTET was
reserved off the pace, came under urging while three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased into the final furlong, gained to
make a bid near the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the finish and was denied while clear for the place. NO MORE TALK was rated off the pace,
drafted inside to the two path around the turn, moved out after turning into the stretch then was put to a drive, chased the winner into the final sixteenth,
swapped back to his inside lead late and weakened while clear for the show. PERCEIVED settled on the outside, was urged five then six wide on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response then suffered an injury to his right foreleg after the finish before being euthanized on
the track. ROYAL REALM was rated off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, went two to three wide around the turn and also lacked the
needed response. MUSICAL HEART prompted the pace on the outside of two opponents, chased in the four path around the turn and tired. VINTAGE
HOLLYWOOD settled just off the pace on the outside, was roused late on the backstretch, chased five wide around the turn and capitulated.
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY was last to commence, settled at the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
BOURBON BAY broke fast while racing for purse-money only then was hustled, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead inside the
seven-sixteenths, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded. BOURBON BAY RACED FOR PURSE-MONEY ONLY DUE TO
HIS ENTRY-MATE BEING A LATE SCRATCH

Footnotes
NOVA RAGS was brushed in the hindquarters at the start, raced on the outside under urging, went five wide on the turn, rallied to take the lead into upper
stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. DOT'S DOLLAR bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the
pace, went four then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. CEES GET DEGREES moved in while
showing good speed, set the pace under pressure to his inside, was urged along in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner while under a
drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. RIVER DOG was sent hard from the start, chased four
wide around the turn, made a brief bid in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth then faltered and was taken in hand but held the last spot
in the superfecta. BIG ENGINE bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up some while in tight, raced at the rear under urging, went two to three wide
around the turn and was no factor. SWOT ANALYSIS was hustled from the start then chased the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide
through the turn and came up empty. NO SABE NADA broke a step slow, was urged near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn and failed to
threaten. SAINT SELBY broke out then made light contact with a foe, pressed the pace along the rail while inside of a foe, vied against the rail on the turn,
dropped back into the stretch and capitulated.
