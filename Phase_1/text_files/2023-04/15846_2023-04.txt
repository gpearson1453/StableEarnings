Footnotes
MONIQUES DAREDEVIL chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and kicked clear in
the lane. OUR FANTASY bumped mildly with the horse to her inside at the start, raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, switched out to
the five path coming off the turn, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and chased the winner home from there. DIA DE SOL bumped with the horse to
her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way on the rail up the backstretch and around the bend, gave way in upper stretch and kept on to the
finish while drifting out. CLASSY OF COURSE bumped lightly with the horse to her inside at the break, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the bend from the three path and faded in the lane. CHARGE IT JENN tracked the pace setter on the inside through the early going, saved
ground around the bend and weakened in the stretch. TIMELESS GLORY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
AMORE MOON raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still
in the two path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground to kick clear late. FROSTY SECRET saved ground early, tracked the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, dueled in upper stretch and chased on to the wire. MARTINI'S AMICA chased the
leader on the inside through the opening half mile, challenged from the two path coming around the far bend, and kept on to the finish. NO MORE FIRE
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the three path and gained
ground late. TEA'S DREAM hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the
far turn in the four path and never threatened. D'ORO BABY led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch
and around the far bend, and faded in the lane. SARA KALI raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path and was empty in the lane. SONG OF THE HEART raced in the three path early, stalked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far bend and continued to tire from there.

K'S PICK raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn,
kicked clear in the lane and held that margin to the wire. BRAMBLE BLAZE raced in the three path around the first bend, settled off the pace on the inside
for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. HONOR LEO
JEAN raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and improved position in
the lane. PLEASANT VALIANT saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch and around the far bend
and improved position on the rail in the stretch. GRATIA PRINCE raced in the three path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, came around the second turn still in the three path and finished evenly. DENYING saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside
up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. BIG LOUIE was sent to an early lead while saving ground
around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong.
HUASTECO saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the four path and

kicked clear. AXCEL bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the
turn and gained ground late. GRAND MACALLAN dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming around the turn and
kept on to the finish while drifting out in the final furlong. MAJESTIC PHAROAH dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the
turn from the four path and kept on to the wire. AWESOME FLAY raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and showed no kick.
ROAD MINISTER raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. COX CANYON hit the gate
leaving it, dropped back to trail well behind the field in the opening stages, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
WOW WISH dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that
margin to the wire. PLAYGROUND LEGEND bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack early, saved ground around
the bend, began a bid passing the quarter ole and gained ground late. WIN NO JOKE hopped up leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the
opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. HASN'T HAD ENOUGH raced in the
middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. EL GABRIELO pressed the pace on
the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the bend and kept on in the stretch. CANADIAN AUTHORITY tracked the pace setters on
the outside through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and weakened in the lane. MOTOWN MIKA bumped with the horses to either
side and was forced to take up at the break, raced off the pace early, saved ground around the bend and never threatened. RAUL'S ENCANTO dueled
between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. HANDSOME RUNNER trailed well
behind the field while saving ground up the backstretch and around the turn and was not a factor. NOT A PRAYER veered in and bumped with the horse to
his inside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack through the early going, dropped back from the two path coming around the turn and continued to tire
from there.

Footnotes
SIGN AND SEAL raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the
two path, dueled to the wire and just held the win while drifting out in the lane. LIGEIA saved ground early, raced off the pace up the backstretch, began a
bid from the five path coming around the turn, drifted in in upper stretch and dueled to the finish from there, narrowly missing. LILY'S LEAD raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground late. BEASTIE GIRL raced in the
three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the second
turn, raced into traffic and was forced to steady slightly near the eighth pole when multiple horses drifted into his lane and kept on from there. DONNA
LIRICA bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, recovered to lead the field from the four path around the first turn, continued to show the way up
the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far bend and faded in the final furlong. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY bumped lightly with the horse to
her inside leaving the gate, saved ground early, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and
weakened in the stretch. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA raced in the five path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the second bend from the three path and tired in the lane. RAINOUT raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at
the back of the pack, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. RAHTID trailed the field while saving ground through the
opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn, swung wide into the stretch and was not a factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE EIGHT, BEASTIE
GIRL, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE FOUR, LIGEIA, CITING INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
