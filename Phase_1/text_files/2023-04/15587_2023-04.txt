Footnotes
JAMIES INHERITANCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, reached the
fore soon after, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held off the closing OCEAN OF LIES to prevail. OCEAN OF LIES was void of early speed,
raced six-wide through the turn and rallied late. STARDUST DREAMS was off a step slow, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing five-wide,
stayed on well in the drive and gave way grudgingly. SHE'D RATHER DANCE was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside, angled out into
the stretch and weakened. MISCHIEF MAME broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. TAMA SETS DA
PACE lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CREME DE LA CHROME settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached CORN POP inside the furlong marker, vied with that rival
and proved best through a stiff drive. CORN POP chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, led, responded
when challenged by the winner, vied and just missed. POPS AWESOME lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good late
energy. WIND RIVER sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. UNSTOPPABLE ME was off a
step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH was forwardly placed from the inside
and gradually weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BRITE TAN raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew
clear. AND I KNOW was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished
with good late energy. DEL MAR FLASH was carried out through the first turn, pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
half, opened a clear margin and gave way through the final sixteenth. LUCKY STEPPER settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second
turn and finished evenly. WORKIN NINETOFIVE lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. RED PANTY NIGHT lugged out
through the first turn, set a pressured pace, re-bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and weakened after going three-quarters. BIG CYN was away in good
order to chase the leaders from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MY MOONDANCER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by MAMALONA with a furlong
to run and drew clear from that rival through the closing yards. MAMALONA stalked the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage with a furlong to
run but could not match strides with that foe in the drive. GRANDIOSE SUMMER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
reached a striking position but failed to gain late. DADDY'SFAVORITESON lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FINE
POINT ASSAY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. VALDINI was off slow, lagged early, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. MUCH ABOUT ONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.
THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TRULY A MESS sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, raced three-wide while setting the pace and held sway to the wire.
CAMDEN HIGH settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and finished with a late
rally. COME CORRECT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. LADY CREATIVE broke sharply
to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. UPTOWN RHAPSODY lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. EASY DOES IT lagged early, was carried out through the second turn and eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

STREET RUCKUS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and wore down FURY KAP in
the closing yards. FURY KAP sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased his margin into the lane but could not resist the
winner late. TAP THE BRAKES was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second tun, angled in with a furlong to run and finished
willingly. ATOMIC CANDY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. SOCAL RED was void of early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PUSH THROUGH raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
weakened. FORT LANGLEY showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
JANERO ROSE stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a
sixteenth to run and held off the closing HOLLYWOOD MISTRESSS to prevail. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS bobbled at the start, raced unhurried early,
moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. REIGN OF FIRE was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn,
angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. SPEEDY GIGI sprinted clear at once, saved ground through the turn and gave way through the final furlong.
FLASH FLOOD was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually gave way. DAZZLING MIST raced off the pacesetters,
checked nearing the half, angled out in mid-stretch and did not reach contention. ELDORADO DREAM raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide through
the turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SINGLE LADY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was up in the closing
yards. DIPLOMATICA pressed the pace of LOOPY while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear
margin with a quarter to run but could not resist the winner late. BURROW DOWN lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, checked in
mid-stretch and finished evenly late. ZEYARAAT was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished
with a belated bid. LOOPY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going six furlongs. YES PLEASE settled off
the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. LARIMAR raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and weakened. SPUN LINE raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not
menace. MY CRAFTY GAL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
