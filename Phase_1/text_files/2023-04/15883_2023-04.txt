BEAT THE DEALER perfect position to turn, swept around leaders with a deft move, cleared in the stretch run and was all out to hold on at the wire. JUST
TAPIT IN had an awkward start, raced back to the stretch with a late run in the final furlong but just missed in a good effort. STREAKY dueled early on,
stayed game throughout between horses late. THE PINK Z dueled from inside to the turn, used up on rail, faded in stretch. HEIDI'S SINATRA never in the
mix throughout. JUST TAPIT IN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED LAST FOR A VIOLATION OF THE HISA WHIP RULE FROM THE
GATE.

OBRIGADA just off leaders to turn, took over in hand to go clear in the stretch, felt the whip several times but was eased up in the final sixteenth as much
the best. MEET IN SECRET good position throughout with a nice trip while no match for winner while best of the rest. LOVE MY CANDY had a troubled
start, never far back throughout with an even trip for the show spot. IT FACTOR inside speed to the front, hounded to turn but gave in stretch. THIS IS
ANFIELD tried to keep up, could not go on and faded back from the turn. SWEET TORI PAT had an awkward start and never threatened throughout.
RUNAWAY WILLIE broke awkwardly from the gate and never menaced thereafter.
