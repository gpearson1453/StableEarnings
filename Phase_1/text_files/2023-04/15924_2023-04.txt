Footnotes
OHEAVENS was content to stalk near the back in the early going, shifted just off the fence at the quarter pole, began to lengthen her stride when switching
leads inside the eighth pole and was full of run late to win comfortably in the end. LOADED VIXEN broke sharp to dictate the pace at the half, surrendered
the front seven sixteenths from home, chased the frontrunner through the turn and was gritty between rivals in mid stretch to finish well to capture the place
share. GREEN GABLES showed good speed outside to take command entering the turn, continued to separate herself from runners racing on the turn
opening up as they turned for home, began to weaken at the furlong marker and faltered with seventy yards remaining. TICKLE HER TOE settled near the
back on the inside in the beginning, was roused angling out three wide at the top of the lane and showed some good energy gaining late on her rivals in
deep stretch. AWILDAS TREASURE sat behind the early speed pair tracking at the half, was urged on the turn to go after the leaders inside and offered
little effort in the stretch drive. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was fractious in the gate before the break, off slowly when the latch opened, trailed the pack down
the backside and could not recover enough to close the gap on the field through the stretch.

Footnotes
GIVE ME MY MONEY was bumped outside leaving the gate, rated kindly on the rail in the second tier down the backside, rallied three wide at the top of the
lane and wore down his challenger at the furlong marker to draw away in the end. GRAND AMBITION broke in at the start, tracked the frontrunner on the
turn, took command between rivals as they turned for home, battled with the winner until the furlong marker and finished well to be second best. DO THE
GRIDDY dictated the pace throughout the turn, was collared outside two furlongs from the prize, could not keep up with the two leaders in mid stretch but
had enough left to be a clear third in the end. ARNIE P had a good spot tracking outside in the second flight entering the turn, was urged for more run at the
quarter pole, offered little response but finished up evenly holding for a minor share. PREETZAH'S STAR hopped at the start, rated mid pack between
horses with a half remaining, took an awkward step three eighths from the finish when roused and could no make an impact in the late stages. MANETKA
stalked outside four deep at the half, could not gain on rivals through the turn and made little impression running to the wire. TORY'S HOLIDAY was
brushed outside at the break, then was steadied while leaving the chute to trail the field down the backstretch, offered a mild rally saving ground on the turn
but could not be a factor racing down the lane.

Footnotes
HONEY WON'T was comfortable hounding the pace outside while in hand, took control in upper stretch and drew off late to win going away in an impressive
score. TRICKY MAGICIAN broke in after the start, had a good inside position tracking the top pair, was shuffled back a touch nearing the three furlong
marker, put in a good run angling outside five wide as they turned for home and closed well to get up for the place award at the wire. MASTER SPY was
reined in down the backside to rate behind the top pair, attempted to engage the leaders inside on the turn but could not get the seam, shifted out off the
front duo in mid stretch and finished well between rivals for a good effort. MAYITO stalked outside at the back racing three wide at the half, found another
gear running four wide around rivals at the quarter marker, angled out to six path in upper stretch and was closing but could not threaten in the end.
FOREST B broke sharp to set the early fractions, was collared outside by the winner at the furlong marker and faltered in deep stretch losing positions. BET
settled near the back of the pack entering the turn with runners on either side, was roused to keep pace five sixteenths to go and had little to show for the
drive to the finish line. MONEY MATTERS was brushed outside at the start, unhurried down the backstretch, put in a brief run between foes midpoint on the
turn and weakened when they turned for home.

Footnotes
ELYSIAN FIELD tracked the leaders from inside mid-pack, came out in upper stretch for room, struck the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear under
moderate urging. CALABRIAN QUEEN was coaxed forward to take the lead after the opening sixteenth, set the pace inside, came off the rail turning for
home, was overtaken in mid-stretch, no match for the winner but just lasted for place over MORAL TURPITUDE, who broke a bit slowly, settled at the rear,
advanced inside on the turn, continued to rally up the rail in the stretch and just missed second. TIMELESS ELEGANCE stalked from between runners two
to three wide, angled out near the eighth pole, showed good late stride. WORST BEHAVIOUR got away alertly, ceded the lead to CALABRIAN QUEEN,
pressed outside that one two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. ZONING ORDER stalked from outside, was within range three to four wide on the turn,
forced out near mid-stretch by another rival and had no late kick. CANDY WINE got away a bit slowly, settled outside at the rear, swung five wide turning for
home, failed to menace. GRAVY was forwardly-placed outside, in range on the turn racing four to five deep, came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
CANYOUHEARMENOW was given some encouragement early to keep up racing between runners, put to stronger urging on the turn, shifted in on that
bend and bid inside, took command in upper stretch and drew clear under strong and steady urging. LIL GREEN MACHINE got away well and moved
forward under some early urging, contested the pace from outside three wide, drifted to nearly the six path leaving the turn, came back in and fought on to
get the place. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN switched outside the leaders to stalk that pair into the turn four wide, was carried out about seven deep turning for
home by a drifting rival, came in after that and kept on but missed second. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT settled at the back racing off the inside, went three then
two wide on the turn, kept on evenly in the stretch and needed more. STYLISH GENT exchanged a light bump at the start, moved forward inside a rival to
set the pace racing off the rail, dueled inside that one, faded in the stretch. EXTRACTION WILL pursued from outside four to five wide, dropped back and
tired. SUPER HEADLINE exchanged a light bump at the start, lacked early speed, raced mostly inside, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MAXIMUS MOMENTUS settled inside mid pack early, started to rally midway on the turn angling outside to be in the four path when they straightened out
for the drive and continued a sustained run to wear down the leaders in deep stretch. RACING IN THE RAIN broke in to begin, set all the fractions while
alone on the front throughout the turn, tried to open up at the top of the lane, could not shake loose from his challengers at the furlong marker and was
caught in deep stretch. FADE AWAY advanced on the rail at the half to be behind the frontrunner entering the turn, continued to chase the pace at the
quarter pole, angled just outside for the drive and dug in between foes in mid stretch but could not gain late for a better placing. UNILATERAL was steadied
briefly leaving the chute to trail down the backstretch, began picking off horses circling midpoint on the turn, angled widest to the seven path turning for
home and closed in for a small share. BLOCKBUSTER stalked close to the back three wide at the half, put in a four wide rally three furlongs from the prize
outside his rivals and offered some run in the stretch passing tiring runners. DUKE OF MIAMI settled near the back of the field between horses in the early
stages, was coaxed for more on the turn, could not offer a run and was not a factor running to the finish. BIG BAD BEAST chased the leader racing outside
of rivals at the half, could not keep up with the front pair at the quarter pole and faded through the field in the stretch. RADCLIFFE was brushed at the start,
chased the pace down the backstretch, steadied briefly and retreated quickly seven sixteenths from the finish then lost contact with the field as they turned
for home. PER RULING #2180278 FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, MAXIMUS MOMENTUS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
OLD CHESTNUT settled just off the pace tracking inside, edged closer willingly late on the turn, came out and was put to urging at the top of the stretch,
struck the lead outside the eighth pole, drew off under just mild urging late. HILARIOUS AFFAIR raced between runners at the rear, angled five wide at the
top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished strongly enough to get up for place late over LAPOCHKA, who settled early, saved ground near
the rail through the turn, rallied between runners in mid- to late-stretch but was outfinished for second. PERFECT CRIME moved forward three wide heading
into the turn, asked for run past the five-sixteenths, evened out in the stretch. ABISKO moved clear to set the pace racing in the two path, came up empty.
ROCKSTAR RO was forwardly-placed four wide chasing from outside, strongly encouraged at the five-sixteenths, had no response and faded. REPEAT
THE HEAT raced outside at the rear, went four wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
UNCLE JOE took command from the onset, was unchallenged on the lead setting the fractions on the turn, opened up at the furlong marker and cruised
home in a front running victory. LONG POND tracked between rivals at the half, took up the challenge outside of horses at the quarter marker, loomed three
wide in upper stretch but needed more late to threaten the loose on the lead winner in the end. POINT TO THE STARS was situated near the back inside
racing into the turn, advanced smartly on the rail with two furlongs remaining and put in a good fence run to the wire just missing out for place losing out on
the nod at the wire. TALK TO YA LATER raced in midfield four wide in the beginning, was shuffled back some running outside at the five sixteenths pole,
was widest in the six path when the straightened out for the run to the wire and ran on some to win the battle for a minor award. SOUPER CLASSY was on
hold watching the field down the backside, continued to trail racing on the turn, angled out in the five path for the drive to the wire but had no finishing kick to
give in the stretch run. SOONER LUNAR chased the winner down the back straight, started to weaken running with rivals on either side midway on the turn
and gave way at the furlong marker.

NEW YORK THUNDER was urged at the break to move clear then settled on the front end dictating terms, responded to urging in the stretch and drew
away as the rider pleased. NINETYFOUR EXPOS got away alertly, pursued the eventual winner two to three wide, was no match but second best.
STAYHONOR GOODSIDE settled at the rear inside, angled six wide turning for home, put to stout urging, gained show honors. SHIP THE GOODS broke
just a bit awkwardly, shifted in to track the eventual winner from inside, saved ground, failed to rally. OPPOSITES ATTRACT raced outside three to four
wide on the turn and within range, drifted in a bit in late stretch, needed more. GRAN SPIRITED broke outwardly, settled at the back racing outside a foe
two to three wide, failed to rally.

ONE BAY HEMINGWAY was four wide fighting for the front end on the turn, put away his speed rivals as they entered upper stretch and began to edge
away from all challengers the final sixteenth in an impressive score. PARAMOUNT PRINCE was part of the foursome dictating the fractions on the turn
running between foes in the two path, continued to chase the winner in vain mid stretch but to no avail and finished well late to still hold off foes for the place
award when they hit the wire. MORSTACHY'S was void of any early speed and trailed, continued to see the field while finding his legs running on the turn,
angled out widest to the six path for the run to the wire and put in a strong closing rush to get up and capture third. HALF TO RELOAD had a good trip
tracking the four leaders battling up front on the turn, found a seam entering the stretch in the four path and ran on with late energy to get involved the final
eighth settling for a minor share. SMART SKY watched the frontrunners contest while sitting behind waiting on the rail for a seam on the turn, saved ground
at the top of the lane and picked up the pieces passing tired runners in the stretch. CONFUSING stalked inside situated near the back of the field early on,
could not gain on fellow rivals racing on the turn and was never a factor in the drive to the wire. HIGHLAND LIFE engaged for the lead three wide in
between horses down the backside, contested for the front end through the turn, was the first to give way in the four horse battle at the quarter pole and
retreated in the six path through the stretch. PUDDINGONTHERITZ was on the rail in a four way battle up front for the lead, battled on the turn continuing to
fight off outside foes, gave way at the top of the lane inside and faltered in the final sixteenth. POSTURING settled near the back on the rail in the beginning,
put in a brief rally midpoint on the turn outside foes until the top of the stretch then faded outside at the furlong marker.
