Footnotes
BIG BROWN SHOES moved clear under rating, repelled a rival at the quarter pole then drew away under urging and was geared down late. JOVIAL lacked
speed, advanced wide on the turn and was up for place late. MISS YOU AJAX raced close up between rivals, angled inside in the lane and closed well.
CLASSY UNION lagged far behind then offered some late energy while no threat. BRODY'S WAR prompted the pace along the inside then proved empty in
the stretch. THE COLORA KID chased behind wall of pacesetters and lacked a rally. FIELD OFFICER dropped well behind then passed fading rivals.
PRIMORDIAL FEAR forced the pace outside to the stretch and gave way. HEATED BATTLE flashed speed in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.
TRIPLE AMERICANO trailed early and was always far behind. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE was outrun throughout and gave way readily.

between rivals, rallied mildly and was outkicked for third. PEYTON'S COLLEGE raced off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, then finished evenly

clear early lead, dueled into the stretch and faded. GOD STILL LOVES ME chased on the inside and tired. BELLA MARIA raced off the rail, off the pace and

LUNA T lacked speed, advanced wide on the turn, rallied very wide into the stretch and surged clear late. BACK TO D' FUTURE alternated for the lead
along the rail, bid clear in midstretch then weakened. BLANCHIMENT prompted the pace four wide and continued willingly through the stretch. AZTEC
QUEEN dropped far back then narrowed the gap without menacing. BIONIC KAT dueled outside, led at the quarter pole and proved empty in the final
furlong. BAHAMIAN SKY settled just off the dueling leaders three wide and gave way. UPTOWN CHARLOTTE was urged close up, moved inside on the
turn and stopped.

edged away, driving. BOCA ROYALTY trailed the field, moved up at the quarter pole, came wide into the stretch, made a late run outside and was gaining
at the end. SIZZLING ROMA raced off the pace with an inside trip, rallied on the rail in the stretch run and earned the show spot. WORLD GONE WILD

wide, came three wide into the lane, made a mild bid and flattened out. ANGINETTI raced off the pace, inside on the turn and failed to threaten. MRS.
CREWS chased close up along the rail, chased on the turn and faded. SOUTHERN CENTS raced off the pace, between rivals on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
FRENCH TOAST pulled clear in the opening quarter, widened in the stretch and stayed safe under a drive. ANGELUS WARRIOR lacked speed, advanced
inside through the stretch with late energy. SPEIGHTSTER RED went after the pacesetter into the far turn and finished willingly. DECKOLOGY settled off
the pace inside and lacked a rally. HENRYTHETHIRD trailed early, moved very wide into the stretch passing foes. SOCIAL GROUP prompted the pace
outside for five furlongs and gave way. MY TRAIN broke a bit sluggishly, moved up outside before half a mile then faded. LAVERY lagged far behind and
was never in contention. KITH forced the pace briefly inside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BABY GUNDIN raced two wide off the pace, made an early move into contention at the half mile marker, dueled on the far turn, took over entering the
stretch and drew clear under urging. R TENDERONI raced off the pace, then chased on the inside, came three wide into the lane and rallied for second.
MOONCHILD set the pace racing with a clear early lead, was pressed by BABY GUNDIN past the half mile marker, dueled with that rival on the far turn,
yielded, dug in through the lane and weakened late. WONDER CITY stalked the pace, then chased two wide, chased the leaders on the far turn and tired.
TIZ A SHARPIE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. FRAME THIS was outrun early, advanced on the far turn and did
not factor. CAJUN COUSIN raced three wide early, chased outside and gave way.

Footnotes
LOVERBOY LOU stalked outside early on, tracked four wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed steadily and finished well in deep stretch
for the win. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN raced two wide off the pace, angled out entering the stretch, closed well late outside and was just up for second at the
wire. JUPI'S LIGHTNING vied three wide early on, dueled between rivals on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and lost second at the wire.
REJECTED AGAIN was bumped at the start, chased close up four wide early, dueled three wide on the turn, dug in and weakened late. DRENA'S BULLET
raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out and closed belatedly. STRONG BREEZE vied inside for the early lead, briefly shook
clear, dueled inside on the turn and weakened in the lane. MANAHAWKIN trailed the field, saved ground entering the stretch and passed tired rivals.
SPLITZVILLE raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. ONE SLICK START was bumped at the start, tracked close up on the inside,
chased on the turn and faded. READY AND RICH raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CUNEO vied two wide for the early lead, then chased
inside and gave way.
