Footnotes
LUNA TUNA led in the four path thru the opening quarter but settled to allow an inner foe to take over midway down the backside. rebid into the turn and
took the lead while shifting to the two path approaching the three-eighths pole, was roused midway around the turn, opened up from the two path into the
stretch, and was driven clear. A J'S MEMORY stalked in the five path, was coaxed while tipping in to the three path into the turn, was in the four path
entering the lane, and chased home the winner for place. TINKATWO brushed with an outer foe at the start, vied for the lead in the two path and held a
narrow advantage from midway down the backside to into the turn, lost the lead to the outer eventual winner while along the rail nearing the three-eighths
pole, was cued right handed midway around the turn and tipped out to the two path into the stretch, but evened out for show. HIDDEN ROAD rated in the
five path, was ridden around the turn and floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. KAREN'S HONOR chased in the six path but was
tired turning into the lane. LA DAME DE FER was behind along the rail early and never threatened around the three path in the stretch. FAR ABOVE
brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path but was no menace around the five path down the lane.

CAPTURETHELAUGHTER dueled for the lead inside of an outer foe just off the rail into the turn, was shaken up passing the quarter and took command
along the inside into the stretch, and held off a pair of closing outer rivals under left handed urging in the final furlong to get the win. GREENPOINT
prompted the leading duo in the four path, ranged up in the three path passing the quarter pole, floated out to the six path into the lane, ran on for place, but
was out of time to get up for the win. BEGANINGREENPOINT got bumped by an inner foe at the start and chased in the three path, was in the two path
rounding the turn, received right handed cues while angling out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. SHARP PLAY BOY broke inwards
at the start and trailed in the four path, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. BLUE LIEUTENANT broke out and bumped an outer
foe, dueled for the lead in the two path, stuck a head in front under rousing passing the quarter, but faded around the three path in the stretch.

CUPID'S DART pressed the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, drifted out late. and dug in inside of a
trio to prevail. TAPIT BRIO saved ground in range around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, vied three wide and
just missed. THE PENINSULA raced off the pace three wide, tipped further out in upper stretch, could only gain slightly while continuing on the left, finally
switched leaving the sixteenth pole, surged late and just missed. I AM THE GAME set the pace along the rail, drifted into the two wide in upper stretch,
battled on between the top two finishers to deep stretch and checked when in tight in very deep stretch. TAPATERM failed to menace while racing two wide.
SEBARAY was soundly bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. JEST ABOVE
broke outwardly and bumped SEBARAY at the start, chased the pace two and three wide and faded through the lane. LOVE ME ARCHIE played no factor
while racing two wide. LEGEND broke outwardly, stalked the pace three and four wide, drifted further out near the quarter pole and retreated. COLONEL
JACKSON was outrun inside. THE RIDER OF I AM THE GAME CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BOTH OF THE TOP FINISHERS FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH BUT THE STEWARDS DIALLOWED IT AFTER RULING THAT THE INCIDENT OCCURED TOO LATE TO HAVE
ANY IMPACT ON THE FINISHING ORDER.

Footnotes
GRAN ANDREWS rated in the two path, was under coaxing around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the lane, rallied down the center, and drew
past a pair of inner foes late to win. STRASBOURG raced prominently up close in the four path and was roused from the three path early into the turn,
tipped out to the five path under right handed urging into the stretch, and ran on for place. APPRAISAL set the pace in the three path, was roused from the
two path early around the turn, tipped back out to the three path into the stretch, stayed on but drifted out slightly into the final furlong under left handed
urging, and yielded late to show. ASTROTURF tracked in the three path, was coaxed between foes midway around the turn and under urging while shifting
out to the five path into the lane, but flattened out. MOPED DENNIS raced off the pace in the five path but was no factor around the six path in the stretch.
POWER (BRZ) was well behind in the six path and never threatened. SIR KAHN stalked along the inside but backed up around the turn.

SAPPHIRE STAR dueled two wide for a half and drew off under a drive. CECILIA'S WINGS settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide
nearing the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch, was clearly second best in the lane and was vanned off. MYSTIFY pressed the
pace three wide, reached even terms outside of the winner near the five-sixteenths pole but tired in upper stretch. HOW BOUT DAT raced off the pace four
wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a closing bid. A KISS FOR KHOZAN chased the pace two wide came up empty in the lane. JACKIE'S
SPIRIT vied at the rail and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ENGLISH PAINTER trailed around the two path into the backstretch, was nudged along the rail rounding the far turn, angled out to the three path under left
handed urging in upper stretch, and rallied to get up for the win in final strides. SWAN LAKE set the pace inside, was cued right handed midway around the
far turn and opened up into the lane, stayed on under steady encouragement, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. SENDERO rated in the five path,
was under coaxing around the far turn and still in the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on to get up for show. CALYCANTHUS tracked in the two
path, was ridden around the far turn and tipped out to the three path into the stretch, but was one paced. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY was held up between
foes in the four path, tipped in to the two path and was roused midway around the far turn, received a right handed cue while going back out to the four path
into the stretch, but flattened. WINE EMPIRE prompted the pace under a hold in the three path, was under coaxing into the far turn, but faded between foes
turning into the lane. PRUDENCIO stalked in the five path but was empty turning into the stretch.

HEALS THE SOUL stalked the pace three wide, took over turning for home and drove clear. UBIQUITOUS settled off the pace while racing three wide and
ran on to gain the place. HIGH PRESS broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace three wide and rallied for the show. URANIUM chased the pace two wide
and lacked the needed rally. MILITARY DRILL saved ground off the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. SMOKY BLUES
saved ground and failed to menace. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT set the pace along the rail and tired in the stretch.

GANGLY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, ranged up in the five path and bid midway around the turn, took the lead while in
the six path at the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. SENSEI LAWRENCE stalked in the three path, was roused between foes in the four
path around the turn, briefly led nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken by an outer foe while in the four path at the top of the stretch, chased home the
winner, evened out late, but held place. HIGH YIELD KITTEN bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the four path, received a right handed cue in
the five path rounding the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. MADDY'S DREAM set the pace in the two path
into the turn but yielded into the stretch. POUNCIVAL had a slow start and trailed in the five path, was coaxed while shifting to the rail early around the turn,
but never threatened from out in the center down the lane. KING CAB hopped a shadow just after the start, then appeared to do so again near the
five-eighths pole, chased along the inside, bid between foes in the two path around the turn, but was empty from the five path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
DEVILS ONLY FRIEND bumped with GHOST COAST soon after the start, dueled along the rail for six furlongs, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted out late
and held clear. GHOST COAST bumped with the winner soon after the start, settled in range inside, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled three
wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. INTERSTELLAR broke outwardly and bumped CHANGEORDERSONNY at the start, dueled outside of the
winner to upper stretch and kept on well enough for the show. MUTAAWID trailed inside for a half, went three wide around the far turn, swung widest in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly. IMPOSTER SYNDROME chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. LOOKIN FOR ROSES was outrun inside.
LAWFUL failed to menace while racing three and four wide. PHOBIA hit the starting gate, raced three wide and never threatened. FORTHELOVEOFART
was outrun inside. SMOOTH MOTION was reluctant to load, chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. CHANGEORDERSONNY was
bumped at the start and had only brief speed three wide. MACLIN was outrun inside.
