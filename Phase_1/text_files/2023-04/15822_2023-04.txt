under a drive while failing to make up ground along the inside. VULCAN away well, had a wide path, lugged out three lanes early, asked right handed in an
attempt to straighten out, kept lugging out, wrapped up while continuing to drift out. BELIA broke out and bumped rival at the start, drifted out and was
corrected, lost a bit of momentum, angled out from lugging out rival and not asked while drifting out to the wire. JESS FIESTY bumped from both sides at
the start, lugged out three paths early, began to get green when urged, and shifted out late in a very green effort. DALTON DM bumped out at the start, took
up when rival lugged out and was saved thereafter.

MIDNIGHT RYDE scrambled in at the start, quickly took command and kept under a strong drive while proving best. FANCY POLLITICS broke in and
bumped at the start, kept to task under urging in a solid effort outside. EDDINGTON came in and bumped at the start, floated in a bit early, kept to task
under urging in a good try. JAMAICA LIGHTS rubbed gate leaving, came in at the start, lugged in passing the gap, and kept to task under a hand ride to the
wire. GAMBLING LADY bumped and floated in start, bit hesitant when rivals drifted in passing the gap, asked midway and failed to respond. WARRIOR
SOUL bit slow, came in at the start, was a bit green and ridden cautiously to the wire. VAL PARRAS lifted and bumped at the start, drifted out and saved
thereafter.
