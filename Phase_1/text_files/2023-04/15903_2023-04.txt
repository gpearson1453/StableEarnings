Footnotes
RAFAEL'S SURPRISE pressed the early leader from the outside of foe and edged clear late under strong pressure. WATFORD raced mid pack early,
moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and rallied gamely to the wire to narrowly secure place position. GOLDEN CARACAL chased the early
going, raced four deep in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. JON L was quick to begin to set the pace, dropped back nearing the far turn, came on
again from the inside, checked just past the sixteenth pole over fallen rival and kept on willingly late. CLUE raced near the inside around the far turn, angled
out and had no late rally. QUANTUM BULL dropped back early, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. WHO'S ON THE RUN raced five wide around the
first turn, raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch to experience a wide trip with no late response. GONE PROSPECTING showed
good early speed, had a clear lead at the eighth pole, was injured and had to be vanned off.

SIZZLING EVENING pressed the early leader from the outside, dug in and just got up under all out pressure. MR GOLD MAN vied for the early lead
between early and kept on gamely to the wire to just miss. SILVERWIND vied for the early lead from the inside of foes and kept on while racing three to four
wide. NOT THAT SERIOUS lost his whip near the three eighths pole, moved up from the far outside and closed in too late. FOLLOW THE FACTS chased
early on while racing three deep and raced evenly with no closing run racing five wide. PIRATE JUNCTION broke awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of
ground at the start, moved up five wide but was never a factor. CAIRO KING hustled throughout, raced four to five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid.
MR. SILVER EXPRESS was hustled from the outside, swung wide into the upper stretch and was empty. FIGHT ME void of speed, raced five wide and had
no response. JAZZ MAN DO raced three to four wide and never was a factor.

DIABOLICAL FIRE dueled from the outside of foe, drifted out sharply through the upper stretch, lost his whip in the upper lane and edged clear under a
strong hand ride. HENNESSY LOOKER RF dueled for the early lead from the inside of foe and finished second best. ARTFUL CRITIC bumped, checked
around the first turn, stalked the top pair and kept on to the wire. GRIFTER chased the pace from the outside, raced evenly with no closing run. DAN WHO
dropped back early, raced near the inside and never was a factor. SHAME ON ROOSTER was coaxed along from the outside and faded. MAXIMUM BULL
stumbled at the break, raced from the outside in the lane and never menaced.

PASSION BELLE tracked the early leader from the outside and finished strongly through the far turn into the stretch to be well clear under steady pressure.
CATTY DOM settled off the early going, raced near the inside past the three sixteenths pole, angled out and finished second best. EVIL TEMPTATION was
sent clear from the outside, met bid near the five sixteenths pole and weakened the in the drive. BERNICE WHO stalked the pace along the inside and had
no late response. LA DIAMANT raced mid pack early on, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. RELEASE THE GENIE chased
three deep and was empty in the drive. WILEO PROCEED checked at the start, lost ground and was eased up on through the stretch drive. KELL'S KISS
trailed, was eased and walked off the track under her own power.
