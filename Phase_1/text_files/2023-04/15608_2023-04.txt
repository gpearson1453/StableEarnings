PRINCE MARCO set a pressured pace inside, bumped with rival at the top of the lane and continued gamely to edge clear late. WINDSOR GOLD pressed
the winner throughout, bumped with that foe at the top of the stretch then was outfinished. SHPILKES settled just off the leaders and faltered on the final
turn. MAXIMUS AURELIUS advanced briefly closer inside then proved empty. DUBROVNIK dropped well behind and was always outrun. CORKY'S CAUSE
stalked the dueling pacesetters, bore out badly on the final turn, was eased and subsequently vanned off.. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the
stretch run and the rider of the runner-up claimed foul against the winner but there was no change in the order of finish.

Footnotes
UNIFIED ALLIANCE set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the turn, responded when asked, drew off under some urging then was in hand the final
hundred yards. HOP ON ME steadied at the start, tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail and earned the place spot. GOLD MEDAL
ANNA trailed the field, advanced at the quarter pole, came wide and rallied mildly. BET OF THE CENTURY stalked three wide, chased three wide on the
turn and weakened. CAN'T COMPLAIN stalked between rivals, chased between foes on the turn and tired. LADY SICARIA raced four wide early, settled off
the rail, off the pace, chased on the turn and failed to threaten. VIOLENT WONDER hopped at the start, pulled between rivals in the early stages, dropped
over to the rail, chased and faded.

Footnotes
EARLY EDITION alternated for the lead inside, shook off that rival and drew away under urging. FLASHING DIAMOND vied outside the winner to the
stretch, continued willingly and was no match for the winner. LANFRANKOPHILE saved ground close up then flattened out through the stretch. PEYTON
ELIZABETH raced off the leaders outside, faded on the turn and offered a mild bid. HALO CITY lagged far behind then offered some late energy along the
rail. CASTILLEJA stalked the dueling leaders for half a mile and faded. EIGHT DANZAS lacked speed wide and was never a factor.

ALLEVARE vied two wide for the lead, dueled into the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in the stretch run and was kept to the task.
COBBLE ROAD stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and held for
second. VASARIANO stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, rallied outside and dug in gamely to the finish. RON DON SCORESE pulled along the
rail entering the first turn, then tracked on the inside, chased, came two wide into the lane, angled out and finished evenly. NAUTILUS steadied after the
start, steadied again entering the first turn, settled off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RUBY BLEU set the pace on the
inside, vied on the backside, dueled and faded. SENIOR INVESTMENT raced four wide on the clubhouse turn, then three wide off the pace, moved to the
inside and failed to threaten. JACK A ROSE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. STYNER raced off the rail, off the pace and gave way.
