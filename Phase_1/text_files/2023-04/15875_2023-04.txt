Footnotes
ELMO'S SECRET outrun in the early going, began to move far turn, continued to advanced after splitting rivals late in that bend, moved closer to the inside
for drive, up in time. CEE MINUS forwardly placed first turn toward the inside, fell back a bit in the run up the backstretch, moved out, began to advance four
wide far turn, took over, clear until late, caught late while outside the winner. LEXINGTON DIAMOND off a step slow, advanced to mid pack while three wide
first turn, continued three wide into the far turn, advanced and briefly challenged the runner up into the lane, could not keep up with that one the final furlong
nor contain the winner, comfortably finished best of the rest. MISS ARKANSAS also raced in the main body first turn while four wide, still four wide into the
far turn, three wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. I GOT A NAME broke on top, narrowly showed the way under
pressure along the inside first turn, shook clear in the run up the backstretch, faltered when confronted in the second bend. TIZ SWEET CANDY broke back,
got out into the first turn, was never dangerous. MOMMA MULE void of speed while four wide into the first turn, steered out when making a mild advance
three wide second, made little impact through the stretch. MRS. MACOMBER in the second flight early, tired while racing off the inside. NAUGHTY MADAM
broke up, pressured the pace through the first turn, got out onto the backstretch, stopped stretch. NELLY LARKIN raced back, gave way second turn, pulled
up stretch, walked in.

Footnotes
DISTORTED SECRETS forwardly placed while off the inside into the turn, asked along while angling out slightly to be three wide turning into the stretch,
was not making any progress on the winner past the furlong marker while drifting slightly, late surge outside, up in time. EMERALD PRINCESS dueled up
front in the two path, disposed of the other speed to be clear into the stretch, continued to maintain daylight past the furlong marker, could not contain the
winner, clearly second best. GP'S AMAZING GRACE void of speed, came in the two path for the drive, rallied to earn the show, not a threat to the top two.
DORITA'S HEART moved up to become a pace factor along the inside, dueled into the turn, began to gradually weaken late in that bend and through the
stretch. ROYAL BONUS last to leave, lacked speed out in the strip, floated out by BURNADEBT turning for home to be five wide, passed tiring rivals.
CRYSTAL CRESCENT in mid pack and in the two path, failed to respond when called on for the drive. BURNADEBT lacked speed off the inside, angled
four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick as well. KEWPIE DOLL within striking distance while racing outside, four wide into the stretch, backed up in the
run to the wire.

BLOW TORCH forwardly placed while racing outside, floated out four wide into the lane, bid past the furlong marker, kicked clear. SISAWAY NOW in the
second flight while along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, determined for the place.
ATRAS broke on top, quickly sprinted well clear, continued to show the way through the turn, offered little resistance to the winner the final furlong,
outkicked late for the second spot. TITLE SHOT void of speed along the inside, continued to save ground turn,slipped through a narrow opening along the
rail to improve position. SAINT PIO prompted the pace while off the inside and between horses into the turn, angled out three wide turning for home to float
out the winner, could not match that one in the run past the furlong marker, came up empty late to lose a couple of positions. DRIFTER back off the early
pace, came three wide for the drive, failed to rally. MARK THE MOOSE in tight to be away slowly, lacked speed and never menaced while four wide into
lane. WESLEYAN fell back to trail after the start and was always outrun. YACHT ROCK (IRE) in mid pack for a half, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAPNEL forwardly placed in the two path up the backstretch and into the turn, steered out to be three wide into the lane, outside bid past the furlong
marker, drove clear. ROTARY DIAL back off the pace in the two path, three wide turning into the stretch, rallied outside and finished willingly to be up for the
place. CITRUS BAY prompted the pace while in the three path, continued to prompt the issue into the lane, bid between foes and inside the winner past the
furlong marker, could not match that one to the wire, caught late for the place. STELLAR TAP lacked speed out in the strip, came four wide for the drive,
mild late interest to improve position. MATTS FIRE N ICE broke alertly, cleared early in showing the way up the backstretch, held a slight advantage into the
stretch, weakened when headed in upper stretch. BACK BEAT dwelt at the break to show the field a couple of lengths, failed to menace. ACEHIGH ROYAL
chased the early leader along the inside, gave way in traffic turning for home. ST ANDREWS off a step slow, fell further and further back, well beaten,
jogged in.

Footnotes
THE GIRL IN RED used a bit to maintain early position toward the rail, showed the way into and through the turn in the two path, drew out steadily through
the lane under steady handling. KOKOMO STARLET pressed the winner from the outside for a half, chased into the lane, could not keep up in the run to the
wire, all out to save the place. CASHMERE BABY void of early foot, came five to six wide out of the turn while between horses, rallied while remaining well
out in the strip to be getting to the runner up. DELTA MOON in mid pack while racing three wide, improved into the lane, flattened out in the late going to be
caught for the show. RUNNINTHESTREETS fell back to near the back after the start, continued to lack speed into the turn, angled out five wide and
between foes into the lane, improved position. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, improved while not a
serious threat. ICONIC BONNET in the second flight three wide, steered inside, weakened in the drive. SHUTUP PLEASE off slowly, passed tiring rivals
while never a threat. MAGNOLIA MAE saved ground, in some traffic late in the turn, lacked a closing kick when clear for the drive. GRANDMA BELLE broke
near the back, steadied early, closer four wide early turn, had little left for the drive. BONNIE LASS lacked speed, seven wide into the stretch, tired. ZONGS
IRISH FROST in the second flight two path, dropped inside, stopped.

Footnotes
JUILLIARD broke out to bump DARK AFTERNOON, tracked behind the pace along the inside, bit closer in traffic late in the turn, got through along the
inside to challenge nearing the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, gained nod. MISSIN CURFEW moved up to show the way up the backstretch, continued
to set pace turn just off the inside, allowed the winner the inside once straightened for home, responded when confronted, dueled to the wire, dug in late to
narrowly miss in a game. BOLT ABOVE last away, raced back early, four to five wide when improving into the lane, continued to advance to be clear of the
others at the wire, no threat to the top two. COMMERCE COMET within striking distance outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, came up empty
for the stretch run. DARK AFTERNOON bumped break, was straightened, pressed the runner up from the outside, between foes into the lane, began to
weaken soon after. RUNTODAY broke back, saved ground through the turn, was never dangerous down the lane. CACTUS lacked speed, four wide
through the turn, failed to muster a bid. DIXIE FURY in mid pack while three wide early, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
SEASIDE BOY raced back off the pace and the inside, advanced four wide through the second turn, continued to rally through the lane, up in time outside.
LITTLE FRAPPUCINO took control soon after the start off the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch, shrugged off a foe into the lane to be
clear again past the furlong marker, responded when the winner challenged late and proved stubborn to the wire. ROUNDER forwardly placed while four
wide into the first turn, remained within striking distance second bend, came up empty in lacking a closing response late. BACKGATE RED back off the
pace, raced three to four wide into the stretch, improved slightly with some mild late interest. POINT BLANK bumped with COLE SPUR at the break, three to
four wide first turn, moved closer three wide in the second turn, flattened out through the stretch. MYSTIFIER pressed the runner up early from along the
inside, weakened after five furlongs. COLE SPUR bumped at the break, settled off the pace and the inside, was also finished early. OUT OF ALCATRAZ
was never a factor.

SHEZZ KOLDAZICE pressed the early leader from the outside, moved to challenge in the second turn, bit, put a head in front into the stretch, in turn was
headed by the runner up nearing the furlong marker, battled back in game fashion to prevail. JUBELLA moved out to to be four wide midway on the first
turn, stalked up the backstretch, ranged up three wide to challenge into the lane, gained a slight advantage with a furlong remaining, outkicked in the run to
the wire. MARINA'S GOLD broke on top, narrowly set the pace along the inside, briefly responded when confronted by the winner into the stretch then could
not match that one or the runner up the final furlong, narrowly saved the show. I FEEL THE NEED last to leave, trailed for over a half, angled three wide late
in the final turn then beginning to advance, staged a belated rally to be gaining for the show late. LADY COMMANDER pulled when forwardly placed behind
the leader first turn, fell back in traffic onto the backstretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. JUDY'S WAY void of speed, four to five
wide first turn, angled in, remained back. MEDLEY pressed the issue early, began to give way after a half. SQUILLIONS in mid pack early, gave way, was
eased in the second turn, vanned off.

GO WEST broke alertly, helped set a hot pace closest to the inside, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, slight drift, kept to task, enough
left. RUGGS closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, came four wide for the drive, slowly getting to the winner, clear for the place. FULL AUTHORITY
settled inside early, two path into the lane, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the top two. DOCTOR OSCAR away in good order, dueled up front
outside the winner through those glib fractions, first to blink upper stretch, continued to weakened. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS off a step slow, saved ground
through the turn, made little impact in the drive. DEFLATER off a step slow, not a rally.

Footnotes
TAILORBESWIFT away in good order, came in to tighten up and bother a couple of inner rivals when attempting to clear a furlong in, did clear into the turn,
breather, maintained daylight through the lane under steady handling. HISSY MISSY with the forward flight early, was put in tight and forced to check when
TAILORBESWIFT came in five furlongs out, altered course outward, three wide through the turn, set down for the drive and finished up willingly to be up for
the second spot while between rivals at the wire. TIGER BAIT forwardly placed outside up the backstretch, raced in the second flight in the three path turn,
chased the leader past the furlong marker, lacked a late punch to be caught for the second position at the wire. LADY ASTRID broke in the air to be last
away, void of speed for a half, swung out five wide turning for home, finished willingly to improve position. TAPIT RIGHT within striking distance while racing
off the inside, between horses through the second flight in the turn, also lacked a winning kick late. MY DAMS ATITUDE in the lead pack inside the winner,
was floated into MISSY HISSY when TAILORBESWIFT came in with five furlongs remaining, fell back a bit, off the inside through the turn, went evenly
through the lane. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL in mid pack outside, four to five wide through the turn, also went one paced down the lane. FIVE QUEENS in
the second flight along the inside, began to fade before a half. BLOW SUM SMOKE did not menace in remaining back. MARY ALICE in mid pack while
raced outside, four wide into the lane, tired. TWENTYTWENTYREDO off a step slow, raced back and failed to menace. WARM BEAUTY raced always back
while four to five wide. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER
OF HISSY MISSY AGAINST TAILORBESWIFT FOR EARLY INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SIXTH.
