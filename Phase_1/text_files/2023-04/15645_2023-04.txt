around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and chased the winner home from there while drifting mildly late. BONNIE SANDRA raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside early, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position in the lane. KEEP ON ROCKIN tracked the leaders between horses up the
backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path and faded in the stretch. IRISH VICTORY led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail

around the turn and gained ground late. HE'S CONNECTED raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the bend and improved position in the lane. CATATUMBO LIGHTNIN chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. PIDIN led the way up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and tired from there.

stretch and bumped with TEE AT ONE in the process, dug in from there and was caught late. OSKAR MARTINEZ (IRE) raced in the three path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path, raced into traffic and was brushed by TEE AT
ONE when that rival was forced out in upper stretch and kept on the wire but was outfinished late. JOHNSON raced in the two path early, tracked the leader
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. OUT OF DEDUCTIONS raced off the pace on the
