into upper stretch, issued a challenge for command nearing the final furlong, knocked heads with the runner up before seizing the front seventy yards from
home, then dug in to to the finish kept to task. WEST STAR vied briefly from the three path outside a pair before emerging to prompt and then duel with
BEAR'S CORRECT, took over command seven-sixteenths from home and tucked to the two path midway on the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under growing threat to the outside, dug in stubbornly clinging to the front until displaced seventy
yards from home and was along well clear of the rest and second best. CONNECT THE BROCKS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. POT OF GOLD chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. IMPULSIVE SPENDING bobbled at the start and recovered to vie early
on inside a pair before being shaken off a bit, gave chase along the rail into and through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and faltered. BEAR'S CORRECT vied early on from the two path between foes before dueling with WEST STAR, had that rival take
over and was shaken off when put to urging three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide in retreat at the quarter pole and folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT FUDGE broke out then showed good speed from the outside, went to the front while still well out in the track, angled in near the five-eighths, was
asked under threat in the two path early on the turn, moved to the three path under pressure later on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch, came under
a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, fought off the runner-up under the crop to near the sixteenth-pole and held gamely under a strong hand-ride
from that point to the wire. PHAROAH'S HEART stumbled at the start and was last to commence, moved up then was taken in hand while behind the
leader, dropped in passing the three-quarter pole then moved back out when the leader crossed in front around the five-eighths, gained to make a bid at the
nine-sixteenths, was asked while vying outside in the three then four path around the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, battled outside the winner
under a right-handed crop, fought on under a strong hand-ride in the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. HONEY MONEY was
steered out sharply early then tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four then five path around the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch,
pursued the top two while outside in the drive and was out-kicked while clear for the show. MOVIE MOXY was coaxed along off the pace, saved grounder
under stronger encouragement around the turn and lacked the needed response. I'M BUZZY was urged along at the rear while off the inside, went two to
three wide around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
EVVIE JETS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under lone threat and held stubborn to the finish rebuffing the challenge to the wire. WHITEBEAM (GB) just off the inside tracking the front from just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong
but was repelled to the finish. RUNAWAY RUMOUR just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to preserve the show honors. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) tracked the pace along
the inside at the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on one paced through to the end.
MALAVATH (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until placed to tepid light hand urges near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SECURITY CODE brushed with a foe after the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four to five wide around the turn, gained to make a bid in the
seven path into upper stretch, took the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in some outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady
urging. FANCY JOKE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path around the turn, gained a brief lead at the three-sixteenths then lost the
advantage to the winner, fought with that foe until near the sixteenth-pole then proved no match while clear for the place. I'MHAVINGAMOMENT was well
placed just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened while best of the rest. MAJESTIC
RETURN came outward early while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied under urging in the two to three path on the turn, lost
the advantage while floating five wide into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. STARRY MIDNIGHT settled under some urging, went
three to four wide around the turn and came up empty. LADY MINE broke a bit slow then dropped back, angled in at the rear, advanced closer under urging
with five furlongs to run, saved ground around the turn and had nothing left. JOEYBIGNOSE brushed with a foe after the start, was coaxed at the rear then
dropped well behind, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.

foe overhauling the leader with seventy yards to the finish, fought gamely to the end but was ultimately denied on the wire. LIANA B showed the way in hand

the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. YUKON coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride
from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, offered no response. SHARP PIPPA chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,

outside of the favorite on the turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, drew away under one pop of a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, was
given another pop of a left-handed crop while widening outside the sixteenth-pole then was geared down in the final sixteenth while much the best.
CURLIN'S WISDOM showed speed on the outside, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, was urged four wide around the turn, kept on in the
stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. CHESTERTOWN moved out then settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the place while able to get the show. STAGE RAIDER showed speed then attended the pace,
vied in the two path under urging on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole then shifted three wide into the stretch and capitulated. KOOLHAUS
settled towards the back, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond. MARKET ALERT was coaxed to the front, showed the way while inside of
foes, lost the advantage near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
SELL SOMETHING just off the inside through the first turn, settled three wide in pursuit leading the main flight behind a duel and one lone tracker, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and the field took closer order on the once prominent gap duelers, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied in
tandem with the runner up to overthrow the embattled top pair inside the eighth pole, seized sole command a sixteenth out, then edged away to the finish
kept busy to the wire. KINGFISH STEVENS three then two wide through the first turn, chased the duel three wide isolated between that pair of foes and the
main body of the field in behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch taking first run at the embattled pace duo,
dug in collaring them just inside the eighth pole already under threat to the outside, got caught himself a sixteenth from home and ran on to safely preserve
the place honors. ROYAL SPIRIT three wide through the opening bend, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to procure the show
honors. BRICCO chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled three wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. SMOKE AND
HEAT chased three then two wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. BIG VENEZUELA
went two then three wide through the first turn as his main pace rival floated him out briefly, dueled from the two path with LORD GATLING to his inside
widening away from the rest as a pair, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in continuing to engage in head to head combat when overhauled in concert with his main foe just inside the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish.
LORD GATLING dueled inside of the aforementioned foe floating to the two path and carrying him out three wide briefly midway on the first turn, knocked
heads widening away from the rest down the backstretch and into the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in yielding just inside the eighth pole in tandem with his embattled rival and weakened to the end. MO REWARDS chased just off the
inside until tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and came up empty. STRONG
LIGHT chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, made no impact. MACH ONE bobbled at the break,
recovered to be rank off heels of a rival past the stands the first time before settling briefly into the turn, grew rank under restraint three wide through that
bend before settling four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths three wide, swung five wide for home
and made no impact.

Footnotes
LADY MILAGRO went to the front then sped clear, remained clear in the two path through the turn, had her advantage shorten into upper stretch, swapped
to the proper lead inside the three-sixteenths, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drifted out inside that marker then was switched to
a left-handed crop, drifted out a bit more while desperate and just held on the wire. GAL IN A RUSH settled near the middle of the field, was roused three
then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed crop, had the rider lose the crop while attempting to switch it
to his left-hand just inside the furlong marker, closed fast to get alongside the winner in the final sixteenth, came in a bit late and just missed while able to
get the place. ANNA KARENINE (FR) bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the front, was asked in the two path on the turn, angled out in pursuit
of the leader in upper stretch, chased that foe determinedly into the final sixteenth, was passed by the runner-up on the outside late then taken up in tight
quarters nearing wire and was clear for the show. PALACE GOSSIP followed the solo leader from second, was urged along in the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch while getting closer to the front-runner, pursued the vanguard under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick.
WINGS LIKE EAGLES bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with that same opponent near the five-eighths, tugged hard at the bit while keen under
restraint near the nine-sixteenths, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved position.
FONTANAFREDDA tossed her head at the start but broke with the field, was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was driven
three wide into the stretch, made light contact with a foe inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE settled on the
outside, traveled three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made light contact with a foe in upper stretch and also lacked the needed
response. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. RESPECTFULLY was urged early then taken in hand against the rail, saved ground while taken up multiple times on the turn and failed to
respond. KITTEN'S APPEAL broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. HEY THERE bumped with foes on both
sides at the start, bumped with a rival near the five-eighths, tossed her head while rank under tight restraint behind horses near the nine-sixteenths, tossed
her head several times while dropping back three wide on the turn and faltered. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF ANNA KARENINE
REQUESTED A HOLD ON THE RACE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

EVER GRACEFUL coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, dug in
under a drive rallying to take command seventy yards from home, then dug in holding safe to the finish under late threat. LA CHANCE coaxed from the start,
chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and closed well to latch on the winner as she hit the wire. TUMBLES
brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to the finish. STORMY'S IN STYLE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, had first run at the leader
through the stretch and was heads apart for the front when the eventual winner took over seventy yards from home, ran on to preserve the last major share.
MRS BELL chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish but was outkicked. GEORGIE'S LADIES broke in at the start, prompted the leader from the outside in the four
path down the backstretch before advancing tucked to the two path into the turn, took over command with seven-sixteenths to go, shook away and took the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught seventy yards from home and weakened in the late stages. BUSTINROXY hustled from
the gate, showed the way early on from the two path under some pressure to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and yielded the front at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. GRACE IN MOTION chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just
off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no headway. MADAME ROSE got off in a
tangle bucking at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, angled in and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off.
