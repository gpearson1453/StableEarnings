Footnotes
V K STAR never far back, lacked racing room behind rivals past the furlong marker, altered course four wide at the sixteenth pole, surged under left handed
urging and got up in the final strides. MARIMBA vied for the lead three wide into the stretch, dug in late and just missed. LOTTA MOSCATO battled for the
lead two wide into the turn, gained a narrow advantage, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished in a game effort. V K PRINCESS trailed into the
stretch and had a mild late rally in the five path. HOPS PETUNIA battled for the lead along the rail into the stretch and faded late. OLIVIA'S JOY failed to
menace. DAYS REMEMBERED close up early four wide, failed to respond. THE RIDER OF MARIMBA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF V K START FOR ALLEGED INTEFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

BELIEVING made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, responded under right handed urging and finished full of run to win going away. TIME FOR
CUPID stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in late in the four path and got up for second. YEARS AGO rushed up along the inside soon after the start to
pressure the winner briefly, shifted out to the five path near the half mile pole, chased the pace into the stretch, dropped back towards the rail and was
outfinished for second. TALK DIRTY close up from the start, swung wide and finished evenly. HALOFIED failed to menace. SKY trailed.

SQUID stalked the early pace, responded readily when set down, rallied three wide under right handed urging to make the lead near mid stretch and drew
clear. FLOWZANO pressed the early pace two wide, gained a narrow lead, set the pace until mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner but gamely held on
for second. POLISHED GEM broke in front, set the early pace along the inside, gave up a narrow advantage, prompted the pace the balance of the trip and
was outfinished. SOMUCHSUGAR never far back, finished with good courage four wide. MON PARADIS trailed into the stretch and found her best stride
late three wide. RAINBOW SHIP vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch and faded late. CAUSE OF LOVE was no threat. GRAN MAMIBELLA
close up early, was through after a half.

Footnotes
SORORITY SISTER sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch and prevailed under brisk handling. NEECHI chased the
early pace three wide, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole and finished second best. TRULY INCLUSIVE had a mild late rally. APPEALING
SENORITA unhurried early, found her best stride late. BROWNIE well placed, failed to respond. HELLO SWEETS failed to menace. DANZA MAGIC passed
tiring rivals. BAY MAGIC pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way readily. MISS ELLIE close up near the inside, was through after a half.
