Footnotes
INVASIVE tracked three wide, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, offered a bid in upper stretch before gaining an advantage at the furlong
pole, and held from bidders on either side in the late stages. TEXAS TED raced forwardly along the inside, but had to tap on the brakes while getting too
close to the leaders heels passing the half mile pole, chased around the turn, took aim two wide and between horses as an outer INVASIVE struck the front,
attempted a bid inside of that one in the final sixteenth, but was turned away, and narrowly saved place. MY FAVORITE UNCLE pursued from midpack in
the three to four paths, spun into the lane in the five path, stayed on with a grinding charge, closed in nearing the final sixteenth, but flopped back to his left
lead when approaching a shadow casted by the grandstand soon after, leveled off, and missed reaching place. HAIL ALLEN set the pace along the inside
while well in hand around the turn, was roused straightening for home as an outer rival menaced, got headed by that one at the furlong grounds, and
weakened. SPUNS SON broke in and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed in the three to four paths around the turn, and moved up. BLUEGRASS
LUTE broke out and exchanged contact with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, and faded. MR. YASUDA broke slowly but
avoided being pinched between horses in the process, lagged behind in the three path around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but made
little impact. FANEUIL HALL was urged along in the three path while off of the pace around the turn, and tired. MILITARY CODE stalked two wide, was
driven between horses to sustain pressure entering the turn, but gave way in upper stretch, and weakened on his left lead.

Footnotes
ON A SPREE tracked three wide, loomed a danger outside of the top pair entering the turn, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, assumed command
under confident handling entering the lane, and drew off handily. ONE LAST HAND bumped an outer rival at the start while taking light contact from an inner
rival, leaned into his outer counterpart in the process before being corrected, had his hind heels clipped by that one in the aftermath, went on to press two
wide and between horses, but failed to sustain pressure under a drive entering the turn, chased from the two path around the bend, tipped to the four path
entering the lane, and kept on to narrowly gain place at the wire. PICASSO leaned in and bumped a foe at the start, remained latched on to that one for
several strides, pressed three wide, bid two wide entering the turn, vied as an outer rival menaced soon after, proved no match for that bidder nearing the
lane, maintained place well into deep stretch, but was nailed by an outer foe at the wire. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT broke inwardly while a bit rank and last
away, checked while losing his path to an outer foe leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the two path around the turn, improved between horses in
midstretch, attempted a bid for minor placings inside of rivals soon after, but did not have enough. MALIBU TIME tracked along the inside, tipped to the
three path entering the lane, and failed to menace. COVE BLUE set the pace along the inside, met a challenge from an outer rival entering the turn, vied
inside of a pair of foes around the bend, but faltered in upper stretch. KEEN ON YOU was outrun in the three path. GORMLEYS GOT GAME was bumped
by rivals on both sides while being put to crowded quarters for multiple strides, then clipped the hind heels of his inner accosting rival while steadying back
in the aftermath, then laid off of the pace in the three path, weakened in upper stretch, and was eased through the final furlong.

the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. STAYINYOURLANE prompted the pace three wide and between horses while under strong and steady urging down the

Footnotes
NORDIC LIGHT bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, stalked three wide, chased the leading pair while under urging around the far turn, offered a
bid in the five path in upper stretch, gained an advantage leaving the furlong pole, drove clear, and held safely from an inner rival late. WRITEITONTHEICE
pulled under firm restraint while gaining a tracking position behind the leaders around the first turn, settled into stride at the eleven sixteenths pole, but
chased the leading trio around the far turn, tipped to the four path in midstretch, then drove past an inner pair to gain place in the late stages. RIGHT OF
RUSH set the pace inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one approaching the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, yet kept on, and regained
a minor placing from his outer counterpart while getting outkicked for place approaching the wire. SPRINKLEHEAD prompted the pace two wide, vied down
the backstretch, led turning for home, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, required a strong left handed rein to change over at the three sixteenths
pole, but was headed by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. LEVY bumped with an inner rival at the
start, lacked speed two wide and between horses, shifted out to the four path around the far turn, and failed to factor. RONITHELIMODRIVER saved ground
off of the pace, retreated to trail entering the backstretch, and made little impact. MONEY PIT laid off of the pace three wide, trailed in the four path around
the far turn, and got outrun.

well-handled by the rider and quickly reloaded, lacked speed in the five path, and moved up. ZED was washed out with a layer of sweat pre-race, chased in
the two path, and lacked a bid. SHADY DAREDEVIL vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
PEAK POPULARITY had his hind quarters bumped early on, laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, shifted to the five path down the backstretch,
ranged up outside of the top pair while under a drive in the four path around the far turn, failed to keep pace with those embattled leads in upper stretch,
sustained a chase through midstretch, yet kicked in inside the final furlong, and drove past nearing the wire. MEDAGLIA FOREVER vied along the inside of
a vying rival, met another challenger's bid around the far turn as her counterpart faltered, shifted out tot he four path while getting headed entering the lane,
yet fought on gamely, wrestled an advantage once again in the final furlong, but was caught by an outer oncharging foe in the shadow of the wire. CORSINI
veered out at the start, stalked two to three wide, bid outside of the leader and in the three path around the far turn, forged a narrow advantage while floated
to the five path entering the lane, sparred with her inner game counterpart through the lane, relinquished an advantage in the final furlong, and got outkicked
late. SHE'S MAGIC tracked along the inside, faltered around the far turn to trail turning for home, yet came back to surpass outer rivals in upper stretch.
ABBREVIATION bumped with an outer rival at the start, then got jostled between horses while taking back from crowded quarters soon after, raced far back
along the inside, then two to three wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. RAGGITY SAND contacted an inner rival leaving the
gates, then jostled with that one while in tight quarters in the early stages, lacked speed in the three path, improved in the four path turning for home, and
weakened. ANGORA DEB vied two wide, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

the furlong grounds, led soon after, but was caught by an outer bidder in the late stages. QUICK MUNNY set the pace along the inside, drew clear
approaching the turn, but was headed at the furlong grounds, tired, yet saved show. ATLANTIC STRIKE laid off of the pace four wide, and moved up.
MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor among rivals. FROZEN
SOLID trailed in the four to five paths, and made little impact. AWESOME LAWSON tracked along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch while hanging
on her left lead, changed over at the three sixteenths pole, but weakened. PARENTS PRIDE stalked two wide, but went wrong between horses at the five
sixteenths pole, was pulled up in upper stretch, and got vanned off.

FRANK'S ROCKETTE stalked along the inside, bid outside of the leader and in the four path entering the lane, drove clear approaching midstretch as an
inner LAST LEAF threw her hat in the ring, but held firmly through the final furlong. LAST LEAF saved ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail,
attempted a bid inside of the new leader in the final furlong, but was fended off. PRETTY BIRDIE shifted out at the start, set the pace in the three to two
paths into the turn, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, and yielded while losing place to an inner rival leaving upper stretch. COPPELIA broke
out, stalked the leader from the four to three paths into the turn, but was outmoved by an inner rival turning for home, got floated out to the five path by that
one entering the lane, and gave way. PRAISE AND HONOR was outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
NEIGHBOR stalked along the rail, bid inside of the top pair in upper stretch, and inched clear in the final furlong. PLENTY OF TIME bumped an inner rival at
the start, pressed the leader from the three path, bid turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rival in midstretch, and kept on. KANSAS COMET set
the pace in the two path, vied between bidders in upper stretch, and gave way late. BOOSTER SHOT tracked four wide, but failed to keep pace with the top
trio in upper stretch, and held fourth. CAMBIASO saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. T LAW bumped an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the
four path, then lacked a bid between horses. CRONUS laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and failed to factor.
DESERT HIGHWAY trailed, got floated to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. SUCCEED pursued from midpack in the three path and
between horses, and tired. TIZ TWENTY TWENTY took a bump from an outer rival leaving the gates, laid close up while keen two wide and between horses
around the first turn, then weakened around the far turn. YES POINT bumped with an outer rival at the start, then raced keenly while bumping into the first
turn, checked around that bend, and was outrun.
