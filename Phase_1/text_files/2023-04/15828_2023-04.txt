Footnotes
POPNFIZZ hounded the early frontrunner while under a snug hold entering the turn, engaged for the lead outside two furlongs from the wire, took command
between horses at the top of the stretch and had enough left in reserve to hold off the closing runner at the finish. ATTABE was allowed to settle near the
back in the beginning, was roused angling outside at the quarter marker, began to find her best stride five wide in mid stretch and was full of run late gaining
but could not get there in time. GAMBLE'S ORB tracked the early pacesetters three wide at the half, joined the battle up front outside the contesting leaders
turning for home but did not switch leads until very late and could not find more in deep stretch. JANIS JOPLIN took a stalking position behind the early
leaders into the turn, waited on the rail with five sixteenths to run, shifted out to the four path for the stretch drive but could only run evenly late for a minor
share. NOT NEGOTIABLE broke sharp to set the pace down the backside, was headed outside midway on the turn, battled inside in upper stretch and
faded on the fence the final sixteenth. NEOLITHIC NATION was unhurried settling inside at the back in the early stages, saved ground through the turn but
could not be a presence in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HIGHLY FLAMMABLE had a nice trip watching the front duo battle in the early stages, cruised three wide outside foes to assume command at the top of the
lane and comfortably drew away when asked. FOREST BUZZ chased the early speed at the break, took over the top spot outside three furlongs from home,
was collared by the winner in mid stretch, could no fight that one off but ran on well to be a clear second. BOSS HOLIDAY was situated near the rear on the
rail down the backside, advanced up the fence throughout the turn to be in with a chance turning for home, shifted just outside at the furlong marker to finish
up well to capture third money. LAKE SHORE DRIVE broke well to set the early pace, surrendered the front position with three eighths from home, fought
on inside on the turn but could not match strides with the leaders in upper stretch and had to settle for a minor role. BET N WIN took a stalking position in
the two path near the rear in the beginning, was scrubbing on for more run with five sixteenths to go, offered little response and could not get involved for
the stretch run. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY trailed the field outside down the backstretch, something appeared amiss entering the far turn and could not keep
pace with the field, regrouped in upper stretch and had some late energy to close the gap on the field at the wire.

Footnotes
CHANCEL kept a close eye on the early pacesetter racing outside down the backstretch, continued to hound the speed on the turn, began to wear down the
leader under left handed urging in mid stretch to get up a few strides before the wire. LIGHT THE LAMP was away alertly to dictate the pace, continued to
be the frontrunner on the turn, opened up mildly on the eventual winner turning for home but could not find enough late to hold that one off in the end.
STERLING SPEED had a good inside position watching the leaders in the beginning parts of the race, was asked for more run but could not threaten the
top two down the lane but fought on gamely when shifted just off the fence at the furlong marker to win the battle for the show prize. KID FORESTER
tracked outside foes in the second flight entering the turn, put in a mild rally at the top of the stretch and stalled at the eighth pole losing the battle in the end
for the show money. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was in tight quarters running between rivals at the half mile marker and was shuffled back to near the rear, in
upper stretch was roused for more effort and had little to give late while finishing on the fence. BIG WARDEN broke well with the field at the start, could not
keep pace with runners early and trailed into the turn, raced three wide outside horses but could not make an impression running to the wire.

STORMY SOUL contended between runners early then continued to duel inside a rival but off the fence into and on the turn, forged clear in the stretch
under steady handling. WESTERN TROUBLE settled outside foes toward the back, went four wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch, rallied
widest of all but was no match for the winner while clearly securing the place. MASTER SPY was prominent between runners briefly in the early going,
eased back off the leaders heading up the backstretch, switched out and made a swift advance four then five wide on the turn taking a narrow lead but
evened out late. WENJACK settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out a path into upper stretch, was between rivals at that juncture and
continued to improve inside foes. CHAIRMAN BOB chased from inside, switched out going two then three deep on the turn and in the stretch, put to strong
urging at the quarter pole, needed more late. MR. DAZZLE broke a step slowly, raced outside three deep on the turn, came out further in mid-stretch, ran on
willingly but was unable to menace. ALACRITOUS prompted the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, weakened some in the stretch. BAHAMIAN
DUDE attended the early pace from inside, was in a bit tight and tapped on the brakes outside the three-eighths, steadily dropped back.

Footnotes
NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) pressed the early pace outside, took command seven sixteenths from home, was headed outside at the quarter marker and stubbornly
ran on inside to draw away from challenger in the last sixteenth. AIM FOR THE SKY showed good speed to set the early fractions, surrendered the top spot
while on the rail entering the turn, re-rallied to bid outside two furlongs out, fought on gamely in mid stretch but needed more to threaten the winner late.
MAAKWA was on hold behind runners running down the backside, angled off horses at the quarter marker for the drive, closed well racing down the four
path to rally well and get up for the third money at the finish. FEELTHEBEAT raced between rivals in the tracking flight into the turn, was in range of the
frontrunners when they straightened out for the drive but levelled out in the late stages of the race losing third place. PARTICULAR tracked the leaders on
the rail, continued to chase the front duo throughout the turn and could only finish up with an even effort in the final stages of the race. SEVENTYSEVEN
STONE was void of any speed to trail the field in the beginning and could not get involved in the stretch to be a challenger running to the wire. JACK
BEANSTALK was reined in outside foes running down the backstretch to stalk four wide, could not keep pace racing four deep on the turn and was not a
factor for the drive.

READY FOR A FIGHT bumped lightly with a rival after the break, tracked from between runners in the second flight going two to three wide on the turn,
angled out five deep at the top of the stretch, took aim and drove past inside the final sixteenth. MACLEAN'S POSSE pressed the early leader from inside,
engaged that one further leaving the backstretch, dueled inside through the turn and upper stretch, took a narrow lead in mid-stretch, was outkicked by the
winner but kept on for place. KAWACATOOSE bumped with a rival at the start but readily obtained the early lead to set the tempo, dueled outside a rival
two to three wide on the turn and in upper stretch, was simply outkicked but kept on gamely. CLEAR DESTINATION was brushed lightly at the start,
unhurried at the rear, came into upper stretch four wide and gained willingly but too late. COMMANDER JOE brushed a rival lightly at the start then was
vigorously urged to gain forward position tracking in behind the leaders inside the second flight, failed to rally. WARP RIDE raced outside off the pace going
four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. THERE'S NO JOE chased three to four wide, faded.

FOREST DRIFT broke sharp to lead from the onset, continued to dictate the pace unchallenged upfront though the turn, found another gear at the furlong
marker and had enough late to keep on holding off foes at the finish. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE broke out at the start, settled near the rear after the break,
advanced smartly on the rail through the turn, continued to travel well on the fence in the stretch closing on the winner but could not get there in time.
AUBRIETA sat comfortably outside tracking the loose speed on the turn, was roused at the top of the lane to go after the leader, could not find more in mid
stretch and had to settle for third money. STORMING LADY was brushed by the inside foe at the start, trailed the field racing on the rail down the backside,
saved ground throughout the turn and put in a mild run to get up for a minor share at the end. TRADING BAY was rated between rivals early on, raced three
wide outside horses on the turn , put in a brief run at the quarter marker to be in contention in the five path in upper stretch and stalled in the final eighth.
HALFINTHEWRAPPER tracked between runners mid pack down the backstretch, was steadied briefly seven sixteenths from the line, was shuffled back to
the rear, could not offer a run in upper stretch and was not persevered with the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
EXCEED had a good tracking trip behind the contesting front duo, waited patiently to pounce on the turn, found clear running room in the three path at the
top of the lane and wore down the leader in the late stages for the victory. PRINCE SUSSEX showed good speed to lead on the rail at the half, continued to
set the fractions on the turn, stubbornly gave way racing on the wrong lead inside through the stretch and just missed at the finish in a gutsy effort. ORPHAN
HALLIE made a good move for position from the outside post down the backstretch to enter the turn tracking outside runners in the second flight, rallied four
wide into the stretch drive and closed well to get up for the show award. TWO YEAR CONTRACT was in tight behind and between runners at the half,
regrouped between horses to rally five sixteenths from the line and showed good energy through the lane passing tired runners for a minor placing. BIG
INVESTMENT rated on the rail midfield down the backstretch, was urged inside midpoint on the turn, spurted up the fence to be in with a chance for a share
in upper stretch and levelled out for the final sixteenth. STYLISH GENT pressured the pace on the outside in the early stages, drifted outwards when they
straightened out for the drive, could not find more run and retreated in mid stretch. ARTIE'S ALL IN raced three wide outside foes near the rear in the
beginning, could not gain on fellow rivals racing on the turn, drifted out when roused entering the stretch and could not be a factor to the line.
