Footnotes
GOD STILL LOVES ME showed good early speed to set the pace, maintained a clear lead on the turn, raced off the inside, responded when asked and
drew off under urging. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied in the two path in the stretch and finished well for
second. SCARF stalked three wide early on, chased inside on the turn, rallied mildly in the lane and got third. ADVOCATE HARBOR stalked between rivals,
continued between horses on the turn and gained mildly outside in the lane. FALL CAMPAIGN tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and lacked a
rally. WITHOUT A VIEW raced three wide off the pace, contiuned three wide on the turn and had no rally. PEARLBDANCING stumbled at the start, quickly
recovered and moved up to chase the pace, chased the winner on the turn and weakened late. MISS ALEX raced off the rail, off the pace, was outrun and
vanned off after.

SATCHEL DE RITCHES controlled the pace in hand, widened into the stretch and remained well clear under moderate urging. MIDLANER lacked speed,
angled out in the stretch and closed strongly narrowing the gap. ICONIC LEGACY advanced four wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. ABUELO
NUNO trailed for half a mile then passed rivals inside through the stretch. SMOKEY WHITE moved close up between rivals through the opening quarter
then faded. CENTER MID MADDIE was fractious in the gate prior to the start unseating his rider, flashed speed and stopped. AGGRANDIZE raced in
closest pursuit of the winner on the turn then gave way. PER RULING #2184PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, SATCHEL DE
RITCHES WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
CAUSALISTIC raced off the pace inside, then two wide, tracked outside a rival on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside of
SINGINTHRUTHESTORM in the final furlong and wore down that rival at the wire to prevail. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM stalked close up two wide, bid
entering the far turn, dueled, took over in upper stretch, then dug in gamely inside of the winner and battled on to the finish. CHAIN REACTION set the pace
on the inside, dueled on the far turn, weakeed in the lane, then held well to earn the show spot. JUST A THOUGHT tracked close up on the inside, chased
inside on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and then finished evenly. ILOVECHARLYBROWN raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and failed
to threaten. WE BE THERE raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and was outrun. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE raced off the pace, two wide, failed
to respond when asked and gave way in the lane.

furlong grounds, put a head in front and edged away in the final sixteenth, driving. FULL CONTACT vied three wide for the early lead, took over soon after
and cleared off, led into the stretch, dug in gamely inside when challenged, then was no match and continued willingly for the place spot.
GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS raced close up on the inside, chased inside on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. LYFE IS SIMPLE vied two
wide in the early stages, then chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. STEVIE T raced off the pace, chased three wide on
the turn and closed belatedly inside. RECLUSE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, inside on the turn, came wide for the drive and had no rally.
WHERESTHEPASSION was steadied after the start, then outrun. TIEMPO PERFECTO stalked the pace early on, three wide, chased between rivals on the
turn and faded.

CUP OF LIFE took control inside, began widening on the turn and remained well clear under moderate urging. RANDOM LUCK saved ground close up and
continued well to gain the place. POOR NO MORE prompted the pace between rivals and finished willingly. TUDOR PEAK settled off the pace, raced
extremely wide and closed well. REID'S FANGIRL raced off the leaders in the two path and flattened out. ROSE LEGACY broke slowest and trailed early
then passed rivals outside. ONE PAIR OF HANDS dropped back inside and was never a factor. HIP HOP HOORAY prompted the pace three wide and
proved empty in the stretch. SMARTY PANTS SANDY chased six then four wide down the backstretch and stopped.

A DANGEROUS GUY set the pace no the inside, held a clear lead on the turn, responded when roused and pulled away under energetic handling.
PERFECT DAY stalked close up three wide, chased the winner on the turn and rallied for second. MUTASALLEM was off slowly and steadied, raced off the
pace inside, advanced on the turn, came wide and rallied mildly outside in the final furlong. WIZKY'S ON THE BAY raced off the pace, three wide on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. MR SANDMAN stalked two wide, chased inside on the turn and lacked a rally. CELTIC HEART
raced two wide off the pace, then inside in the stretch and did not factor. JAMIE DREAMS tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and tired.

IRISH EXIT vied inside for the lead, showed the way on the backside, dueled inside on the far turn, dueled past the furlong marker, dug in gamely inside
and prevailed in a driving finish. DREAMING OF GERRY stalked close up three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run,
dug in gamely in deep stretch and got up for second. EAGLES CRY bobbled at the break, took an awkward step nearing the first turn, then pulled and was
steadied on the clubhouse turn, stalked between rivals, waited for room on the far turn, continued between rivals lacking a clear path in the stretch run,
closed late between rivals and got third. EXPENSIVE CUT vied two wide for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, continued to battled through the
stretch drive and dug in gamely between to the end. TOUGH TICKETS tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, waited for room on the rail in the
stretch drive and finished evenly. SEICHE raced off the pace inside, angled out and failed to threaten. MANOR HOUSE raced three wide on the first turn,
two wide off the pace and did not factor. SUPER JOHN trailed the field, moved up on the far turn, then flattened out.
