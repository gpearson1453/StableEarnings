MINDSHARE off slow, asked for speed and cleared in between rivals on the backstretch, failed to take the turn well and lugged out to the three path,
headed into the lane, dug in and just lasted in a game effort. HOLYJAZZ stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn,
launched bid in the four path, and rallied strong to just miss. PAUL L tracked two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, altered in midway
on the turn from lugging out rival, launched bid along the inside and repelled by. AUTISM ABILITY tracked pace along the inside on the backstretch,
continued along the inside on the turn, took a bad step mid turn, fell and had to be vanned off.

CHOOSEN ONE away very well almost clearing field in first to jumps, kept to task in a mild drive while winning comfortably. RACY SWEET CORONA
bumped solidly at the start by outside rival, accelerated well and kept to task under a hand drive in a promising debut. FANCY POLLITICS broke in, asked
left handed throughout in an even effort. JAMAICA LIGHTS broke a bit slow, came in and bumped rival at the start, hand ridden first half of the race, asked
late and responded well. MR FAVORITE JESS away cleanly, asked right handed immediately, did not fully level till late in an even effort. SNEAKY KID
fractious in the gate, ducked in and bumped rival at the start, ridden cautiously rest of the way while in tight. FAMOUS TRESSY tossed head, came away
slow and pushed in by outside rival at the start, asked right handed early, lacked path and ridden to wire. BEDUINOS FAVORITE fractious in post parade,
stayed in gate and completely missed the break and lost all chance.

MY KIND OF LOVER fractious behind the gate, away cleanly, dueled with outside rival and narrowly prevailed. PERFECT PLAY broke in, leaned in early,
asked left handed and just lost by a head bob. CAVA JOHN CASH broke in and brushed with inside foe at the start, shied a bit early from outside rival,
asked twice right handed in a good effort. SEPERATE KISSES away cleanly, kept to task along the inside in an even effort. RHEA ducked out four lanes at
the start, asked steadily right handed and finished up evenly. TABASCO JESS off slow, lacked path for first hundred yards, lugged out and never asked.
APOLLITICAL PRINCESS off slow and lost her path at the start, veered out four lanes and failed to ever level.
