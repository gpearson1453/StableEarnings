SPARE A DIME between horses to the turn, backed out, angled off rail into the stretch with a late run and drove past under good handling. HONEYBELL
awkward start, dueled in the turn and stretch, kept place spot. LUCKY CAT TOO dueled three wide to turn, stayed game in stretch between rivals.
SHRIMPIE no speed to the stretch, tipped out for the drive while evenly. OLIVIA'S JOY sharp break, inside run to turn, gave in readily through stretch.
EASY IS GOOD never menaced throughout. MAMITA LINDA through at the half from outside.
