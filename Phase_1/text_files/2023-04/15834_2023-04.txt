OLD MAN WINTER Away on top, showed the way along the rail, remained clear with a furlong to go and under the whip turned back HIGH HEAT for the
win. HIGH HEAT Gained along the three path midway on the turn, chased outside, appeared to be in gear and hung. NUMBER ONE DILLON In tight at the
seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground and failed to fire. HARRISON KNOWS Tracked along the two path and weakened. YOUR AWESOME BOSS Broke a
step slow, four wide on the turn, was not a factor.

A MAIZE ZING DOTIE In hand along the rail, eased out a path into the lane, reached the leaders three across leaving the furlong marker, took the
advantage at the sixteenths pole and was going away at the end. SMALL PEBBLES Vied for the lead along the three path into the turn, two path out of it,
between leaving the furlong marker and bested THIN LEGS for the place. THIN LEGS Away best, vied for the lead along the two path, took the rail into the
lane, battled and then faltered inside. GOING GOING GONE Broke sluggishly, saved ground into the turn and failed to gain. EASY PLAY Close up along
the three path into the turn, continued on that path and weakened. TIMED OUT Broke slow, ducked out after that, three path on the turn, was not a factor.
