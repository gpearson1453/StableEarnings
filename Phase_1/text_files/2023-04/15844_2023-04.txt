MORE THAN A DANCE settled inside, bid in the two path on the final turn then pulled away through the stretch driving. LIBERTY RUNNER lacked speed,
raced inside throughout and was up for the place late. DYNAMITE DUKE prompted the pace outside, took over near the three eighths, edged clear then
tired. CLASSY UNION raced within striking range outside and lacked a rally. ALONZO MOSELY hustled to the front for five furlongs and weakened.
SUNSANDDRINKINHAND trailed inside then caught a stopping rival. LUCKY MUCHO MAN raced close up to the first turn and gave way readily.

Footnotes
MS MERRABEL raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed steadily, took over passing the
sixteenth marker and drew clear under urging. FROSTED WILD RIDE set the pace racing with a clear lead, shook free entering the turn, responded when
roused, was no match for the winner, then dug in to save the place spot. TWIRLING WIND tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, angled out in the
stretch and rallied mildly outside. BOOM BOOM GIRL stalked two wide, chased on the turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch, then weakened.
YOURINDENIAL raced off the pace inside, checked entering the turn, continued on the inside and lacked a rally. CREME CARAMEL raced off the rail, off
the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TONALA was outrun. HALLIGIRL stalked two wide, then three wide on the turn and faded.

furlong. RETWEET trailed early, advanced extremely wide on the turn and rallied. KEEP DEM TALKING raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and
continued willingly. STOUTHEARTED hustled to the front inside, widened on the turn, was collared and tired. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE settled off the pace

BROTHER SHOWTYME forced the pace inside, slipped through at the top of the stretch and edged clear in the final furlong. SHARP SENSATION
prompted the pace outside, loomed a threat in the stretch but was outfinished. CHIP'S FRIEND lacked speed inside, was blocked in tight and steadied along
in the final sixteenth. THE BOATMAN chased wide down the backstretch then went evenly in the final furlong. ROAD CALL dropped back early, advanced
very wide narrowing the gap. ASH OF MY ENEMY lagged far back then passed rivals without menacing. FRUGAL JUDE trailed to the stretch then caught
stopping foes. ALMOND CIDER hustled to the front, widened briefly on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. PRACTICALLYMINE raced within
striking range down the backstretch then gave way.

GLOWSITY hustled to a clear lead, widened on the final turn, repelled a stretch challenge then edged away again driving. BEACH DAZE settled outside off
the pace, made a menacing bid into the stretch, was repelled but easily second best. FINE ONE WON raced in the two path in closest pursuit of the winner
then came up empty in the stretch. SEAHORSE D'ORO saved ground, moved briefly closer before half a mile then faded. TITANIC ROSE raced far behind
outside and was always outrun. SOLEMN OATH raced within range for half a mile then gave way readily. J D'S VISTA trailed early and was never in
contention. FRANKLY MY DEAR flashed speed then stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.
