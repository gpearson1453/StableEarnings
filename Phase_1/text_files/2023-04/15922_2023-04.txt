Footnotes
FEUILLETON saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, kicked clear while racing on the rail around the far bend and drew
off in the lane, in command through the final furlong. FOREVER SAUCY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch,
began a bid from the three path coming around the far bend and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. KALINBA dueled on the outside around
the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the second turn and weakened in late stretch. MIGHTY FROSTED raced in the four path
around the first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and was outkicked in
the lane. THE POINT ROAD saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path and passed
tiring horses in the lane while never threatening. MY BIG DRAMA raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
between horses, saved ground around the second turn and made no bid. RED JET trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was not a factor. STEEL HAWK saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and was empty in the lane.
