Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ROSIE chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths, angled out to swing three wide
into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a right handed crop and under left rein crosses and came in three
paths bumping K D KAKES into the fence just inside the sixteenth marker, then knocked heads to the finish and just lasted on the wire. K D KAKES hustled
from the gate, dueled four paths off the inside down the backstretch with SPATIAL REALITY to her inside, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under
coaxing and came inwards forcing the backing away SPATIAL REALITY to steady at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in head
to head now with MIDNIGHT ROSIE to her outside and was displaced from command nearing the eighth pole, dug in and was bumped just inside the
sixteenth marker brushing the fence and just missed at the end. SPATIAL REALITY dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to her outside,
tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to get shaken off and was forced to steady when in retreat at the
five-sixteenths as K D KAKES took over her lane directly in front, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages.
FRANCA chased three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. SARAH'S
PRIDE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, made no impact.
GLOCCA MORRA coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and faltered. There
was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on MIDNIGHT ROSIE and K D KAKES as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of SPATIAL REALITY
alleging interference against K D KAKES at the five-sixteenths. After review, the claim of foul by SPATIAL REALITY against K D KAKES was dismissed. It
was deemed though that MIDNIGHT ROSIE had impeded K D KAKES in the stretch run and therefore MIDNIGHT ROSIE was disqualified from victory and
placed second behind K D KAKES before that result was declared official.

Footnotes
DARN THAT SONG was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside
lead while in pursuit of the leader until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead under a left-handed crop, gained to make a bid while
still under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, took the advantage in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. SWEET AS SUGAR broke a
half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained into the final furlong,
angled out behind two foes approaching the sixteenth-pole despite some room to the inside of the leader and finished fast but was too late while up for the
place. BASTET broke out at the start, showed speed on the outside then moved clear around the nine-sixteenths, extended the advantage late on the
backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was set down in the two path into the stretch, came under a right-handed crop shortly thereafter,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while well clear for the show. ICE COLD GOLD broke a step slow then was
hustled, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back in the three path around the turn and tired. IDAKA was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the
inside of a foe then dropped back around the nine-sixteenths, fell further back into the turn, saved ground around that bend, came out into the stretch and
capitulated. LONDON GOLD stumbled at the start and unseated the rider then was walked off after being caught by the outrider.

stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot and missed at the end. MELTING SNOW coaxed from the start, prompted the leader from the outside four to
five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, got bumped inside the three-sixteenths as MON PETIT CHOU tipped out from the inside and weakened in the late stages while just holding for the
show honors. MON PETIT CHOU chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, tipped out with three-sixteenths to go and bumped MELTING SNOW, dug in head to head with that rival weakening in the late
stages and missed for the show honors. ALPINE QUEEN five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. DAME CINCO chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path

Footnotes
GLORY ROAD moved out while urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained in the final
furlong, closed fast on the tired leader late and got up in the final strides to prevail. REED KAN was asked leaving the gate, went to the front, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, moved clear outside the five-sixteenths, responded well put to a right-handed crop in upper
stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while still clear outside the sixteenth-pole, led to the final strides but was caught while clear for the place. CHARLIE
FIVE O chased the pace down the backstretch, moved out near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the four path, pursued the runner-up in the
stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. GOLDEN JUAN was sent from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three
path around the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and tired. HERO TIGER dropped back while urged along, saved ground early on the turn,
shifted three wide near the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten.

command five furlongs from home and tucking to the two path, got placed to light coaxing half a mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch
under challenge, dug in under threat to the outside and came out slightly a sixteenth from home and rebuffed that rival to inch clear to the finish kept to task.

four wide at the five-sixteenths and advanced on the leader, spun just off the inside into upper stretch issuing a challenge for the front, dug in latched on the
leader to the outside a furlong from home, got nudged a bit outwards as the leader drifted slightly and briefly before being corrected a sixteenth out and ran

WINTER POOL went four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the three path around the
far turn, had the rider take a peek behind him while gaining the lead outside the five-sixteenths, took another peek behind him outside the quarter-pole, was
put to a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, turned back a challenge from the runner-up shortly thereafter, switched to a left-handed crop
outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. CARIBBEAN (AUS) went around the first turn in the two path, settled just off the pace, was
roused late on the backstretch, went three then four wide under urging around the final turn, gained outside under a drive in upper stretch, loomed a threat
to the winner into the final furlong but was turned back and settled for the place. SAILOR SPEED went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was
asked on the final turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the five-sixteenths, came a bit off the rail into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into
the final furlong and weakened. WARRIOR IN CHIEF was away awkwardly but with the field, raced in the three path around the first turn, prompted the pace

Footnotes
SWEETIE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, went four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into the
stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. SHAMAN PRINCESS quickly sped clear, dictated terms while inside through the
turn, drew off under a drive into the final furlong, remained well clear into the final sixteenth, shortened stride late and was caught while able to hold the
place. DREAM ON CARA was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace under urging, rounded the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch then
angled out around the three-sixteenths and finished with late energy to garner the show. DANSEUR D'ORO was urged along off the pace, took a few
awkward strides while disliking the kickback in the two path early on the turn then shifted four wide, came five wide into the stretch, gained in the final
furlong and just missed the show. FOXY CARA was a bit reluctant to load then brushed the inside of the gate at the start, dropped well off the pace under
urging, traveled three wide around the turn and improved position without threatening. RUN CHATA was hustled from the start then chased the pace, saved
ground around the turn and tired. MIDNITE CONFESSION was fractious in the gate then broke slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the
outside, was urged along in the three path around the turn and came up empty. SPLASHY chased the pace on the outside then in the two path around the
turn and capitulated.
