Footnotes
BLEDSOE stalked while forwardly placed behind the top pair, smoothly split those foes in upper stretch to bid for the lead at the furlong grounds, and drove
clear. MISCHIEF JOKE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, improved to striking range behind a bidding rival in upper stretch, altered course
three wide and outside of that new leader at the furlong grounds, and ran on to secure place. CALLIN MY NAME dueled for the lead along the inside, inched
an advantage leaving the quarter pole, but was outkicked by a bidder at the furlong pole, and yielded. WEST SARATOGA pursued the top flight from
midpack in the two path in to the turn, and sustained a rail chase through the lane for a minor share. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON chased from off of the pace
in the four to five paths and between horses around the turn, and was one paced through the lane. NURCAN rushed to track the dueling pair from the three
to four paths around the turn, and yielded. TRANCHE broke a step slow, was hung in the five to six paths around the turn while off of the pace, and lacked a
bid. EARLY MUNNY never got invovled. ALEXANDRA'S SONG dueled for the lead two wide, drifted three wide entering the lane, and faltered between
horses. PRINCE OF POWER was rowdy during the post parade, broke slowly, and got outrun along the inside. HOLD THE PHONE broke a step slow and
showed little.

Footnotes
AFTERNOON TEA tracked in the three path, took aim in the four path turning for home, offered a bid in upper stretch, inched an advantage at the furlong
grounds, and determinedly maintained a margin from his inner game counterpart thereafter. AMERICAN RETRO vied two wide, led turning for home, dug in
to resist an outer bid in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds, fought on doggedly through the late stages, but failed to regain even terms.
BEACH WALKN bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued the main group along the inside, came into the lane int he four path, and ran on to claim
show at the furlong pole before chasing the dueling pair home. MISSILE tracked in the two path, moved between horses entering the lane, but lacked a bid.
UPPER CASE leaned out at the start, stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home to produce a bid, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper
stretch, and tired between horses. LADY SAMARITAN raced far back in the four path and moved up turning for home. STUNNINGLY bumped with an inner
rival at the start, saved ground far back, trailed behind traffic entering the lane, altered course five wide in upper stretch, and improved. CONTRIVE bobbled
slightly at the start, rushed to set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane.
DOMINA trailed in the three path, and failed to factor. FORENOON lacked speed despite steady urging from the rider, retreated to trail the field in the four
path around the turn, and made little impact. ACTIVE LANE failed to factor from the three path. ROCK THE NILE was brushed between horses at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three path, and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
COMPARATIVE pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, sustained a duel through the lane, and inched ahead in the final sixteenth. HAYUNEVANO set
the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that foe around the far turn, dueled through the lane while clinging to an advantage entering the final furlong, but
was bested late. FOREVER DIXIE tracked two wide, improved between horses approaching the far turn to chase the top pair from the three path around
that bend, then pursued them evenly through the lane. MUSTANG LADY stalked along the inside, but failed to progress under urging around the far turn,
and chased thereafter. CONDONE laid off of the pace along the inside under a firm hold around the first turn, and failed to factor. CHIQUITA MOSCA
bumped the outer part of the gate upon leaving it, raced at the rear in the three to four paths, and made little impact. EAST SHORE stalked outside of the
top pair, but faded approaching the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
HURRICANE DREAM (FR) was bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, tipped to the three path turning for home, ranged up
to loom a danger in upper stretch, and shot away from inner rivals with a good kick at the furlong grounds. FANCY LIQUOR set the pace inside of a vying
rival, shook free of that one entering the lane, vacated the rail before offering little resistance to the eventual winner's bid at the furlong grounds, and lasted
for place from an outer oncharging foe late. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) saved ground while unhurried towards the rear, swung seven wide entering the lane,
and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to miss reaching place. TIZ THE BOMB laid off of the pace in the two path, but bumped an outer rival
while altering course outwardly in midstretch, and stayed on between horses in the final furlong. CAMP HOPE bumped with an outer rival at the start,
stalked along the inside, attempted a rail bid in upper stretch, but was swiftly outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, and tired. KENTUCKY GHOST tossed
his head while bumping with an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, then lacked a rally between horses in the final furlong. EONS
bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the three path, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, and leveled off before reaching
contention. GREYES CREEK trailed in the two path, advanced in the four to five paths around the far turn, and failed to factor. HENLEY'S JOY tracked in
the two path, yielded between horses at the half mile pole, retreated to the rear behind rivals entering the turn, and took a bump from an inner foe at the
furlong grounds while making little impact. HOZIER vied two wide, but weakened entering the lane, and caved between horses. BEATBOX stalked two wide,
weakened entering the lane, and took a bump from an inner rival in midstretch.

POSITANO SUNSET tracked two wide and between horses, split foes to take aim on the clear leader from the four path in upper stretch, rallied up to that
foe in the final furlong, and edged ahead in the closing stage. VAHVA prompted the pace two wide, led between horses at the three path at the three furlong
pole, drew clear in upper stretch, but was worn down by an outer challenger in the final sixteenth. PEACOCK LASS bumped with an inner rival at the start,
raced off of the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, and ran on in pursuit of the top pair after
claiming show in midstretch. CHARLEE MAE stalked along the inside, and chased between horses in midstretch. PEACOCK ALLEY broke a bit outwardly,
stalked outside of the top pair, vied in the four path around the turn, but gave way once floated to the five path in upper stretch. SECRET STATEMENT
lacked speed in the five path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to menace. ZIAERATI bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced far
back in the three path, improved between horses turning for home while fanning to the six path, then failed to threaten through the lane. BLACK FOREST
set the pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of rivals at the three furlong pole, and weakened in upper stretch. JUST LIKE MAGIC was bumped and
pinched back between horses at the start, lagged behind, and moved up between horses in upper stretch. RO TOWN tracked four wide, but weakened
between horses around the turn. HALF A CHANCE saved ground off of the pace, but faded. BOBBIE SOX pursued from midpack three wide and between
horses, got keen racing to the turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
HER WORLD (IRE) set the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path with a clear advantage entering the lane, maintained a clear margin through
midstretch, but tired late as an inner rival menaced approaching the wire, and lasted narrowly. NOTA BENE laid off of the pace in the two path, split foes
while launching a charge at the three sixteenths pole, took aim inside of the clear leader in the final furlong, sustained progress as that rival tired in the
closing stages, but just missed. LINGUISTIC was coaxed along from midpack three wide around the turn, floated four wide entering the lane, shifted to the
six path in upper stretch, and ran on well. KAUFYMAKER stalked in the three path, but failed to keep pace with her clear stablemate in the five path entering
the lane, chased that rival while between horses in midstretch, but yielded late. COVENANT LADY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, then stayed
on to improve in the final furlong. FROZEN SOLID pursued from midpack two wide, moved forward three wide and between horses nearing the lane, but
lacked a rally from there. DRESSED trailed along the inside, then improved between horses late. LAUGH AND PLAY raced forwardly two wide and between
horses, but got outkicked by an inner bidder before weakening at the furlong grounds. AWESOME LAWSON stalked along the inside, but weakened in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
CORONA BOLT set the pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer rivals around the turn, battled with HEJAZI through the lane, and held tenaciously in
the final furlong. HEJAZI was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, recovered to press three wide after a quarter mile, vied around the turn,
came into the lane on even terms with an inner CORONA BOLT, sparred with that foe thereafter, but was fended off in the late stages. FREEZING POINT
tracked four wide, raced in range of the leading trio turning for home, but only managed to chase the embattled leading pair through the final furlong.
LUGAN KNIGHT was bumped by an inner rival and forced to make contact with an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, but failed to progress despite
heavy urging around the turn, and lacked a bid while gaining a minor share. GULFPORT broke outwardly and stacked up a group of rivals at the start, was
prominent early, but rated back to stalk leaving the chute, pursued from along the inside around the turn, and faded. DETERMINEDLY was bumped by an
inner rival before retreating out of crowded quarters at the start, lagged behind into the turn, cut the gap while fanning to the five path entering the lane, and
failed to menace thereafter. HURRICANE J prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.

MO STASH set the pace along the inside, shook free of a pressing foe entering the lane, met NAGIRROC's bid approaching midstretch, and held firm
through the final furlong. NAGIRROC tracked three wide, took aim on the newly clear leader in upper stretch, attempted a bid in midstretch, but was turned
away. WEBSLINGER settled far back along the inside, bided time outside of foes while caught in the four to five paths around the far turn, then rallied
willingly outside of foes through the lane. MI HERMANO RAMON checked while forward behind the top pair into the first turn, stalked from the two path, but
lacked a bid while only able to chase through the lane. ANDTHEWINNERIS raced far back three wide, turned for home in the four path and between horses,
but was steadied once put to crowded quarters among horses in upper stretch, altered course outwardly, and recovered to rally for a minor share.
CANDIDATE broke awkwardly before shying from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide under snug restraint around the first turn,
inched closer four wide around the far turn, but was bumped by an inner rival while between horses in upper stretch, and leveled off. FREEDOM TRAIL
saved ground off of the pace, shifted out and caused trouble for a group of outer rivals in upper stretch, then lacked a rail charge thereafter. DUDE N
COLORADO (GB) stalked outside of the leader, but gave way entering the lane, and weakened between horses. WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) checked
into the first turn before settling into an inside tracking position , pursued from the two path around the far turn, but was bumped by an inner rival and put to
crowded quarters between horses in upper stretch. MOVISITOR broke a steps low, laid off of the pace two wide, then in the three path between horses
around the far turn, but was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe in upper stretch, and made little impact. RARIFIED FLAIR was outrun.

Footnotes
DEFINING PURPOSE stalked outside of the pace setter, vied with that one around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, and lasted late as a pair of
outer rivals closed in. PUNCHBOWL stalked along the inside, shifted three wide and between horses turning for home, brushed her outer grinding
counterpart in upper stretch while in pursuit of the clear leader, closed in on that tiring foe in the final sixteenth in hopes of bidding late, but came up short.
JULIA SHINING tracked three wide, was urged along to sustain striking range position around the far turn, got floated four wide nearing the lane, failed to
keep pace with the clearing leader entering it, kept on after taking a brush from her inner counterpart in upper stretch, gained late, but did not have enough.
GUNS N' GRACES trailed into the far turn, fanned six wide with a quarter mile to go, and moved up willingly. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT set the pace,
sparred with an outer vying rival around the far turn, proved no match for that one in upper stretch, and gave way. WONDER WHEEL tracked in the two
path, required snug restraint while tugging in the bit around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, shifted five wide turning for home, but
lacked a rally. PRIDE OF THE NILE laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide approaching the far turn, and faded turning for home and was
eased through the lane

Footnotes
HAY STACK took a brush from an inner foe early on, tracked two wide and between horses, took aim on the newly clear leader in upper stretch, bid along
with an outer foe at the furlong grounds, sparred with that one through the late stages, and held gamely. LIL MISS MOONLIGHT tracked in the four path,
ranged up around the far turn, sustained a bid along with an inner rival at the furlong grounds, battled through the final furlong, but was kept from gaining
even terms. PENUMBRAS MAKER bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, tracked from midpack along the inside, took the far turn in the three path
among foes, tipped to the five path in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, then changed over while claiming show at the sixteenth pole. HECKLED
was brushed by an inner foe into an outer rival early on, stalked along the inside, but checked turning for home before steadying while being shuffled behind
the tiring early-pace setter entering the lane, and lacked a re-rally. PEDIGEEK trailed along the inside circled inner rivals with a six wide rally around the far
turn, but flattened out before reaching contention. BEST PERFORMER stalked three wide, pressed into the far turn, bid turning for home, but yielded
between horses in upper stretch. DORAL was put to tight quarters soon after the start, laid off of the pace two wide, awaited racing room turning for home,
shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. IDLE CHATTER pressed two wide, led turning for home, cleared in upper stretch, but offered little
resistance to a pair of bidders at the furlong grounds, and faltered. ROBIN SAGE set the pace in the two path, but was headed turning for home, and
stopped. WITS AND WAGERS saved ground off of the pace, but faded. COSTA BELLA was bumped and bothered by an inner rival at the start, laid off of
the pace in the three path and between horses, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and weakened. MISCHIEF LILY laid off of the pace in the four to
five paths, floated to the seven path entering the lane, and gave way.
