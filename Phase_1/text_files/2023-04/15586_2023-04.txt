Footnotes
R KING KONG dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane. AWKWARD PAUSE
bumped with the horse to his outside at the start and trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground late. LOVIELEE dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two and three
path and weakened in the final furlong. ANY MINUTE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the bend in the four path and made
no bid. I'LL FINISH chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and faded from there. ROLL ON DUDE bumped with
the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn
and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
FLYING SUN raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear in
the lane and held off a closer at the wire. GERARD chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the
two path and gained ground late. COLORS stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the
bend and kept on to the finish. POSEIDONS MYTH raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the four path and improved position in
the lane. EL POLICIA raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in
the lane while never threatening. J T'S MY BOY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path
and was outkicked in the stretch. ALEXIS N NIKO raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, continued around the turn in the three path and was
empty from there. EDMUND FITZGERALD led the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
IRAZU saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second
bend, launched a bid in upper stretch and kicked clear. CUPIDS DREAM raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for
the run up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SUMMER AT
THE SPA saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend, brushed with ONE NIGHT STAND
near the eighth pole, was caught in midstretch and chased on to the wire. PUGILIST raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half
mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and improved position in the late stretch. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT raced in the two path around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the second bend, and improved position on the rail in the final furlong.
ONE NIGHT STAND raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the far
turn and weakened in the lane. CHICA BOOM raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the three path and faded in the stretch. TWISTED TREASURE stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the four path early, tracked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path and tired in the lane. WHISKARITA reared up more than once
leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field throughout and was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT
WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SEVEN, WHISKARITA, HAD A COMPROMISED START AND HE WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER.

kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the finish. CHRIS'S MOTOWN GAL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, began a bid from
the three path coming around the turn and improved position in the lane. GLORIOUS WAVE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three
path around the turn and kept on to the wire. NOBLE ATTITUDE chased the leader through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the
