GUITAR BOY stalked the pace to the three-eighths pole, engaged the leader to duel through the turn, and drew clear down the lane under steady urging.
MY BOY BLING rated off the pacesetters down the backside, made steady gain through the stretch to be second best. NOISE COMPLAINT rushed up to
take the lead from the outside draw, set the pace to the far turn, responded when challenged on the turn but weakened in the lane. NIGHTWIND trailed
down the backside and rallied four wide to be gaining late. POSEIDONS WAVE tracked pace into the first turn while in tight quarters along the rail, held his
rail position to the far turn and lacked a late response. SLIM JIMMY raced evenly as a non-factor.

Footnotes
SATIN HEART was well rated while two wide, then dug in gamely in the four path mid stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. GLITZ AND
GLAMOUR set the pace along the inside, was in steady drive, cleared the turn then gave way in the end and was best for second place. JUSTCAUSEICAN
settled along the inside into the turn to rally in the late stretch but it was too little too late. ANNA B raced in the middle of the field while three wide, then
rallied throughout the turn and into the stretch but came up empty. PHARME'S PHINALE raced in the middle of the field while two wide into the turn, then
menaced in the upper stretch but it was not enough in the end. MEMORABLE FLIGHT raced from the inside in the middle of the pack, then bid while three
wide on the turn into the stretch but came up empty. FREE DROP GYPSY settled while two wide then bid from the inside on the turn but did not fire in the
stretch. J M SKY CLASSIC chased the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn but did not respond in the stretch.

Footnotes
BIG WAVE JAMES pressed the pace from the onset, moved two wide to take command in the far turn and drew away when prompted. WHITEROSE
JEWEL reserved in mid-pack off the pace early, commenced a rally into the far turn, checked along the rail lacking room, split horses when clear down the
lane and finished full of run. GOLDEN FLASH stalked the pace in striking position throughout and finished willingly for the show. MAN IN THE MIDDLE
ducked in at the start to trail early, rallied 5w turning for home and closed well late. GOLD BARON raced wide near the rear of the field down the backside
and made a mild bid in the lane. HUMOR ME PLEASE broke alertly to settle into a tracking position in mid-field and failed to rally. TOP COP raced between
horses and went evenly failing to challenge. BENISSIMO well placed while racing three wide and flattened out in the lane. RAIL TOWN set the pace away
from the gate, led for a half mile and tired turning for home. UPTOWN BIGBADJON raced at the rear of the field and was no factor.
