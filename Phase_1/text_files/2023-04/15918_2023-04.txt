Footnotes
ONLYTHREESOCKS void of early foot while three wide through the first turn, continued outside, three to four wide when advancing second turn, continued
to rally, challenged inside the furlong grounds, kicked clear late. WORTHINESS forwardly placed along the inside, moved forward and challenged inside the
leader into the far turn, drew clear when straightened for home, offered little resistance to the winner late, all out to last for the place. OLD SCHOOL FLASH
prompted the leader from the outside from the outset, advanced three wide to challenge as the runner up was challenging along the rail late backstretch, fell
back off the latter was drawing clear in upper stretch, was getting back to that one in the late going while also not able to match the winner. I GUESS NOT
one paced while four wide into the first turn, two to three wide second bend, continued evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. SOPHIE'S
STAR lacked speed, continued to lag up the backstretch, in traffic late in the final turn, improved position in a non threatening fashion. BOOTLEGGING
GIRL edged clear to show the way into and through the first turn, allowed the runner up the rail late backstretch, began to weaken when headed by that one
far turn. TRUEBLUEGIRL back off the pace, lacked a closing response. ALTAR GIRL was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SIDETOWN broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, in hand while still clear into the lane, roused with a brisk hand ride and remained clear to the wire
under an intermittent right handed crop. TRAPPE VALLEY lacked speed while racing off the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn, finished with good
energy to be up late for the place. DIAL IN FOR LUTE in mid pack while off the inside, three wide into the stretch, advanced to race closest to the winner
past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. STUD PUPPY broke back, trailed, saved ground through the turn, improved position while not a serious
threat. ROCK N JUNE BUG in the second flight while off the inside, chased the winner through the turn in the three path, had little left late. CARL G last
away, raced in mid pace toward the inside, tired through the stretch. TILLIS broke in good order from the outside, moved toward the inside, chased, backed
up through the lane. MORNING SNOW was finished early, four to five wide turn, outrun.

Footnotes
HUMOR ME NOW steered out midway on the first turn while three wide, dueled outside, shook clear into the lane, ridden out. IMPECCABILITY last to
leave, lagged far back toward the inside, swung out late in the final turn to widest in the drive, rallied down the middle of the strip to be up in time for the
place. DARYL'S BOLT dropped inside, raced in the second flight closest to the inside, lacked a significant closing response. PERMAFROST got clear into
the first turn, relinquished the advantage to the leader midway on that bend, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn closest to the inside, began to
weaken turning for home, continued to falter. CHROME RUN broke out, was straightened to race off the early pace, steered out five wide onto the
backstretch, moved closer the middle half then tired through the stretch. MOON OVER DUBAI forwardly placed off the inside, bothered pushed out midway
on the first turn, began to fade after a half. DOUBLE NUMBERS floated out to be five wide midway on the first turn, angled in a bit late in that turn, retreated.

Footnotes
IMPRESSOR broke out to tighten up EL GAMAR, moved up to a forward position by late backstretch, shuffled back a bit early turn, patiently handled
through the rest of bend, got through and gained command while continuing inside upper stretch, drew clear, held late. EL GEMAR squeezed back at the
start to be away slowly, lacked early speed three wide steered out four wide for the drive, finished willingly while remaining out in the strip to be getting to the
winner late. WHONEW off a step slow, trailed early, asked along, steered out four wide into the lane, finished willingly to be clear for the show. LEOLA
bumped at the break, quickly recovered to narrowly set the pace while just off the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, allowed the winner the inside
upper stretch, weakened. JOE BILL moved closer into the turn, vied three wide and between rivals turn, weakened. DALTON'S RUTROW within striking
distance while five wide into the turn, four wide when still contending late in the bend, tired through the stretch. SUNSIGN lacked speed, saved some ground
into the stretch, failed to menace. FIVE O FOX pressed the issue early while four wide and between horses, gave way midway on the turn. MALORIE'S BIG
BOY finished after a half.

Footnotes
RUM 'N TONIC allowed the pace to go early, advanced three wide to challenged into the lane, long drive, wore down rival under firm handling. R DOC with
the pace from the start, dueled through the first turn and up the backstretch closest to the inside, disposed of that rival far turn, briefly clear, responded when
the winner came alongside entering the stretch, second duel to the wire, relented late. LUCK OF THE DRAW settled in mid pack while off the inside,
between horses backstretch, came three wide for the drive, went evenly down the lane in proving no match for the top two the final furlong. XYLOPHONE
broke a step slow, trailed early two path, came three wide for the drive, improved position with some mild late interest. HAPPY BOY ROCKET hesitated at
the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back, and off the inside, four wide turning for home, went evenly down the stretch without posing a
threat. WHOOPING JAY dueled up front off the inside, alternated up front in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the final turn. TRIVISTA settled in the
second flight along the inside, faded. TWITTY CITY was finished after a half.

Footnotes
MAY DISCO in mid pack off the inside, dropped inside by late in the turn, challenged along the rail inside the drew clear. HONEYCAMP moved up along the
inside to race closest to the leader up the backstretch, moved out turn, three wide bid nearing midstretch, could not match the winner late, proved
determined for the place. QUARANTINED broke in good order, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, continued to hold a slight advantage
past the furlong marker while between the top two, proved stubborn until late. COROMANDEL broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded in good
order, broke outward to bother ROSALIE'S DESTINY, was straightened to race within striking distance while 2-3w turn, went evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing response. PAT'S GAL raced forwardly and five wide into and through the turn, went evenly through the lane to also be found lacking late.
ROSALIE'S DESTINY bothered to be off slowly, void of speed for a half, steered out for the drive, lodged a belated rally to improve position. GREER
CROSSING lacked speed well off the rail, came four wide for the drive, improved position slightly. RELENTLESS ROCKET went one paced outside, four
wide into the turn, six wide exiting, failed to muster a rally. SWEET HOLINESS forwardly placed three wide, fell back while still in the three path turn,
continued to fade through the stretch. DRIVING off a step slow, remained always back. TIZ A STRATEGY lacked speed toward rail, failed to rally.
PREORDAINED second flight and four wide, between foes, gave way.

Footnotes
OFF RAMP back off the pace while four wide into the turn, closer three wide exiting, challenged on the outside when straightened for home, long drive,
determined. JETS A GINNIN broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, held a narrow advantage into the lane, long drive, gave ground grudgingly
to the winner late, gained the nod for the place. COMEDY ACT pressed the runner up from the outside, vied between horses past the furlong marker, also
proved stubborn to the end, missed the nod for the place. SILVIA one paced while behind the lead flight, continued to pursue that group into the stretch,
altered course to the outside with less than a furlong remaining, finished up evenly. ARGUMENTAL forwardly placed inside early, fell back turn. TAKING
CHARGE DESI fell back to trail after the start, three to four wide turn, not dangerous. HARTLEY in mid pack for a half, tired when four exiting the turn.
SASSY SAGEY finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ALL WEST close from the start, ranged up to challenge in the two path second turn, dueled through the stretch, proved narrowly best while fully extended.
MYSTIC NIGHT took command after the start, continued to show the way toward the inside up the backstretch, responded when confronted by the winner
entering the stretch, dueled to the wire inside late one, proved game to the end. TEN GAUGE four wide into the first turn when back, advanced 2nd bend off
the inside, bothered behind a stricken rival upper stretch, was straightened then finished willingly when regathered the final furlong. ICE BLAST unhurried
for five furlongs, began to advance far turn, four wide into the lane, bothered soon after by the same stricken rival, finished up evenly after recovering.
JEDREK within striking distance, saved some ground second turn, bothered by the same incident in upper stretch, fell back and did not recover.
CATDADDY in the second flight while four wide in the first turn, four to five wide through the second bend, tired in the drive. BROOKLYN DIAMONDS last
away, lacked speed, altered course in upper stretch to the inside of the incident, failed to rally when straightened. U S NAVY CROSS broke back, remained
always back. MAMZOOJ in mid pack, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, went wrong soon after, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
GRAMERCY PARK bumped at the start, raced back early, three wide into the lane, advanced four to five wide late in the bend, bid just inside the furlong
marker, gained the advantage then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. SASSY LASS lightly bumped start, forwardly placed inside, shuffled
back into the turn, two path exiting the turn, rallied up the inside to be getting to the winner late. HEATED ARGUMENT prompted the early pace, advanced
and challenged in the two path midway on the turn, showed the way into and through upper stretch, weakened a bit late, narrowly saved the show. ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER prompted the pace outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting while still within a striking position into the lane, went evenly
through the lane. MS CARROLL COUNTY chased the early leader while three wide, crept a bit closer in the turn while remaining in the three path,
weakened through the stretch. LASSIE MY GIRL bumped lightly with SASSY LASS at the break, raced back and off the inside, came in the two path for the
drive, made little impact. MOCHA KISS bumped break, raced back while well wide, 5-6w turn, passed some tiring rivals with some mild late interest.
CHOCTAW CHARLIE lacked speed, four to five wide through the turn, remained back. MUSIC MISTRESS was finished early while racing off the inside.
DERBY DAY LASSIE sprinted clear after the start, gave way when headed in the turn.
