DIVINE FASHION settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, dug in
under steady stretch encouragement and took over in later yards. GOLDEN SWEETS stalked from the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
raced close in the three and four paths on the far turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch but was outfinished in later yards. TEQUILA FOG stalked off the rail,
took the lead two deep approaching the three eighths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn, but was met nearing mid-stretch and relented later yards.
DAT DARES GOLD rated close inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dueled to near even terms
mid-stretch, but was outfinished later yards. SAX raced off the rail on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little more. SHERIFF'S KID broke awkwardly then saved ground. KALENJIN took over nearing the three

opening turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. COWGIRL HOP

Footnotes
LUCYLOU WHO tapered in and stalked the pace, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep midway on the far turn, drew
clear into the lane and was kept sharp to the wire. XANTHE settled back in the three path on the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole
and improved four wide on the far turn, was brushed lightly by Alpine Moon leaving the turn but closed for second inside the sixteenth pole. MOONLIT
SHADOW took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway
on the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. ALPINE MOON settled in the three path on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn three wide, angled out and made light contact with Xanthe leaving the turn and flattened stride in the lane. THE SKY IS FALLING saved
ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. CHANGE THE
WORLD rated close off the rail on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in the
lane. AZZURRA rounded the first turn off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. YOLO CHARLOTTE stalked from the three and four
paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. SENECA ROCKS rated close inside on the opening turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. OCEAN LILLY saved ground. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim
of foul for alleged interference leaving the far turn, lodged by the rider of Alpine Moon, against the rider of Xanthe.

closed and took the lead in the four path midway on the far turn, raced clear nearing the eighth pole and was steadily handled in the lane. SHINY PENNY
rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then angled out leaving the turn and finished well to
take second later yards. DON'T TELL GRANDMA settled off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, angled out approaching
the eighth pole and left the turn in the seven path, dug in leaving the turn and got up for third under the wire. JALEBI BABY became a bit anxious in the gate
then took the lead and moved to the inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened
inside the eighth pole. KIRBY saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened
