Footnotes
JETAROS set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of SIDE EYE when that foe reached near even terms at the quarter pole and edged ahead in the lane.
SIDE EYE pressed the winner two wide, reached near even terms near the quarter pole but was turned back. MR. RHODIUM chased the pace two wide,
angled the rail in upper stretch and could only gain mildly. TWIRLING EXPRESS tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch and
finished evenly to just miss third. SOUTH SIDE was off slowly, trailed inside, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. GRAFT broke very awkwardly,
raced four wide and was never a threat. CONTINUE APACE (IRE) tracked the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
TRUE BLUE PEARL set the pace and crossed over rounding the first turn to lead in the two path into the backstretch, received a right handed cue passing
the quarter and was challenged by an outer foe while still in the two path into the lane, dug in to fend off that foe through the lane and held on. BELLA
MIURA settled up close in the four path, was under a ride in the three path around the far turn, bid from the four path into the stretch, ran on but lugged in in
the final sixteenth, and held place. TAPPLE CIDER tracked in the two path, was roused between foes around the far turn, swung out to the five path into the
stretch, and kept on for show. SHEA D SECRET rated in the five path, tipped in to the four path around the far turn, fanned out and was in the seven path at
the top of the lane, and finished evenly. ZEN (IRE) was unhurried in the four path but no factor from around the six path in the stretch. HOLY BERRIES
stalked inside but faded turning into the stretch. KUKARO trailed throughout around the two path.

Footnotes
TWIRLING GRACE raced off the duel down the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn, took over in midstretch and powered clear under a drive.
GINGER SPARKLE lacked speed while racing in the two path, swung five wide near the quarter pole and ran on down the center of the track to be clearly
second best. SHES A GIFT vied three wide down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and churned on
for the show. SHE'S OUTTA HERE dueled inside to midstretch, could not keep pace with the winner from there, appeared to have the rider injure a shoulder
near the sixteenth pole and was geared down from there. ROCK ALONG dueled between foes down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, took the
lead late on the bend but tired in the stretch. SOUTH PACIFIC chased the pace from the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and retreated. TESTED
POSITIVE broke through the starting gate, was fractious once re-loaded, broke last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EUPHORIA STAR chased in the four path, was put to a ride while tipping out to the five path early around the far turn, under urging from the six path at the
top of the lane, rallied thru the lane, and was up in the final strides. SOLAR TAP raced up close in the two path, bid from the rail under rousing and took the
lead early around the far turn, opened up into the stretch, but began to shorten inside the final furlong, and was caught late. TAPATERM bumped with an
inner foe at the start, rated in the six path, lost the whip midway around the far turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on under steady
goggle urging for show. BACH bumped with an outer foe at the start and was along the rail around the first turn, raced wellback in the three path down the
backside, was under urging in the two path around the far turn, and passed tired rivals in the stretch. DREAM OF BLESSINGS raced off the pace in the
three path, dropped back to last early down the backstretch, and was no factor from the five path in the stretch. SEBARAY set the pace in the four path but
faded in the three path turning into the stretch. READY ON THE LINE stalked in the three path, but gaveway from the four path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
DOMINATE THEMOMENT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed steadily and was up and
clear late. EVER DANGEROUS was bumped at the start, swerved very wide to avoid the faller entering the first turn, angled down to the three path midway
around the bend, raced closest to the pacesetter in the clear two wide from there, took the lead in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. CHARLES
CHROME set a clear pace inside, was collared in upper stretch and kept on well enough to hold the show and was taken in hand late while clear of the
fourth place finisher as the rider heeded the outrider's instructions to alter out after the wire. KINENOS bumped with EVER DANGEROUS at the start, raced
off the pace two and three wide and improved position in the lane. YOU TALKIN TO ME raced in range two wide, was one-paced through the lane and was
taken in hand late as the rider heeded the outrider's instructions to alter out after the wire. VAN DUSEN (GB) saved ground in midpack and lacked the
needed rally. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF steadied to avoid a fallen rider entering the first turn, raced three and four wide, never reached contention and was eased
in the lane. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL jumped a fallen rider entering the first turn, swerved out very wide afterwards, raced at least four wide toward the rear
of the field and was eased in the lane. CHAPALU had early speed at the rail, lost the rider entering the first turn, completed the course riderless and walked
off. UNO TIGER was bumped at the start, checked trying to avoid a fallen rider entering the first turn, was pulled up soon after and walked off. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE FIRST TURN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORGINAL
ORDER OF FINISH.

MERLIN vied at the rail around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch and widened under a drive. VALIANT AVENGER raced off the early pace
three wide, went five wide around the far turn and ran on widest to gain the place. THE MAR was bumped after the start, raced off the early pace four wide,
angled into the two path early on the backstretch, angled back out four wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was outfinished for the place. BOLD
MAJESTIC was bumped after the start, chased the pace two and three wide and faded in the lane. PLUMA ROJA trailed in the two path, went five wide
around the far turn and never threatened. THE KHOZAN ONE saved ground in range and retreated through the lane. COSMIC SPECULATION was
fractious in the gate, broke slowly, was bumped on both sides soon after, rushed up outside, briefly led outside of the winner, chased outside of that foe
around the far turn and faltered in the lane. GENTLEMAN GERRY was bumped between foes soon after the start, steadied entering the first turn, had some
speed three wide, angled in early on the far turn, retreated readily and was eased in the lane.

BATTLE CRY raced wellback in the four path, was ridden around the turn and bid while being floated out to the eight path into the stretch, took the lead
passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. YOUR INHERITANCE chased in the six path bid in the four path nearing the quarter pole, drifted out to the seven
path in upper stretch, evened out in the final furlong, and held place. DEM A WONDER bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path,
was challenged passing the quarter pole, tipped out to the four path into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong to show. PENS STREET trailed in the two
path, tipped out to the five path and was cued midway around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the lane, finished evenly but was unable to factor.
SIMPLIFY (ARG) bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, but gaveway into the stretch. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE raced
up close in the five path early but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
ARMONIA bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, was roused between foes early around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path into
the lane, rallied down the center and was up in closing stages. KILKENNY BELLA raced in midpack around the six path, ranged up under a ride around the
far turn and was cued from the five path at the top of the lane, ran on and briefly led before the sixteenth pole, but was overtaken by an outer rival to finish
with place honors. CONSTITUTIONALIST raced prominently in the five path, bid under coaxing in the four path around the far turn, led from the three path
at the top of the lane, but evened out late to show. WITCHING HOUR tracked in the three path, was under a nudge early around the far turn, tipped out to
the six path into the stretch, but flattened. AMOR SALVAJE was unhurried in the three path, tipped out under a drive around the far turn and was in the
seven path entering the stretch, but did not factor. I LOVE IRELAND brushed with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the three path, was roused in the
two path around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. CONNECTING FLIGHT prompted the pace in the six path, was driven between foes in the five path
rounding the far turn, floated out to the nine path into the lane, but was tired. HOOCHIE COO raced off the pace in the three path but was no factor from the
five path in the stretch. MY JO JO trailed in the four path early and never threatened. SUBTLE SENORITA was no menace around the three to five paths.
BEAUTY DESTINY broke out and brushed with an outer foe, stalked in the two path but gaveway around the far turn. APPLE LOVER broke out and
bumped with an outer foe, raced in midpack under a hold around the four path, backed up around the far turn, and was eased thru the lane.
