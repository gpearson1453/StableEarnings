Footnotes
TEN AT TWELVE vied for the early lead, cleared through the two path, came into the lane from the five path, remained clear with an eighth to go then kept
to the task to last. MAMA LOU settled early, moved up through the four path through the turn to get into contention, came into the lane from the six path with
aim on the leader then steadily inched on that one through the final eighth but ran out of real estate. WILD TAPIT trailed into the lane while in the two path,
offered a mild gain for the show spot but was not a threat to the top two. U SO MONEY BABY hustled early to engage for the lead early, dropped back
through the turn to trail the field into the lane then reengaged through the stretch to pass a couple. GOSHEN was never a threat while in the four path.
LASHES vied for the early lead while off the inside, chased the winner through the turn then was empty after straightening.

Footnotes
SPLASH OF TONIC dueled outside of a foe, bid at the quarter pole and drew off under steady urging. IWANNABEPERFECT stalked the pace in the three
path, bid at the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. AMERICA RULES was unrushed, bid six wide at the quarter pole and gained the show spot
late. NO DRAMA MOMMA dueled inside before fading in the stretch. SHES MY TREASURE was unrushed four wide and then had no late bidd. NEVER TO
MANY HUGS stalked the pace inside to the turn and faded.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S FEVER set the pace while under pressure from the inside, shook clear into the lane then drew off while being ridden out. WIN ME OVER
chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and stayed on well to gain the place spot. BLUEGRASS
PRAYER stalked the winner from the three path through the turn, had aim on the top one into the lane, could not gain on that one and lost the place spot on
the wire. FOLLOW THE MONEY was never a menace while near the inside. SPOKE pressed the winner while along the inside through the turn then faded
down the lane. FRIDAY NIGHT RIGHT never a factor while along the inside. VICTOR'S DEAL trailed into the lane while in the three or four path and never
was a factor. VENICE BEACH was done early while in the three or four path.

the pace in the two path, then faded in the stretch. TRAFALGAR SHORE saved ground to no avail. BOTOX KATIE improved position late. QUICK AND

Footnotes
POETIC VERSE set the pace from the two or the three path through the turn and into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then continued to lengthen the
advantage to the wire. SPEEDY DELIVERY raced four wide into the turn when never far back, continued closest to the winner into the lane then could not
keep up while gamely holding off the challenge for place. MY MY MUNNY was unhurried early, advanced from the four or five path through the turn and into
the lane, was a serious contender with a sixteenth to go then weakened and just barely held the show spot. RAINDROPS ON ROSES was unhurried early
while off the inside, came with interest from mid-track and just missed the show spot. LIL EVIE vied for the early lead into the turn, continued along the rail
into the lane and faded. SMOOTH JUSTICE was three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired. RATTRAPANTE was steadied
behind a checked rival, raced along the inside and never factored. NO MORE FAKE NEWS was outrun from off the inside. VOODOO JUSTICE vied for the
early lead, was checked then taken up through the turn dropping back to the back then ridden out.
