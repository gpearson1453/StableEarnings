Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, confronted KIWI'S DREAM at the
quarter pole, took command from that rival in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, kept to task while under steady urging to the
sixteenth-marker and drew away in the final stages. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) tracked the decent early pace, gained a bit of ground while two wide on the
second turn, raced three wide into the stretch, went evenly to the furlong pole, could not impact the winner in the final stages and held well in the end for
second. CHIEF JACKSON was a bit unprepared at the start, threw his head leaving the break and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced
three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the rail heading into the far turn, made a mild late bid in the stretch and was clear for third in the end. KIWI'S
DREAM (AUS) broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions while prompted by LOOKIN FOR REVENGE, felt pressure from
that rival at the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. JACKS OUTLAW tracked the early pace, raced three wide
into the backstretch run, maintained position to the half-mile marker, lost ground while three wide on the second turn, was steered five wide into the stretch
and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PARK ROAD COWBOY showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch
and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, felt pressure from KERRY GOLD inside of the sixteenth-marker, was all out to hold that one off in deep
stretch and gamely held on for the win. KERRY GOLD took back in the early going and tracked the pace to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter
marker, swung three deep into the stretch and lost ground nearing the furlong pole, closed fast in the late stages, came within aim of PARK ROAD
COWBOY inside of the sixteenth-marker, made one final surge at the finish and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. GALLAND DE BESOS
showed early speed and was forwardly placed in the early running, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker while outside of PARK ROAD COWBOY,
lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was clear in the end for third. FOYT lost his path at the start and was off a step
slowly, rushed up in the early stages, tracked the decent pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide into the stretch and tired. SILENT BULLET chased the
decent early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten.

IRISH ROYALTY was prominent in the early running, kept close attendance to the pace heading to the turn then pressed the pacesetter to the quarter
marker, took command in upper stretch, raced to a clear lead under steady urging nearing the sixteenth-marker, dug in while under pressure in deep stretch
and lasted for the win at the wire. RESPOND stalked the early pace, gained ground from the rail nearing the quarter marker, swung two wide for the drive,
ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied nicely inside of the furlong pole, put pressure on IRISH ROYALTY in deep stretch, could not quite reel in that foe and just
missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. CHILLY WILLY broke alertly, showed good early speed and set the pace to the turn, was pressed
to the quarter marker by IRISH ROYALTY, was overtaken by that rival in upper stretch, weakened inside of the furlong marker and just held at the finish for
third. KING ADROCK tracked the early pace while on a hold, advanced three wide on the turn, lost position approaching the furlong marker, gave way in the
final stages and just missed for third. APLOMBADO was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide to the quarter marker and lacked the needed late
response. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace while three wide on the turn and did not offer a
late rally.

SEATTLE BOLD broke out at the start and crowded OUR SILVER OAK, recovered and was sent to the front in the early going, set decent fractions while
well handled through the backstretch run, came under pressure from KINGMEISTER at the quarter marker, turned away that rival's effort in upper stretch,
drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole and kept to task under firm handling in the final stages to prove best. MEMO DADDY (CHI) settled while not far back
in the early running, advanced along the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, closed well inside of
the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and ran on to secure second. KINGMEISTER was forwardly placed into the first turn,
attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, confronted SEATTLE BOLD nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in that effort and lost
ground heading to mid-stretch, gave way in the late stages and was outfinished for second, while holding for third. OUR SILVER OAK was crowded at the
start by SEATTLE BOLD and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, was coaxed along three wide
into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch run and did not factor. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) stalked the decent early pace from the inside, was well
placed into the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong pole and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
EGON was forwardly placed into the first turn, steadied just after the seven furlong marker when FAST SERVICE bolted, recovered and tracked the
moderate pace to the far turn, was roused three wide nearing the top of the lane, battled with FAST SERVICE to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead at the
furlong marker, kept to task under urging to deep stretch and drew clear for the win in a good debut. FAST CHAD was allowed to settle, saved ground to the
far turn, swung four wide for the drive, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages but rallied with good interest and held safely for second.
SECRET TREASURE was allowed to settle in the early going, was well placed through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, raced five wide into the
second turn, slipped to the three path in upper stretch, improved position at the furlong pole, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and held
for third. FAST SERVICE broke alertly and dictated terms into the first turn, bolted just after the seven furlong marker and forced out BRONZE ONE,
recovered heading into the backstretch run and set the pressured pace to the far turn, was caught by EGON in upper stretch, battled with that foe to
mid-stretch, tired in the final stages and was outfinished for third. BUY THE RUMOR was a bit slow into early stride, was allowed to settle while not far back
approaching the half-mile marker, raced two wide to the quarter pole and lacked a rally in the stretch. DARK MYSTERY chased the moderate pace, came in
tight while between runners nearing the far turn, was shuffled back leaving the three furlong marker, raced five wide into the stretch and gave way. BRONZE
ONE was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was away a step slowly, showed speed and was prominent into the first turn, was forced out by
FAST SERVICE just after the seven furlong marker when that rival bolted, recovered and prompted the pace to the second turn, could not keep pace in the
stretch run and tired. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING FAST SERVICE ALONG THE FIRST TURN AND
IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THAT INCIDENT.

Footnotes
SERIOUS SECRET broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set solid fractions to the turn, rated along the bend, drew to a clear lead heading to the furlong
pole, kept to task to deep stretch and held safely in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. SUE GENEROUS stalked the decent early fractions, raced three
wide on the turn, lost position approaching the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in SERIOUS SECRET in the final stages and
bested the rest. TOM'S PIC unseated the rider prior to the start, chased the decent early pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not match
strides with the top pair in deep stretch and just held for third at the finish. VALERIE showed good early speed and raced close to the early pace, tracked
SERIOUS SECRET to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was just edged out for third at the
finish. BIKINI NATION chased from the second flight, angled to the two path entering the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a final
response. FRESNO CHILE hesitated at the start and was off slowly, trailed to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the
stretch and offered a mild late rally. CHANTELLE chased from towards the rear early on, came two wide to the quarter marker and did not factor in the
stretch run. CUTE RENEGADE chased the pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn, swung three wide into the stretch, Orozco lost his crop
at mid-stretch, and did not threaten. UNION STREET CAT chased the pace while outside of rivals into the turn, slipped to the two path heading into the
stretch and could not muster a late rally.

Footnotes
THE CALABRESE KID stalked the decent early pace, lost position on the turn while two wide, came in a bit tight approaching the top of the lane, lost
position at the furlong pole, re-rallied in the late stages, split foes at the sixteenth-marker, drew to even terms with MILEYS BLUECAT in deep stretch and
won the nod on the wire in a blanket finish. MILEYS BLUECAT was prominent in the early stages, disputed the pace to the turn with TRABIESO AVELITO
then dueled with that foe to the quarter marker, continued to battle to mid-stretch, vied for the lead at the sixteenth-marker, took a narrow advantage into
deep stretch, raced on even terms with THE CALABRESE KID in the final strides and just missed for the win, while just holding for the place. SASQUATCH
RIDE took back off of the decent early pace, raced three wide into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong pole, rallied
in deep stretch, came within aim at the sixteenth-marker, made a final surge at the finish and just missed for the win and place, while getting up to secure
the show. HAWK HILL raced close to the decent early pace, pressed the pace from a three wide path heading to the quarter marker, advanced in upper
stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was outfinished. SYNNIN AND WINNIN chased the
decent early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, came in tight in upper stretch, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, continued to have traffic issues into
deep stretch and could not muster the needed late response. TRABIESO AVELITO broke alertly and was sent to contest the early lead, battled with
MILEYS BLUECAT to the turn then dueled on the front end with that rival to the quarter pole, continued to battle for the lead to mid-stretch, was overtaken at
the sixteenth-marker and weakened in the final stages. INDIANERA lacked early speed, was keen on the run into the turn, raced two wide between rivals
along the bend, swung three wide into the stretch, closed willingly in the final stages but was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) was allowed to settle in the early going while not far back, raced two wide into the backstretch run, improved position while three
wide on the far turn, was asked for run nearing the top of the stretch and circled the field to come six wide into the drive, responded to steady urging at
mid-stretch, closed determinedly in deep stretch, reeled in ALOHA KITTEN in the final stages and edged away at the finish to prove best. ALOHA KITTEN
settled in the second flight in the early going, advanced along the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, came in tight in upper stretch and
swung three wide for the drive, ran evenly to the furlong pole while within aim, reeled in TROJAN CLUBHOUSE at the sixteenth-marker and took command
into deep stretch, was all out to hold off SIGNORINA MERISI in the final stages but was outfinished by the winner and bested the rest. TROJAN
CLUBHOUSE was asked to show early speed and assumed command heading into the first turn, set a pressured pace into the backstretch run, carved out
moderate fractions while pressed to the second turn, shook free in upper stretch, was set down at the furlong grounds, was overtaken by ALOHA KITTEN at
the sixteenth-marker, weakened in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. UNDISTURBED broke a bit awkwardly and was off a step slowly, settled
off of the decent early pace, saved ground to the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and passed tiring foes in the final stages. MADEIRA WINE was forwardly
placed while three wide into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and pressed the pace to the far turn, vied for the lead while three wide at the
quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. WORK TO LIVE tracked the decent
early pace, raced four wide into the backstretch run, was well placed to the half-mile marker, gained ground while outside of rivals nearing the quarter pole,
could not sustain that run in the stretch drive and tired in the late going. SHEZAGHOST broke alertly, was prominent into the first turn and prompted the
pace into the backstretch run, raced between rivals while attending to the pace into the far turn, vied for the lead while between foes at the quarter marker,
dropped back leaving the second turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAISSON broke well but was held near the back of the pack through the first turn and down the backstretch, was extremely wide down the backstretch then
angled into better position before the far turn, began to make steady forward progress into and through the far turn, made an eye-catching move with a
quarter mile to run, got a clear run five wide into the stretch and commenced a bold rally to just get up in time. HEAT N REHEAT broke in at the break and
brushed with BLAZING JAMIE, hustled hard to get early position into the first turn, took over the pace setting duties approaching the six furlong pole, set a
pedestrian pace to the stretch, responded when roused at the three-sixteenths marker, ran on gamely while drifting in and out but was caught in the final
yards. ATTENZIONE broke well, steadied slightly in traffic heading into the first turn, was boxed in the middle of the pack to the far turn, got clear run near
the quarter pole, responded when asked to quicken, had dead aim at the leader with a furlong to run but was unable to match strides late. EL JOY tracked in
third position but well behind the slow pace, moved forward on the far turn, started a rally from the five-sixteenths pole, swung into the stretch three or four
wide then ran on well but came up short. BLAZING JAMIE brushed with HEAT N REHEAT after the break then was sent hard to get the lead into the first
turn, seized the lead and attempted to slow down the pace, ceded the lead to HEAT N REHEAT near the six furlong marker, tracked behind the slow pace
to the turn, was hard to place down the backstretch while dodging the erratic leader, settled down then made a serious bid to challenge the leader inside of
the five-sixteenth pole but was outrun down the stretch. LOOKOUT POINT was away in good order, saved ground to the stretch, was able to muster a mild
rally but did not offer the needed late response. YOU KIDDING ME broke out at the break and brushed with TALISKER BAY then was slow into stride,
trailing the field into the first turn and down the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn, rallied from the three furlong marker but was unable to make
much of an impact against the slow pace. TALISKER BAY bumped and forced out a bit by YOU KIDDING ME then caught three wide on the first turn, raced
mid-pack down the backstretch while still wide, made a mild bid from the three furlong marker, tipped five wide into the stretch and finished evenly, unable to
improve position. DRUIDIC broke in a tangle, then was held up behind horses into the first turn, saved ground throughout but could not improve position and
was never a threat. MIDNIGHT METAL stumbled at the start, fought the rider repeatedly and was hard to place through the clubhouse turn, raced three to
four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch but was unable to summon a rally.
