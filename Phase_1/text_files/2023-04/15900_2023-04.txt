Footnotes
JESS RELOAD hightailed outside. NO RECONCILIATION never saw outside foe. NO FIRE REQUIRED long duel for place. BP TRES CARTEL good
response, not enough. A VALIANT TRADITION in hunt, weakened. HES THE PILOT no gain, no loss. MOON LARK MONEY never fully leveled. BIG RACY
KISS backed out of bid. AVERYS TREASURE tardy break. NSM JESSYSRELENTLESS reluctant to load, restless.
