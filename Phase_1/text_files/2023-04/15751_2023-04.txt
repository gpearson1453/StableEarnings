Footnotes
TIZRIK was hustled to a clear lead, challenged from inside midstretch but pulled clear when urged soon after. READTHETRANSCRIPT was kept close from
inside, challenged the leader midstretch but could not sustain his bid. INDEFENSIBLE forwardly placed outside rivals from the beginning, lacked the needed
late response. SOME DUDE broke inward, trailed, swung widest for the stretch run but had no rally. I CAN'T TELL YA hustled between rivals early, gave
way from inside on the bend.

Footnotes
SIRCORRI brushed repeatedly with GREAT PLAINES as he stalked the early pace., went for the lead outside PITAMAN leaving the bend then gradually
opened up under urging. JOEY B without early speed, angled in nearing the turn, steadily progressed along the rail, took over second inside the final
sixteenth and narrowly held his position. TRUIST rated off the early speed, lost ground fanning five wide for the stretch run, made a strong move the final
furlong but was too late. PITAMAN displayed early speed, fanned out some leaving the bend and flattened out between rivals. GREAT PLAINES brushed
repeatedly with SIRCORRI as he prompted the pace on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and flattened out for the drive. SAFE failed to menace in
a wide trip. APPLICANT chased from between rivals and had little to offer for the stretch run.

DUST DANCER was sent to gain the lead near the end of the first furlong, was challenged from outside on the bend, dueled between rivals through the lane
and held on. DEMAND RANSOM broke alertly, was overtaken from inside nearing the half mile marker, came to DUST DANCER from outside on the turn,
battled gamely through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. EMPTY HOLSTER without early speed, was two wide taking the bend, gradually angled
out for a clear path as he rally in the stretch, closed well but was too late. SWISHAWISH advanced along the rail on the turn, threatened through the stretch
but finished evenly. MON AMI FUZZIE void of speed, passed inside tired ones late. MAJESTIC ATTACK forwardly placed between rivals, came four wide
into the stretch and flattened out. CAMARGO was an early contender from outside, came widest into the stretch and gave way.

CRANKSHAFT quickly sprinted away from the rest, was under some urging inside the final furlong and proved much the best. SEMINOLE BEACH broke
inward, bumped with WILDWOOD SECRET, bobbled, gradually progressed running widest and took over second inside the last furlong. IRISH
DECLARATION well back early, picked up his pace along the rail on the turn and gradually closed the gap in the lane to gain third late. WILDWOOD
SECRET bumped at the start, chased the leader from just off the inside and slowly wore down for the drive.

Footnotes
TENSE rated between horses early, was let out leaving the bend then steadily drew away under urging in the lane to be much the best. BIG SALLY
hesitated then bore in at the break, was rushed up from inside to vie for the early lead, did not keep up leaving the turn, no match for the leader in the lane,
began to wear down in the late going but lasted for the place. TU ROYAL bumped at the start, advanced from path four on the turn, ran evenly through the
lane but proved easily best of the rest. FREEDOM ATTACK was a brief contender but began to yield from path three on the bend. COWGIRL FRANKIE
dwelt at the start and was never a factor. CANDY LOOKER bumped and squeezed briefly between rivals, advanced from inside on the turn, swung out for
the stretch run and steadily gave way. MADELYN ATTACK broke inward, bumping solidly with CANDY LOOKER then steadily faded from outside.

Footnotes
TROUBLE FINDS ME was sent to vie for the early lead between rivals, responded to urging in the stretch, drew clear and maintained control under steady
handling. IT'S GREEK TO ME in contention early from inside, gradually angled out upper stretch to gain a clear path and gained second late. BETHY
displayed early speed outside TROUBLE FINDS ME, gradually began to yield on the turn, finished evenly but was clearly best of the rest. G MONEY LIV
disputed the pace from inside but flattened out for the drive. WITCHING chased from not far off the rail, moved to the inside upper stretch and had no late
bid. MARIA'S GIFT broke outward, was steadied briefly, moved to the inside early on and failed to menace. LORI ATTACK chased from outside and was
not a factor.

SHEZ RECKLESS vied for the early lead from outside, took the lead from path three upper stretch, drifted out inside the final furlong but held on. MY
MORNING GAL in contention early between horses, advanced two wide on the bend, fanned out behind SHEZ RECKLESS into the lane, altered outside
that one soon after for a clear path, gained second inside the final sixteenth but came up short for the win. HELEN MAE'S SONG vied for the lead from
between horses on the backstretch, stayed just off the rail taking the turn and gradually wore down in the lane. LICHITA raced in contention from inside on
the backstretch, failed to keep up as she angled out through the turn, came into the stretch from path five and showed a willingness to run late. WILDCAT
BOBBIE was steadied behind traffic shortly after the break, altered to the inside, began to pick up her pace on the bend, angled out for a clear path upper
stretch and showed late interest. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE chased from just off the inside and also made up minor ground through the stretch. MISS
WINDY SLEW was an early factor, three then four wide taking the turn but gave way for the drive. BOBBIE TOO TOO displayed early speed from inside but
began to fade before finishing two furlongs.
