Footnotes
GRITTY GIRL cleared early and moved inward, led two wide into the turn then along the rail into the stretch, moved off the inside in upper stretch and held
well under a drive. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) raced up close while in-hand near the inside, tipped two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, dove down to the rail in
upper stretch and finished willingly to hold second. KATERINI chased off the inside then angled to the rail, got boxed in from the three-eighths to the
five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch, altered out at the eighth pole and finished gamely for the show. BACK ON THE STREET bobbled a bit
leaving the gate, chased three deep at the back into the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, failed to find the needed rally in the lane but got
up for a minor award. DOLLY MAY (IRE) saved ground from off the pace and failed to threaten. TRAVEL SMART got crowded between rivals early, raced
two wide at the back into the turn, ran up behind a rival near the quarter pole and had to shifted three wide leaving the bend, churned on down the lane but
failed to menace. JAMIES INHERITANCE broke out a bit at the start, tracked outside rivals then raced outside a rival in the two path into the turn, remained
two wide into the stretch and weakened. CHEERFUL CHARM forwardly placed off the rail into the turn, dropped back three then four wide on the bend and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ANYBODY'S CHOICE vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch before inching ahead at the half-mile pole, cleared midway around the bend, showed
the way two wide into the stretch, then drew away from SIDE BY SIDE in the final furlong. SIDE BY SIDE broke out a bit then stalked the top trio up the
backstretch, started to rally four wide around the bend, took aim in upper stretch, drifted to the rail in the final furlong and was no match for the winner. LULU
LEMON DROP broke out a bit then went up to contest the pace three deep, failed to keep up with the winner around the turn, chased three wide into the
lane and saved third. MONEY BABY broke a step slow, saved ground from off the pace through the turn and never rallied. OUR KENTUCKY ROSE vied
between for command, lost touch with the winner midway around the bend, chased along the rail into the stretch and weakened. BILLY GALLIVAN broke a
step slow, trailed leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SPIRIT MAKER unhurried in the two path, moved to the rail on the far turn, steered out in upper stretch, surged from outside and got up late.
MECKLENBURG (IRE) brushed leaving the gate, sped clear from inside and was keen early on, showed the way through the far turn, asked right-handed at
the top of the stretch while coming off the fence, continued clear to deep stretch, then was challenged by SPIRIT MAKER shortly after crossing the sixteenth
pole and could not fend off that rival. HUDSON RIDGE stumbled leaving the gate, settled inside, saved ground to the stretch, took aim in the final furlong but
went evenly late. RIP CITY was closest in pursuit from the two path early, asked two wide leaving the far turn and could not find more in the final furlong.
RIJEKA (IRE) traveled along the inside at the back, had his path taken by the winner entering the far turn, tipped out to the three path and failed to rally.
NEPTUNE'S STORM tracked two then three wide and flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
CURLY ESA pressed the pace from outside, headed DIVINE RASCAL on the turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch and dug in to prevail. DIVINE
RASCAL set the pace under pressure in the early going, raced on even terms with CURLY ESA around the turn and into the stretch, lost command outside
the eighth pole but battled back through the final furlong and finished a game second. BIG SPLASH raced up close from inside early, angled out around the
bend and came three wide into the stretch, moved out further in drive, finished well under right-handed urging and was gaining to the wire. QUICK INTRO
chased off the rail, angled to the rail around the bend and failed to menace. SONOFAFINCH came away slow, raced outside a rival into the turn, two wide
into the stretch and lacked a rally. KRIXUS FLASH stumbled leaving the gate, chased three then four wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BARELY FUNTIONAL broke in and bumped rival, chased two wide through the turn, tipped out and asked left-handed at the top of the stretch, drew
alongside the leaders with a furlong left to run and proved best in the final sixteenth. MOON ICE raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, challenged
two wide on the turn, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch, fought with runners on both sides into deep stretch and got outkicked by the winner.
GRAND TIGER went up to take control early and showed the way up the backstretch, met the challenge from MOON ICE on the turn, dueled into the
stretch, lost command outside the eighth pole, fought into the final sixteenth and yielded late. CALIFORNIA BAY broke a step slow, lost path before the
crossing then bobbled over the dirt, angled down to the inside while off the pace, came two wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and
summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. GET THE GOLD drifted inward leaving the gate, stalked from inside to the stretch and lacked a bid.
STYLISHLYACCLAIMED was off slow to begin, raced two wide into the turn near the back, angled over to the rail around the bend, steered out in the drive
and improved position. CALIFORNIA TIGER was off a bit slow to begin, tracked out of range two wide through the turn, moved out in the drive and flattened.
TITOS WITH A TWIST got bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace outside a rival, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. BIG
ATTITUDE broke a step slow, also settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and could not make an imapct. RED AND READY broke a step
slow the became rank early, trailed into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NICKEL NICKEL NINE stalked the pace from inside, waited behind the leaders while easing off the rail on the far turn, angled four wide into the lane,
launched a bid inside TAKE CHARGE CURLY approaching the eighth pole, gained command in the furlong grounds and drove clear. TAKE CHARGE
CURLY vied four deep into the first turn then moved back a bit to stalk the top trio from outside, drew alongside again on the far turn and took over four deep
at the quarter pole, inched ahead entering the stretch, held a short lead over NICKEL NICKEL NINE approaching the eighth pole, relinquished the lead in
midstretch and stayed on to the wire. DONTTESTYOURLUCK pressed the pace from between rivals to the far turn, took a short lead at the five-sixteenths
pole still between rivals, lost command at the quarter pole, could not kick on with the top pair in the final furlong but stayed on to earn the show honors.
BUCK OWENS tracked three deep early, angled five wide to take aim entering the stretch but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. SAMBA
FLAVOR pressed the pace three deep early, fought three deep around the far turn and weakened in the drive. LE VRON JAMES set the pace inside a pair
of rivals to the far turn, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders into the lane and gave way. BALLROOM PRINCE was off slow to
begin, trailed in the early going, moved out on the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn and was not a factor. GOLD EXPRESS scrambled
leaving the gate, pulled two wide early, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ELEUTHERA set the pace along the inside with GHOSTEM applying pressure, maintained a short lead to the top of the stretch, cleared with a furlong left to
run, met the challenge from SUNSHINE BABE in the final sixteenth and held gamely. SUNSHINE BABE trailed along the inside then moved into the two
path around the clubhouse turn, advanced between rivals in the middle stages, commenced a rally three then four wide on the far turn, drew alongside
ELEUTHERA in deep stretch but could not get by. GOLDEN AGAIN stalked the pace from inside, ridden along while saving ground behind the leaders on
the far turn, remained along the fence through the lane and finished willingly for third. GHOSTEM prompted the pace two wide throughout and flattened in
the furlong grounds. TRUE PATRIOT reserved three deep early, rounded the far turn in the two path, lacked room in upper stretch and could not threaten
once in the clear. MADIHA stalked three then two wide early, ran two then three wide around the far turn, moved to the rail in the drive and lacked a rally.
SHEZMISBEHAVING settled two wide between rivals, chased four wide through the far turn and lacked a rally. WARRIOR'S MOON sat off the pace on the
inside, cut the corner into the stretch, found traffic twice in the lane and weakened.

EDA set all the pace to the stretch, met the challenge from TEDDY'S BARINO with a furlong to go, responded to right-handed urging while drifting out and
held gamely under strong handling. TEDDY'S BARINO was off slow and bumped at the start, pulled to a forward position while angling to the inside, tipped
two wide late on the turn, drew alongside with a furlong left to run, fought gamely from outside while being floated out by the winner and could not get by.

Footnotes
BATTLE CALL dropped back early and lagged behind, was on the move four, five, then six wide outside rivals through the turn, lugged inward in the lane
and edged WARRIOR ROAD late. WARRIOR ROAD set the pace under pressure from a pair of rivals to the turn, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole, drew
away in upper stretch but was run down in the closing moments. HEARTBREAK KID hit the gate and brushed with inner rival at the start, was forced to
steadied off heels at the nine-sixteenths pole, raced along the rail then two wide into the stretch, put to left and right-handed urging in the drive and finished
willingly for the show. SNAPP DADDY was off slow from outside, sat off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, moved out and spun five wide into the
drive, bumped with inner rival in the lane and finished willingly through the final furlong but needed to find more late. PORT ROYAL brushed leaving the
gate, pressed the pace from between rivals, lost touch midway around the bend, chased two then three wide into the lane, shifted in upper stretch then got
bothered by outer rival past the eighth pole and weakened. CARPE BELLUM stalked two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the drive,
lost his path in upper stretch and could not rally once in the clear. MT. ZEROR tossed his head and came away a bit slow from inside, traveled awkwardly
crossing back onto the grass from the dirt, took the turn two wide then tipped out into the lane and failed to menace. CHARLIE'S GHOST pressed three
deep up the backstretch, chased the leader three then four wide past the five-sixteenths pole, drifted inward in upper stretch then bumped with outer rival
and weakened. MOON TIME stalked from inside, ridden along through the turn and faded out of contention.
