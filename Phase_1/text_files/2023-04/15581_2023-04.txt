Footnotes
SUGAR SHANE Led on the rail from the outset, maintained advantage until being joined at the quarter pole, brushed off foe inside the quarter pole, to the
wire willingly. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA Pressed two wide into first turn, joined rival at the quarter pole, shaken off at the eighth pole, tried lane, second best.
DYNAMIC WOMAN Tucked in from outer draw to sit in the second flight on the rail, stalked inside throughout, made mild progress in behind top duo around
the turn, finished evenly. OJO FELIZ Settled in rear, advanced up rail at the three-eighths, further gained from the quarter to the eighth pole but was unable
to fully sustain bid. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE Moved four wide around the first bend off the pace, stymied in place while three wide into the second turn,
never factored. WE WANT ANOTHER Traveled three wide into the first turn, called upon at the three-eighths but showed no improve, between rivals on the
second turn, tired into and down the lane.

Footnotes
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR Stumbled to knees at the break but quickly recovered to vie for the lead, held the rail in a duel lasting throughout the backside,
shook free from field at the quarter pole, opened up enough to hold sway through the stretch. ROCKED Settled inside in the second flight, tracked well off
the pace, commenced at the three-eighths pole by swinging three wide for clean air, picked up strongly on the wrong lead through the stretch, ran out of
time. LIL LATIGO Moved two wide into the first turn, pinched out of a spot on the first turn and drifted out, advanced inside of rivals into the turn but simply
had too much to do. EDINBURGH EXPRESS Joined two wide into the first turn and began a duel that lasted until backing out at the quarter pole, finished
evenly. TWO SOCKS MAC Hopped at the break, had no speed early, lagged far behind until the eighth pole when showing strong progress to the wire while
passing tiring. KING LEBRON Moved three wide into the first turn, carried out by troubled rival, continued to move outside in a line of three three wide,
flattened out down the stretch. BECOME AN INSIDER Had no foot early and was well off the pace, attempted to improved along the rail at the quarter pole,
failed to gain. BLUE GESSAMI Four to three wide into the first turn, backed out between horses at the three-eighths, five path into the lane, tired.

HAYNESPUN Dueled outside of a rival from the outset, kept to task throughout and into the turn, in a dogfight with nagging rival through the lane, got up in
the dying strides. BAD KARMA Worked hard to enforce positioning along the rail, maintained in duel inside throughout, battled through the lane with same
opponent, outfinished in the final yards. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY Settled well off the pace on the rail, presented some mild foot into the turn and down the
stretch to get up for show. TOTHEMOONANDBACK Stalked dueling leaders from the outset three wide, stayed in touch with foes to the eighth pole, gave
way and tired lane. MY FUNNY GAL Settled off the pace two wide, failed to improve. CHRISTA SLEW Toss head around at the break, moved well off the
early speed, never a menace. ELEMENTAL Broke in stride, got in tight and in trouble into the first turn, became far detached from the field, never became
involved, eased home.

Footnotes
BOTERO Let the hard dueling leaders go and led a race of his own into the backstretch, topped the second flight up the backstretch, commenced move at
the five-sixteenths pole by swinging to the three path, continued surged through the stretch, up inside the final fifty yards. GONE SOMEWHERE Hard sent
to duel on the outside of a rival, quarter horsed up the backstretch to an extensive lead, moved to a clear advantage at the eighth pole, overtaken inside the
sixteenth, no extra. LOW DOSE Hustled to lead inside of a rival, opened up a hefty advantage with dueling foe up the backstretch, stayed in touch despite
behind overtaken at the eighth pole, held enough for show. PALACE PRINCE Bobbled at the break, tucked in in the rear, moved up at the five-sixteenths
and continued to progress at the quarter pole, finished up willingly. GUARDING ELK CAMP Well off the pace two wide, asked at the quarter pole but idled in
the four path on the second turn, tired. FULL DRAW Broke a touch slow, forced four wide into the first turn, maintained position backside, moved to the rail
at the quarter pole, never picked up stride. PLATINUM EQUITY Traveled three wide into the first turn, dropped back at the three-eighths pole, failed to
improve.
