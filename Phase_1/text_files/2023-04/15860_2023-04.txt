MAGNETIC CHARM was well rated four wide early, made a three wide move on the turn and took over nearing the quarter pole, then drew off to prove
much the best, driving. BROBRO CORMAN set the early pace while clear, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and proved to be no match for the
winner, second best. BUFF AND SHINE was allowed to settle early, made a middle move up the inside nearing the half mile marker, weakened on the turn
and bested rest. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was reserved early, three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. RIVERBOAT BANDIT was off slowly and had no
speed, not a factor. RED DEVOLUTION had an awkward break, then chased the pace two wide and tired after a half mile.
