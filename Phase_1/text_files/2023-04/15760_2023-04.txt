Footnotes
GRAND WISER prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn, drew clear leaving the turn and was on the inside, and then widened
the margin under left handed crop urging. ZILLION stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to press the winner, but flattened out
in the drive, second best. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was rated two wide early, then came three wide into the lane and had no bid, held show award.
SNEAKINESS was off slowly, then rushed up the inside to be close up by the half mile marker, then was boxed on the turn on the inside, shuffled back and
swung out four wide leaving the turn and just missed the show award. LAST MINUTE MARIO set the early pace two wide and stopped.

KEEPING THE PEACE was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the turn, split rivals nearing the quarter pole, then made a five wide bid off the
turn and slowly edged away in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. VOUCH prompted the early pace and made a four wide bid off the turn to vie for
command, but could not match strides with the winner late, second best. TRUE GOLD was well placed along the inside, slipped through nearing the furlong
maker but needed more late. SPIN CYCLE pressed the early pace in between rivals three wide, made a bid on the turn and vied for command off the turn in
between rivals by the furlong marker and faded late. E T'S SUPER STAR was allowed to settle early, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally.
AGAINST THE ODDS bobbled at the start, chased the pace four wide, came wide into the lane and was empty. BERHANU set a pressured pace on the
inside and gave way.

JUST GOT STARTED prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the backstretch to take over, then shook clear on the turn and then
remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. SKIMBLE SHANKS was bumped at the start, settled thee wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and failed
to gain late, second best. ORASHI pressed the early pace on the inside, then shifted off the inside nearing the half mile markler, tracked the winner three
wide on the turn and weakened, bested rest. ON THE EDGE was settled early and passed the tiring rivals. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was slammed hard at
the start, then was not a threat. SPELLED WELL set a pressured pace two wide and then gave way. KAZ MUNNINGS chased the early pace and was on
the inside by the five eighths marker and stopped.

miss. GERONIMO stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but hung late, lost place wire. BUCK WILD chased the pace four wide,
five wide by the quarter pole and had a mild late rally. SHADOW CHASER was settled early on the inside, made a mild bid four wide leaving the turn but
finished evenly late. KNOCKDOWN KID tracked the pace on the inside and faded in the lane. ADY'S MUNNY was bumped hard at the start, saved ground
and had no rally. BAILEY COFFEE tracked the early pace three wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
DR GREENTHUMB was well rated towards the inside, drafted behind the front runners on the turn and eased out and made a four wide sweep leaving the
quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker and then widened the margin to the wire to prove best, driving. HE'S FANCY
FREE was four wide into the first turn, then settled on the outside and came five wide into the lane and made a bid but could not go with the winner, second
best. DON'T QUESTION ME bumped at the start, reserved early, advanced two to three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and was along for the show
award. BEFRIENDTHEENEMY was void of early speed and saved ground and improved late. WHISKIED UP set a pressured pace on the inside and
weakened in the lane. QUINCY ADAMS was settled early, two wide on the turn and lacked a rally. BARN SWALLOW tracked the pace three wide, then
went up to prompt the pace three wide and in between rivals and then weakened. HERE COMES LUCKY pressed the early pace two wide, then was in
between rivals and tired. TAKING WHAT'S MINE tracked the pace and then went up to prompt the pace four wide and then tired.
