Footnotes
LOST MY VOWCHER hugged the inner rail stalking the pace well in hand, eased out to the two path at the head of the stretch, took command outside ACE
NINE NINE in mid stretch, was under light whipping and eagerly drew away. ACE NINE NINE , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner, lost the
lead in mid stretch and finished willingly. CRUSH IT chased the pace two wide down the backstretch and on the far turn, angled three wide entering the
stretch and weakened. UP AGAINST IT stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses throughout, weakened leaving the far turn and passed tired
horses late. CAN'T PASS IT UP , outrun, raced four to five wide on the far turn. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY , four wide both turns, faltered and remained on
his left lead in the stretch. MYSTIC LINK bobbled slightly at the break, raced forwardly in the three path down the backstretch and faltered approaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD edged up nearing the half mile marker and prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, responded to strong asks and closed
in to engage in mid stretch, wrested command a sixteenth out, briefly went clear then held firm. CORA'S CHOICE , under snug hold tracking inside, shifted
out three to four wide into the lane, straightened away and made a grinding run to bridge the gap. LIL' LATE LUCK lagged well back while saving ground,
continued towards the rail advancing in mid stretch, eased out and finished up nicely. FREE ADMISSION , fractious in the gate, was backed out then re
entered, broke sharply and quickly established a clear lead, set a rated pace about two wide, was joined by the winner nearing mid stretch, battled on about
a sixteenth more then faded. DIAL FOR LOVE broke a step slow, was hustled up to the inside of a rival nearing the turn, gave hard chase around the turn
and gave way. ENKINDLE was attempting to get out a bit leaving the far turn, remained removed from the rail and came up empty.

BARISTA VIXEN , two wide the first turn, patiently stalked the pace down the backstretch, remained two wide on the far turn, eased out to the three path in
upper stretch, closed relentlessly and was up approaching the finish. ESPERANNNA , clear soon after the start, set the pace along the inner rail, failed to
switch to her right lead until the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. CARTWHEEL raced near the inner rail throughout and failed to rally in an even
effort. CAR LADY brushed with VIKING QUEEN at the start, raced near the inner rail throughout and was no factor. VIKING QUEEN brushed with CAR
LADY at the start, circled both turns three wide and lacked a rally. CHALK HILL was outrun.

HAPPY CLOUDS , patiently rated saving ground and close up to a contested pace, swung out five wide soon into the lane, closed sharply under a drive and
overtook the embattled leaders with a sixteenth to go, spurted away and was taken in hand near the wire. LIQUIDATOR attended the pace three wide,
pressed the pace outside AND WHISTLE past the three eighths, sparred between foes from the head of the lane, gained a slim advantage in mid stretch,
fought on between runners to the sixteenth marker, kept on trying and held down the place. AND WHISTLE stumbled at the break, recovered and was sent
up between horses to take command, set a pressured pace slightly off the inside, dueled inside rivals from the head of the lane to about the sixteenth pole
then gave way grudgingly. MUSICMANSANDY tracked outside rivals, ranged up four wide to engage past the five sixteenths, dueled on a narrow lead
nearing mid stretch, raced between foes soon after and gave way. TINSELTOWN TINA , off slow after bobbling, saved ground making some progress under
a ride mid turn, chased into the stretch but came up empty. JOLLY MISS JILL , between rivals nearing the half, backed off the leaders soon after and
dropped back.

CONTEMPT , between rivals and in range of the quartet of embattled leaders, was pushed along past the five sixteenths, shifted out five wide for the drive,
leveled off under left handed asks in mid stretch, continued to grind and wore down the leader to prove best through the final yards. BOX N BEN , six wide
while forwardly placed outside rivals early on, drafted in and prompted four deep under rating around the turn, responded when asked soon into the lane,
gained a slim advantage in mid stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. DELEGATED broke slowly, raced well back early and
under asking outside a rival, moved up a bit nearing the lane, altered out to about the seven path in mid stretch and finished well. DISPUTED CLAIM
disputed the pace three wide between runners around the turn, held the lead into the stretch, battled on between foes past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. MR. HOUGHTON moved to a slim lead early, dueled inside a trio of rivals, was ridden along to hold position past the five sixteenths, stayed on
as a serious contender to mid stretch then gave way stubbornly. HE'S PURE TALENT edged up early under coaxing and tracked the leading four, worked
outward past mid stretch and stayed on with interest. ADMIT NOTHING , fractious leaving the paddock and entering the track, broke slowly, raced well back
while saving ground, continued inside through the lane then had some belated handy action. RAGTIME RICHES , four then three wide early, disputed the
pace between rivals, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and retreated. MOONSET flashed speed between runners, was rated back off foes
heading to the turn, raced four wide past the five sixteenths and faded through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ITALIAN DRESSING , rated down the backstretch, was in hand in the two path on the turn waiting for room, remained inside horses through the stretch,
closed, led late and drove clear. SAINT EROS GIRL disputed the pace outside MONEY'S WORTH, opened up in mid stretch and weakened late. FAST
TRACKED , steadied in narrow quarters along the rail inside the winner near the six and a half furlongs pole, circled the turn three wide, was fanned five
wide by SHE IS WISKY in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. SHE IS WISKY , in the two path around the turn chasing the pace, drifted to the four
path turning for home, raced on her left lead until late and flattened out between rivals. FORTUNATA ITALIA raced along the inner rail on the turn and
through the stretch and weakened. MONEY'S WORTH dueled with SAINT EROS GIRL, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave
way. LIKE A PRO trailed. An objection by the rider of FAST TRACKED against the winner for alleged interference near the six furlongs pole was not
allowed.

Footnotes
OURNATIONONPARADE prompted the pace three wide, moved to command between rivals near the three eighths, was guided out a bit further as he and
ZABRACADABRA emerged in a duel into the stretch, straightened and went nose to nose under stout encouragement past mid stretch, edged away a bit
inside the sixteenth marker and held firm. ZABRACADABRA broke outward, corrected and moved up four wide to a stalking spot past the seven eighths,
remained well wide tracking into the far turn, responded when given cue soon after and bid four deep, was floated out a bit sparring outside the winner into
the stretch, fought on near even terms leaving mid stretch, saw the winner get away some late but stayed on well to the wire. VANCE SCHOLARS saved
ground in range into the backstretch, lost touch a bit while under asking into the far turn, gave hard chase into the stretch, shifted out and leveled off nicely
in the final sixteenth to gain. AIN'T DA BEER COLD grabbed command early and set the pace towards the rail, was joined by a trio to his outside leaving the
far turn, was pushed along to stay in the picture to the five sixteenths, could not go with the leaders into the stretch and faded late. AMERICAN D'ORO , in
close at the break, settled back off the pace and saved ground, dropped further back entering the far turn, worked outward in the drive but failed to generate
a solid run. AMERICAN PATROL , keyed up a bit between rivals and close up past the seven eighths, pulled his way forward two wide and between foes
past the five eighths, disputed the pace from the far turn to about the five sixteenths, was under futile pursuit into the lane and gave way.

SECRET SANCTUARY , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, maintained a clear advantage through the stretch, was under brisk urging, drifted
out inside the sixteenth pole and lasted. KERANOS , three wide the far turn, took aim on the lead in mid stretch, flattened out and angled in late. NOT AS
LUCKY AS US raced along the inner rail throughout and gave way in the stretch. SETTE STELLE , a forward factor between horses down the backstretch,
dropped back entering the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and failed to respond. START SINGIN DIXIE , four deep the first turn, chased the pace two
wide the far turn then faltered in upper stretch.
