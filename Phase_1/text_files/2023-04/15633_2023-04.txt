OVERANALYTICAL dueled for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, was all out at the wire and won under steady urging. BRITE OUTLOOK
challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, while putting forth a game effort. BOURBON DAY unhurried in the
early part, moved up between horses, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. BASTI BLUE lacked early speed, made a steady gain, finished
wide and was no real factor. SONYA KNOWS BETTER raced in the middle of the field, lacked a late rally and finished evenly. CHECK ME OUT raced within
contention, faded and went to the wire evenly. SIMPLY WOW void of early speed, improved position, but was no threat. KATS PICK lacked early speed and
was never close. NEPHI raced within striking distance and made a steady retreat. RAY'S BIG BOY raced near the middle of the field, dropped back and lost
contact with the field and walked off.

A G'S CHARLOTTE quickly went to the front, led throughout, won under steady urging and pulled clear down the stretch. SASSY BEAST pressed the pace,
challenged throughout, but couldn't get to the winner. ANOTHER HOT MESS was an early factor, eased back, made a late mild bid, but proved no match
for the top two. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME broke a step slow, racing from the rear, improved position, but was no factor. MAJESTIC WAYS near the back a the
break, moved up, within contention, faded and lacked a late kick. HANNAH'S HAVEN pressed the pace in the early part, dropped back and was outrun.

OAK HILL LG pressed the pace, racing behind DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE in the early going, took the advantage around the final turn, dueled to the wire with
BOULDERING and prevailed for the win. BOULDERING unhurried in the early part, racing outside down the backside, moved up three wide around the
second turn, collared OAK HILL LG down the lane, dueled to the wire and was outfinished for the win. ALIGNED INTEREST lacked early speed, racing
outside around the first turn and was a clear third at the wire. COURTMAN raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn, faded and finished
evenly. FLIT N FLOT TIME void of early speed and was never a factor. BET AGAIN raced within striking distance, dropped back and was no threat late.
DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE shot to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded on the inside.

Footnotes
TAYLORS TAP lacked early speed, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally and got up late. LADY DREAMER raced
in the middle of the pack, made a late inside bid, took the advantage down the stretch, but was caught late for the win. BLAME DAY raced evenly near the
back in the early going, made a wide gain, proved no match for the top two and was just up for the show. KYLE BEAUTY dueled on the front end, drove
clear around the turn and hung down the stretch. GRACIE DIAMOND showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and faded. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER
raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. NODAH lacked early speed, moved up to the middle of the field and retreated. THROWBACK pressed
the early pace and dropped back.
