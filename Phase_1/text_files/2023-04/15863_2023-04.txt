Footnotes
JUDGE HEAD matched for the lead along the rail into the stretch, responded readily when set down, gained a clear lead late and finished full of run to win
going away. HANSENATION set a pressured pace two wide into the far turn then was no match for winner but held on for second while drifting out.
BLACKTIEANDTUX close up four wide, dropped back on the far turn, swung wide then came on again five wide. OFTEN ENOUGH never far back, finished
with good courage two wide. DEER CREEK ROAD stalked the pace three then four wide and was outfinished. STONE COLD CAT unhurried early, finished
determinedly along the rail. NAMBITI unhurried early, improved position along the rail on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. SAMMY DA BULL failed
to menace.

Footnotes
PENNIESANDDIMES pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the five path, was put to a right handed whip, made the lead before the furlong
marker and proved best by a narrow margin while fully extended. PATTI LOU trailed early three wide, altered course to the eight path entering the stretch,
rallied determinedly and just missed. MISS ELLIE made the lead shortly after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was
outfinished. BUSYBEING FABULOUS stalked the pace three wide, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch then lacked the needed response.
SHANGHAI ROYALTY turned in an even effort. BONNIE'S BEST had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
AWESOMELY INSPIRED prompted the pace three then two wide into the stretch, dug in under left handed urging and proved best under strong handling.
PLAYING FOR KEEPS matched strides for the early lead along the rail, dropped back on the turn, swung out to the six path entering the stretch then came
on again to finish clear for second while gaining on the winner. FLAG RAISER away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide then along the inside into the
stretch and was outfinished. PRIMITIVO had a mild rally late two wide. PLAYING BALL allowed to settle, finished with good courage along the rail.
CONTROLLER was no threat. MARCH MAGIC was outrun. HAPPY TAKEOVER was no factor.
