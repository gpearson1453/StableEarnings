Footnotes
KINISON was unhurried around the four path early, tipped out to the six path and was cued into the far turn, ranged up rounding the far turn and took aim
from the four path at the top of the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole, took a narrow lead while drifting out passing the sixteenth, and held on. RACKET set
the pace in the two path, opened up along the rail rounding the far turn, was roused nearing the quarter pole and back in the two path at the top of the lane,
drifted out into the final furlong, and was caught nearing the final sixteenth to place. MEDIA SENSATION stalked in the five path, received left handed cues
from the four path around the far turn, shifted out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. QUICK QUICK WHIT tracked in the three path,
was under urging along the rail rounding the far turn, tipped out to the three path into the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong while staying on, and just
missed minor placings. LOCKE AND KEY had his head turned and hopped at the start, steadied early around the first turn, rated from the four path down
the backside, was roused from the three path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, but was stymied near the final
sixteenth, and evened out. PHOBIA raced in midpack around the five path, was ridden between rivals around the far turn, but flattened from the eighth path
in the stretch. DOLLAR BILL was off the pace around the two path early but never threatened. UNSTOPPABLE APPEAL trailed in the two path early and
never menaced. DECISIVE PRIDE raced up close around the four path but gaveway between foes rounding the far turn. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF LOCKE AND KEY AGAINST THE RIDER OF QUICK QUICK WHIT WAS DISALLOWED AS THE STEWARDS DETERMINED IT DID NOT CHANGE
THE RACE OUTCOME.

HOPE IN HIM opened up quickly to lead from the two path into the turn, was confidently handled around the turn and roused while tipping out to the four
path into the lane, maintained a clear advantage into the final furlong, began to shorten stride in the final sixteenth, but held on. FAMOUS GENT raced off
the pace in the five path, was ridden in the six path around the turn, and rallied outside of foes around the seven path in the stretch for place. MAJOR
WAGER rated in the two path, was under urging while angling out around the turn and in the five path at the top of the lane, kept on, and was up for show
late. RICHY was hustled along from the three path into the turn, under urging between foes from the four path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly.
ROLLING ON chased in the four path, was under coaxing from the five path around the turn, but was one paced thru the stretch. UNSOCIABLE was
prompted along inside of foes into the turn but flattened in the final furlong. NO ANGEL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
READYSEEKGO stalked in the five path, bid under a ride in the three path around the far turn, took the lead and floated out to the six path into the stretch,
and was driven clear. STARSHIP WIZARD broke well but was unhurried along the rail early, was coaxed early around the far turn, under right handed
urging while remaining inside in upper stretch, and stayed on for place. GLOBES tracked in the two path, was ridden between foes in the three path
rounding the far turn, shifted out to the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. TEPPER bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced up close in the
three path, was under coaxing in the four path around the far turn, but was one paced from the five path in the stretch. CAPTURE MI bumped with an inner
foe at the start but recovered well to lead around the first turn and set the pace in the two path down the backside, was challenged by the outer eventual
winner midway around the far turn, lost the lead going into the lane, and faded. BLUTO'S CANDY rated in the four path, was roused into the far turn, but did
not factor from the six path in the stretch. SOLAR TAP bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace around the three path but never threatened.
BIG SAVE bumped with an inner foe at the start and trail throughout from around the four to six paths.

no factor while racing two and three wide. SCHUMER set the pace in the two path around the first turn, was collared nearing the five-eighths pole, chased

down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the far turn and gave way leaving the five-sixteenths marker. EXCLUSIVE JONI was bumped at

Footnotes
OLGA stalked in the five path, bid in the four path midway around the turn, took a narrow from the three path passing the eighth pole, and held on. CAJUN
TEASE vied for the lead in the four path, stuck a neck in front from the three path rounding the turn, was headed by the outer eventual winner while in the
two path at the top of the stretch, dug in inside while losing her advantage into the final furlong, and fought on but could not get back up to finish with place,
was pulled up and vanned off . ATTHECROSSROADS chased in the three path, was under coaxing from the five path around the turn, and kept on for
show. LOOKING FOR HOPE dueled for the lead in the two path but yielded turning into the lane. CARLOTUK trailed in the four path, had to avoid a fallen
foe passing the three eighths pole, and was unable to factor. SINGING THE OLDIES tracked inside of rivals, fell around the three-eighths pole, and was
euthanized. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD A GENERAL INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE RACE PROCEEDINGS.

Footnotes
MARLEY LUCK was lightly bumped at the start, tracked the duel in the two path, angled four wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front in midstretch
and drew off under a drive. NATIONAL UNITY settled off the pace while racing three wide and ran on to gain the place. UNDALAY dueled inside of BEST
DEFENSE in the two path, was collared nearing the eighth pole and fought on to save the show. BOURBON THERAPY broke inwardly and bumped FACE
ABARRIO into the winner at the start, raced four wide and lacked the needed rally. FACE ABARRIO was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the
pace inside, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. BEST DEFENSE dueled in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and wilted.

CATATUMBO chased in the four path, ranged up under a drive rounding the far turn and bid from the five path at the top of the lane, took the lead into the
final furlong, and drew clear. GOOCH GO BRAGH bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, was coaxed into the far turn, shifted out to
the seven path into the lane, and kept on for place. INHALATION (GB) bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the five path, bid under a nudge in
the four path around the far turn, took a narrow lead but lugged in entering the lane bothering a pair of inner rivals, and evened out from the three path to
show. WARP SPEED BABY rated in the three path, was driven around the far turn and angled out to the center in upper stretch, but was one paced.
ADVANCE CASH pulled while up close in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three path around the far turn, in tight and steadied in the two path
in upper stretch, then yielded. STAGE READY trailed around the five path and never threatened. RUNAWAY HARRY set the pace in the three path, was
challenged by an outer duo while under a ride midway around the far turn, lost the lead entering the stretch, had to check along the rail just after, and was
eased. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT ACTIONS IN UPPER STRETCH
