Footnotes
COCKTAIL DREAMING attended the pace three deep early on, emerged two wide prompting outside FANCEE GRACE C leaving the turn, took over mid
turn then clear, responded when put to firmer asking and pulled away under a steady hand ride. FANCEE GRACE C took over between rivals early and set
a pressured pace, dueled inside the winner leaving the turn to mid turn, shifted out after being outkicked to the quarter pole, gave hard chase from there and
kept on with effort to preserve the place. VEGAS WILD CAT , urged along off the rail, angled four wide approaching the stretch, made a bit of progress soon
after then failed to seriously follow through. IRISH LACE stumbled at the break, raced three wide leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane and
came up empty. DON'T TELL DEREN was hard used from the gate and vied briefly inside foes, chased the leaders into and around the turn, shifted out for
the drive and faded. OJITOS BELLOS broke a step slow and was outrun.

Footnotes
CARROLL GIRL , four wide to contention nearing the seven eighths, was patiently handled three wide tracking the pace through the backstretch run, bid
three deep in hand to take over leaving the far turn, moved out to a clear lead leaving the three eighths, remained under confident handling into the lane,
responded when asked soon after and drew away under a steady hand ride. SWEET TALIA edged up three wide around the first turn and stalked, was put
to asking and bid between rivals into the far turn, chased the winner after that one cleared past the three eighths and kept on with effort to be second best.
MISS CHAMITA lagged back off the pace and under urging, circled five wide into the stretch and offered a mild response. MO FIRE broke a bit slow, was
taken four wide and advanced outside rivals mid way through the backstretch run, dropped in a bit to chase leaving the far turn but failed to generate a solid
kick through the final quarter mile. LUCKY LORRAINE broke inward, raced three wide between runners past the five eighths, moved up some and angled in
leaving the far turn, chased but came up empty. NIBBLES cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on by rivals entering the far turn, gave little
resistance and weakened. IF THEN , two wide between foes near the five furlong marker, dropped back. ANATH saved ground, faltered and was eased
late.

Footnotes
BUSTINUPISHARDTODO raced forwardly in the two path around the turn, moved three wide in upper stretch, closed steadily outside SHADOW BOX and
brushed with that one when lugging in near the finish. SHADOW BOX opened up in the two path on the turn, weakened in the drive and brushed late.
SUPERSTITIEUX saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. GREAT DAYS AHEAD , along
the inner rail around the turn while well off the pace, angled off the rail in upper stretch and failed to menace. PER DIEM , never a factor, swung to the five
path entering the stretch. URBAN BANDIT , outrun, was five deep entering the stretch then drifted to the inner rail in mid stretch. PATRIOTIC PARTY , three
deep on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
VELVET GHOST shadowed the leader under confident handling, moved alongside leaving the far turn, dueled under some rating past the five sixteenths,
took over in upper stretch then spurted clear, turned away a threat from ALBERTANO in mid stretch then bound back away under a drive. ALBERTANO ,
forwardly placed while saving ground, edged closer leaving the three eighths, swung out four wide approaching the stretch, ranged up to engage the winner
in mid stretch, had that threat denied but was clearly second best. ANTIPOISON , four wide a long way while stalking, dropped back a bit entering the lane,
found more past mid stretch, shifted in and continued with effort. HOT N SPICY LOVE saved ground off the pace, chased inside rivals leaving the five
sixteenths, eased out into the lane, worked between runners near the sixteenth pole then flattened out late. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , in range between
foes, was shuffled back nearing the far turn, dropped further back leaving the three eighths, angled out but failed to make a serious recovery. CURLINGTON
lost ground four wide to the far turn while under asking, came five wide under a ride into the stretch but failed to drum up a run. SASSY KING dropped in
early, settled off the pace then lacked a late response. MUCHACHO MACHO took over into the first turn, secured the rail and set a rated but pressured
pace, dueled leaving the three eighths, stayed on to about mid stretch then faltered through the final seventy yards.

TWEET AWAY ROBIN , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, angled farther out turning for home, closed determinedly outside HALEIGH B and
was up approaching the finish. HALEIGH B sprinted to the early lead, raced slight off the inner rail on the turn, drifted out a bit in the late going and just
missed in a game effort. BETCHA BY GOLLY raced in the two path between horses mid way on the turn, was taken to the inner rail approaching the stretch,
remained along the rail in the drive and weakened. SMART EULEE circled horses around the turn, was fanned four deep entering the stretch and faded.
QUEEN TAPITURE , outrun, swung very wide turning for home. THAT'S SOME KISS raced in the two path leaving the turn and was always outrun. LA
FAMILIA stumbled leaving the starting gate and was steadied in close quarters leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
FOOD FOODIE , three wide prompting a contested pace, moved up and bid three deep under rating after a half mile, put a head in front mid turn, went clear
into the lane, responded to strong handling in the lane and steadily pulled away through the final furlong. THAT'S MY BUSINESS vied to the inside of
MOON SIGN, was hard ridden to hold position mid turn, failed to stay with the winner leaving the quarter pole but kept on trying and held down the place.
GENERAL J R lagged well back while saving ground, continued inside while under asking into the lane and found his best stride too late. MOON SIGN
dueled two wide on a short lead outside THAT'S MY BUSINESS, ceded command between rivals mid turn, gave hard chase from the head of the stretch
and faded. ELUSIVE IMAGE stumbled at the break, regrouped and edged up through the opening quarter mile to reach a stalking spot, raced outside a rival
leaving the far turn, swung out pursuing into the stretch and gave way. MUNNIS PRETTY chased the leaders, raced three wide into the lane and dropped
back.
