Footnotes
LORD OF LIGHT took back off of the early pace while never far back, angled four wide nearing the top of the lane, closed well heading to mid-stretch,
responded to steady urging while on the left lead in the final sixteenth, drew to even terms with SGT POWELL in deep stretch and kept to task in the final
strides to prevail. SGT POWELL showed early speed and established the lead heading into the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted through the
backstretch run, maintained a narrow lead to the quarter marker, battled for the lead with LOKI OF ASGARD to mid-stretch, was confronted by LORD OF
LIGHT nearing the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished by that rival in deep stretch and just held for second at the finish. LOKI OF ASGARD was forwardly
placed into the first turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter through the backstretch run, remained close to the pace to the quarter marker, battled for
the lead with SGT POWELL to mid-stretch, was not able to match strides with the top pair in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding for third.
DO IT FOR DAVE was allowed to settle in the early running, was asked for run while widest heading into the stretch, mounted a five wide bid into the drive,
was gaining in the final furlong and just missed for third. MICKEY GOLDMILL was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, advanced
in the stretch run but could not muster the needed late response. G'S LAST CHANCE stalked the moderate pace, came within aim while three wide on the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. EASTER COMMAND settled off of the early pace while not far back, maintained position
through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, raced four wide into the far turn, could not keep pace heading into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN was asked to show early speed and pressed the solid early pace heading to the turn, kept close attendance to NEVER FOR
MONEY to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, drew to even terms inside of the furlong pole, disposed of the runner-up in deep stretch
and edged away in the final stages to prove best. NEVER FOR MONEY showed early speed and established the advantage heading to the turn, set a
pressured pace to the quarter marker while well rated, held HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN at bay to mid-stretch, battled with that foe to the sixteenth-marker,
could not keep pace in deep stretch and bested the rest. HOT RAGEOUS chased the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, was roused
three wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, did not offer a final response in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. TIP TOP
GAL was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the drive and did not threaten. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU chased the fast early pace heading to the
turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, lost position approaching the top of the lane and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY HUSTLE tracked the quick early pace, raced closest to the loose pacesetter along the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, came within
aim of HAY JUAN nearing the furlong marker, overtook that foe at mid-stretch, was kept to task heading to the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the final
stages to prevail. ALEXANDER'S DREAM took back in the early stages, raced two wide into the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, finished well
in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and was best of the rest. MY DOMINATOR chased the quick early pace from the second
flight, was roused four wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and held for third in the final
stages. DIAMOND RANGER chased the fast early pace, raced two wide along the turn, ran evenly in the drive, could not muster a late rally and missed for
third. HAY JUAN sped to the early lead, drew to a clear advantage heading to the turn, carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, was set down for
the drive in upper stretch, could not hold off HOLIDAY HUSTLE at mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. UNREAL lacked early speed, raced three
wide into the stretch and did not threaten. MESA EMPIRE came in tight soon after the break, was shuffled to the back and spotted the field in the early
stages, trailed to the quarter marker and did not factor.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SEEKING rated off of the fast early pace while not far back, advanced outside of rivals on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, lost a
bit of ground at the furlong marker, closed with a rush in deep stretch, drew to even terms with ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA inside of the sixteenth-marker,
surged in the final strides and was up in time to prevail. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA was asked to show early speed and was prominent in the run to the turn,
pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground to CAROLINA MIA in upper stretch, re-rallied in mid-stretch, drew to even terms with
CAROLINA MIA nearing the sixteenth-marker, met the late bid of ALWAYS SEEKING in deep stretch but was outfinished by that rival and held safely for
second. CAROLINA MIA showed good early speed and dictated terms into the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch,
was all out inside of the furlong marker, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished by the top two, while holding clearly for third. BUYBACK was
bumped leaving the break and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed, raced two wide to the quarter marker and did not threaten. SLACK TIDE stalked
the quick early pace, lost position on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
COUSIN RICHIE took back off of the fast early pace, traveled in the second flight through the backstretch run, loomed two wide on the second turn, came in
tight and raced in traffic in upper stretch, split foes nearing the furlong marker, took command at mid-stretch, quickly opened to a clear lead nearing the
sixteenth-marker and pulled away in the final stages to be much the best. DE LA LUNA was shuffled back at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried
through the early running, saved ground to the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, came in tight and waited for racing room at the furlong grounds,
found room inside of the furlong marker, was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure second. JERRY JEFF
WALKER settled in the second flight in the early going, lost a bit of ground along the backstretch run, re-rallied along the far turn, swung widest into the
stretch, mounted a five wide bid and came within aim at the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and was just edged for second in the final
strides, while holding safely for third. CUT ACROSS SHORTY tracked the solid early pace, was well positioned while closest to the top pair through the
backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, raced four wide into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run late
and gave way. NORTHERN JEWEL was unhurried in the early going, maintained position through the backstretch run, raced four wide into the stretch,
gained ground at mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final stages and did not threaten. MR. FIGHTER broke alertly and was sent to establish the early
lead, disputed the pace with IRISH CORN along the first turn then was pressed by that foe while carving solid fractions to the half-mile marker, continued to
face pressure from IRISH CORN to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and faded in the late going. IRISH CORN showed early speed and
contested the pace into the first turn, pressed the solid pace along the backstretch run and into the second turn, battled for the lead to the furlong marker
and tired in the late stages.

MY SUMMER DREAM was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the decent pace while three wide into the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter
marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch, took a narrow advantage at the furlong pole, kept to task to deep stretch while under firm urging and held in a
drive to prevail. LARRY'S LEGEND chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, advanced while four wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch
while still within aim, closed well in the final stages, could not catch the winner in deep stretch and ran on to secure second. TORPEDO AWAY was
unhurried in the early running, raced two wide to the quarter marker, angled out at mid-stretch, made a sustained rally in the drive, could not reel in the top
two in the final stages and was up for third. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF took back off of the early pace, improved position on the turn while two wide, swung
five wide into the stretch, closed willingly in the drive and missed for third. IRREFUTABLE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and pressed DR PESCADO to
the turn, kept close attendance to that foe heading to the quarter marker, battled for the lead nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in deep
stretch and gave way. RAGER chased from the second flight in the early going, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, came in
tight while along the rail at mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. DR PESCADO was hustled in the early stages and dictated terms to the turn, set
moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted in upper stretch, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. HEY MATE
chased the decent pace to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the stretch. EXECUTIVE CHEF was
fractious in the starting gate, lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not factor.

TALBOT BAY got off to a good start, saved ground on the rail and raced in mid-pack through the early stages, awaited room on the turn while well in hand,
got a clear path turning for home, looked to tip out around LUCKY LAD near the eighth pole then surged through an opening on the rail when that one
drifted out a bit and was up in time. LUCKY LAD broke well then took command of the early pace under a bit of a hold, led the field to the stretch, responded
when roused and repelled all challengers save for the winner. LOOKIN TO EXCEL brushed with SHARONA'S WILD BOY after the break, tracked the
pacesetter to the stretch, tipped out to the two path and ran on well down the late but was unable to get past a stubborn LUCKY LAD. SHARONA'S WILD
BOY broke out at the start and brushed slightly with LOOKIN TO EXCEL, then overcorrected in the other direction and caused INDULGE to alter path,
gathered up then raced with the early leaders, lost some ground in the turn then re-rallied, was still with a chance when behind horses in deep stretch,
tipped out and found room but was much too late. INDULGE was bothered after the start when SHARONA'S WILD BOY veered into his path and then
forced him into TALBOT BAY, fell back and chased the field to the turn, attempted to rally three wide and managed to pass a couple in the final furlong.
IDIOT'S GOLD broke well and was up close in the early running, steadied slightly just past the nine-sixteenths pole, made a three wide bid on the turn and
loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. COUNT ASHER outrun for the first quarter mile, began to make some
forward progress through the turn, came under heavy pressure approaching the five-sixteenths pole and was unable to improve position from there.
TOLONISITO away well, was close up early, came under a ride near the seven-sixteenths pole, stopped passing the three-eighths marker, was eased
through the stretch and walked off under his own power.
