TIZ HERSELF raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, moved up headed into the far
turn, raced in the three path from there and dueled in the lane to pull clear late. CHICK'S SHADOW raced off the pace on the inside through the opening
half mile, began to move up towards the end of the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far bend and dueled in the lane, giving way, much the best
of the rest. PRUDENT SONG saved ground early, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the far
turn and continued to fade in the lane. SILVER GLEN raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the second bend from the four path and faded in the stretch. SHERRY ORIENTAL trailed the field on the inside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dropped back further while racing inside around the far turn and was not a factor.

quarter pole and gained ground to get up for the win late. CAJUN CRACKER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the
leader up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and dueled to the wire, getting caught late. CAPE COD SUMMER bumped with the horses
to both sides and was squeezed back at the start, raced off the pace early, navigated the bend from the two path, launched a bid nearing the quarter,
dueled to the finish and was caught late. SUPER GREMLIN stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn
and gained ground late. MINISTER QUINN bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while racing in the three path around the bend and weakened late. I LIKE BOSTON raced in the middle of the pack between horses through
the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. SUNSPOT raced at the back of the pack through the opening
stages, navigated the bend from the three path and improved position in the stretch while never threatening. SEAX raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, moved up while racing in the five and six path around the turn and flattened out in the lane. HAPPYIZE raced off the pace on the
outside early, continued around the turn in the four path was outkicked from there. PERSONAL FINANCE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up
the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the lane. ANDY WALKS WITH ME raced off the pace on the inside through the opening
quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. DEACON ELI reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced
