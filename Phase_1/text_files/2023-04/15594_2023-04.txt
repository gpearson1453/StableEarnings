Footnotes
SPIRIT ANIMAL stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes midway around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew clear under a
drive. UNCLE ARMANDO settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner nearing the quarter
pole, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but won the place battled between foes. WINNING FACTOR saved ground off the early pace,
went three wide around the far turn, shifted further out in upper stretch, rallied widest and just missed second. TETRAGRAMMATON set the pace along the
rail, was collared near the quarter pole, fought on inside and lost second late. WATCH THE MUSIC saved ground and failed to menace. BACKWOODS
BOOGIE prompted the pace two wide and faded in the stretch. TIMMY M. played no factor while racing two and three wide. DRILLOMATIC was outrun
while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
MOONCAPTURE set the pace inside and was confidently handled rounding the turn, was roused while floating out to the four path into the lane, opened up
into the final furlong, and held on. SEA HUNTER (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate and trailed in the two path, tipped out under coaxing around the turn and
swung out to the eight path into the stretch, rallied down the center under steady urging and was up for place. AARAJ tracked in the three path, was ridden
in the four path around the turn and under urging while tipping out to the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. CRUZIN MAN prompted the pace in
the three path, was cued right handed around the turn and was in the five path entering the stretch, but was one paced. NO NAME DUDE rated along the
inside, was roused in the two path midway around the turn, but never threatened from around the three path in the stretch. SYNDICATED (GB) chased in
the three path, was asked for more run midway around the turn, but was no menace.

wide, could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the place. YOU LOOKING AT ME chased the pace in the two path, angled
four wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. SO OVER IT was up close inside and weakened in the lane. TROTTING GEAR broke in a tangle,
raced three wide and never threatened. EGOZ UNIT played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
AVANT GLORY brushed with an inner foe leaving the gate but broke well and vied for the lead under a hold around the four path into the turn, took a narrow
advantage from the three path midway around the turn and was cued right handed while floating out to the five path into the lane, and was driven clear.
ROUGH ENTRY stalked along the inside but was steadied into the turn, was under coaxing around from the two path rounding the turn, tipped out to the six
path into the lane, and kept on for place. HE'S IN CHARGE dueled for the lead in the two path and tipped inside into the turn, was under rousing along the
rail midway around the turn and ridden from the two path into the stretch, evened out inside the final furlong, but held show. ADVANCE CASH brushed with
an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, tipped out into the turn and bumped an outer foe, was under right handed urging in the four path around
the turn, and floated out to the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. FEELTHEBEAT rated in the five path but was bumped out to the six path by an
inner foe into the turn, and never threatened from around the seven path in the stretch. CROSS HASTE chased around the two path but was no menace.

was one-paced through the stretch. HEY BOSS failed to menace while racing two wide. QUANTUM THEORY was off bit slowly, raced three and four wide
and never threatened. UPSTART GENTLEMAN trailed inside and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
ANY PORT tracked in the three path, tipped out to the five path and ranged up around the far turn, bid into the stretch, was brushed by an inner foe nearing
the sixteenth pole, and inched ahead. UNA LUNA rated in the two path, tipped out under a nudge around the far turn and was cued right handed while
shifting out to the six path into the lane, and ran on under right handed encouragement to nail an inner rival for place. JUDGE JUDITH set the pace in the
two path, floated out around the turn and was cued around the four path at the top of the lane, dug in when challenged by an outer foe approaching the
eighth pole, brushed that foe while losing the lead nearing the final sixteenth, and yielded late to be caught by another outer foe to finish with show.
PRETTYKEEN trailed along the inside and was roused into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, but was unable to factor. PASSION
PLUS prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn and from around the four path into the backstretch, was under coaxing midway around the
far turn, but faded from the five path in the stretch. MIA CAMILA stalked along the inside and was coaxed from the rail into the far turn, but was empty
entering the lane, pulled up on the gallop out and was vanned off.

RACE CRAFT stalked the pace four wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of FLY THE W to midstretch, edged away from that foe
nearing the sixteenth pole and withheld a late charge from the runner-up. CONGLOMERATE settled off the pace while racing two wide, remained in
midpack while going three wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied. FLY THE W settled off the early pace four wide,
advanced five wide around the far turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. JACK THE CAT
raced in range three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. A ROSE FOR RAVEN saved ground and failed to menace.
WICKED FINN set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. MOMZA broke a bit awkwardly and made little impact while
racing three wide around the first turn and five wide around the far turn. SOUPER ENERGIZER pressed the pace three wide between foes, continued on the
left lead in the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
SHEKKY SHEBAZ stalked in the two path, was coaxed around the five path turning into the lane, bid passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. SILENT
POET raced up close in the four path, was cued right handed midway around the turn and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place.
MAYA PRINCE rated in the three path, was ridden around the turn and in the two path at the top of the stretch, and kept on while tipping out in the final
furlong for show. COPPOLA bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path and was under right handed urging rounding the turn, swung out
to the seven path into the lane, and stayed on but just missed minor rewards. CLASSICSTATEOFMIND set the pace inside, was put to ride in the two path
into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. CHESS MASTER was hustled off the pace in the four path, roused between foes nearing the quarter pole
and angled out to the seven path entering the lane. but was no factor. KLUGMAN raced wellback in the two path but never threatened from around the three
path in the stretch. OMAHA CITY travelled off the pace in the six path but was never a menace. WARP RIDE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in
the three path, shifted to the rail and was under a ride around the turn, tipped back out to the four path into the stretch, but had to check and steady to avoid
a distressed rival nearing the final sixteenth. MEETMEINKINGSTON prompted the pace in the two path, was under coaxing in the three path entering the
stretch, pulled up under distress just past the eighth pole, and was euthanized.

Footnotes
SOPHIA'S STORM dueled three wide to upper stretch then drew off under a drive. RAIN settled in range while racing three wide and ran on to be clearly
second best. AMAZING TRIP hit the starting gate, advanced five wide around the turn and was along for the show. GHOSTLY NIGHT raced off the pace
outside, edged closer four wide around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. MABEE LUCKYNWILD dueled at the rail down the backstretch,
chased inside around the turn and faded through the stretch. CHASING JOY dueled two wide between foes down the backstretch, vied inside of the winner
while in the two path around the turn and tired in the drive. DOMINEERING saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and never
threatened. RED WIND played no factor while racing two and three wide. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL bumped with THE GREAT KATH at the start, raced four
wide and was never involved. THE GREAT KATH was bumped at the start then had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
GET SMOKIN set the pace inside, was roused from the two path turning into the stretch, dug in gamely when challenged by an outer foe into the final
furlong, and held on under right handed urging. SARATOGA FLASH bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack around the four path, was
roused midway around the far turn and took aim from the five path at the top of the lane, ran on to bid under left handed urging into the final furlong, but was
denied by the inner pacesetter to finish with place. SANCTIFIED bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was under coaxing around
the far turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. MAX K. O. tracked in the two path, waited for room around the far turn,
tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, and stayed on. WHISPER NOT (GB) had to check in the four path midway around the first turn, rated in the
two path but steadied early down the backstretch, was under a drive in the four path turning into the lane, and finished evenly. HEAVEN STREET stalked in
the four path, was cued nearing the quarter pole and floated out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. AIRSPEED VELOCITY prompted the
pace in the three path, was ridden around the far turn and still in the three path at the top of the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. VALUE
PROPOSITION (GB) settled in midpack along the inside, waited for room along the rail rounding the far turn, was cued left handed from the three path at
the top of the lane, but was no factor. RED DANGER checked from the five path midway around the first turn and raced off the pace in the four path down
the backside, was under a drive around the far turn and swung out to the seven path into the stretch, but did not threaten. PROVEN STRATEGIES was
steadied in the three path rounding the first turn and raced wellback along the inside down the backstretch, had to steady again midway down the
backstretch, and could never get involved. SAFE CONDUCT raced up close in the two path but gaveway into the lane. SIGILOSO was off the pace and out
in the eight path while under a hold around the first turn, remained out in the center down the backside and was no menace in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS set the pace in the two path and drew off while ridden out in the stretch. QUEEN KARIMA chased the winner in the three path,
was no match for that foe but held clear of the rest. OOLONG HAI (IRE) raced four wide in midpack and was along for the show. SECRET MONEY was off
slowly, raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. NO ACTION failed to menace while racing three wide. TAORMINA
steadied off heels midway down the backstretch, saved ground and never threatened. SIGN OF BEAUTY was outrun inside. WARDOG (IRE) played no
factor while racing four wide. CHLOE'S TOY bumped with EILAT not long after the start, chased the pace in the two path and came up empty in the lane.
EILAT bumped early, chased the pace three wide and faltered in upper stretch. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THE FINAL MARGINS ARE
CHARTCALLER ESTIMATES.
