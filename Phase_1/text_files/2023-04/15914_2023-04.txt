Footnotes
MUNGO MAGIC sped to the early lead, hugged the rail around the turn while setting a pressured pace, opened up in mid stretch and lasted. DISTANT FIRE
chased the pace, raced along the inner rail leaving the turn, swung outside near the eighth pole and rallied. SPUNKY IRISHMAN bumped with DA BEERS
ON ICE leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and rallied mildly. WHERE'S RAY , three wide in good
position on the turn, failed to rally in an even effort. NEUTRAL broke slowly, was well back for five furlongs, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and
showed mild, late interest. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER , three wide on the turn, was outrun. DA BEERS ON ICE bumped with SPUNKY IRISHMAN at the
break, raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. GOLDEN REMEDY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BELLA BETTINA settled off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner advancing into the stretch, came out leaving mid stretch, shifted back in to sustain
under right handed asks, took over in deep stretch and drew clear in the final yards. O SHAUGHESEY had speed then rated back off of the leader, tracked
outside a rival, responded when given her cue and went up to engage GATITA SUAVE entering the lane, kicked clear four wide leaving the three sixteenths,
kept on gamely but could not contain the winner. GATITA SUAVE broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated outside foes to take command, cleared off
and dropped in to set the pace, was joined nearing the stretch, stayed on to about mid stretch and faded. FULL OF ATTITUDE chased two wide, angled five
wide in upper stretch but lacked a serious response. SHE'LL MAKE WAVES showed speed but could not quicken with the leader heading to the turn,
chased inside and gave way in upper stretch. BRUMMAGEM , three wide mid turn, dropped back. MIZ THE BEST , off last after hopping in the air, dropped
far back and never got involved.

Footnotes
TAM CHAR broke sharply and got into a pace battle to the outside of ROCK ROSE in the opening yards, was nicely handled into and around the turn,
responded to right then left handed asks inside the furlong grounds and shook clear in the final strides. ROCK ROSE , quickly to contention, dueled on near
even terms to the inside of the winner for five furlongs, gave way grudgingly in deep stretch and remained clear of the rest. LADY JEAN broke slowly,
regrouped and edged up while saving ground into the turn, took closer order past the five sixteenths, worked outward for room into the lane, straightened to
be about four wide, chased past mid stretch but came up empty late. LITTLE MS SCARLET drafted back early, lost ground four wide, lacked a stretch kick
and was reported by the stewards to have bled. SHINELIKEADIAMOND , away alertly, tracked the duelers while three wide, came under pressure past the
five sixteenths, lacked a punch in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CARVELLIAN QUEST stalked the pace outside NORTH HIGHLAND, overtook that one leaving the turn, opened up in mid stretch and was under some mild
urging. HAY CHIEF lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, was fanned five deep entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside foes. SNEAKING
SUSPICION lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, moved to the four path turning for home and passed tired rivals. HIALEAH NATIVE advanced
three deep mid way on the turn and tired in the stretch. NORTH HIGHLAND , right to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, was done in upper stretch
and faltered. CARICO , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, gave way in upper stretch. IMAGINE IT was outrun. SCORESTOSETTLE , a brief
factor along the inner rail down the back stretch, dropped back on the turn and was eased late.

wide past the three sixteenths, leveled off under a drive near the sixteenth marker, overtook a pair to her inside soon after and drew out.

the three eighths, came back out for the drive, rebid between foes near the sixteenth marker and kept on gamely to be second best. CORA'S CHOICE

turn, came into the lane off the inside and well clear, kept on past the eighth pole, was taken on a sixteenth later and weakened. SUGAR SIN had speed
then rated back off the leaders in the opening furlong, advanced four wide nearing the quarter pole, chased to mid stretch then gave way. LIL' LATE LUCK ,
bumped at the break, lost ground four wide outside rival, came seven wide for the drive, altered in and failed to menace. VOODOO PRIESTESS , inside,
failed to respond.

Footnotes
SALAGADOOLA dropped in early and settled off of a contested pace, steadily advanced leaving the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, closed in under
right handed asks, moved to command inside rivals nearing the sixteenth marker and drew clear. THE HAUNTED ROOM broke outward, corrected and
edged up wide into the first turn and stalked, took closer order past the five sixteenths, moved to engage soon after, dueled on a slim lead past the furlong
grounds then gave way grudgingly. SHAOLIN sped clear early, set the pace removed from the inside, handled outside pressure through the backstretch run
and leaving the far turn, dug in when collared by THE HAUNTED ROOM approaching the stretch, battled on between foes past mid stretch and gave way
grudgingly. MUSICAL CAT rated back to be just off the leaders leaving the seven eighths, saved ground tracking, moved to the inside of rival near the five
sixteenths, swung out five wide for a clear run in upper stretch, loomed heading to mid stretch then flattened out. SWEET TALIA pressed the pace three
wide outside SHAOLIN, was under asking trying to keep pace past the three furlong marker, failed to go on with the leaders in upper stretch and weakened.
LUCKY LORRAINE , in the clear nearing the far turn, failed to respond. MO FIRE , four wide early, faltered.
