Footnotes
KITTEN'S CLOWN raced in the second flight in tight between rivals, was roused two wide leaving the bend, engaged LAWMAKER from outside in the lane
and gradually edged ahead inside the last furlong. LAWMAKER moved clear at the end of the first sixteenth, was challenged from outside in the stretch,
battled gamely in tight quarters along the rail, did not have enough left but was clearly second best. PAYNT BY LETTERS hesitated then made a small leap
from the gate, gradually advanced widest, took over third upper stretch, was no match for the top pair but steadily lengthened his hold for the show in the
late going. MAMAS HOME COOKING somewhat unruly in the gate, pressed the early pace three wide but wore down the last quarter mile. DURANGO
CHROME hustled along from inside, found himself boxed in approaching and through the bend then also yielded for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT rated three wide between rivals, took over when allowed on the bend then steadily opened up under urging in the lane. NEXT TIME YOU
WIN raced in the second flight just outside TRIPLE SCOUT, did not keep up on the turn, rallied belatedly four wide and caught G CITY WARRIOR for
second near the wire. G CITY WARRIOR prompted the pace from inside, was no match for TRIPLE SCOUT when set down for the drive, began to wear
down late and was outfinished for the place. ALMAFUERTE prominent from outside, lost ground four and five wide taking the turn, was also closing in on
the weakening G CITY WARRIOR deep stretch but came up a bit short. BOBBIE TOO TOO was hustled to the early lead but began to wear down between
rivals the las two furlongs.

Footnotes
LASTFORTINOFAMILY shared the early lead just off inside, did not stay with CAMPAIGN SPY after a half mile, took the rail into the second bend, came
again in close quarters from inside in the lane and got up in time. CAMPAIGN SPY advanced three wide on the backstretch to gain a clear lead after a half
mile, was challenged from both sides in the stretch, fought gamely in tight quarters between rivals and finished on even terms with LASTFORTINOFAMILY.
READY REDDING displayed early speed just outside LASTFORTINOFAMILY, also did not stay with CAMPAIGN SPY after a half mile, came again three
wide into the stretch then battled on the front in close quarters with the latter until near the wire. LEMON BLITZ was kept close from inside, came off the rail
some on the second bend, moved out widest at the top of the lane and found best stride too late. AMERICAN SUCCESS soon trailed from along or just off
the inside, also moved outside upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. MY GUITAR in contention early just off the inside, angled out some on
the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and gave way. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.

GREAT PLAINES broke on top, showed the way in hand, was just off the inside taking the turn, floated out some for the stretch run, opened up under urging
and was kept to task until the final sixteenth. B G ATTACK bumped with SKIP AWAY CARTER at the break, raced closest to GREAT PLAINES, saved
ground taking the bend and proved easily second best. BLEEDING BLUE in contention early, angled out three wide with a half mile to go, stayed off the rail
taking the turn, drifted out to the middle of the track for the drive, ran evenly and was unchallenged for the show. SKIP AWAY CARTER was bumped at the
start, checked behind KINGSBURRY ATTACK into the bend and had no stretch bid. KINGSBURRY ATTACK chased from outside, angled to the inside
entering the turn and had little to offer for the drive.

Footnotes
SOME DUDE rated from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the bend, was carried out further entering the lane, took the lead and gradually
lengthened command under urging. I CAN'T TELL YA raced in the second flight from outside, was three wide on the turn, forced out by the drifting CALL
ME DROSSEL into the stretch and took over second with seventy yards to go. ARGYBARGY BUCK hesitated at the start, advanced from inside, angled out
to the middle of the track upper stretch and caught CALL ME DROSSEL for third near the wire. CALL ME DROSSEL soon moved clear, stayed just off the
inside taking the bend, drifted out entering the lane and began to wear down. COPPER CROSSING broke alertly, was soon overtaken, saved ground
through the turn and flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
OWEN'S PLEASURE hustled from the gate, was steadied in traffic after a sixteenth of a mile, advanced from inside on the turn, continued her bid from
inside in the lane, drifted out in the waning yards but caught DELIGHTFUL BREEZE in the final strides. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE soon had a clear lead, was
just off the rail taking the bend, began to gradually drift out nearing the final furlong, held a straight path the last sixteenth but did not have enough left.
RACETOTHEFINISH prominent from the beginning, took over second just outside DELIGHTFUL BREEZE on the turn, weakened for the drive but was
easily best of the others. I LUV THIS BAR helped prompt the pace from between rivals on the backstretch but faded just off the inside on the bend.
GHAALEB'S DOMAIN raced in the second flight from outside and gave way widest the last quarter mile.

Footnotes
PECOS AUTUMN was kept close from outside, took the advantage three wide on the turn, lugged in some under right-handed pressure as she moved clear
inside the final furlong and kept MINI DRESS at bay. MINI DRESS without early speed, picked up her pace four wide through the bend, threatened with an
eighth of a mile left but lacked the needed late kick. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN broke inward, progressed from inside on the turn, rallied two wide between horses
upper stretch, did not sustain her bid inside the last furlong, angled out some for a clear path with a sixteenth left and finished evenly. LORI ATTACK hustled
along between horses in the early going, improved position behind PECOS AUTUMN on the bend, altered out twice for racing room in the lane but leveled
off in the late going. G MONEY LIV overcame crowding at the start to gain the lead from inside, was overtaken approaching the end of three furlongs and
flattened out for the drive. ARNEIS chased from between rivals, began to retreat just off the rail on the turn, was quickly altered out and steadied to avoid the
stricken PRETTY GITA with a quarter mile to go and had little to offer for the stretch run. NIFF showed little in a ground-saving trip. PRETTY GITA pressed
the early pace from just off the inside, sustain an injury on the bend, was pulled up and vanned off.
