Footnotes
SWEET CHERRY PIE rushed to set the pace inside of a trio of vying rivals early on, showed the way inside of only a pair of pressing foes around the turn,
shook free of them in upper stretch, drew clear while hanging on his left lead, changed over inside the final furlong, and held sway safely. GLOBAL STAGE
prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch, sustained pressure three wide leaving the three furlong pole, ranged up to the leading pair to bid turning
for home, but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart in upper stretch, and chased that foe home well to prove second best. CAPE TRAFALGAR
was on his toes in the post parade, took a light brush from an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead two wide and between horses while racing well in the
bit, sparred between a pair of foes around the turn, but yielded to them in upper stretch. NASTY HABIT prompted the pace three wide and between horses,
but failed to keep pace with those foes at the three furlong pole, lost ground around the turn, yet kept on through the lane to maintain fourth. FOREVER
COOL hit the inner half of the gate while breaking slowly, chased along the inside, was urged in the two path around the turn, and lacked a bid.
BROKENHEARTED brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked in the three path early on, but yielded in the four path around the turn. ICEATUDE raced
towards the rear in the five path around the turn, and made little impact. REDEMPTION TIME saved ground towards the back of the group, but tired.

INSOLITO set the pace along the inside, sparred with an outer bidder around the turn, got headed turning for home, yet regained an advantage from his
drifting counterpart entering the lane, shook free in upper stretch, and held sway. RIVOLI bumped with an inner rival, stalked two wide and between horses,
came under a driven at the three furlong pole, tipped a bit further out while running on in the final furlong, and gained place late. TALKIN PHAROAH
prompted the pace two wide, vied outside of the leader while remaining a path away from that foe around the turn, forged an advantage turning for home
before drifting to the four path nearing the lane, got re-headed by his inner counterpart entering it, failed to keep pace with coming to midstretch, weakened
late, and narrowly saved show. ST. ELMO broke a beat slow before lacking a response to strong urging from the rider soon after, raced far back along the
inside, took the turn in the two path, then offered late rally between horses through the final furlong, and just missed reaching show. MASK PATROL tracked
four wide, then outside of a pair of foes while in the four path around the turn, spun in to the lane in the five path, but lacked a rally before yielding.
COLLECT FROM IKE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, and faded. HEY RIVER broke a step slow, raced far back, retreated
to trail in the six path at the three furlong pole, then surpassed tired rivals. NORTHWIND tracked three wide and between horses, but gave way at the three

Footnotes
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to engage the pace setter two wide at the three furlong pole, bid in the three path
entering the lane, led at the three sixteenths pole, and drew clear through the final furlong. KEY TO SUCCESS broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the
three path, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed for that position. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY pursued
from midpack in the four path and between horses, ran on along with an outer rival while hanging on his left lead between horses, bid for place with that one
at the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished. TELL ME WHEN set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist the eventual winner's bid entering the lane, got
headed at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened through the closing stages. FRIGID LADY broke a step slow, tracked along the inside, and gave way.
MEAN SUE failed to factor from the two path. MISS TAPPY TONE broke a step slow, failed to keep pace with the rest of the group while under strong
urging in the three path around the turn, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and surpassed tired rivalls. CHASING AFTER YOU stalked two to three wide, and
weakened between horses turning for home. BLAME IT ON PARIS lacked speed in the five path, got floated six wide entering the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
HE'S A ANGEL steadied out of crowded quarters approaching the first turn, stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the embattled leading pair in upper
stretch, grinded away to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead. COACH PETRO prompted the pace two wide while in the three path, vied around the
far turn, led turning for home before an outer rival challenged at the quarter pole, sparred with that one through the like, subtly shook free leaving the
sixteenth pole, but was bested by an outer bidder late. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS laid off of the pace in the three path, gained on the main flight in the
four path around the far turn, but lugged in slightly while failing to keep pace with the eventual winner's charge in upper stretch, yet ran on to gain show late.
BON BUENO tracked in the five path, bid three wide turning for home, sparred with an inner foe through the lane, but faltered between horses entering the
final sixteenth. PACE lacked speed in the two path, then improved by splitting foes entering the lane. NAVY CROSS broke slowly, raced at the rear in the
three path, gained between horses around the far turn, but leveled off through the lane. EMERGENCY RESPONSE set the pace in the two path as an outer
rival applied pressure, then gave way at the quarter pole. TEXAS TED failed to factor while hung six to five wide. NOBLE CONNECTION tracked two wide
and between horses, chased the main group around the far turn, and weakened. LUCKY'S LANE bobbled while off slow, and was outrun along the inside.
ELECTROMAGNETIC stalked in the four path, but weakened between horses with a half mile to go, and was done early. CLOSE KNIT broke a step slow
saved ground off of the pace, but weakened, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ALLAMERICANBEAUTY saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room around the far turn, bullied his way three wide while bumping foes in upper
stretch, offered a rally between horses, and reeled in the leaders nearing the wire. MRS. ASTOR tracked along the inside, shifted three wide and between
horses entering the backstretch, gained in pursuit of the clear leader around the far turn, failed to progress in upper stretch, yet closed in as that foe tired in
the final furlong, bid along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth, but got outfinished. SAFEEN set the pace along the inside, shook free entering the far
turn, drew away turning for home, but hung on her left lead through the lane, tired in the final furlong, and was caught approaching the wire. MALLEYMOO
laid off of the pace in the four path, tucked two wide down the backstretch, checked back out four wide turning for home, took a bump from an inner rival in
upper stretch, yet sustained a rally through the final furlong, but did not have enough. STRIKINGLY SPUN trailed, gained in the four to five paths around the
far turn, and rallied willingly outside of rivals through the lane. WONDERFULL LADY (FR) laid off of the pace in the two path, split foes through tight quarters
two to three wide turning for home, got jostled by an inner rival into an outer foe in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE stalked along
the inside, but weakened. KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF was forwardly placed four to three wide, claimed place into the far turn before tucking two wide turning
for home, but weakened in upper stretch. EMBRACE ME stalked three to two wide and between horses, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader at the
three furlong pole, and steadied out of tight quarters between horses while fading at the five sixteenths marker. C C CRUISE CONTROL stalked two wide
and between horses, but failed to sustain that position entering the backstretch, and steadily faded. AROUND THE SUN pursued from midpack in the five to
four paths around the first turn, and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE tracked along the inside while under snug hold behind the leaders around the first turn, patiently bided time while saving ground
around the far turn, remained blocked while committed to a rail charge entering the lane, slipped through a very tight seam leaving the furlong grounds,
struck the front nearing the final sixteenth, and kicked clear. SHE'S KEEN set the pace along the inside, subtly vacated the rail while clinging to a margin in
upper stretch, which allowed the eventual winner to slip through passing the furlong pole, got outkicked soon after, and held place late. ACADEMIC HONOR
stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn, bid turning for home, failed to gain even terms before getting outkicked by a rail bidding rival in the final
furlong, and was fended off for place. INVENTING laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, was urged four wide and outside of the main
group while within striking range around the far turn, but lacked the needed punch. BEACHFRONT BID tugged to prompt the pace two wide and between
horses around the first turn, but faded with a quarter mile to go. MYTOWN MYRULES tracked four wide, but trailed the short field entering the far turn, and
was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
LOVE REIGNS (IRE) saved ground off the pace, was stymied behind rivals in upper stretch, steadied hard at the three sixteenths pole, shifted in to launch
her rally in midstretch, surged between horses entering the final sixteenth, and drove past the leader in the closing strides. LADY HOLLYWOOD (GB)
tracked three wide, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, drove clear soon after, but was caught by her inner stable-mate
late. MY SWEET AFFAIR settled far back in the three path, split foes five wide at the furlong grounds, rallied between horses through the late stages, but
missed reaching place. AMERICAN APPLE got hung in the five path while off of the pace, spun into the lane in the six path, and stayed on. SASSY
NATURE tracked along the inside, shifted off of the rail while chasing coming to midstretch, but was outkicked among foes soon after, and lacked a bid.
JUST A CARE (IRE) pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses, fanned five wide entering the lane, and offered a mild kick between
horses. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL rushed to the fore from between horses, set the pace along the inside, shook clear entering the lane, but was headed by an
outer bidder passing the furlong pole, and faltered inside of foes late. STONE SILENT stalked behind the leaders from the two path, tipped three wide
entering the lane, but got outkicked by rivals on either side while put to tight quarters leaving the three sixteenths pole, and faded. CAMP AKEELA lacked
speed in the four path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and made little impact. TWIRLED pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the
leader entering the lane, and caved between horses. ALLURING ANGEL (GB) bobbled at the start and lagged well behind throughout.

PRAISE AND HONOR stalked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner CHEETARA (CHI) through the lane, and narrowly prevailed.
CHEETARA (CHI) pressed two wide, bid for the lead along with an outer PRAISE AND HONOR turning for home, battled gamely with that one through the
late, but was bested. CHI TOWN LADY bumped the outer half of the gate upon leaving it, raced far back in the four path into the turn, moved forward while
fanning to the six path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes through while in pursuit of the embattled leading pair in the final furlong, but ran out of ground
late. BE LIKE WATER lacked speed along the inside, retreated to trail the field in the two path around the turn, then stayed on well between horses while
hanging on her left lead. TRAVEL COLUMN set the pace along the inside, was confronted by a pair of challengers turning for home, got headed in upper
stretch, and weakened. SECRETLY WICKED pursued from midpack in the three to five paths, and failed to factor. RICHEBOURG tracked along the inside,
but faded. NOVEL SQUALL dropped back between horses soon after the start, saved ground off of the pace, but tired.

Footnotes
CHEZ PIERRE (FR) set the pace along the inside, allowed a head-strong outer rival to clear leaving the nine-sixteenths pole, re-engaged that foe from the
outside turning for home, gained an advantage once again in upper stretch, and kicked away with good energy. MODERN GAMES (IRE) settled off of the
pace in the three path, was urged to launch a rally in the two to three paths around the far turn, did so with a good kick in the five path in the final furlong,
gained place inside the final sixteenth while too late to catch the well-traveling leader, and fended off an outer bidder for place late. UP TO THE MARK was
antsy in the post parade, laid off of the pace in the two path, failed to gain in the four path around the far turn, spun into the lane in the six path, rallied in the
eight path in the final furlong, but was kept at bay for place through the closing stages. CABO SPIRIT stalked outside of the top pair, gained place in pursuit
of the clearing leader passing the furlong pole after flopping back to his left lead, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. SPEAKING
SCOUT saved ground far back, but to no avail. DR ZEMPF (GB) prompted the pace two wide, tugged keenly down the backstretch, pulled to the front at the
nine sixteenths pole, cleared approaching the far turn, but met the early pace-setter's re-bid turning for home, got headed in upper stretch, and gave way.
EMMANUEL broke slowly, trailed two to three wide, and failed to factor. IN LOVE (BRZ) lacked speed two wide, and got outrun.

Footnotes
BOURBON RESOLVE stalked three wide, bid in the four path between horses turning for home, failed to gain even terms while hanging on his left lead
through midstretch, yet changed over inside the final sixteenth and forged an advantage late. MR MCGREGOR set the pace inside of a vying foe, met a trio
of bids turning for home, dug into cling to an advantage through midstretch, but was bested late. TSHIEBWE tracked four wide, bid in the five path turning
for home, but chased inner rivals through the lane while hanging on his left lead. PURSUIT OF POWER vied two wide, then between horses turning for
home, but yielded at the three sixteenths pole. LUNA VIEJA laid off of the pace in the five path, tracked in the four path around the far turn, and lacked a
bid. FIGHT'N READY tracked along the inside, and faded turning for home. EARL OF DASSEL broke multiple lengths slow, saved ground far back, but to
no avail. ST. JOHN'S failed to factor. IM A MODEST MAN shied to the four path entering the first turn, and made little impact. MADDON never got involved.
