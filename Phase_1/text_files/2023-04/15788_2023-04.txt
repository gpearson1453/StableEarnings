Footnotes
THUNDERHEART was away well then pressed the pace from inside, took over with three furlongs remaining, shook free from outer rival around the bend,
drifted out then back inward in the lane and stayed clear to the wire. LANSDOWNE (GB) stalked the top pair from off the rail, rounded the bend three wide,
took aim at the winner in the lane but could not summon the needed rally. BEAUDACIOUS stalked four wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane,
could not find the late response to challenge in the furlongs grounds but churned on to hold the show. FRANKLIN ONE STAR stumbled leaving the gate,
jumped the dirt crossing then began to pull the rider along to the turn, got boxed in while along the fence around the bend, moved out to a clear path in the
lane and finished with a mild rally. MENDEZ MILE broke a step slow, stalked from inside through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and failed to rally.
PETRUCHIO dropped back under coaxing early, traveled three then two wide on the turn, steered out in the lane and also lacked a rally.
TANGLEDUPINGREY stumbled leaving the gate, lost path and steadied shortly after, ran up on heels and had to put the brakes on once again, ran two
wide through the turn and weakened. BLACK MAGICIAN set the pace while pulling the rider along up the backstretch with THUNDERHEART to the inside,
was overtaken by that rival at the three-eighths pole, could not keep up approaching the quarter pole and chased two wide leaving the bend and weakened
in the drive.

Footnotes
HOT ROD MAMA chased four wide into the first turn then went up to duel outside MIDNIGHT SILENCE on the backstretch, battled two wide through the far
turn and into the stretch, disposed of the runner-up outside the eighth pole and drew away. MIDNIGHT SILENCE broke a step slow then went up to vie for
command three wide while keen around the first turn, dueled inside HOT ROD MAMA up the backstretch and far turn, could not keep up approaching the
furlong grounds but stayed on to secure second. JACQUELINE COCHRAN forwardly placed from the rail into the first turn then lost her path when DEL
MAR WOMAN came in a bit around the bend, moved off the inside to give chase through the middle stages, rounded the far turn two wide and lacked a late
bid. AMERICAN CONQUEST chased five wide early, started to weaken three then two wide on the second bend and continued to weaken in the lane. DEL
MAR WOMAN stumbled leaving the gate then went up to vie for command in the two path under coaxing, could not keep pace with the leaders and chased
up the backstretch, began to weaken along the rail on the far turn and had little left for the drive. TAP IN NINE trailed three wide around the first turn, trailed
four wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IRISH PATSY broke a step slow and came in at the start, sat off the pace in the two path leaving the backstretch, gained two then three wide around the
bend, took over at the furlong pole, then quickly cleared and inched away. PRECIPICE broke slow, chased two wide off the pace around the bend, angled
out in upper stretch, finished in tandem with PAID IN GOLD and edged that rival for the place. PAID IN GOLD bobbled leaving the gate, stalked the pace
inside MISS POLO BAR into the turn, got shuffled back when that rival came over on the turn, continued along the fence to the drive, then steered out and
finished determinedly but lost the photo for second. SOUL OF A WARRIOR stalked the leader from inside then moved out a bit, rounded the bend in the two
path, reached the front briefly in upper stretch before being overtaken by the winner at the eight pole and flattened to fourth. ELEGANCE CODE broke well
then dropped back off the pace and steered inward, navigated the turn two wide, moved out in the lane and improved position. MISS POLO BAR tracked
two wide outside a rival into the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend, got blocked behind a weakening PRETTY RENA at the top of the lane, then
gained a clear path but could not regain momentum. CRESCENDO MOLTO was off a bit slow to start, trailed two to three wide around the bend, drifted out
in the lane and never got involved. PRETTY RENA cleared early and crossed over, set the pace along the rail to the lane and retreated when overtaken in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
PEQUENA TORMENTA broke a step slow, went up to take the lead with AWESOME TAYLOR alongside, cleared that rival nearing the turn, drew away in
upper stretch and widened in the furlong grounds when flagged with the whip. AWESOME TAYLOR broke a step slow, moved up to press the leader from
outside early, chased three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch and kept on to best the rest. MODERA stalked from outside early, rounded the bend
four wide, failed to threaten in the lane but finished a clear third. THE REIGN SONG got crowded a bit between rivals early, tracked outside a foe into the
turn, went three then two wide around the bend and could not rally. DADDY CLASSY DILL coaxed along from the gate then drifted out early, chased two
wide through the bend, moved out in the lane and could not rally. QUICKLIKEABUNNY tracked two wide into the turn, moved over to the rail while losing
ground on the turn and lacked further response in the drive. MISS KALINE was rank briefly trailing the field, went four to five wide around the bend and
weakened.

WORKDAY chased three wide then went up to press the leader from outside leaving the first turn, dueled between rivals into the second bend, moved to the
rail on the far turn while battling JOHNNY PAYCHECK, shook free in upper stretch and remained clear to the wire. BE PUNCTUAL was off slow from inside,
started to pull early and continued to tug the rider along to the nine-sixteenths pole, tracked on the inside then got blocked behind STAN FROM MALIBU at
the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide around the far turn, finished well through the lane but had to settle for second best. JOHNNY PAYCHECK
stumbled badly leaving the gate, chased three deep around the first turn, bid three wide into the second bend, dueled two wide into the lane, lost touch with
WORKDAY in upper stretch and flattened to third. SILENT HEAT lost his footing and broke slow from outside, chased two wide early then had to steady
around the first turn, had to steady again at the nine-sixteenths pole, asked two wide on the far turn and lacked a bid. STAN FROM MALIBU sped to the
front in the two path, got pressured around the first turn, vied inside a pair into the second bend while losing command, started to retreat around that turn,
eased in the lane and walked off.

SWEET HELLO vied three deep into the first turn then cleared inner rivals and crossed over, showed the way to the far turn, opened up around that bend,
widened when roused and flagged with the whip and was geared down in the end. PRESTIGIOUS trailed three then two wide early, traveled along the rail
into the second bend, eased out through that turn and summoned a mild rally to best the rest. CON SEAL AND KERRY stumbled leaving the gate, had to
steady when running up behind a rival into the first turn, pulled the rider to a forward position, was closest in pursuit from the two path through the far turn
but weakened in the drive. ANACARAVA (IRE) forwardly placed along the rail then angled out three wide on the first turn, chased three then two wide on the
far turn and weakened. MISS JO'S CANDY vied between rivals then lost her path into the first turn and dropped back, raced in mid-pack outside a rival in
the middle stages, rounded the far turn four then three wide and came up empty. COMPTONS HOUSE chased three to four wide on both turns and
weakened.

CATALINA EDDY was closest in pursuit of the leader from outside in the two path, bid two wide into the far turn, led briefly into the stretch before being
overtaken giving the lead back to BOSS SULLY, bumped with that rival at the eighth pole, continued to battle and drifted inward to bumped again in the final
sixteenth and dug in late to prevail. BOSS SULLY cleared quickly and moved over to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch, met the bid from outer rival
into the far turn, maintained a short lead around the bend but was overtaken entering the lane, regained the upper hand at the top of the stretch, drifted out
to bump CATALINA EDDY at the eighth pole, took a bump from that rival with a sixteenth remaining and was outkicked in the end. OLD PAL bobbled
slightly leaving the gate, stalked in the two path early, bid three deep late on the far turn and flattened in the final furlong. TOM AND JAZZY had to steady
behind BOSS SULLY early, was rated along the rail after, saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response when called upon. THIRSTY PAPPY
broke a step slow, settled inside, tipped two wide with a quarter mile remaining and could not rally. UPWARD MOBILITY tracked two wide at the back early,
moved into the three path on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
OCTOPUS vied three deep up the backstretch, dueled outside MY HARBORS DREAM past the five-sixteenths pole, battled down the stretch and dug in to
gamely prevail. MY HARBORS DREAM vied between rivals early, dueled from inside midway around the turn and into the stretch, fought hard through the
lane but was bested by the winner. VICENTE'S SHADOW stalked two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and gained the
show. AFTERNOON HEAT stalked outside a rival five wide into the turn, moved inward around the bend and spun three wide into the stretch, churned on
while not produced a bid and was edged for the show honors. CROSS EXAMINE was off slow in the beginning, raced at then near the back early, traveled
along the inside around the bend, two wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally to improve placings. AWESOME HEIGHTS vied for the lead inside
rivals to the turn, failed to keep up with five-sixteenths left to run and weakened through the drive. STREET VISION dropped back early, trailed outside a
rival into the turn, rounded the bend two wide and proved no menace. MIGHTY MATT brushed with inner rival and got crowded a bit early, rounded the turn
five to six wide, got bumped by MIDNIGHT SPECIAL in upper stretch and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL brushed with MIGHTY MATT early,
chased four to five wide on the turn, drifted out and bumped MIGHTY MATT in the stretch and had little left for the drive. MY DOMINATOR showed early
speed outside rival then chased the top trio to the turn, went four wide into the bend, moved in a bit then four wide again into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MISS LIZZY bumped lightly in the beginning, got blocked behind BELLA BABY early, chased on the inside into the turn, was coaxed along but then had to
pause behind a pair of rivals on the turn, tipped out into the stretch, rallied widest and surged clear late. MYGALSDAWNNLORI was closest in pursuit to the
outside of the pacesetter early, bid two wide with a quarter mile left to run, gained command in upper stretch, drifted out at the sixteenth pole and yielded to
the winner. BELLA BABY stalked outside a rival in the two path into the turn, remained two wide to the stretch, moved out to make a run in the stretch, got
bothered by the runner-up at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly for the show. MISS JOANNIE stalked the pace from inside, steered off the fence in the
stretch and failed to rally. CALIFORNIA BLING settled along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten. DIALING
SCOTTY bumped leaving the gate, sped clear and set the pace early, challenged from outside with a quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. WIRLY GIRLY bumped at the start, tracked two wide into the turn, three wide into the lane and failed to rally. MAP TO MY
HEART hopped crossing onto the dirt, reserved along the inside after, saved ground to the stretch and was never involved.
