around the far turn and kicked clear. SLIME QUEEN raced in the four path early, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two
path around the second turn and into the lane and chased the winner home in the final furlong. LULLABY LAND hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the
three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far bend from the four path and
improved position in the lane. IRAZU trailed the field on the outside through the opening half mile, swung out to the five path for the run around the second
bend and gained ground late. TAMI ANN raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. TAKE TO THE SKIES saved ground around the first bend, tracked the pace setters on the inside
up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path and faded in the stretch. ONE NIGHT STAND hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the
three path around the first turn, chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and weakened from there.
SERENADE A KITTEN raced in the three path early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and
continued to tire in the lane. TOWERING GAZE saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two
