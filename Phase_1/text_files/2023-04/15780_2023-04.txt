STORM TRAPPE drew clear while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. GLASTONBURY stalked the early pace inside, eased out with a bid leaving the three eighths pole and
rounded the turn off the rail, drifted toward the eighth pole and ran evenly down the lane. BASHDAFLASH came away rank and lost his blinkers soon after
the start, moved to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly to take third later yards. MONEY MAC chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, left the turn outside then flattened stride. FROSTY THE BULL chased inside, rounded the
turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. MY SLICK NICK gave chase and raced in the three path on the turn. BOCCHERINI saved ground.

sixteenths pole, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, drew clear passing the sixteenth pole and edged away late yards. COLLECTORATE took the
lead leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace, was met and dueled from the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail
on the turn but relented mid-stretch. SEAN THE HAMMER saved ground on the first turn then started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced three wide on the far turn and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. URBAN BANDIT settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and flattened in the lane. MIGHTY MINION rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. PER DIEM settled in the three path the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn four wide and weakened. CHERRYS CROSS raced well back in the five path the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch. MIMS HAT TRICK came away awkwardly then saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
