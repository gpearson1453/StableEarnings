Footnotes
I'M WIDE AWAKE hustled to the lead early while in the two path, continued near the inside through the turn when put under pressure, dueled with runner-up
through the lane, lost the lead with an eighth to go then edged back to the front late in a game effort. EL ROSILLO pressed the pace two wide through the
turn, bid into the lane from the three or four path, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe. MULTI PLATINUM chased the
pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then needed more late. ROAN FOR THE ROSE raced near the rail through the turn and into the
lane and offered a mild gain. DROP IT raced in the three path through the turn and never was a factor. SENSE SHINES steadied early while near the lead
then faded throughout while along the inside. LIMITED D'ORO was outrun while in the three or four path. The stretch time was omitted due to a timer
malfunction.

Footnotes
MS. THE LAW chased the pace from the two path into the turn, bid in late turn, gained the lead once straightened then drew clear and was kept to the task.
BODIEFUL was three wide through the turn and into the lane, moved closest to the winner near the three-sixteenths pole and settled for second best. C C'S
WORLD was in the four path through the turn when in mid-pack then moved up for show spot and clearly best of the rest. ZERO CLICK inside into the lane
and tired. TAYA ALLDAYA was never a factor while in the three path. AMORADA never a factor while along the inside. GOLDEN DAME set the pace into
the lane then was empty along the rail. AKEDAH never a menace while in the four path. BIRD SET FREE was outrun while along the inside.

ROCK THE RED pressed the pacesetter two wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, gained the lead straightening in the lane then drew
away while being ridden out. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and
moved up to be clear for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. PHILIP SNOW set the pace from the two path through the turn, dueled with the
winner into the lane and yielded in upper stretch. GO FOREVER was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was never
a serious threat while picking up a part of the super. STANDOUTJUSTICE saved ground through the turn and tired. SNERDLEY was in the three path
through the turn and moved up while not a threat. MYSTERY IMPACT stumbled at the start and was brushed by another soon after, raced near the inside
into the lane and never was a threat. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE was in the four path in upper lane, drifted in toward the rail and tired. STICKER was bothered
by another at the start and never was a factor. SKY HIGH FIVE chased the pace from the two path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. EL
CHAPARRO steadily faded while in the three path.

Footnotes
SHIMMER ME TIMBERS set the pace while under pressure from the outside, moved clear outside the eighth pole then kept on well. A FEW TOO MANY
chased the pace from the four path through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the top ones with an eighth to go then got up for place while not a late
threat to the winner. FORREST CITY raced along the inside into the lane, was well placed with an eighth to go then could not finish while turning in a good
effort. THEDEVILSALGORITHM trailed through the first half while moving off the rail, came into the lane from the six path and finished with good energy.
D'ORO'S WISH saved ground through the turn, came off the rail to split rivals near the eighth pole then moved up. ADMIRAL RETURNS raced in the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and never was a threat. ORO AZTECA pressed the winner while two wide into the lane,
had aim with an eighth to go then weakenec. BAL A KAZOO saved ground and weakened. TROPIC STORM three path through the turn and tired. SATURN
BOY was never a factor while in the two path. BONNIE BILL was outrun from the two path. NAVY SOUL chased the pace from the three path through the
turn then was empty.

BELLA'S PRAYER vied between foes, dueled through the stretch and was clear late under mild urging. SUDDEN SHIFT vied four wide, bid at the
three-eigths pole, dueled late outside of the winner but couldn't get past that one. UNBRIDLED VICTOR was unrushed, then rallied late four wide.
SPOTONJUSTICE led early before giving way in the stretch. BENNY'S LEGACY was unrushed early, then had his best stride late outside.
LOADEMUPJUSTICE had a slight bobble at the start, stalked the pace inside, then had no closing bid. JERICHO EXPRESS was through early. CIELO BLU
was not a factor. KINGOFTHERAINBOW stalked the pace in the four path to the turn and gave way. ROYAL ICING bore in at the start, then faded inside
steadily.
