Footnotes
VICTORIAN RIVIERA exchanged contact with Cataffairwithmedal leaving the gate then took the nod two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole, dug in
to the challenge of LINDA'S TAJ nearing the three eighths while alternating the lead with that one, contested even terms through the far turn and dug in
determinedly to inch clear later yards. The latter raced with the pace inside, challenged toward the three eighths pole while alternating for the lead,
contested even terms on the far turn and dueled gamely to mid-stretch before reluctantly ceding. WICKED SAUCY settled inside on the opening turn, picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. SWEET FACTOR saved ground well
off the pace, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch
duel for third. SUPER SWEETIE settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the three path of the far turn and flattened in the lane. CHANTILLY MOON (PER) rounded the first turn in the three and four paths, gave chase
approaching the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. HERECOMESPUDD raced well back and never factored.
CATAFFAIRWITHMEDAL exchanged contact with Sweet Factor leaving the gate, was shuffled back shortly afterward and showed little response.

Footnotes
COLT ROCK rated a slim lead leaving the chute, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and held on under steady stretch handling.
CHASENJOHNATHAN chased through the backstretch, raced in range of the lead three wide on the turn, drifted into the lane but corrected course and
finished well to close the gap. DE'S CASTLE engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened the final sixteenth.
BERTRAM FLIGHT gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. OFFICER STONE gave chase through the backstretch,
raced in range four wide on the turn, was carried out leaving the turn but ran evenly in the lane. PINNACLE REEF came away awkwardly, picked up the
chase through the backstretch and saved ground on the turn. TWO ROOM SCHOOL chased the leaders, rounded the turn about the three path and showed
little in the lane. JUST A FLIRT was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUCKY ONE stalked two deep, challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep approaching the quarter, contested the edge through
the far turn and dug in determinedly to inch away from ZIGGY STARDUST late yards. The latter took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the
pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail nearing the quarter, contested near even terms through the turn and
dueled gamely to deep stretch before grudgingly yielding. REVEREND JACK rated close toward the inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well while gaining on the top two. LIEUTENANT BROWN settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out leaving
the turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn four wide then flattened in the lane. COMEONTURNMELOOSE settled off the
rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. CALLISTO'S
BRIGADE rounded the opening turn in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and
ran evenly in the lane. I SEE NOTHING was not a factor. SENZA STRIKE stalked the early pace from the three path then faded through the backstretch.
The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Lucky One for alleged interference on the far turn, lodged by the rider of Ziggy
Stardust.

Footnotes
ROCKET APPEAL broke in and made sharp contact with Khaki Jack, dueled to a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest
the rail on the turn, drew clear into the lane and held on well with steady handling. REMYS SHOWTIME chased through the backstretch, contested at a
close disadvantage three wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and just lasted for second. GOLDEN G chased inside, angled out through the turn, left
the turn four wide and just missed second. FIBER STRONG chased through the backstretch, raced close between horses through the turn then flattened in
the duel through the stretch. BODYSLAM chased toward the inside, entered the turn at the rail, angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane and
finished evenly. KHAKI JACK became anxious in the gate, was bumped soundly and pinched back at the start then picked up the chase, rounded the turn
about the six path, left the turn widest and showed little more. BAR ON THE BEACH came away awkwardly and exchanged contact with LANTAU, gave
chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. The latter exchanged contact with Bar On The Beach and
set a pressured early pace the opening quarter mile, but was met approaching the five sixteenths pole and weakened at the rail on the turn.
