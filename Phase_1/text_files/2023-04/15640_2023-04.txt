Footnotes
INTO DISCO stalked the relaxed pace under a firm hold, continued closest to that on into the far turn, took over turning for home, drew clear then held the
runner up safe under steady handling. JUBELLA broke in the air, lacked speed off the rail, moved smartly into contention with a four wide move late in the
final turn, flattened out a bit in the final furlong to make only minor progress in the winner late. BRITTLE AND YOO lacked early speed, moved out to race in
the two path, turning into the stretch, rallied for the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. SAND AND SEA away in good order, cleared toward the inside
early in the first turn, set a soft pace for six furlongs, briefly offered some resistance to the winner entering the stretch then began to gradually weaken.
BLAMEITONMIDNIGHT four wide in the first turn when with the main body, moved closer three wide second turn, in traffic late in that bend, went flat
through the stretch after recovering. FAST AND FEMININE settled in mid pack off the inside, two path far turn, angled out four wide late in that bend, failed
to muster a response in the drive. GIMME CANDY steadied behind the winner early in the first turn, recovered to race within striking distance along the
inside, gave way second turn.

Footnotes
EL MONGO broke alertly, soon clear along the inside, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn, extended that advantage in upper stretch,
enough left to last. TAP THAT DIAL stumbled badly at the break, lagged for three furlongs when trailing inside, swung out five wide exiting the turn, closed
with good energy to be getting to the winner late. KING DOODLE in the second flight while racing off the inside, three to four wide into the stretch, also was
closing the gap on the winner with a late push. EL GEMAR off a step slow, moved up inside to a forward position, one paced late to lose a couple of
positions. JOE BILL in mid pack while racing outside, four path into the turn, angled in a bit to be in the two path turning into the stretch, also finished up
evenly. SUNSIGN broke back, lacked speed off the rail, improved position while not posing a serious threat. LEOLA went one paced while racing toward the
inside. ORDER OF MERIT tired while racing four wide through the turn. GUARDED chased the winner early off the inside, began a steady retreat before a
half. SANTINO'S FANTASY remained back in in lacking a rally. PIKACHU was finished before a half. EIGHT STRAIGHT off a step slow, tired toward the
inside.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHARM broke on top, vied along the rail into the first turn, fell back off the leader and moved off the rail late first turn, advanced, took over in the
two path late in the second bend, clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up at bay late under firm handling. MISTY VEIL raced back off the pace
while three wide, continued in the path when beginning to advance second bend, chased winner past the furlong marker, challenged that one from the
outside late, denied. PRETTI XTREME lacked early foot while angling to the inside first turn, moved out, three to four wide into the stretch, improved upper,
went evenly when unable to keep up with the top two. LET'S DUET last to leave, trailed while remaining devoid of early foot, steered off the rail a bit when
beginning to improve with a quarter to run, bothered between horses into the lane, improved with some mild, belated interest after recovering. BOW BOW
GIRL also back off the early pace, floated out to be four wide into the stretch, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals. GOOD PENNY in the second flight
while racing off the inside, had little left for the drive. FOREVER DREAMING within striking distance while three to two wide through the first turn, saved
ground through the second bend, backed up through the lane. ENCHANTED NILE vied early outside the winner and between foes, cleared before a quarter
to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way weakened when headed by the winner not long after. BOBBIN TAIL in mid
pack in the early going, began a steady fade after a half.

furlong to run, outkicked in the late going. BARSTOOL BABE dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternated in the two path up the backstretch and
into the far turn, took over and showed the way into the stretch, weakened a bit and could not match the top two late, saved the show. ABBREVIATION in
the second flight along the inside, in traffic late in the final turn, steered out a bit to be in the two path for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late
kick,. SWEET SWEETFANTASY went one paced throughout while racing three wide. FLIRTING GIRL headed up the second flight while between horses in
the two path, had little for the drive. PARIS STYLE (FR) broke back, raced four to five wide by late in the final turn, failed to muster a rally. DIXIE TAP

Footnotes
COLONEL BOWMAN lacked early foot, roused five wide into the lane, challenged outside the leader with a sixteenth to run, wore that rival down late under
steady handling. JACKMAN vied up front in the run up the backstretch in the two path and between horses, dueled through the turn, shook clear entering
the stretch, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. ALEXANDROS in the second flight in the two path, steered out into the lane, raced on even
terms with the winner past the furlong marker, could not match that one's energy to the wire, fully extended to save the show. THUNDERSHOOK off slow to
be last away, displayed zero early speed four a half, two path for the drive, rallied late to finish willingly and be getting to the show horse late. SIDETOWN
broke on top, vied up front along the inside, dueled turn, first to blink. ONE FOR RICHIE pressed the early pace three and between horses, four wide exiting
the turn, had little left for the drive. SQUARE DEAL made little impact in the two path. RIBBONS AND MEDALS pressed the issue in the four path up the
backstretch, fell back off the first flight through the bend while remaining in the four path, gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUELIGHTSPECIAL broke sharp, clear into the first turn toward but not on the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch while rating, saved
ground through the final turn, remained clear through the lane under steady handling. TOUGH LEGACY lacked early foot, advanced along the inside late in
the second turn, shifted out a bit when straightened for home, slowly getting to the winner late while clearly second best. BOSS LADY BAILEY settled off the
pace, came three wide out of the final turn, lacked a winning response, clear of the others. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD away in good order from the outside,
raced closest to the winner outside that one, could not keep up turning for home, weakened. CORNINGSTONE in the second flight while outside, came four
wide for the drive, went one paced to the wire. NEED SOME MONEY lacked speed while racing inside first turn, moved off the rail for the second turn, three
wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. FREEBRITNEY last away, trailed three wide, also passed a couple of tiring
foes. WATCH THIS MUNNY in mid pack while racing four wide through both turns, had little left for the drive. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS saved ground to no
avail, tired.

Footnotes
GREAT ESCAPE in the second flight inside, crept a bit closer late backstretch along the inside, shuffled back into the far turn when the rail was cut off,
patiently handled after recovering, slipped through along the inside turning for home, drew clear. ALEJANDRO void of early foot, advanced four to five wide
second turn, rallied upper stretch to be closest to the winner a furlong out, could do little more with that one late while clear for the place. RED RUN in mid
pack just off the inside, three to four wide into the lane, along for the show late. DON'T FORGET back off the pace and the inside, moved closer three to
four wide second turn, flattened out a bit late to be caught for the show. NUMBER ONE DUDE went one paced along the inside in lacking a closing
response. SEIZE THE NIGHT off a step slow, raced back early, staged a mild rally four wide to improve position. GHOSTLORE made little impact while
racing toward the inside. OMAHA RED forwardly placed off the inside, remained within striking distance second turn in the two path, was tiring when in
traffic a sixteenth out. WAYAKIN broke alertly, clear early, angled in second turn, moved back off the inside and allowed the winner the rail turning for home
then faltered. STORMY PATTERN chased the leader early, began a steady retreat after a half.

Footnotes
PEPPERONIKID in the second flight off the inside, made a steady advance to challenge three wide late in the turn, took over past the furlong marker, kicked
clear. PAID DOUBLE settled in the second group with the winner in the two path, in some traffic late in the turn, finished willingly from between horses to
earn the place. AUX ARCS back off the early pace outside, four wide through the turn, mild late interest to earn the show, outkicked for the second spot.
DANCIN ROCKET broke alertly, dueled up front while racing off the inside, continued to alternate through the turn, faltered when confronted the final
furlong. HOWL YEAH dropped inside turn, improved position. IMPOVERISHED within striking distance in the second flight inside the top two, traffic, waited
turning into the stretch, went evenly through the lane when clear. HEART HEADED ARKY broke well, set or forced the pace along the inside for a half, first
to blink and weakened through the lane. FINBARFUREY off slowly, raced back, swung four wide out of the turn, improved position down the middle of the
strip. DALTON'S RUTROW broke in a tangle, moved out, raced five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, had little left the final furlong. DEVLISH HOUR in
mid pack while racing off the inside, failed to muster a rally. MORE MONEY MO off slow, remained back while moving to the inside. HARD LUCK HENRY
off a step slow, trailed, showed little, vanned off.
