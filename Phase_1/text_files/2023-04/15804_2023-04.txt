Footnotes
ROCK N ROLL SONG vied inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, shook clear entering the lane and proved best late. GLITTER
LAKE tracked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, launched bid along the rail, leader drifted in and made it tight
late but did not affect the outcome. CASILLALATER off a half length slow, tracked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued in between on the
turn, launched what appeared to be a menacing bid four wide, and flattened out in the final sixteenth. CHARMING ALEXIS away cleanly, attempted to cross
over and bothered foe exiting the chute, vied for lead two wide, continued two wide on the turn, began to weaken late on the turn, and failed to respond in
the lane. TRUTH PREVAILS away well, contested early pace exiting the chute, steadied sharply when rival came in, steadied back to last, under light
handling along the rail on the turn and asked in the lane to just miss fourth. MY SWEET MARY off slow, under a loose rein well off the rail on the
backstretch, continued in hand four wide on the turn, scrubbed on late on the turn and failed to threaten. BLUE BUTTERFLY off slow, tracked pace three
wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, and in contention entering the lane, came up empty when asked. JOCKEY OBJECTION, RIDER
OF TRUTH PREVAILS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ON CHARMING ALEXIS, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CHARMING ALEXIS
AND PLACED BEHIND TRUTH PREVAILS

EVASIVE away cleanly, had a wide path, dueled with rival and edged away late. TELLER PERRY MRL away well, dueled with inside rival, kept to task and
proved to be second best. BETTER ONE off slow and ducked out at the start, kept under a hand ride throughout in a educational debut. REINA ISAMAR
bumped in at the start, caused to be on right lead, shifted in and almost hit rail when asked and saved thereafter. TWO CORONA KING shifted in and
bumped rival at the start, showed little when leveled.
