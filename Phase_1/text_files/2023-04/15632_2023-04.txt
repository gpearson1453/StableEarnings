Footnotes
CHEEKY TICO tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path around the turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole,
drifted in while shaking clear into upper stretch, responded well under the crop into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. MIDNIGHT
CHROME was hustled from the gate then showed speed, shied in nearing the seven-eighths, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two
path under threat from the winner to the outside on the turn, lost the advantage to that foe at the quarter-pole, moved out into upper stretch, chased into the
final furlong and proved no match then just held the place. GHOSTLYPRINCE made contact with a foe at the start, settled off the early pace, moved closer
with five furlongs to run, chased inside around the turn, came out into upper stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. PAPI ON ICE
dropped well back early, angled in leaving the chute, went two then three wide around the turn, drifted inward while remaining on his inside lead in upper
stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. SORPRESO was hustled from the gate then taken in hand while inside
of a foe around the seven-eighths, dropped back while eased off the pace with six furlongs to run then moved out near the five-eighths, passed the
nine-sixteenths under urging, went around the turn in the two to three path, came out into upper stretch and tired. BERT BERT BERT hit the inside of the
gate at the start then bobbled hard while making contact with a foe, nearly unseated the rider as he was dislodged from his left iron and dangled over the
right-side of his mount, had the jockey show great athleticism to regain balance in the center of the saddle then reached down to get his left foot back in the
iron, spotted the field many lengths in the process, went three then two wide around the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
BALPOOL hustled from the gate, vied inside a pair in the early going before taking over sole yet narrow command, tipped to the two path into the turn under
some pressure from the runner up to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, went clear under a drive
to prevail. FANCY AZTECA coaxed from the gate, vied from the two path between foes through the early going before emerging to prompt the pace of the
aforementioned foe to the outside three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, proved no match for the top one
while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. CRIMSON three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
continued three to four wide for home and weakened. LA VITA SOFIA chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, tired. ANISTON coaxed from the gate, chased five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home
and tired.

Footnotes
APRIL ANTICS settled off the pace, was roused late on the backstretch, gained three then four wide around the turn, rallied to the lead at the
three-sixteenths, shook clear under a right-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead outside the eighth-pole, continued on her inside lead in the final
furlong and proved much the best under strong urging. BRAVO REGINA settled off the pace, moved out near the three-quarter pole, chased in the three
path around the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and
proved no match while well clear for the place. RICELLE stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead with five furlongs to run, inched clear in the two path
early on the turn, was asked near the three-eighths pole, lost the advantage coming to the quarter-pole and weakened while clear for the show. SWEET
SENSATION was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. CRYSTAL ORB showed
the way early, lost the lead with five furlongs to run, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, came up empty along the rail on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
TWENTY SIX BLACK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung
three wide into upper stretch in behind ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA, attempted to nudge his way out to the four path against FACTUALLY CORRECT and was
denied the move, then successfully nudged his way to the four path at the eighth pole against that same rival, rallied to issue a challenge through the final
sixteenth and was just up in the last strides to the wire. ELECTRIC STUFF coaxed from the start, dueled inside of ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA from the get go
, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down swinging just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in stubbornly clinging to the front until nailed
in the last jumps to the finish. ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA shied out at the start filling some of the space left vacated by the outwards breaking NEW YORK
PANTHER, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out spinning three
wide for home, dug in under a drive continuing to knock heads through to the final seventy yards now fighting on between foes and was staved off to the
end. FACTUALLY CORRECT coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got
nudged at the three-sixteenths and denied the move, then got leaned on again and gave way to the five path allowing the eventual winner a seam, then
weakened in the late stages. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued in the
inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. TIE BREAKER chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and weakened in the stretch.
UNCLE MARTY got bumped twice at the start, chased just off the inside until tipped four wide through the turn, continued four wide for home and came up
empty. NEW YORK PANTHER broke out at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, made no
impact. IMPULSIVE SPENDING got bumped at the start by the aforementioned breaking outwards, chased three to four wide and tired.

Footnotes
LISTENTOYOURHEART bumped with a rival at the start, attended the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the three path with a short lead around the turn,
moved clear passing the five-sixteenths, was asked ever so slightly near the three-sixteenths, powered away under a very mild hand ride into the final
furlong and won handily in an impressive effort. AWESOME NATIVE bumped with a rival at the start, was forwardly placed down the backstretch, chased in
the four path around the turn and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS dropped back on the outside, was urged
five wide around the turn and came up empty while best of the rest. FIRST DEPUTY settled off the pace, traveled three wide around the turn, was roused
outside the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. BREAKING STONES settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, drafted behind horses passing
the five-sixteenths, was asked when given room between foes outside the quarter-pole and came up empty. DURKIN'S CALL settled on the outside, moved
in inside the three-quarter pole, angled further in around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to
threaten. WRITER'S REGRET showed the way while inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back with five-sixteenths to run and faded.

from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the inside to take command nearing the
eighth pole, then edged away to the finish to prevail. SHUTTERS got bumped at the start by EMBOITE, who broke inwards, raced just off the inside through
the first turn before chasing three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to secure
the place honors. EMBOITE (IRE) broke in at the start bumping SHUTTERS, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show honors. SO HIGH (GB) showed the way in hand along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened
in the late stages. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. STANDUP chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide
into upper stretch, made no impact. GIANT'S FIRE tracked the pace along the inside coming under brief coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into

Footnotes
MOMMASGOTTARUN was hard held off the pace, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch
then shook clear, responded well under the crop in the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. FUNNY HOW bumped with a
rival at the start, settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole then spun
three wide into the stretch under the crop, angled out at the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner on the outside to the wire and finished willingly for the
place. HYDRA was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace between foes, vied in the two path while between rivals on the turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and weakened while able to get the show. ROSSA VELOCE stumbled twice while making contact with a foe at the start, was taken up while trying to
recover and very slow into stride, spotted the front many lengths, moved up on the outside, made a bid near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the four then three
path around the turn and tired. GERRYMANDER was hustled to the front, set the pace under heavy pressure to her outside, vied along the rail through the
turn and gave way. MERAVIGLIOSO was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged in the
two to three path around the turn and came up empty. EASY TO BLESS was taken in hand early then settled at the rear, moved from the two path to the
four path around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
GEM MINT TEN coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish kept to task. LAUNCH CONTROL dueled from the two path with DISARMED to
his outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, got bumped at the three-sixteenths as his main pace rival
came inwards, then leaned out just inside the eighth pole taking back a narrow advantage before being overhauled in tandem by the eventual winner, ran on
to secure the place honors. DISARMED coaxed from the gate, dueled from the three path with the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came inwards and bumped LAUNCH CONTROL at the three-sixteenths, then got
leaned on as that rival came outwards inside the eighth pole before he and his main pace rival were overtaken by the top one and ran on clear for the show
honors. POP COYER chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish.
SCHERZANDO turned his head to the near side then sprung to the off side at the break striking the stall door and getting away last conceding four lengths
to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. NEWPORT BRIDGE chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch, trailed.
