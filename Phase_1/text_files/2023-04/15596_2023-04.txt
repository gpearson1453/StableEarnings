Footnotes
OXIDE took control into the first turn, set a rated pace two wide, responded when set down entering the lane, opened up a bit in mid stretch then held firm
while kept to task. NORTHERN THUNDER , three wide tracking outside the winner, was put to a strong ride entering the far turn, gained some nearing the
quarter pole, failed to make real progress past the furlong grounds but continued with good energy to be clear for the place. BADGER TOOTH settled off the
pace, was sent up between rivals leaving the far turn, dropped in to pursue but lacked a serious stretch response. OFF THE MEDS bobbled at the break,
recovered and was sent up to prompt the pace along the rail, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and retreated.

SHACKINTHEBOX circled the turn three wide, advanced outside horses to secure command in upper stretch then drew off under urging. SIR SMOAK ,
outside horses on the turn, moved to the four path approaching the stretch, remained on his left lead and ralied. FREDDYNESS , clear soon after the start,
set the pace in the two path around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. CAVALRY COMMAND chased the pace while racing along the
inner rail and weakened. RASCALLY REBEL broke slowly, failed to be a factor and swung to the five path leaving the turn. IMAGINE A CURE was a brief
factor leaving the backstretch. EL TOLU , pulled up mid way down the backstretch, walked off.

NAUGHTY NAN broke outward, corrected and edged up to track the dueling leaders three wide, cruised up and bid three deep mid turn, secured command
into the stretch, responded when shoved on, opened up leaving mid stretch and was kept to a steady hand ride. SKY BUY chased outside a rival, came
three wide gathering steam into the lane, leveled off past the furlong grounds and just got up for the place. FIVE STAR FRAN dueled two wide outside LILY
MOR, held a slim lead between rivals mid turn, dropped in for the drive, chased past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. LILY MOR was hustled up inside
rivals soon after the start, sparred on a slim lead into the turn, was headed mid turn, altered out nearing mid stretch while not kicking on with the top pair and
faded. WAVERLEY broke slowly, saved ground, edged up a bit leaving the far turn, pursued into the lane and weakened. SUPER MONEY , three wide off
the pace, circled four wide into the lane but lacked a bid. DANCE DELILAH dropped back early and failed to drum up a run.

Footnotes
GALATIANS , taken to rate two wide, edged up nearing the far turn, was stalled to the five sixteenths, split rivals near the quarter pole, took over in upper
stretch and eagerly widened under a drive. BAHAMA CHANNEL stalked towards the rail, awaited room from the three eighths to the quarter pole, altered
out in upper stretch and finished up willingly to gain the place. LORD MIO cleared early, set the pace under some rating, came under pressure two wide
when confronted by the winner into the lane, ceded command soon after, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth marker then faded. UNCOMMON VALOR
settled off the pace, made a run to the inside of rivals near the five sixteenths, worked outward in the drive, drifted out and came up empty. FIVE STAR PHIL
, three to four wide, made a run outside rivals to loom past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. KING NATE lagged
well back early on, was under a ride past the three eighths, swung six wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. MINECRAFTER , three wide early, moved
up around the final turn, angled five wide and gave way. TITAN'S WILL drafted back a bit soon into the backstretch, angled out leaving the far turn, lacked a
punch past the five sixteenths and weakened. VINNY , three wide early, prompted the pace outside LORD MIO into the far turn, threatened around the final
turn, failed to go on entering the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
BLACK DIAMOND RAIN hopped at the break, recovered and angled in to quickly gain past the five eighths, awaited room while saving ground mid turn,
eased out into the lane, closed in under left handed asks, forged ahead in deep stretch and held firm. GINAMAYA sped to the front, set the pace about two
wide, drifted out under a drive near the sixteenth, was corrected with right handed asks and gave way grudgingly. FASHIONISTA , off the early pace and
outside a rival, swung six to seven wide for the drive, closed in leaving the furlong grounds, switched over to her left lead in deep stretch and was taken in
hand near the wire. LIL SPINNER , hard used between rivals chasing the pace, came four wide for the drive and gave way. SWEET SHUGS , three deep
stalking the pace, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and weakened. TENACIOUS TRAVELER broke slowly, saved ground and faded.
