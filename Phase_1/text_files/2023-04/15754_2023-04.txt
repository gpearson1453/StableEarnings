KOVACS stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and quickly drew off. FRISCO KID
broke sharply then settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner late but finished with a steady rally. ANDY
BOBBY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a late bid. IRISH KNIGHT was off slow,
raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished evenly. ROYAL TAP was away in good order to chase
the pace of TRINNI VALANTINE while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. TRINNI VALANTINE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off
the rail while setting the pace and weakened after a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BLESSED JOURNEY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached BLUE SKYE JADE nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and was up at the wire. BLUE SKYE JADE was away in good order to duel for the lead
from off the rail with UNLEASH THE BEAST, disposed of that rival inside the quarter, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the
three-sixteenths marker, vied and just missed in a game effort. EL NOBLE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and
finished with good late energy. BIG CITY BANE lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to rally. CAPTAIN RED lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through both turns, and did not offer a bid. UNLEASH THE BEAST disputed the pace with UNLEASH THE BEAST while racing three-wide
and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the
lane and was ridden out to the wire. BAD KARMA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, relinquished the pace setting chores to the
winner nearing the quarter, angled out into the stretch, was no match for that rival but finished well to hold the place. PIPER ROSE lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. STREAMER raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. MISCHIEF MAMA was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and gave way. CANTERBURY GOLD was off slow, rushed to contend, showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

SHESAHEATWAVE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off.
AND I KNOW settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. BIG AL'S PRINCESS was away in
good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin after going three furlongs, remained in control until mid-stretch and yielded to the winner.
HEART RIVER was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid.
SEVEN POINTS lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and failed to rally. BELLS AND WHISTLES chased the leaders while racing
three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

PAULINA'S STAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away late.
BEAUTIFUL MESS was never far back, raced five-wide through the turn, gained command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead but could
not resist the winner late. JERUSALEMA (IRE) was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. BOOSICAL
LADY dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. I'LL TAKE THE SOUP disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave
way through the final eighth. AMAZING FLYER chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened in the drive. WHAT A WAY TO GO lagged early,
raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. MAMALONA raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HER PERFECT VISION was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off through the
lane as a handy winner. PLUM ROSE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished
well to gain the place. TECATE GOLD pressed the pace of the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive and gave way late for the
place. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with a
belated bid. KEEP IT ROLLIN raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. LILY PAD LAKE showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and was not a factor. LOVELY LOLA was off slow, lacked early foot, saved
ground through the turn and did not menace. MISCHIEVOUS EMMA was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
PRECIOUS ONE showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
