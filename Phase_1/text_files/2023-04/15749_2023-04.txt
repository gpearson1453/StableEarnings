Footnotes
PAUL VINCENTS POEM was away in good order to duel for the lead with WEARENOTBADPEOPLE, vied with that rival throughout, was headed in
mid-stretch and came back to gamely prevail. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE was off a step slow, disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide,
vied through a vigorous drive and just missed. VICTORY AT LAST was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the
drive. DEVILS WORKSHOP was never far back, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed closing response. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

KINGDOM HEART sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his margin into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task.
JUSTIN AZTECA lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was up for the place. IT'S TURBO
chased the leaders while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive and gave way late for the place. RAAJIN RIBBON chased the leaders
from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. MS FLASHY HARBOR settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with
a furlong to run and finished evenly. HI YAH stumbled at the start, rushed to contend, pressed the pace while racing five-wide and weakened after going a
half. HADLEES HONOR showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BAROSSA raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged
away late. CASHANOVA was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the seven-eighths pole, remained in control
through mid-stretch but could not match strides with the winner through the final sixteenth. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) appeared hard to rate, chased the
pace of CASHANOVA while racing three-wide, could not gain on the top pair late but stayed on well in the drive. UNMACHABLE lagged early, raced
four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. BRIX chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
gave way after going seven furlongs. FALSELY ACCUSED was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally.
INESPERADO was off a step slow, raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through both turns and did not offer a bid. PLAYOFF BOUND lacked early
speed, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the leaders nearing the quarter, vied and finished willingly. BOURBON AND WATER raced
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked nearing the quarter, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late.

Footnotes
NASHVILLE SKYLINE pulled to vie for the lead, opened a clear margin after going three furlongs, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to
the wire. ECHO CANYON lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. ANOTHERFORBROOKS was
forwardly placed early while racing from the inside, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. I'M NOBLE settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. NAPOLEONIC CODE disputed the pace from the inside for the opening three furlongs
and gave way. SPECIAL MOMENT raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early foot, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. PROSPECT OF
RAIN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. MY KACEJJ raced off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and weakened. PUBLIC OPINION showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not offer a
bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
