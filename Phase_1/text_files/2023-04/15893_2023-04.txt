Footnotes
CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) was bumped at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, advanced two wide on the turn, was
roused four wide into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong marker, closed determinedly in the final stages, surged in deep stretch and was up in the
final strides to dead heat for the win. NAUGHTY NIKO broke alertly, took back to stalk the decent early pace, kept attendance to the pacesetter to the
quarter marker, overtook WAKES AND WEDDINGS in upper stretch, met the bid of PERFORMATIVE heading to the furlong pole, dueled with that foe to
deep stretch, was confronted in the final stages by the rallying CHICAGO SOLIDER and gamely lasted to dead heat for the win. PERFORMATIVE tracked
the decent early fractions while outside of rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, matched strides with NAUGHTY NIKO in upper stretch, dueled with that
foe to the sixteenth-marker, took a narrow lead in deep stretch, was outfinished in the final strides and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest.
WAKES AND WEDDINGS was hustled in the early running, dictated terms into the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper
stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. SILENT BULLET was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the
quarter marker and did not threaten. TIZACRAFTYMINISTER chased the decent early pace, lost position on the turn while saving ground and tired in the
drive.

SHE'S RESILIENT away a step slowly, was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions through the turn, raced in hand into the stretch, extended
the lead at the furlong marker and kept to task under steady urging in deep stretch to prevail. MY YAMMY LADY settled off of the decent early pace, saved
ground on the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, gained ground at mid-stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. A
ROUSING BABE settled just off of the early pace, raced two wide between rivals into the turn, was roused three wide for the stretch run, raced on the left
lead inside of the furlong marker, was outkicked in the late stages and held safely for third. SONOMA DREAMING broke alertly, lost the early lead to SHE'S
RESILIENT and chased that foe into the turn, kept attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, was steered three wide into the drive, lost ground
heading to the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. BLACKENED tracked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide to the
quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and tired.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA allowed to settle in the early going, was well placed through the backstretch run, advanced on the second turn, was roused three wide into the
stretch, was full of run approaching the furlong grounds, collared STATEFOREST nearing the sixteenth-marker and pulled away in the final stages. BOLD
DAUGHTER was a bit fractious in the gate, was unhurried in the early running while not far back, improved position while saving ground on the far turn,
tipped two wide for the drive, advanced at mid-stretch, could not match strides with STOIC LUNA in the late stages and was up in the final strides to secure
second. STATEFOREST assumed command in the early stages, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was confronted
nearing the quarter marker, turned away the bid of BYE BYE BUGGSY and kept to task to mid-stretch, was overtaken by STOIC LUNA nearing the
sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in the final strides for second and was well clear in the end for third. LYINATTHEBAR was forwardly placed in the early
running, raced three wide along the first turn, lost ground along the backstretch run, steadied slightly while in tight approaching the second turn, was hard to
place along the second bend, raced five wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the leaders in the final stages and passed tired rivals in deep stretch.
CITY GLITTER stalked the early pace, raced four wide along the first turn, maintained her position through the backstretch run, gained ground four wide on
the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch and did not rally. BYE BYE BUGGSY was prominent in the early running, stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run, advanced on STATEFOREST nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in that effort heading into the stretch and tired in the final
stages. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN was keen in the early going, chased the moderate pace through the backstretch run, came in tight nearing the second turn,
was shuffled back along the far turn, trailed into the stretch and did not offer a final response.

Footnotes
BORKAN tracked the solid early pace, raced two wide along the turn, loomed nearing the furlong pole, overtook DAD BOD inside of the furlong marker,
drew to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth-pole and was hand urged to the finish. HARBOR SKY took back in the early running, improved position two wide
on the turn, came in a bit tight and waited for racing room at the top of stretch, found room heading to mid-stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker,
was no match for the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. HAWK HILL rated off of the solid early pace, advanced while outside of rivals on the
turn, was steered four wide into the stretch, continued his bid to mid-stretch, could not keep keep in the final furlong, weakened in deep stretch and just held
for third at the finish. DAD BOD was sent to establish the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn while on a clear lead, came under pressure in the
stretch, was overtaken inside of the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. SASQUATCH RIDE broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, lacked
early speed, raced three wide into the turn, was steered four wide into the drive and lacked a late rally. TRABIESO AVELITO broke alertly, ceded the early
lead to DAD BOD and stalked that rival through solid fractions into the turn, lost position at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and tired in the final
furlong.

quarter marker, tipped three wide into the stretch, loomed at the furlong pole. overtook JOHNNY DAR inside of the furlong marker, kept to task to deep
stretch and held in a drive in the final stages to prove best. JOHNNY DAR was hard sent leaving the break and dictated terms early on, set decent fractions
through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, came under pressure nearing the furlong pole, could not hold off HEAT N REHEAT
inside of the furlong marker and held well in deep stretch for second. CARDIFF CRACK prominent in the early going, stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run, kept attendance to the pace while two wide into the second turn, came in a bit tight while within aim nearing the furlong marker, was
outkicked in the drive and missed for second, while holding safely for third. MACHO CHROME forwardly placed in the early running, was a bit keen along
the first turn while close to the pace, maintained his position through the backstretch run, advanced from the inside on the far turn, checked slightly nearing
the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch but could not muster the needed late response. TEX HANLEY settled off of the decent early pace, raced two
wide into the far turn, was steered three wide for the drive and offered a mild late bid. ATTENZIONE unhurried in the early running, saved ground to the
second turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT METAL forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent
pace while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, maintained his position on the second turn while three deep, came four wide into the stretch and
gave way. LOOKOUT POINT settled in the early stages while not far back, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker and lacked a response in the
stretch. RACKATAPTAP settled off of the early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained that position to the second

LILY POO broke well, stalked SMILING LADY from the two path while well in hand and traveling well, moved to challenge through the turn, was set down in
the stretch, got the best of that foe in the final furlong and drew off to a decisive victory. DELUSIVELY bobbled slightly at the start, was outrun to the first
turn, settled in the rear of the field but well within striking distance, was moving well through the turn while in the two path tipped out for clear run in
mid-stretch and rallied well to get the place. SMILING LADY sprinted from the gate to gain the early lead then attempted to slow down the pace, enjoyed an
unchallenged lead through the far turn, was challenged at the top of the stretch by LILY POO, held on to the furlong grounds, weakened in the final stages
and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. BOURBON GLAZE held up a bit through the first turn and down the backstretch, raced close
up while saving ground along the rail, came under heavy pressure approaching the quarter pole and did not have the needed response while finishing up
evenly. MASTERY KAT raced three wide throughout, was close up to the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to go and loomed a threat then weakened
under pressure and was outrun down the stretch.

Footnotes
ALICE MARBLE allowed to settle off of the quick early fractions, saved ground into the turn, improved position heading to the quarter marker, angled four
wide into the stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker, caught CHANCERY WAY in the final
strides and was up on the wire to prevail. CHANCERY WAY showed good early speed and set a rapid pace into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker
by SECRETS TOLD, shook free from that foe and drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, came under pressure in the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off
ALICE MARBLE and was tagged in the final strides for the win, while besting the rest. SECRETS TOLD broke alertly, raced close to the fast early pace,
pressed CHANCERY WAY to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, re-rallied in the final stages and was up in the final strides to
secure third. XMAS SURPRISE was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the fast pace while three deep into the turn, maintained her position to the
quarter marker, lost ground approaching the furlong pole, re-rallied in deep stretch and was outfinished for third in the final strides. LEXINGTON HUMOR
broke awkwardly and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the run into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker and found her best stride late.
CAROLINA MIA chased the fast early pace, raced three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, was outrun nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied
in the final stages but could not muster the needed late response. SLACK TIDE chased from the second flight, came two wide to the quarter marker, lost
ground heading to the furlong pole and lacked a late kick. ALWAYS SEEKING chased the quick early pace, saved ground on the turn, lost position in upper
stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABU DHABI unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, continued that steady
bid while two wide on the second turn, came in a bit tight and waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, angled three wide for the drive, split rivals
nearing the furlong pole and loomed at mid-stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, kept to task to deep stretch and dug in in the final strides
to prevail. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) settled in the second flight while never far back, raced three wide into the second turn, was roused five wide into the
stretch, advanced at the furlong pole, rallied in deep stretch, came within aim of PRINCE ABU DHABI inside of the sixteenth-marker, surged in the final
strides and just missed for the win, while holding for second. EGON settled in the second flight in the early running, raced three wide into the first turn then
slipped to the two path into the backstretch run, came two wide into the far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, closed willingly inside of the furlong
marker, could not reel in the top two in the final stages and held safely in the end for third. HARCYN crowded SEA DOG leaving the start, was forwardly
placed into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions into the backstretch run, raced outside of rivals to the half-mile marker, came three wide into the
second turn, was roused and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took a narrow lead into the stretch, raced on the left lead to the furlong marker, could
not hold off PRINCE ABU DHABI inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. PASSARANDO allowed to settle, raced two wide into the
backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, roused three wide on the far turn, swung widest and came seven wide into the stretch,
advanced at mid-stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. SEA DOG was crowded by HARCYN at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled in the
second flight while saving ground into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, advanced to come within aim at the quarter pole,
swung four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and could not muster the needed late response. NAUVOO showed early speed and was
prominent into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run and into the far turn, advanced to vie for the lead heading into the stretch,
battled with HARCYN to the furlong pole, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in the final stages and gave way. CHASE THE CHAOS hopped at the
start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and did not threaten. JAM
SESSION broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms in the early stages, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under
pressure nearing the half-mile marker, could not keep pace heading to the furlong grounds and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BALNIKHOV (IRE) allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, was roused four wide nearing the
quarter pole, loomed at mid-stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, overtook IL BELLATOR inside of the sixteenth-marker and determinedly held off RIO
KING in the final strides to prevail. RIO KING was unhurried in the early running, raced two wide into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the
far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed fast in deep stretch, came within aim of BALNIKHOV in the final
strides and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure second. IL BELLATOR settled just off of the decent early pace, maintained his position
while two wide through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn, gained ground in upper stretch, chased the leaders while within aim to the
furlong marker, took command nearing the sixteenth-pole, could not match strides with the oncoming top pair in deep stretch and was outfinished, while
holding safely for third. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) settled off of the decent early pace, was floated four wide along the first turn, recovered and came two wide
into the backstretch run, was well positioned heading to the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into the lane, encountered traffic in deep stretch and was
outfinished in the final stages. FLAVIUS prominent in the early running, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn
and confronted LAMPLIGHTER JACK nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead with that rival to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong
pole, could not hold off IL BELLATOR nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened in deep stretch. TARANTINO settled in the second flight in the early
going, saved ground into the backstretch run, was well positioned heading into the far turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, advanced at the furlong
grounds, encountered traffic in deep stretch and lacked the needed late response. LAMPLIGHTER JACK broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set
decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, met the bid of FLAVIUS and battled with that
rival to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final stages and faded. TESORO was keen in the early running, floated out DICEY MO CHARA midway
through the first turn, chased the pace four wide into the backstretch run, advanced four wide into the second turn, was outrun to the top of the lane, was
shuffled back entering the stretch and tired in the drive. BOB AND JACKIE was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run, lost position on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.

DANEHILL SONG broke alertly, hustled to get to the lead then once clear angled over towards the rail, held a clear advantage through the turn, widened the
lead turning for home and won as much the best under intermittent urging. WHATWASTHENISNOW broke well then chased DANEHILL SONG from the
second spot through the turn, came under pressure when that rival started to slip away, kept to task and finished best of the rest. VALERIE brushed with
TOM'S PIC after the break, was up with the leaders early then dropped back a bit, re-bid through the turn with a mild sustained rally three wide and finished
up well enough to gain the show. TOM'S PIC chased the fast early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, gave way in the drive and finished evenly in
the final furlong. SUE GENEROUS broke outward at the start and bumped with PASSIONATE KISSES, lost some ground early then made some forward
progress heading into the turn, was put into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, could not improve and finished evenly. FRESNO CHILE struggled to
keep pace in the early going, found a good rhythm going into the turn then idled behind horses to the stretch, had no response when roused and was unable
to improve position. ROUSING STAR off a step slow, rushed to hold the rail position for the backstretch run while racing near the back of the pack, was in a
bit tight through the turn but did not have a response once clear in the stretch. PASSIONATE KISSES broke slightly inward after the break and was bumped
by SUE GENEROUS in the initial strides, began to race erratically after a quarter mile and was not persevered with. HUSSAR'S HOPE veered out from the
break and was off slowly, rushed to race mid-pack but four to five wide down the backstretch, began to lose ground while still wide going into the turn and
had nothing left to offer in the stretch.
