WATCH OUT NOW was sent along from the outside to set the early pace and held well to be clear late under steady handling. TEQUILA EMPIRE settled off
the early going, moved up two to three wide in the lane from the inside of Magicalstorm and finished well to get up for the place position. MAGICALSTORM
chased just to the outside of foe and weakened a bit in the drive. DR Z'S ELSA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced four wide near the
quarter pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GOLD MAKIN GIRL broke awkwardly, took the path of Leprechaun Charm away at the start, veered
back in soon after, raced off the early going, raced three wide around the far turn, continued three to four wide in the lane and never threatened.
LEPRECHAUN CHARM checked at the start, coaxed along early and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
VEILAZIG showed good early foot to set the early pace and held well to prevail under all out pressure. SIMPLE PLEASURE rated under a firm hold down
the backstretch, waited for racing room near the quarter pole, continued to search for racing room near the three sixteenths pole, split rivals just past the
eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire. NORA'S LEGACY prompt the pace while racing between rivals, raced from the outside of foes in the upper
stretch to race three to four deep and finished willingly to the wire. ITS MY MONEY TOO settled early on, made a bid three wide near the quarter pole to
challenge and flattened out in the drive. SHESMYBROKER raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. GREY HALO was coaxed from
the outside of foes, stopped and was eased up on through the final stages.

Footnotes
WILD EXPRESS was rated outside of foe under a firm hold, asked through the far turn, and proved best under all out pressure. OIL N CANDY showed good
early foot along the inside and gave way late grudgingly. TIZ A KNOCKOUT was off slowly, raced near the inside into the far turn, angled to the four path
into the upper stretch, moved up and improved position. OCCURRENCE was coaxed along from the inside and had not enough. NUBILITY was off slowly,
chased the pace from the outside of foes and weakened while racing four wide. LO PROFILE raced off the early going, was near the inside in the stretch
and had no response. MAREBELL raced mid pack early on, was five deep into the upper stretch and had no response. PERFECT MESA was forwardly
placed to lay up closed between and faded. MYRTLE BEACH was away slowly and never was a factor.
