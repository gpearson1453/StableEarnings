Footnotes
LOKI OF ASGARD was prominent into the first turn, stalked the pace into the backstretch run then advanced to press the pace to the half-mile pole,
confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, switched to the correct lead
nearing the sixteenth-marker, came under pressure in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. CANTILEVER stalked the decent early pace,
remained within striking distance through the backstretch run, raced two wide along the second turn, lost ground in the drive, re-rallied inside of the furlong
marker, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and won the nod for second. SGT POWELL tracked the decent early
pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on the second turn, chased LOKI OF ASGARD to the furlong pole, was gaining in
deep stretch but could not catch the winner and was just edged for second at the finish. DO IT FOR DAVE bobbled then broke out at the start and was off a
step slowly, stalked the decent early fractions from the inside, maintained his position through the backstretch run, chased from the rail on the second turn,
was outrun in upper stretch, re-rallied in the final stages and missed for third. G'S LAST CHANCE hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, settled
off of the decent early pace, raced three wide into the second turn and did not factor in the stretch. DARK MYSTERY broke out at the start and was away a
step slowly, settled three wide along the first turn, maintained that three wide trip through the backstretch run, was steered four wide to the quarter marker
and lacked a response in the stretch. EASTER COMMAND assumed command in the early stages, set decent fractions while pressure through the
backstretch run, was confronted by LOKI OF ASGARD nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
DUPLICATION settled off of the early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, was roused at the top of
the lane and tipped two wide for the drive, overtook LASMUIGH inside of the furlong marker and drew away under mild urging in the final stages. UNCLE
WALT was allowed to settle in the early running, was well placed through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn, was roused four wide into
the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed in the final stages, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and was up at the finish for second.
LASMUIGH (GB) was asked to show early speed and dictated terms in the early running, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was pressed
to the half-mile marker, shook free along the second turn, was set down in upper stretch, could not hold off DUPLICATION inside of the furlong marker,
gave way in the final stages and was just edged for second on the wire, while clear of the rest for third. ACERO was a bit hard to place into the first turn,
raced three wide into the backstretch run, made a middle move outside of rivals and chased the pace while within aim into the second turn, ran three wide to
the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and flattened out in the final stages. CORAZON DE LUCIA took back off of the early pace, was a bit keen in
the early stages and steadied off of heels entering the first turn, settled along the backstretch run, raced along the inside into the second turn, was steered
four wide into the stretch and did not threaten. GATO NEGRO was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, lost a bit of ground to the pacesetter along the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
LITTLE CASINO broke alertly and dictated terms in the early running, set decent fractions into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker, shook free in
upper stretch and extended the lead heading to the furlong grounds, came under pressure inside of the sixteenth-marker and dug in under firm handling to
prevail. PSYCHO DAR chased the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, lost ground to LITTLE CASINO in upper stretch, closed well inside
of the furlong marker, could not get by the determined winner in the final stages and missed for the win while holding for second. TORPEDO AWAY settled
off of the early pace while not far back, raced between runners into the turn, ran two wide to the quarter marker, came in tight and waited for racing room
nearing the top of the lane, swung four wide for the stretch run, was gaining in the drive, could not catch the top two in deep stretch and held safely for third
at the finish. BOBBY'S ALIBI chased the pace from the rail, maintained position to the quarter marker, lost ground at mid-stretch and did not rally. DR
PESCADO bothered HEY MATE at the start, was forwardly placed in the early running, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, lost ground heading
to mid-stretch and weakened. HEY MATE was crowded at the start by DR PESCADO and was away slowly, chased the early pace while outside of rivals,
advanced while four deep on the turn, was steered five wide into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
MARS ON FIRE broke alertly, showed good speed and set a pressured early pace, shook free on the turn and carved out quick fractions to the quarter
marker, drew to a clear lead approaching mid-stretch and drew away under mild urging in the final stages to be much the best. PINEAPPLE JUICE raced
forwardly in the early running then took back to stalk the quick pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, chased MARS ON FIRE to mid-stretch, could
not keep pace with the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. HYDRO FROST was prominent in the early running, raced close to the fast early pace
while two wide on the turn, chased MARS ON FIRE into the drive, gave way in deep stretch and just held for third at the finish. BOTH AT FAULT chased the
fast early pace from the second flight, raced three wide on the turn, ran evenly in the drive, did not offer a late response in deep stretch and just missed for
third. VIVA LEON JODIDO chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not muster a late rally.
RAVELLO was allowed to settle, raced two wide along the turn and did not factor. RETIREMENT MISSION was unhurried early on, saved ground into the
stretch and did not offer a late response. MY DAD IS THIRSTY lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
RAGER settled off of the fast early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, rallied along the inside in upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker,
tipped two wide inside of the furlong pole, overtook HIGHLAND GHOST in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prove best. HIGHLAND
GHOST broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, was engaged by WAR GAMES soon after the break and dueled with that foe through fast
fractions into the turn, battled to the quarter marker while well clear of the rest, shook free of WAR GAMES in upper stretch and raced to a clear lead at the
furlong marker, was kept to steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off RAGER in deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. TOP
EXECUTIVE tracked the dueling pacesetters in the early stages, raced two wide along the turn, advanced at mid-stretch, was outkicked in the drive and
held safely for third. EXECUTIVE CHEF was bumped at the start and away a step slowly, was unhurried in the early going, saved ground along the turn,
angled two wide into the stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF settled off of the fast early pace, raced two wide on the turn,
was roused four wide into the stretch and did not offer a late response. WAR GAMES was sent in the early running, engaged with HIGHLAND GHOST and
dueled with that foe through fast fractions to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST was unhurried in the early going, raced three wide along the first turn, improved position while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, was
roused four wide along the far turn, chased the pace setter to the furlong grounds, closed with a rush in deep stretch, came within aim of OH GREAT in the
final strides and surged at the finish to prevail. OH GREAT (IRE) broke alertly and dictated terms in the early stages, set a pressured pace along the first
turn then shook free into the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, showed the way while saving ground into the far turn, drew to a
clear lead at mid-stretch, kept to task while under firm urging to deep stretch, was confronted by ECOLOGIST in the final strides and was nailed on the line
for the win, while besting the rest. SUNNY SPOT saved ground in the early going while well placed, stalked the decent pace along the backstretch run,
advanced two wide on the second turn, could not match strides with OH GREAT in upper stretch, made a mild late gain in the final furlong, could not impact
the top pair in deep stretch and held for third. COOLCROSS settled off of the decent early pace while saving ground, was well placed through the
backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn, was outrun heading to mid-stretch, offered a mild late rally in the final stages and just missed for third.
WELLSWORT (IRE) settled off of the early pace while not far back, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground three wide on the far turn,
was outrun in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker and was gaining in the late stages. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was forwardly placed in the
early running, stalked the pace three wide on the first turn, maintained his position through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn, was
outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was prominent in the early stages, raced close to the decent pace through the
backstretch run, dropped back leaving the half-mile marker, tired along the second turn and trailed through the stretch.

Footnotes
SAINT IVES was well placed in the early running while under a snug hold, saved ground along the turn, tipped three wide and was roused at the top of the
stretch, gained ground heading to the furlong pole, overtook LUCKY LAD nearing the sixteenth-marker and drove clear in the final stages. LUCKY LAD
chased the pacesetter in the early running, advanced on the turn and pressed PAPA TIGER to the quarter marker, overtook that foe and assumed
command in upper stretch, was set down for the drive at the furlong grounds, could not hold off SAINT IVES heading to deep stretch, was outfinished and
was best of the rest. SHARONA'S WILD BOY chased the fast early pace from the second flight, raced two wide along the turn, made a mild gain at
mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in the late stages and closed for third. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased the fast early pace, improved position while
three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong pole and lacked a response in deep stretch. ARREST
was away a step slowly, chased the fast pace from the inside, gained ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. MUAY
THAI (IRE) lacked early speed, raced three wide into the turn, was coaxed five wide into the stretch and did not threaten. PAPA TIGER broke alertly,
showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final
furlong.

MISS FLAWLESS (FR) bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the early pace into the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch
run, advanced to stalk the pace into the far turn, was roused three wide heading to the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, vied for the lead at the
furlong marker with SHANGHAI MIST, took a narrow edged on that foe nearing the sixteenth-marker, determinedly kept to task in deep stretch and held the
runner-up at bay in the final strides to prove best. SHANGHAI MIST was prominent in the early going, stalked the decent pace into the backstretch run,
advanced on the pacesetter nearing the half-mile pole, pressed INDIAN DANCER to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, met the bid of
MISS FLAWLESS inside of the furlong marker, gamely battled with the winner to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while holding safely for
second. LIGHT UP was squeezed at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide along the first turn, inched closer
along the backstretch run, came five wide to the quarter marker, made a steady gain to mid-stretch, continued to make headway in deep stretch and held
safely in the end for third. ZABAVA hit the gate at the start and was off a bit awkwardly, settled off of the early pace while saving ground, shifted to the two
path heading into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. INDIAN DANCER broke alertly and established the early
lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure at the quarter marker, met the bid of oncoming rivals and battled to the
furlong grounds, could not keep pace in the final stages and gave way. NORTHERN ROSE was allowed to settle in the early going, raced three wide into
the backstretch run, was never far back to the half-mile marker, was steered four wide along the far turn, gained ground approaching the top of the stretch,
could not sustain that run in the drive and weakened in the late stages. BLUSHING BAY was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate
pace from the inside, maintained her position through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
AWESOME SUMMER broke in after the break and took the path of I'M DR. O, then went straight to the front, briefly cleared the field, was joined by
TALBOT BAY to the inside just past the half mile marker, dueled with that rival to deep stretch, gained the advantage in the final furlong and pulled away.
ROBIE prompted the early pace, backed off going into the turn but held inside position then had to wait for racing room through the turn, tipped out to the
three path at the top of the stretch and chased the winner home while best of the rest. TALBOT BAY broke out slightly at the break then shied from
AWESOME SUMMER a few strides out, rushed up to join the early pace, engaged AWESOME SUMMER near the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled through
the turn then gave way in mid-stretch while holding third. I'M DR. O squeezed at the start, fell back, stayed inside through the turn, ran on under intermittent
urging but needed more. MR. MASON off a step slow, settled off the speed, fell back going into the turn, re-engaged with the pack turning into the stretch,
had trouble finding racing room behind horses to deep stretch and was unable to improve position. COMMANDER KHAI away well, settled in the three path
just off the dueling leaders, went after them past the three furlong marker, had every chance turning for home but was outfinished down the lane. OUR
BOLD PRINCE was a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, was outrun in the early stages, made some forward progress but still had only one beat through
the turn, tipped out six wide into the stretch and made a mild rally but was not able to improve position. ALMANERA (IRE) close early, raced five wide
throughout and faltered in the stretch.
