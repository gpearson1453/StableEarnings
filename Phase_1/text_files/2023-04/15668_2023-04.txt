Footnotes
ESCAPE ARTIST took control along the inside, took pressure from NUCLEAR in the middle stages, dueled on the far turn while saving ground, spurted
away at the top of the lane under right-handed urging and remained clear under steady handling. PRECISION STRIKE stalked the pace from inside, swung
out into the lane, rallied and edged NUCLEAR for second. NUCLEAR drifted out shortly after the start, stalked off the rail then went up to press from outside
in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, bobbled a bit past the quarter pole, was no match for the winner at the top of the lane and got edged for the
place. RIDLEY'S MAJOR was crowded between rivals first time through the stretch, advanced three deep up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the
far turn and faltered in the lane. RAJI broke a step slow and drifted some, chased three to four wide on the first turn, lacked room and took hold past the
half-mile pole, dropped back on the far turn while two to three wide and failed to menace. STONKS settled a bit off the rail early, saved ground through the
far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
LUNATIC dueled for command from outside into and around the turn, got bumped by CARELESS STAR into the stretch, fought on down the lane and drew
clear in the final sixteenth. CARELESS STAR dueled for the lead from inside, drifted out and bumped LUNATIC entering the stretch, battled to the sixteenth
pole, then yielded and managed to hold the place. NEVER SWAY shifted in to bother rivals shortly after the start, steered chasing off the pace, rounded the
bend three then four wide, put in a late run and gained the show. BIG BELL got forced into inner rival at the start, raced two wide into the turn, angled out
and exited the bend four wide, rallied and missed the show. TEEN DRAMA tracked between rivals into the turn, went two wide around the bend and could
not produce a bid. ROSES R BLUE was off slow and lost her path at the start, trailed four wide into the turn, remained wide to the stretch and lacked a rally.
TWENTYSEVENTROUTS away quickly from outside, dropped back to stalk the top pair, went three deep into the turn, took aim three wide into the lane but
weakened in the drive. MAJESTIC GIGI was off a bit slow then got bumped from outside, stalked the leaders inside a pair of rivals into the turn, lost ground
around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
MAVEN sent for the lead and led outside SEE THROUGH IT early, cleared that rival exiting the backstretch, met the bid from BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB)
around the turn, shook free into the stretch, led clear through the lane then was challenged by SEE THROUGH IT late and held on. SEE THROUGH IT
raced up close inside the leader early, got shuffled back a bit into the turn, remained inside then moved out in the lane, launched a bid in deep stretch but
was denied. NATURAL POWER (IRE) dropped back early, raced off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn, finished willingly along
the fence and earned the show honors. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) stalked off the rail, bid from outside at the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with
the winner nearing the stretch and weakened. CHAOS THEORY stalked two wide into the turn, bobbled and took hold briefly at the quarter pole, drifted a bit
into the lane and could not rally. BUTKUS threw his head and came away slow in the beginning, tracked three deep into the turn, moved into the two path
late on the bend and failed to menace.

Footnotes
IT'S MY HOUSE sped to the front and crossed over into the two path early, pressured by SHOW TIME at the half-mile pole, cleared and moved to the rail
with three furlongs remaining, put to left-handed urging at the eighth pole and held safely. KATONAH pulled while between rivals in the two path early, lost
ground two wide on the second bend, finished determinedly through the lane to gain the place but could not reach the winner. SHOW TIME rated on the
inside early, went up to challenge at the half-mile pole, paused briefly at the three-eighths pole, chased the winner around the far turn and down the lane
and flattened to third. FINNEUS reared in the gate, was rank early while chasing five deep into the first turn, remained hard to ride before settling on the
backstretch and angled in, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and earned a minor award. BLETCHLEY PARK chased four deep early, three to four wide on
the far turn and weakened. MOBOU chased three deep on the clubhouse turn, two then three wide on the second bend and lacked the needed response.
HEMBREE tucked inside at the back early, trailed two wide on the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NOBLE REFLECTION sped clear quickly, showed the way near the inside through the turn, kicked clear at the top of the lane and was kept to task to set a
new track record. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) tracked two wide on the turn, angled out crossing the dirt, finished willingly but could not get to the winner.
FOR ALL MANKIND stalked the pace two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend, tipped off the rail across the dirt, found the rail again in the
stretch and flattened to third. RESPECT THE CODE threw his head and was off very slow, lagged behind to the stretch and failed to rally. FAST BUCK
stalked from inside and weakened in the lane. COULTHARD (IRE) pulled up early in the race and walked off. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE
HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SAVILE ROW broke a step slow, forwardly placed up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend, took over
outside the eighth pole, then kicked clear to win going away. STIR THE POT vied for the lead inside rivals, dueled with CONCH DADDY around the turn and
into the stretch, was overtaken by the winner nearing the eighth pole and stayed on to secure the place. MITICO bobbled a bit at the start, vied three deep
up the backstretch, chased the top pair three then four wide around the turn, finished willingly in the final furlong and earned the show honors. CROSS
EXAMINE was off slow in the beginning, trailed under coaxing up the backstretch, traveled along the rail then two wide on the turn, moved out in the drive
and showed a mild rally. MONGOLIAN FORD chased along the inside into the turn, ridden along through the bend then had to pause when coming up
behind STIR THE POT, remained inside through the lane but never found room. GATOR SHINING raced up close four deep early, chased wideset through
the turn, came six wide into the drive while still within striking distance but flattened in the final sixteenth. CONCH DADDY vied for the lead between rivals
early, dueled outside STIR THE POT around the bend and into the lane, fought to upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong.

FIRST PEACE shifted in to bump early, chased from inside into the turn, waited behind the top pair at the quarter pole, cut the corner into the lane, slipped
through inside HELLADIC to take over in upper stretch and maintained a clear lead over MAS RAPIDO (GB) in the final sixteenth. MAS RAPIDO (GB) got
bumped by FIRST PEACE then unhurried in the early going, raced along the rail then angled out across the dirt, rallied in the lane but was outkicked by the
winner. VALIANCER trailed along the inside into the turn, saved ground then moved off the rail across the dirt, angled out further in the lane and bested the
rest. CONCLUDE came out and bumped rival early, tracked two to three wide on the turn, bid outside the top pair and four wide into the stretch but was no
match in the final furlong. HELLADIC broke out and bumped rival then sped clear, held a short lead over NULLARBOR around the turn and into the stretch,
was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FLEET FEET raced near the back four wide into the turn, angled to the two
path around the bend, steered out back out and lacked a rally. NULLARBOR got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit early, bid
two wide around the bend, fought to upper stretch and faded. MARKS HIP took a bump from inside leaving the gate, got impeded and bumped by
CONCLUDE early, checked between rivals shortly after, became rank nearing the turn, went two to three wide around the bend, moved out across the dirt
and had little left for the drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN CONCLUDE AND MARKS HIP EARLY IN
THE RACE AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH CONCLUDE DID CROSS OVER ON MARKS HIP, THAT RIVAL WAS NOT COST A CHANCE AT A BETTER
PLACING AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

TAPATIO LEO hit the gate and broke inward, went up to challenge from inside then got crowded at the half-mile pole, drew alongside the leader again and
took over into the turn, kicked clear around the bend, held a comfortable lead into the final furlong, shortened late held in the end. CAROL'S COMIC broke
well then dropped back, rounded the bend four then five wide, rallied late and edged COWBOY MIKE for second. COWBOY MIKE broke out and bumped
rival, chased under coaxing up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn then angled to the rail, finished willingly through the lane to close the gap on the
winner while getting edged for the place. STELLA BOY sat off the pace, went three then four wide around the bend, moved inward in the lane and bested
the rest. SHIP AND SCAM raced near the back then trailed on the inside into the turn, swung out with a quarter mile left to run and churned on to improved
placings. TOM HORN hit the gate to come away a step slow then shifted in a bit shortly after, chased outside a rival then three wide on the turn and
flattened out. SEATTLE SURF sped to the front from outside and moved down to the two path, was overtaken at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not stayed
with the winner around the bend and chased two wide to the stretch, then weakened in the drive. AUSTONIAN got bumped then crowded between at the
start, raced at the back off the rail, found traffic three wide midway through the bend, moved out in the drive and could not rally. MONTANA tracked between
then outside a rival early, raced in the two path through the turn, tipped out in the lane and failed to menace. BLUE CHEESE OLIVE hard to load behind the
gate, bumped leaving the gate, raced two wide and had to pause behind rivals on the turn and then never responded once in the clear. CHIEF COUNCIL
sat off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty.

STAY IN THE GAME got crowded and had to check early near the fence, went up to challenge at the half-mile pole, dueled from inside through the turn,
cleared with a furlong remaining and drew away. BIG HAT WILLIE got bumped three times early then checked between rivals, chased six wide around the
turn, rallied and got up for second. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT raced up close from outside early, chased outside a rival on the turn then bid three deep at the
quarter pole, could not find the needed late kick in the furlong grounds and got edged for second. SPIRITIST chased under coaxing up the backstretch, went
three deep into the turn, bid four deep late on the bend but faltered in the late stages. CHICK'S DIG IT had to check early then pulled up the backstretch to a
forward position, waited for room behind the leaders around the bend, lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally after gaining a clear path.
GOLDENSPA chased three deep then checked between at the half-mile pole, navigated the turn two then three wide and could not rally. CRYPTO RIDE
bumped with inner rival early, tracked five wide around the turn and failed to rally. WARRENS WORLD sped to the front, challenged from inside at the
half-mile pole, dueled two wide around the bend, then weakened in the lane. STRUT ON LOUIE antsy in the gate, raced three wide into the turn, eased out
and came five wide into the stretch and made no impact. QUAGMIRE MAGIC was off slow to begin, bumped with outer rival three times early, went four
wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and was not a factor.

LOTTERY PICK settled in the two path, moved closer off the rail up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the stretch, dug in the final sixteenth and got
up. SO I'M TOLD chased two wide around the first turn, bid outside on the far turn, dueled into the lane, took over and brushed in upper stretch, held a short
lead over GOLDENEYE into deep stretch and got run down by LOTTERY PICK in the end. GOLDENEYE sped to the front and moved inside, challenged on
the far turn and dueled into the lane, lost command and brushed in upper stretch, then stayed on for a game third. AJAAWEED got bumped leaving the
gate, sat off the pace three wide early, rounded the far turn three to four wide and needed to find more in the final furlong. BIG FLINT got pinballed leaving
the gate, trailed on the inside then angled out leaving the first turn, lagged behind three wide on the far turn and passed tired rivals. KO SAMUI (IRE) stalked
three deep around the first turn, two wide on the second bend and lacked a rally. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES broke out and bumped rival, stalked along the
inside, saved ground through the far turn and weakened. WHAT A DUDE chased four then three wide on the first turn, raced off the pace up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn but came up empty.
