Footnotes
OAXACA set a pressured pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. TEMERITY raced off the pace five wide and rallied to gain the place late. NOBLE
DREAMER stalked the pace in the four path, was no match for the winner and lost second late. L. E. GRAY was bumped just after the start, steadied while
racing a bit erratically down the backstretch, saved ground around most of the turn, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung eight nearing the
eighth pole and improved position. FOR EVER OURS chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. JUNO SEA broke inwardly and bumped L. E. GRAY
just after the start, came out and bumped HONEYBUNNYBOOBOO soon after, dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch and tired. KINDNESS IS FREE
failed to menace while racing three and four wide. HONEYBUNNYBOOBOO broke awkwardly, was bumped soon after, trailed inside and was eased in the
lane.

Footnotes
DOVE IN CHARGE stalked in the three path, was cued right handed midway around the turn and ranged up to take aim from the five path into the stretch,
took the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under right handed encouragement. SUBTLE FAITH raced off the pace in the five path, was coaxed
midway around the turn and in the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on to get up for place. CAJUN FANTASY set the pace in the two path, was
roused nearing the quarter pole and received right handed cues from the two path into the lane, was overtaken by the outer eventual winner passing the
eighth pole, and evened out in the final furlong to show. RIA FORMOSA raced wellback in the three path, was ridden around the turn and tipped out to the
seven path in upper stretch, but was no factor. SUGAR SIN raced up close in the four path, bid under rousing from the three path around the turn, but faded
while shifting inside in the stretch. SHOW ME LOVE was behind in the two path, floated out to the six path under urging into the lane, but never threatened.
RATIONAL KATE tracked along the inside but was empty around the three path turning into the lane. LITTLE GIA chased in the four path, backed up early
around the turn, and was eased home.

three wide and lacked a closing bid. KENTUCKY PRIDE failed to menace while racing three wide. SHES THE NORTH pressed the winner two wide, was
hard held while racing keenly down the backstretch, bid between the top two finishers midway around the far turn and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
THE ICEMAN RUNNETH bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside, was roused along the rail when headed by an outer foe passing the
three eighths pole, shrugged off that foe and opened up along the inside into the lane, and held sway. ADIOS PAPA CHICO tracked in the five path, was
under right handed urging midway around the turn and in the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. VANISHING INTEREST raced off the
pace in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on between rivals for show. BIG
MARTINI raced wellback in the two path, tipped out and was driven in the six path around the turn, and finished evenly around the seven path down the
lane. BERNARDO'S LEGACY brushed with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid rounding the turn, but was repelled into the
stretch, and faded. POWER HUMOR bumped with an inner foe twice early, chased in the six path, shifted into the three path into the turn, but flattened
down the lane. NIGHT RIDE brushed with an inner foe at the start then bumped with an outer foe twice just after, was behind in the six path early and never
threatened. BEN'S HERO bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked around the two path but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
BELLA ROMANZA raced well off the pace two wide, advanced at the rail around the far turn, swung out nearing the eighth pole, bumped BIG BRASS BED
and burst clear. STARSHIP BOEING hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide entering the far turn and rallied outside. BIG BRASS
BED saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch, was bumped in midstretch and flattened out. TICKLE MY FANCY was hustled two wide,
was outsprinted around the first turn, angled out down the backstretch, re-bid two wide, took the lead in upper stretch and weakened through the final
furlong. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL was devoid of speed while racing two wide, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. IMAGE OF LOVE had early
speed inside, hit the rail entering the first turn, chased two and three wide from there and came up empty in the lane. I'M GLAD (IRE) was intent on the lead
three wide around the first turn, cleared and angled in down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the far turn and tired in the stretch. MISS
HOLLY failed to menace while racing three wide. GRAND BIRDIE played no factor while racing four wide around the first turn and along the rail around the
far turn.

Footnotes
STARSHIP RENEGADE chased in the five path, ranged up and bid in the four path around the turn, took the lead and was put to a drive into the stretch,
and drew clear under right handed encouragement. LOGICO trailed in the two path, was ridden around the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the lane,
and ran on for place. LAUGHING BOY tracked in the four path, was roused from the two path passing the quarter pole and split foes into the stretch, but
evened out for show. DOC AMSTER pressed in the three path, stuck a head in front passing the three eighths pole, was overtaken by the outer eventual
winner into the lane, floated out to the six path, and flattened. NITROUS CHANNEL set the pace inside, was coaxed passing the three eighths pole, but
yielded at the top of the stretch. AMERICAN PRINCE raced off the pace in the four path but never threatened. ALMANZO rated in the two path early, was in
the five path around the turn, but never menaced.

CARROTHERS tracked in the five path, bid under light rousing in the four path around the far turn, took the lead passing the quarter pole and was in the five
path at the top of the lane, drifted in and was driven clear. JOURNEYMAN chased inside, tipped out under a ride around the far turn, was in the six path
entering the stretch, and kept on to split place. CALL CURT raced off the pace in the three path, was under coaxing in the five path early around the far turn,
tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on to split place. BROOKLYN STRONG got brushed by an inner foe at the start, was unhurried in the
four path around the first turn and shifted in to the two path down the backside, was roused midway around the far turn, but never factored around the two
path in the stretch. EAMONN steadied in the two path out of the first turn, rated in the two path down the backside, tipped out and was ridden from the four
path into the far turn, was in the five path at the top of the lane, but did not threaten. TAPSASIONAL stalked in the four path, bid between foes in the three
path rounding the far turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. LIGHT FURY pulled while up close in the three path, took the lead in the two path
early around the far turn, but yielded in the stretch. LIVING WATER broke out and brushed an outer foe, set the pace in the two path but gaveway along the
inside early around the far turn.

Footnotes
GONE NUTS brushed with an inner foe, stalked in the five path, ranged up around the turn and floated out to the seven path into the lane, bid passing the
eighth pole, and drew past an inner foe to win. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH chased in the five path, was driven around the turn, shifted out to the eight path in
upper stretch, and ran on to get up for place. ON JET HEIR got brushed between foes at the start, pressed in the three path, bid under a ride around the
turn, took a narrow lead from the four path into the lane, but evened out late to show. PAPA KATZ trailed in the three path, received a right handed cue
midway around the turn, fanned out to the ten path into the stretch, and stayed on. JOYFUL SURPRISE brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the
two path, was along the rail rounding the turn, shifted out to the five path into the lane, and finished evenly. RECKLESS PLACE raced off the pace in the
four path, was coaxed in the three path around the turn, but was no factor around the seven path in the stretch. GRAND VALLEY rated in the six path but
was no menace from out in the nine path down the lane. BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN got brushed between foes at the start, prompted the pace in the four path,
bid rounding the turn, but faded around the six path in the stretch. TI SENTO (IRE) set the pace in the two path but yielded passing the eighth pole.
