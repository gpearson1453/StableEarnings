Footnotes
SPANSIVE set the pace in the two path, was under light rousing around the far turn and was cued when being challenged by an outer foe approaching the
quarter pole, was in the two path at the top of the lane, drifted out after a left handed cue and bumped with an outer for passing the eighth pole, dug in, and
inched away late. GLORIA'S PRINCESS stalked in the four path, ranged up around the far turn and bid from the five path at the top of the lane, tipped
slightly inwards and bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and ran on but was repelled to finish with place. MILLENNIUM PARK prompted the
pace in the four path, bid under coaxing midway around the far turn, but evened out from the four path in the stretch to show. PREREQUISITE got bumped
between foes at the start, rated along the inside, was roused while tipping out to the three path into the far turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch,
and was one paced. MO TOWN MAYHEM brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, was under coaxing rounding the far turn, but failed
to threaten. OGEMA BAY bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback around the three path and never factored from out in the seven path down
the lane. MALIBU SMART tracked in the two path, was put under a ride just after the half, and backed up around the far turn. GRAVY had a slow start and
raced off the pace in the four path, was roused while shifting inside into the far turn, but was empty from the two path at the top of the lane.

JERRY'S TURN set the pace two wide and drew off while ridden out. STERLING HARMONY had early speed inside of the winner, chased in the two path
around the turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, could not match strides from there to but dug in to hold second. AWESOME CRUSADER was bumped at
the start, raced in range four wide and was one-paced through the lane. MR. AMERICAN stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. RACKET
broke outwardly and bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. GOTTA LIKE HIM broke in a tangle then veered out and
slammed into GLOBAL PRIDE, made progress two wide between foes around the turn but faded in the lane. GLOBAL PRIDE was slammed and forced out
just after the start, raced five wide and never threatened. ARMS hit the starting gate, saved ground in midpack and had no response. NO TOMORROW was
off slow, saved ground and made little impact. NOWITZKI was outrun outside. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND

BEHIND ENEMY LINES (GB) stalked in the two path, was cued right handed from the three path midway around the far turn, and bid while floating out to
the seven path entering the lane, took the lead in upper stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. ANGLOPHILE bumped with an inner foe at the start,
travelled in the four path around the first turn and was unhurried in the six path down the backside, was under a ride in the four path around the far turn and
fanned out to the nine path entering the lane, rallied down the center, and was up for place. DUNEDIN bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the
three path, was coaxed from the four path into the far turn, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. KING'S FORTUNE got
squeezed at the start, was in the three path around the first turn and rated in the five path down the backside, was under urging from the four path tuning
into the stretch, shifted out passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. HARRY TIME (IRE) prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a nudge
rounding the far turn and was in the four path entering the lane, but faded in the final furlong. DRINKING PROBLEM set the pace in the two path, was
roused while shifting inside into the far turn, tipped back out to the two path for the stretch, but yielded passing the eighth pole. SPY NOVEL was between
foes in the two path around the first turn and raced wellback in the four path into the backstretch, was driven in the five path around the far turn and swung
out to the eight path into the stretch, but did not factor. COOL KISS tracked along the inside but was no menace.

Footnotes
THERAPIST was unhurried around the three path early, snuck closer down the backside and was roused into the final turn, was in the five path at the top of
the stretch, rallied while tipping inwards into the final furlong, and was up in the closing strides. BAY STREET MONEY rated in the three path, tipped out to
the five path and was under light rousing midway down the backside, was driven around the final turn and floated out to the seven path into the lane, and
ran on for to get up for place. MASTER PIECE (CHI) tracked in the four path, bid into the final turn, took over the lead and received a left handed cue while
still in the four path at the top of the lane, and kept on but was caught in the final sixteenth on both sides to show. WICKED FAST was behind in the three
path early, shifted out to the five path and was coaxed down the backstretch, swung out to the seven path into the lane, and passed tired rivals. RY'S THE
GUY set the pace in the two path, tipped to the rail and was put to a drive when challenged by an outer duo around the final turn, but yielded from the two
path in upper stretch. CALIFORNIA FROLIC raced wellback in the two path but was no factor around the five path in the stretch. NOVO SOL (BRZ)
prompted the pace in the two path early, bid under a drive between rivals early around the final turn, but gaveway entering the lane. ABAAN stalked in the
two path but started to backup early around the far turn.

HOLY FOLEY raced well back two wide, circled five wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. MEOW MEOW HISS failed to menace while
racing three wide. THE ARCHANGEL was off a step slow, raced well back while saving ground, made some progress at the rail around the far turn,
steadied near the quarter pole and faded through the lane. GOOD VALUE chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. MILAN MISCHIEF
played no factor while racing three wide. SECRETS GALORE saved ground in range and retreated through the lane. EVERY TIME advanced three wide to
the lead around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around much of the far turn and gave way readily near the
five-sixteenths pole. ANDROMACHE threw her head at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CLAPTON chased in the six path, moved up and was roused from the four path into the far turn, bid while still in the four path under a heavy drive turning
into the lane, took the lead narrowly and brushed with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and inched away to win. O'CONNOR (CHI) stalked in the four
path, bid in the three path around the far turn, took a narrow lead and was cued left handed in upper stretch, kept on but brushed with a challenging outer
foe passing the eighth pole, and was edged out late to place. SURLY FURIOUS set the pace in the two path, lost the lead nearing the quarter pole and
shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane, and held on to show. TWELVE VOLT MAN tracked in the five path, was under right handed urging around
the far turn and tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, drifted out and finished evenly. SIMPLIFICATION was held up in the three path, under a drive
around the far turn, but was tired entering the stretch. CAJUN'S MAGIC settled in range along the inside early but was no menace. FIRST CAPTAIN had an
awkward start, was wellback in the four path, and could never get involved.

took a narrow lead and was cued right handed passing the eighth pole, tipped inwards to meet the challenge of an inner rival, brushed with that inner rival
passing the sixteenth pole, and held on. DEAN DELIVERS settled in range around the three path, was coaxed passing the three eighths pole and urged
right handed from the two path into the stretch,, ran on and bid entering the final furlong, dueled with an outer foe to the wire and brushed with that foe
passing the sixteenth pole and was denied to finish with place honors. STEAL SUNSHINE trailed in the four path and was roused into the turn, fanned out to

MARKETSEGMENTATION rated off the pace three wide, swung out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in deep stretch. PRINCESS
THEOREM stalked the pace three wide, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. LOVE IN THE AIR set a rated pace along the rail,
fought on inside to deep stretch but was outfinished. CAFE SOCIETY hesitated at the start, saved ground off the pace, lacked a clear path in the lane,
swung three wide leaving the eighth pole and never quite found clear sailing. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) was very reluctant to load, raced up close while a bit
keen, angled out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. KAHIKO pressed the pace two wide between foes, led around much of the far turn
and weakened through the final furlong. SOUPER HOITY TOITY raced two wide in midpack, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and had a mild rally
between foes late. PERSEVERANCIA was outrun while racing two and three wide. ARM CANDY chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
AFFIRMATIVE LADY broke out and bumped MIRACLE into ATOMICALLY at the start, settled just off the pace while racing in the two path for five furlongs,
angled out bumped INFINITE DIAMOND near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped four wide in upper stretch, closed strongly and kicked clear late. SACRED
WISH raced off the pace four wide early, advanced five wide around the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place late. FLAKES set a pressured pace
along the rail, was headed by DORTH VADER near the quarter pole, fought on inside of foes to midstretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong
but kept trying and just missed second. DORTH VADER broke outwardly, was strung out six wide into the first turn, angled down into the three path by the
middle of that bend, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead and shifted in in upper stretch, vied
between foes to midstretch and flattened out late to get narrowly outfinished by rivals on both sides. MIRACLE was bumped on both sides soon after the
start, raced in range four wide and lacked a rally. INFINITE DIAMOND pressed the pace two wide, was bumped by the winner near the five-sixteenths pole
and faded from there. ATOMICALLY was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace three wide and had no response. JUST KATHERINE saved
ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
STEADY ON tracked in the three path, was under light rousing around the far turn, took aim and was cued right handed around the four path at the top of
the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole, and inched past the inner pacesetter for the win. CHURCHTOWN set the pace inside, was put under a ride in the
two path rounding the far turn, opened slightly into the stretch, stayed on under left handed urging, but was caught late by an outer foe to finish with place
honors. FORT WASHINGTON trailed in the four path, was cued right handed from the three path into the far turn, got stymied at the top of the lane, found a
seam in the four path passing the eighth pole and kept on to get thru that seam, got bumped by an out-drifting inner foe near the sixteenth pole, but got up
for show. LUCKY CURLIN rated in the four path, was coaxed in the three path rounding the far turn and was under right handed urging from the three path
into the stretch, evened out passing the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth after a left handed urge and bumped a passing outer rival late. COUNTY
FINAL raced in midpack around the five path, was cued right handed around the far turn, but was one paced in the stretch. GRAY'S FABLE was unhurried
along the inside, put to a drive midway around the far turn and swung out to the ten path entering the lane, but was no factor. DREAMS OF TOMORROW
raced in midflight from out in the six path, was under a drive in the five path midway around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, but
flattened. SOUPER DORMY was a bit keen while wellback in the five path and tipped out to the seven path while hard held down the backstretch, was
asked for more run from the six path around the far turn, but failed to threaten from the nine path into the lane. ROARING FORTIES stalked in the four path,
was under coaxing midway around the far turn, but faded from the six path in the stretch. STRIKER prompted the pace under a hold in the three path, was
roused to bid into the far turn, but gaveway into the stretch. HE'SPUREGOLD steadied in the two path early into the first turn and was off the pace in the
three path but never menaced.

Footnotes
FORTE had his head turned at the start but was still away well, settled off the pace three wide, was patiently ridden three wide between foes around the far
turn, swung five wide turning for home, surged outside and was up late. MAGE broke slowly and lost his path, trailed early, raced three wide around the first
turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, circled five wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, vied outside of CYCLONE MISCHIEF
through midstretch, put away that foe nearing the sixteenth pole but but was unable to resist the winner in the later yards. CYCLONE MISCHIEF raced in
range five wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid between rivals near the quarter pole, vied to midstretch and kept on for the
show. MR. RIPPLE tracked the pace four wide, was bumped midway around the first turn, edged closer three wide between foes rounding the far turn then
flattened out in the stretch. FORT BRAGG lunged at the start, rushed up between foes, set the pace in the three path around the first turn, angled in early on
the backstretch, set the pace along the rail from there to upper stretch and weakened. IL MIRACOLO broke inwardly and forced NAUTICAL STAR in, raced
off the pace two wide and lacked a rally. WEST COAST COWBOY chased the pace from the rail and faded after a half. JUNGFRAU raced in range three
wide between foes, bumped with MR. RIPPLE midway around the first turn, steadied leaving the bend, chased down the backstretch and dropped back
three wide around the far turn. NAUTICAL STAR was forced in at the start, raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and never
reached contention. MR. PEEKS had his head turned at the start, prompted the pace two wide and retreated after six furlongs. DUBYUHNELL played no
factor while racing five and six wide. SHAQ DIESEL steadied along through the opening furlong, saved ground and was through early.
