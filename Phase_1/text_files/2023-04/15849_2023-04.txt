Footnotes
RACHEL'S CAPER stalked the pacesetter from outside, raced two to four wide throughout, took over in upper stretch, was clear by mid-stretch, held sway
under moderate urging. GRANDSONSAM settled toward the back inside a rival but racing in the four path, took closer order up the backstretch, advanced
four deep and between foes near the quarter pole, gained slowly and steadily in upper stretch but was second best. MAGNA TAP switched outside foes into
the first turn racing off the inside, moved out further to advance four then five then six wide on the far turn, gained steadily into upper stretch but needed
more. SWORD OF GOLD tracked from inside through the first turn, switched outside a foe up the backstretch racing between rivals into the far turn, needed
more. FOOL'S MIRAGE raced off the pace two to three wide early, shifted to the rail up the backstretch, failed to rally. PUPPY POWER broke just a
half-step slowly, was caught five wide into the first turn, dropped back and failed to rally. WARRIOR'S STAR was coaxed forward to set the pace in the
clear, came up empty.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE DOLLAR raced off the pace of the loose leader, advanced four wide, struck the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged away. LOCK UP YOUR
PETS sped clear, widened up the backstretch setting the tempo from just off the rail, was overtaken near the sixteenth pole and second best. VLOCK raced
two wide into the turn, moved nearer to the rail on that bend, ran on and held show honors. BLUESKIESANDANGELS broke a step slowly, switched off the
inside racing in behind foes in the two to three path into and on the turn, angled seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on but missed show honors. JEANO
pursued from between runners three to four wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. IRA CHAMP was ridden along early on the turn racing
three to four wide, lugged out a bit in upper stretch and ran on evenly. CAMANCHE RIVER tracked mid-pack inside, moved out a path late on the turn,
lacked the needed late kick. GOSPEL DANDY broke in the air and was never a threat.

Footnotes
KACHINA moved forward three then two wide on the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch racing off the rail and with outside pressure, faced a new
challenge from outside turning for home, repelled that one then lugged in a bit but held an inside rival at bay under steady handling. IM THE BIGGER BEAR
pressed the early pace from inside, dropped back up the backstretch, asked for more at the quarter pole, advanced into upper stretch drawing inside the
flank of the leader along the rail coming to the furlong grounds but was no match while holding second. RAINBOWS ARE FREE raced off the leaders in the
three path early, advanced four then three wide on the far turn, put a very short head in front coming to the top of the stretch but evened out thereafter. OH
NIKI saved ground inside early, switched out and went two wide on the far turn still far off the leaders, failed to rally. LOVELY LOLITA pressed four then
three wide through the first turn and up the backstretch, came up empty. STOLEN KISSES was in tight a few strides after the break and shuffled back racing
off the leaders four then three wide early, moved nearer the rail and saved ground on the far turn but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
AWESOME OUTLAW led through the opening three-sixteenths then was joined by an inside rival, dueled outside and a short head behind that one, retook
the lead at the top of the stretch, drew clear and held sway. MINGUS stalked mid-pack from outside, moved out from four to six wide on the turn, captured
show honors but was only second best. KICK IT AGAIN BOB switched out, stalked the dueling leaders on the turn three then four wide, kept on for show
honors. EURO TRACKING moved forward to take a short lead, dueled inside a rival, yielded to that one but kept on to maintain a minor award. HE'S A
ROCK was forced in a bit at the break, settled off the pace, advanced inside, came out about three wide turning into upper stretch, was outkicked for the
minor placings. CIMARRON SAND shifted in, saved ground but did not threaten. FRANZ came in at the break, raced off the inside part of the track at the
rear, tired.

Footnotes
OUR DAVINA broke outwardly bumping a rival, set the pace racing off the rail, was pressured into the far turn going two then three wide on that turn and
engaged in a duel, edged clear in mid-stretch and held that rival at bay to prevail. CANADA CANDY brushed lightly at the start, stalked three wide early,
pressed up the backstretch, drew even dueling outside three to four wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner but second best. CON SUERTE raced
off the pace five wide early, began an advance three then two wide on the far turn, ran on to capture show honors. CARRY ON was bumped and steadied
slightly at the start, raced mid-pack in the three path early, was within range three to four wide on the far turn, ran on evenly. SMOKIN' OKIE shifted in early
saving ground on the first turn, put to some urging two deep on the far turn, steadied slightly when in tight at the quarter pole, failed to rally. EUTYCHIA was
brushed lightly at the start, settled off the pace four wide early, shifted in up the backstretch saving ground on the far turn before coming out a bit, was never
a threat. BRODIE BABY tracked inside racing close to the leaders, came up empty.

Footnotes
COWBOY MISCHIEF was unhurried at the rear inside early, advanced on the far turn, swung five wide out of that bend in a sweeping move to take
command by upper stretch, fought to hold off a challenger late. PALUXY angled in settling off the leaders along the rail saving ground early, edged closer
into the far turn, angled three wide coming past the quarter pole commencing a bid, fought on inside a rival but couldn't get past. GOSPEL MUSKETEER
moved clear to set the pace racing off the rail, was overtaken in upper stretch, kept on but was no match for the top pair while best of the rest. ROYALLY
broke a step slowly, moved forward and stalked four wide, was within range coming to the top of the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. CANEY'S
GHOST stalked three wide early, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
PORTSMOUTH tracked from inside just off the leaders, angled four wide coming past the quarter pole, was carried out a bit in upper stretch, struck the lead
in mid-stretch and drove clear. MESSAGE DISCIPLINE bumped with a rival at the start, was encouraged forward, pressed the leader from the three-eighths,
bid three wide leaving the turn, lugged out a bit in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but just held place. MAGNET AND STEEL settled stalking
outside, went four to five wide on the turn, missed the place. JUST OKIE broke inwardly, raced inside off the pace, shifted five wide turning into upper
stretch then moved out a bit at that juncture, ran on. C C'S LEGACY moved clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, was pressured on the turn,
weakened thereafter. SWEET ALEX tracked from mid-pack three to four wide and between runners, failed to threaten. WESTCOAST BREEZE was
outpaced early and not a factor. INSIDE JOB bumped at the break, pursued inside rivals mid-pack but off the fence, was never a threat and faded.

Footnotes
SAYAAD AIN'T SO moved forward inside a rival to take the lead outside the half-mile marker, set the pace racing just off the rail, moved clear into upper
stretch and held sway while being kept to the task. ALL AFLUTTER tracked from inside just off the leaders, shifted four wide turning for home, was no match
but second best. RAINBOW SMILES was forwardly-placed stalking four wide into the turn, secured show honors but was no match for the top pair.
MISSWISH raced outside rivals going seven wide through the turn and kept on in the lane. MISS COFFEYVILLE raced inside a rival but well wide going six
deep through the turn, improved position. ENDLESS GRACE raced well back early, fanned nine wide and improved position. ANGEL WHISPER was up
close chasing five then four wide, lacked the needed late kick. LIL BEAN MACHINE was fractious behind the gate, ridden along early, failed to menace.
VICENZA GOLD raced near the inside and was not a factor. GODDESS OF WONDER vied three wide outside a foe early, dropped back and faded.
BOUJEE BRITT chased mid-pack six wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
SULPHUR SUE pressed two wide, took over at the top of the stretch and drew clear. MISS LONG LEGS was forced out heading to the first turn but eased
back and angled in racing three to four wide, advanced nearer the leaders soon after, moved out from three to five wide on the far turn, gained the place but
was not a late threat to the winner. GOSPEL FABULOUS was bumped at the start, moved forward inside to set the pace, faced pressure on the far turn,
weakened in the stretch but held show. MS. MORENA bumped a rival at the start, was in a bit tight soon after, settled well back, switched out five wide
coming to the half, made a swift move outside on the far turn but could not sustain the effort and evened out. O S U BUDKE was carried out nine wide
heading into the first turn, took back inside that rival and altered in racing four to five wide thereafter, dropped back tired. RIVER BLING angled in on the first
turn after being forced to enter that bend four to five wide, saved ground the rest of the turn and on the far turn but failed to rally. GRAY PEARL bore out
entering the first turn, shifted in, was never a threat. TOSH pulled up leaving the first turn, was vanned off.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC VISION broke a step slowly, settled at the back, fanned eight wide for the drive, accelerated and drove past late. GOSPEL SISTER got away
alertly, set the pace racing just off the rail, drew clear through upper stretch but weakened and was caught. JUST ROSIE saved ground inside through the
early part of the turn after racing well back early, angled six wide leaving that bend, gained show honors. PRINCESS BALL edged closer four to five wide on
the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. CATALE WINEMIXER raced off the pace in the back half of the field, came into upper stretch seven wide and was not
a threat. BILLIE BABY moved closer in behind rivals two to four wide on the turn, lacked room and steadied slightly about the quarter pole and still lacked
room in behind coming to the top of the stretch, did not rally thereafter. LA PARADISO JORDAN stalked up close four wide through the turn and faded.
STORMY BISONETTE was urged forward, chased inside, came off the rail late on the turn, tired. HOT TAMALLI attended the pace from outside three wide
early, chased into and on the turn but came up empty and was not persevered with late.
