Footnotes
KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid by the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under left
handed crop urging, sharp. APACHE was settled back early, came five wide into the lane and had a late rally to get up for the place award. NICK THE
CARDSHARK was settled early, three wide on the turn and had a mild late kick and just missed the place award. AGGRANDIZE stalked the winner and
made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. ANNAMATED MOON was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn and advanced
but lacked a late rally. FLAT OUT FLASHY failed to respond. SPIKES SHIRL pressed the pace two wide and stopped.

Footnotes
ROSE VALLEY rushed up the inside to be close up by the half mile marker, then made a inside bid on the turn to take command by the quarter pole, then
drew off in the lane to prove best under right handed crop urging. WARRIOR'S MISS pressed the early pace three wide, then fell of the pace on the turn, ran
on to be clearly second best, no match for the winner. FAIRVIEW chased the pace four wide, then was five wide on the turn and came widest into the lane
and was best of the rest. LUCKY BREEZE was close up early between rivals, then dropped to the inside on the turn and weakened. WIN FOR LAILA was
bumped at the start, chased the early pace, made a four wide run on the turn and weakened. CEREAL I D was allowed to settle early, inside on the turn and
lacked a rally. DISCREETLIN JONES set a pressured pace two wide and faltered.

was denied on the wire to just miss. BLIND SIGHT was outrun early, came three wide into the lane and had a belated rally on the inside to be up for the
show award. UNION RALLY chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and had no rally. SHANIA SEA set a fast pace early while clear

FED CHAIR set a pressured pace on the inside, then shook clear on the turn, then dug in gamely in the drive and held sway late to prove best, drving. MR
BOLDACIOUS pressed the early pace three wide, then m made a two wide bid off the turn and ran on but it proved to be not enough. FORECLOSURE was
bumped at the start, rated along the inside, angled out three wide leaving the turn, then shifted back in by the sixteenth marker and a mild late rally to get
the nod for the show award. SWEEPIN HARD was reserved early, then had a belated rally on the inside and just missed the show award. BLUEBERRY
MASH was allowed to settle early on the inside, shifted out and came five wide into the lane and had a mild late kick but needed more. COUSIN BOB
tracked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. PRATT was settled three wide and tired.

prove best, driving. DIXIE CANNONBALL stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage, then shook clear off the
turn but could not hold off the winner, second best. KEEPING IT COUNTRY was well placed early on the inside, boxed by the quarter pole, shifted out and
came three wide into the lane, then finished willingly to be clearly best of the rest. TIZ HANDSOME pressed the pace two wide, made as bid between rivals
on the turn and faded in the drive. BOX OF JOE chased the early pace and lacked the needed rally. DREAMERS REWARD set a pressured pace on the
inside and weakened in the drive. CALLYOURIGHTBACK chased the pace three wide and stopped. BUSTER BRUNO failed to menace.
