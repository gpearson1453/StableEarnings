Footnotes
SUPER RENEE prompted the pace two wide, bid in the three path around the turn, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command
while drawing away entering the lane, and was ridden out under strong hand urging. PROUD FOOT tracked two wide and between horses, gained place at
the three sixteenths pole while chasing the clearing leader, and proved second best. AZUL TEQUILA laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, tipped to
the five path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. GIN N SIN saved ground off of the pace, then rallied two wide and through traffic for a minor share.
MS HAYLEY lacked speed, took the turn in the five to six paths while far back, and improved in the final furlong. SOCIAL MANDATE hopped into the outer
part of the gate at the start, raced off of the pace while hung in the five path around the turn, spun into the lane in the seven path, and failed to menace.
ONLY TIME stuttered a step while off multiple lengths slow, raced far back two wide and between horses, and failed to factor. LUCY JANE set the pace
inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. CHI TOWN HEAT tracked three wide, came into the lane in
the four path, but lacked a bid and weakened. CUPIDS PAYDAY chased along the inside, but faded turning for home. HALO OF FIRE lacked speed along
the inside, retreated to trail entering the turn, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
EQUIVOQUE stalked outside of the top pair, pressed them from the four path around the turn, bid turning for home and sparked a duel, battled with an inner
game MULLIKIN while hanging on his left lead, shifted inwardly when asked to engage his inner counterpart at the sixteenth pole, changed over to his right
lead in the process, and edged away. MULLIKIN set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals around the turn, gamely sparred with an outer bidding
EQUIVOQUE through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead while daunted by his outer competitor at the sixteenth pole, and was bested. LE BAR
pressed two wide, vied in the three path between the eventual top two around the turn, but yielded to them approaching midstretch while hanging on his left
lead, and held show thereafter. WICKED AGAIN tracked two wide and between horses, and ran on. BETTERA raced in midpack in the four path, shifted
inwardly in upper stretch, and failed to menace. JUST A PHOTO lacked speed and moved up. REGAL REY pursued at the rear of the main group in the
three path and between horses, then weakened. ACCIDENT never got involved. DUAL MONARCHY chased along the inside, and weakened. HOME RUN
HANK was fractious in the starting gate, and showed little.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE broke slowly, pursued from midpack in the five path around the turn, floated out to remain outside of the drifting clear leader at the
furlong grounds, sustained a rally to drive past that foe passing the sixteenth pole, and held from an outer bidder late. WILLTORUN rated at the rear in the
three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied while shifting ground outwardly in midstretch, then sustained a bid to range up to the new leader
in the closing stages, but just ran out of ground to reel that rival in. MAMBA ON THREE was fractious and broke through the back of the starting gate
pre-race, required a veterinarian exam before being cleared to go, tracked the top flight from the two path, tipped four wide turning for home, bid in upper
stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds before drifting outwardly at that juncture, then tired in the final furlong, was caught by an outer bidder a
sixteenth from home, gave way, yet saved show at the wire. SKY AND SAND broke a beat slow, settled far back two wide and between horses, came into
the lane three wide, shifted course outwardly while picking up stride and searching for room in midstretch, then sustained a rally to narrowly miss show at
the wire. DIAMOND CITY laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and chased evenly between horses. JEOPARDY
THEORY raced at the rear along the inside, split foes through traffic in the four path leaving the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on. TIGHTROPE set a
clear pace along the inside around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, and faltered in the final furlong. KANTHARI stalked four
to three wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, and gave way. AWESOME AARON broke slowly, laid off of the pace three wide, and
failed to factor. BAYTOWN BEAR broke a step slow, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. IBRIM was fractious in the starting gate and required
backing out for a veterinarian exam, raced forward two wide and between horses, tucked behind the clear leader entering the turn, but only managed to
chase through upper stretch before caving in hand at the furlong grounds. STONEVICIOUS chased three to two wide and between horses, but caved
entering the lane. THE RIDER OF WILLTORUN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE
OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
FORTIN HILL chased outside of the top pair while under steady urging around the turn, sustained stride to range up alongside those rivals in the final
furlong, and drove past them at the sixteenth pole. KNEEDEEPINSNOW set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist a bid turning for home, repelled that
rival while getting outkicked by an outer challenger at the sixteenth pole, and proved second best. CHASING TIME pressed the leader from the outside, bid
turning for home, sparred through upper stretch, but failed to sustain even terms before being repelled and outkicked at the sixteenth pole. THREE
TECHNIQUE laid off of the pace in the three path, spun into the lane in the four path, delayed his lead change to the furlong grounds while not progressing
on the top trio, and lacked a bid. MANNY WAH trailed along the inside, awaited racing room behind traffic turning for home, slipped through along the rail
entering the lane, but leveled off without reaching contention. DASH ATTACK laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted three wide entering the lane, and
failed to factor. SIR ALFRED JAMES chased along the inside, and faded. STEINBECK lacked speed four wide, and got outrun.

HERE MI SONG broke a step slow, laid off of the pace four wide, gained around the turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, sparred outside of
HOIST THE GOLD through the lane, and prevailed. HOIST THE GOLD shifted outside of foes down the backstretch to track five wide and outside of foes,
tucked three wide in range of the top pair entering the turn, bid for the lead along with an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, dueled gamely with that one
through the lane, but was bested. GET HER NUMBER took an awkward stride before bumping with an inner rival at the start, trailed in the aftermath,
advanced along the inside approaching the turn, remained under mild coaxing in the two to three paths around the turn, shifted out to the six path in upper
stretch, and stayed on willingly to reach show at the wire. NAKATOMI bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked three wide, tipped five wide in upper
stretch while hanging on his left lead, shifted in a touch while changing over at the three sixteenths pole, then chased the embattled leading pair in the final
furlong, gained show in the final sixteenth, but was nailed at the wire for that position. RUN CLASSIC vied two wide, cleared to the rail entering the turn, vied
with a trio of outer rivals turning for home, got headed entering the lane, and gave way through the final furlong. PRO OXIDANT vied three wide and
between horses, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, pursued from the two path turning for home, then chased along the rail while lacking a bid.
HEART RHYTHM raced close up along the inside, backed off to stalk down the backstretch, but faded turning for home. SPANKSTER failed to factor from
the two to three paths around the turn. LONG RANGE TODDY vied four wide, tucked two wide entering the turn, vied between horses turning for home, and
weakened in upper stretch. LEGIONNAIRE never got involved from the three to four paths.

Footnotes
PAPILIO (IRE) settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide and between horses into the far turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied
outside of foes while lugging in through midstretch, lugged further to bump and put PLEASANT PASSAGE into tight quarters at the sixteenth pole, required
strong right handed correction in the aftermath, sustained a bid, and forged an advantage at the wire. CAIRO CONSORT tracked from midpack in the two
path, slowly closed in on the leaders leaving midstretch, shifted outside of the top pair and shared blame in putting an outer PLEASANT PASSAGE to
crowded quarters at the sixteenths pole, sustained a bid along with an outer rival nearing the wire, but was narrowly outfinished. HEAVENLY SUNDAY set
the pace along the inside, felt strong outer pressure from a trio of bidders around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch, led into the
final sixteenth, but was bested by a pair of outer challengers late. WELL INTO pressed two wide, bid along with a pair of outer foes around the far turn, led
briefly entering the lane, battled with her inner game counterpart through midstretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes while yielding in the final
sixteenth. PLEASANT PASSAGE tracked two to three wide, ranged up between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the inner leading
pair entering the lane, chased them through midstretch, but was put to tight quarters by bidders on either side at the sixteenth pole, pinched and steadied in
the aftermath, and narrowly saved a minor placing. SABALENKA trailed two wide, then in the three to four paths around the far turn before swinging to the
six path entering the lane, and moved up. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) pursued from midpack three to four wide, gained outside of the leading trio around the
around the far turn, but shifted inwardly while failing to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened. ALPHA BELLA lacked speed two to three wide, and
failed to factor. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) saved ground far off of the pace, but tired.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE vied along the inside of a pair of foes early on, backed off to stalk after a furlong, loomed a danger outside of them entering the turn,
offered a bold bid to assume command in hand nearing the lane, drew off under confident handling in upper stretch, yet was roused entering the final furlong
as an outer MARYQUITECONTRARY made her presence known, and held sway safely to the wire. MARYQUITECONTRARY was urged in the four path in
pursuit of the top trio into the turn, yet sustained a rally while slowly narrowing the clear leader's margin through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to
reel that one in late. SOCIETY vied two wide and between horses, then only inside of YUUGIRI after passing the five furlong pole, sparred into the turn, but
offered little resistance to the eventual winner's rebid turning for home, and gave way. COCKTAIL MOMENTS laid off of the pace along the inside, and
made little impact. YUUGIRI vied three to two wide, proved no match for an outer bidder turning for home, and weakened.

Footnotes
CARAVEL vied two wide, then along the inside into the turn, met an outer challenge turning for home, gamely clung to a very slim margin from that one
through the lane, and was strong-willed to hold steadfast to the wire. BAD BEAT BRIAN prompted the pace three to two wide into the turn, bid turning for
home sparking a duel, battled gamely while at even terms through the final furlong, but was denied an advantage late. ARREST ME RED tracked from
midpack four wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied along with an inner OCEANIC, dueled for show with that foe while closing in on the top
pair late, and prevailed for that position while running out of ground to catch the leaders. OCEANIC pursued from midpack two wide and between horses,
shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied with an outer ARREST ME RED through the lane, vied for show through the final furlong, but missed. MARK
OF THE Z took back at the half mile pole, laid unhurried far back along the inside, rallied by splitting foes two wide in midstretch, and stayed on to gain a
minor share. BAKERS BAY broke slowly, raced far back two wide, shifted out to the six path in midstretch, and moved up outside of rivals. STITCHED
tracked three wide, spun into the lane in the four path, and lacked a bid. NOBLE EMOTION saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the four path in upper
stretch, but made little impact. MISTER MMMMM tracked two wide while under a snug hold behind the leaders into the turn, but lacked a bid in the three
path in upper stretch, and weakened between horses. ALL IN SYNC broke slowly, and never got involved two wide. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS was antsy in
the starting gate, laid close up along the inside, stalked entering the turn, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading. JOHNNY UNLEASHED
was outrun in the two path.

TAPIT TRICE was hustled out of the gates, shifted out to the four path while off of the pace around the first turn, gained five wide and outside of foes
entering the backstretch, to achieve stalking position by the five furlong pole, pressed outside of the top pair around the far turn, ranged up to a leading
VERIFYING while getting floated to the five path entering the lane, bid coming to midstretch, brushed with that one at the furlong grounds, then took a bump
while forging an advantage in the closing stages. VERIFYING stalked two wide, bid entering the far turn, led turning for home, shifted out to the four path
entering the lane to float an on-charging TAPIT TRICE wider, gamely resisted that foe's bid in upper stretch, brushed with him at the furlong grounds, then
subtly came out under left handed urging in the final sixteenth, and bumped his counterpart while being bested. BLAZING SEVENS laid off of the pace in
the four to five paths, tracked in hand outside of foes down the backstretch, inched closer four wide around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the
lane, but failed to keep pace with the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, yet held show from inner rivals through the final furlong. SUN THUNDER
settled far back along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring rival around the far turn, shfited out to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on
mildly between horses. RAISE CAIN brushed with an outer rival at the start, raced far back two wide, attempted a five wide gain outside of foes around the
far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH brushed with an inner rival at the start, pursued from
midpack three to four wide, then three wide and between horses into the far turn, and yielded. HAYES STRIKE took a bump from an inner rival at the start,
trailed, and improved along the rail. CLASSIC CAR WASH broke out and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but weakened around the far
turn. SCOOBIE QUANDO took a brush from an inner rival leaving the gates, pursued from midpack two wide, failed to sustain position before caught four
wide and between horses around the far turn, and made little impact. MAJOR BLUE tracked three to two wide, and weakened around the far turn. CLEAR
THE AIR cleared off early on, but was collared entering the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped. THE RIDER OF VERIFYING
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TAPIT TRICE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY
THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SQUIRE CREEK rushed to set the pace along the inside, led from a pair of outer pressers around the turn, inched clear entering the lane, and held sway
safely. BLUE LIGHT stalked three wide, bid turning for home, but was turned away by the leader in upper stretch, and narrowly saved place from an inner
rival late. DEER DISTRICT tracked along the inside, chased behind the leaders through the lane, bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was denied via a
head-bob. GILCREASE pressed two wide, then between horses around the turn, but yielded to those foes entering the lane, shifted out in upper stretch,
kept on in hopes of rebidding for minor rewards in the final sixteenth, but did not have enough. UNCLE HEADLEY chased four wide, drifted to the five path
entering the lane, but failed to menace. NOTAH lacked speed six wide, then five wide into the turn, and failed to factor. FROG TOWN broke a step slow,
trailed, and failed to factor. LIBERTANGO lacked speed five wide, tucked to the rail behind foes entering the turn, and weakened around the bend.

OPERATION TORCH tracked along the inside, loomed a danger while ranged up three wide around the far turn, bid entering the lane, and drew off. MY
BOY TONY stalked along the inside, was outmoved by the eventual winner around the far turn, yet stayed on through the final furlong to reach place at the
wire. DECANTED set the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the lane, yielded in the final furlong, and got nailed at the wire for place.
MONDEGO (GB) pursued from midpack along the inside, was urged along in the two path around the far turn, sustained stride through the lane, but lacked
a bid. LINCOLN HIGHWAY was void of speed in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on. HE'S GOT SWAGGER saved
ground off of the pace early on, but failed to sustain position before taking the far turn in the two to three paths, fanned to the seven path entering the lane,
and lacked a rally. WIMHOF pursued from midpack two wide, was driven around the far turn in the three path, and gave way. AUGUSTUS BLUE laid off of
the pace two wide, shfited to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. REGIMENTAL lacked speed along the inside, and never got involved.

at the furlong grounds. SCAT TU TAP stalked two wide, pressed into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. COLLIER'S TIME showed little.
