approaching the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. CLOUD MOVER rounded the opening turn in the three
path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, dug in through the stretch and just lasted in the duel for second. JUST
HAVE FAITH raced well back in the three path on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and just missed
in the stretch duel for second. LADY GANGSTER rated the pace inside, came under pressure and was met toward the five sixteenths pole, then faded at
the rail on the far turn. SUNSET QUEEN saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed
little in the lane. ODINA rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn. ISLE BE THERE

duel through the stretch. WITNESS THE ENERGY raced with the pace from the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the
turn then flattened late yards. ARLYNE'S CROWN contested at mostly even terms through the backstretch, took the nod nearing the quarter pole, contested
the edge two deep while between horses on the turn but flattened late yards. MANAGED MISCHIEF chased, rounded the turn about the three path, eased
out into the lane and finished evenly. SHUTUPN'KISSME broke through the gate and ran off for about a quarter mile, came away sharply and set a brief
early pace, but was met leaving the three eighths pole, continued close at the rail on the turn then weakened in the lane. SHENANDOAH CAT gave chase,

IRISH VALENTINE chased outside through the backstretch, raced close in the four path on the turn and dug in under steady handling to get up the final
strides. CALERA LOVE rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the quarter pole and rounded the turn at the rail, was steadily handled leaving
the turn but was caught in the final strides. ICY STARE exchanged contact with. RAINBOW RHYTHM leaving the gate and engaged in close chase through
the backstretch, remained a factor off the rail on the turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. The latter exchanged contact with Icy Stare leaving the gate,
gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. DEVIN ON EARTH gave close chase inside, raced in range
of the leaders at the rail on the turn but weakened leaving the eighth pole.

Footnotes
BONNIE BLUETOOTH came in and made contact with So Red The Rose leaving the gate, rounded the turn about the four path and picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled for the lead three wide leaving the far turn, drew clear toward mid-stretch and held well under steady handling.
FLOATING BY settled in the three and four paths on the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and dug in to
take second the final yards. ONEPRETTYTHING moved to the inside and rated the pace, dueled leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the turn but was met leaving the turn and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. STYLISH PAINT was bumped, jostled and bobbled shortly
after the break, raced off the rail on the first turn and gave chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths then flattened in the
lane. KIRBY stalked two deep, dueled at even terms from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close between horses on the far turn but flattened toward
mid-stretch. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
weakened in the lane. STORMI CAT LADY saved ground and could only improve her position. LIGHTFOOT MISS saved ground well off the pace on the
first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SEEDS OF TIME was bumped early and raced well off the pace on the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. MISS WILD ducked sharply outward leaving the gate, was never a factor and her rider lost an iron somewhere in the
stretch.
