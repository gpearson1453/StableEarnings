Footnotes
RUN AUNTIE T RUN broke in and bumped rival at the start, pressed leader along the rail on the backstretch, ceded to quicker rival on the turn, eased out
around rival on the turn, and launched bid three wide, dueled with fellow rallying rival and proved best late under a drive. AM YISRAEL CHAI stalked pace
two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid along the inside on the turn and dueled with rival final sixteenth to come up
second best. COUSIN NIECEY stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and launched a mild rally along the
rail. WETHERLY bit slow and bumped by outside rival at the start, settled off the pace and well off the rail on the backstretch, continued on the scenic route
on the turn and into the lane in the five path, kept on willingly to pass some rivals. LIBERTY LIBERTY stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued
off the rail on the turn and lacked needed punch in the lane to make an impact. SHEILA'S CHARLIE away well, led two wide on the backstretch, manage to
clear rival on the turn, opened up into the stretch, quickly began to shorten stride approaching the sixteenth pole and stopped to a crawl. MIGHTY
BOISTEROUS settled off the and on the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, attempted to rally in the four path, but lacked needed
kick to improve. MY BELLA CHICK bumped by outside rival and steadied at the start, dropped well back after the trouble start, stayed off the rail on the turn,
went widest in the stretch and did make up ground but never threatened.

Footnotes
CLOUD BURST away best, kept under a hand drive throughout in a sharp effort, and kept advantage into the turn. BRINDISI broke a touch slow, weaved in
and out early, asked steadily, responded to get up for second and finished up evenly on gallop out. MAKIN CHICKS MOVE away well, asked right handed
early, asked again right handed and she drifted in two paths and losing second in a solid debut, galloped out evenly. GAMBLING LADY scrambled and
came in to bump rival at the start, asked right handed drifting in, asked left handed to be corrected, responded well to finish willingly and continued out on
the gallop out. MOONING UP took a couple awkward steps out of the gate and bumped with outside rival, kept under a hand shove while making mild
progress, and galloped out with some energy. MOCHA CORONA hesitated, and came away slow, lugged in soon thereafter, kept leaning rest of the way
while being wrapped up.

Footnotes
THINK AGAIN KEV came in three paths at the start, responded well to right handed urging, striding out well and galloping out even better. TOOELE broke in
a path, was under steady right handed urging in a solid effort, galloped out willingly. JUST A FOOLER hit gate at the start, asked right handed early, shied
from drifting out rival, and finished up willingly and galloping out well. MAX STORM away cleanly, asked right handed, drifted out a path while shying away
from rivals late, and galloped out ok. WARRIOR SOUL came out four paths at the start, leaned out a bit midway and not asked to the wire. BRUNO CZECH
brushed by inside rival at the start, under strong right handed urging and failed to make up ground on this talented bunch.
