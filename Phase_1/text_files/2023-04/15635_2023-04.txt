Footnotes
MISSING PENNY broke alertly and established the early advantage, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the way
to the quarter marker, was set down in upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong grounds and drew clear in the final sixteenth. BIG JOLT raced four wide
into the first turn, took back off of the moderate pace, slipped to the two path nearing the top of the lane, advanced at mid-stretch, was outkicked by the
winner in the final stages and just held for second at the finish. BEA MISCHIEF was off a step slowly at the start, settled off of the moderate pace, went
three wide into the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied nearing the furlong pole, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and
just missed for second, while clear in the end for third. PEACEHAVEN stalked the pace along the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run and
into the far turn, raced three wide into the stretch, came in tight and steadied slightly at mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. DARK INTENT
raced close to the early pace, was a bit keen along the first turn and into the backstretch run, prompted the moderate pace to the second turn, lost position
in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. BOSSY PEGASUS stalked the early pace while three deep on the first turn, maintained position through the
backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and tired in the late going.

TOM'S STYLE was allowed to settle in the early running, raced two wide into the turn, was roused nearing the top of the lane and mounted a five wide bid
into the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, overtook PRETTY THIRSTY in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides. PRETTY
THIRSTY was hustled at the break and dictated terms to the turn, set decent fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, shook free and drew to a clear
lead at mid-stretch, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch and just held for second at the finish. MATCHLESS
stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, lost position nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied in deep stretch but
could not muster the needed late response and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. MARY WALKER chased from the inside, ran evenly to
the furlong pole and lacked a late rally. CONQUEST ROCKS was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, lost
ground to PRETTY THIRSTY at mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

SMART KITTEN broke alertly and established the early lead, set moderate fractions into the backstretch run then was well rated to the far turn, came under
pressure at the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker
and was hand urged to the finish. LOOKIN AT SWEETIE was unhurried in the early going, raced three wide into the far turn then slipped inside approaching
the top of the lane, was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch but closed with good late interest and was up for second. GET MY POINT was floated
out a bit entering the first turn, tracked the modest fractions through the backstretch run, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep
pace with SMART KITTEN in the stretch run and just missed for second at the finish, while clear of the rest for third. RAUCOUS TIZZY was floated out a bit
along the first turn, recovered to attend to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, confronted SMART KITTEN at the quarter marker, was turned
away in that effort in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. ADJUST THE HEAT was prominent into the first turn, was a bit keen and floated out
rivals in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost position while two wide on the second turn, raced four wide into the

WORTHY OF MAGIC broke alertly and assumed command heading to the first turn, set modest fractions while well handled through the backstretch run,
drew to a clear lead approaching the far turn, was asked for more heading into the lane, held foes at bay to mid-stretch and kept to task under a drive to
prevail. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) took back off of the moderate early pace, maintained position while outside of rivals on the backstretch run, gained ground
three wide on the far turn, was not able to make headway on WORTHY OF MAGIC in the stretch and held clearly at the end for second. SHEZARUNAWAY
was unhurried in the early running, gained ground on the far turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not muster the
needed late response and held safely for third. KOKO'S MOM stalked the moderate pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired in the drive. SEEMS LOGICAL was forwardly placed into the first turn, contested the moderate early pace then ceded the lead to WORTHY
OF MAGIC heading into the backstretch run, tracked that rival through modest fractions to the far turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and gave
way in the stretch.

Footnotes
ZAFFERANA was allowed to settle in the early stages, loomed along the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, advanced at mid-stretch, encountered a
stubborn rival in BIG STRIKE in the final stages, made a determined late surge under firm handling and prevailed in the final strides. BIG STRIKE showed
good early speed and set a quick pace heading to the turn, dueled with DAREDEVIL PRINCESS to the quarter marker, shook free of that rival in upper
stretch and drew to a clear lead approaching the furlong grounds, held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, battled stubbornly against the winner in deep
stretch but was caught by ZAFFERANA and held safely for second. CRY ME A RUNNER chased the decent early pace, raced three wide into the stretch,
gained ground nearing the furlong pole, was not able to keep pace with the top two in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for third. DAREDEVIL
PRINCESS was prominent in the early running, pressed the decent pace to the turn, dueled with BIG STRIKE to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. TIGERIZE took back off of the decent early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, did not threaten in the
stretch run and passed a tired rival in the final stages. ABBEY OOPS rushed up in the opening stages and chased the decent pace to the turn, saved
ground on the turn while in pursuit and tired in the stretch drive. ROUSING STAR hopped at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed and trailed into
the turn, raced three wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
TEX HANLEY allowed to settle while never far back, was roused three wide nearing the top of the lane, was full of run at mid-stretch, was kept to steady
urging to deep stretch, took command inside of the sixteenth-marker and kicked clear in the final stages. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) was prominent into the
first turn, tracked the early pace then advanced to press the pace into the second turn, battled with STORMIN GALILEO in upper stretch and took a narrow
lead at the furlong marker, could not match strides with TEX HANLEY in the late stages and held well in deep stretch to secure second. STORMIN
GALILEO broke alertly, showed early speed and set the pace into the backstretch run, set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, battled with THANKS
MAGGIO to the furlong marker, could not keep pace with TEX HANLEY in the final furlong, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while
holding at the end for third. ZIPPY BABY settled just off of the early pace, improved position along the backstretch run, was well placed while saving ground
nearing the quarter marker, lost ground approaching the top of the stretch, re-rallied in the drive but could not muster the needed late response and missed
for the minor awards. RULER OF ANGELS settled off of the moderate early pace, chased between runners through the backstretch run, came two wide
between rivals into the far turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker while still within aim and gave way in the late stages. HICKORY WIND stalked the moderate
early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the second turn, lost ground three deep at the quarter
marker, swung four wide into the stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
IDAHO ONCE broke alertly and sped to the early lead, was engaged by RACHEL'S COACH in the first furlong and dueled through fast fractions with that
rival to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, drove to a clear lead at the furlong pole, kept to task in deep stretch while on the left lead and
remained clear to the wire. RODRIGOKNOWS was forwardly placed in the early stages then took back to track the fast pace, tracked two wide to the
quarter marker, mounted a three wide rally into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in the final stages and ran
on to secure second. CHUCKANUT BAY was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide to the quarter marker, improved position at mid-stretch, found his
best stride late, closed well in deep stretch and just missed for second, while securing third in the final strides. RACHEL'S COACH was sent in the first
furlong and contested the fast early pace, dueled with IDAHO ONCE to the quarter pole, could not match strides with that foe nearing the furlong marker,
weakened in the final stages while on the left lead and was outfinished for the minor awards. TALK ABOUT AUTISM chased the fast early pace, lost ground
while outside of rivals on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, offered a mild bid in the final furlong but could not muster the needed response. SAXON
SAGA was shuffled back at the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the second flight, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten.

Footnotes
BLACK ZABAT broke sharply and went straight to the lead, held sway through the turn while always traveling well, responded when asked at the
three-sixteenths maker and drew away to an impressive score. A ROUSING BABE got away well but raced near the back of the pack and four wide to the
turn, made a sweeping bid through the turn while still wide, sustained the run though the stretch and was best of the rest. SONOMA DREAMING broke in
and made light contact with BLACKENED, was a little hard to place in the run down the backstretch, made a strong bid from the nine-sixteenths pole racing
in the three path, entered the stretch in second position while racing on the left lead, had some trouble getting straight down the lane and was passed late
for the place. DANZIGS STAR STORM reserved near the pack of the pack early, moved up into contention racing in the two path on the turn, tipped out for
room at the top of the stretch and ran on well enough to pass a few in the late stages. BLACKENED broke in, bumped with YODERANDO at the break,
worked over to the rail and tracked the pacesetter to the turn, got a good inside trip into the stretch, steadied approaching the three furlong marker, was
unable to find another gear when needed and finished one-paced to the wire while holding position. BOB'S VAI broke well and settled into a stalking position
just behind and to the outside of BLACK ZABAT to the turn, remained a looming threat to the top of the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. OTTER
POP broke well but was outrun for the lead, settled mid-pack early, struggled to keep up through the turn and was never a threat. YODERANDO veered out
at the start making contact with BLACKENED, then steadied after the break when that same rival too the path, lost momentum then gathered up, kept to the
outside and regained some momentum going into the turn, remained wide through the turn and swung six wide into the stretch but was unable to improve
position.
