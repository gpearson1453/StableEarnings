Footnotes
INVALUABLE pressed four wide, moved forward to vie three wide and between horses around the turn, battled entering the lane, and kicked clear leaving
the furlong grounds. PRINCESSTAPITURE stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the leader to bid at the three furlong pole, vied inside of a trio of outer
rivals turning for home, shifted outwardly entering the lane, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong pole, and fended off another foe for
place. ALARM CLOCK took a light brush from an outer rival early on, tracked four wide, ranged up to vie outside of a trio of foes at the three furlong pole,
sparred turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in midstretch, then was denied place by an inner rival. PRETTY RACHEL set the
pace in the two path down the backstretch, dueled between a trio of bidders around the turn, then yielded once put to tight quarters by her inner counterpart
entering the lane. LA CUMPARSITA bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, then mildly chased along the rail through
the lane. LA TOURISTA lightly brushed an inner rival in the opening stages and was slow in the aftermath, settled off of the pace four wide, and failed to
menace. TALK RADIO laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, and failed to factor. RUNAWAY MOM trailed in the two path into the turn, fanned
to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor while hanging on her left lead. LIBERTY BELLE pressed three wide and between horses down the
backstretch, but weakened entering the turn. SONADOR bumped with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the three path, and was done early.

Footnotes
MANGIONE tracked in the four path, sustained a grinding rally to bid for the lead along with an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, and edged an advantage
nearing the wire. SONOFASHIP tracked in the three path and between horses, offered a gradual charge along with an outer rival to bid for the lead with that
foe at the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished. LET'S GO MARK dueled for the lead two wide, cleared his inner counterpart in upper stretch, drifted in subtly
entering the final furlong as a pair of outer rivals gave chase, but got outkicked by those bidders while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole.
LOU'S LEGACY broke a step slow, raced far back three wide and between horses, spun into the lane in the five path, and offered a belated rally in the final
furlong. SADDLE UP chased the leaders under strong urging in the two path around the turn, then failed to menace in the three path through the lane while
hanging on his left lead. ORE MINE laid off of the pace in the three path, and lacked a bid. THE RUSH IS ON failed to respond to strong urging through the
chute, lacked speed two wide and between horses around the turn, and surpassed tired rivals late. HOB ALWATAN dueled for the lead inside of a rival,
proved no match for that one in upper stretch, and stopped through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead. GREEN CHILE laid off of the pace in the
two path, and faded. BAYTOWN PARFAIT was coaxed along while chasing from midpack along the inside, but steadied hard while slipping inside of
weakening rival through a tight rail seam at the sixteenth pole. TECHNE was outrun along the inside. BOY POR UNO broke slowly, trailed four wide, and
showed little.

Footnotes
INDY AGAIN tracked in the four path, gained around the far turn to take aim on the clear leader entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge to bid at the
sixteenth pole, led soon after, and held from an outer bidder to the wire. POWDER MY NOSE settled far back two wide, gained while fanning from the four
path to the six path entering the lane, sustained a rally outside of rivals while hanging on his left lead in the final furlong as the leaders tired, lugged in
slightly in the final sixteenth requiring rider's correction, and narrowly ran out of ground to reel in the leader at the wire. GOODBETTERBEST prompted
along the inside into the first turn, allowed an outer rival to clear in order to stalk outside of that foe entering the backstretch, took charge from that one
around the far turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD
broke a step slow, got hung in the five path while off of the pace around the first turn, tucked to save ground while tracking around the far turn, offered a rail
grind to attempt a bid in the final furlong, but leveled off late. RUDIMENTARY DRINK broke a step slow, raced off of the pace along the inside, fanned from
the three path to the five path entering the lane, slowly closed in while getting outkicked by the eventual runner up in midstretch, and missed reaching show
while under light handling behind rivals in the closing stages. SHEAR raced forwardly in the three to two paths, and chased evenly through the lane.
CATHERINE BLAZE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TOFFEE settled off of the pace two wide, improved between horses down the
backstrech, but weakened turning for home. AMENSET prompted the pace in the five path entering the first turn, moved forward to clear and tuck to the two
path around that bend, but proved no match for an outer bidder with five sixteenths to go, and weakened turning for home. AZAMANA EMPIRE failed to
sustain position between horses entering the first turn, and made little impact from the four path. HURRY UP CHIC CHIC was fractious in the starting gate
before breaking awkwardly, lagged behind, and made little impact. CHICAGO TYPHOON tracked along the inside, and wilted around the far turn.

Footnotes
BOURBON CREED rated at the rear of the short field two wide, shifted four wide at the three sixteenths pole to take aim, but wandered about slightly while
grinding away at the leader's margin through the final furlong, bid coming to the wire, and narrowly prevailed. PAGE ONE stalked three wide, engaged the
leader from the three path entering the turn, vied around the bend, forged an advantage turning for home, drove clear in midstretch while hanging on his left
lead, changed over entering the final sixteenth as an outer rival menaced, and got nailed at the wire. JUDGE DAVIS tracked in the four path around the turn,
inched closer to striking range nearing the lane, but yielded after being floated to the five path in upper stretch, yet kept on to gain show late. PATIENT
CAPITAL set the pace two wide, dueled for the lead inside of a bidder while remaining a path off of the rail around the turn, got headed by that one at the
five sixteenths pole, and weakened nearing midstretch. AMANI'S EAGLE stalked while close up along the inside, but gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
TIM TAL set the pace while well in hand, met meager challenges from a pair of outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole, shrugged off those rivals entering the
lane, and drew off under driving pressure. LUPO'S LEGACY leaned out and brushed the gate the start, tracked four wide, gained around the turn to attempt
a bid while gaining place at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled entering the lane, proved no match, yet held place well through the final furlong. RUN
FOR REAGAN broke through the gate pre-race, then tracked along the inside, but lacked a bid. POWER ALLEY bucked when pressured to move into the
starting gate, saved ground well off of the pace, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. REAL NAUGHTY reared in the starting gate when
an outer competitor broke through it, then broke inwardly while off slow, climbed with high-head carriage while lagging behind the field down the backstretch,
trailed in the two to three paths, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and improved. GOIN TO THE SHOW stalked three wide, inched closer along
with an outer rival turning for home, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, but took a bad step and went wrong in the final sixteenth, and crossed
the wire before being vanned off. LEVEL UP stalked two wide and between horses, but was outmoved by an outer pair at the three furlong pole, and
weakened. MO TIME AT ALL tracked in the three path, but tired.

Footnotes
QUALITY STAR broke a step slow and was allowed to settle at the rear along the inside, patiently bided time around the far turn, smoothly swung seven
wide entering the lane, offered a good turn of foot to bid outside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. QUEEN JUDITH saved ground in
midpack, awaited racing room around the far turn, committed to a rail charge while finding clear sailing in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds,
but was outkicked by an outer bidder leaving that station, and was second best. EIDIKOS (GB) tracked along the inside, stalked while pocketed around the
far turn, rallied two wide and between horses in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by a rival on either side. SWEET LADY
IVANKA opened up entering the first turn through quick splits, came back to the field around the far turn, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch while
clinging to an advantage, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides at the furlong grounds, and gave way. DIAMOND HANDS stalked two wide, shifted to
the four path in upper stretch to bid, vied between horses nearing midstretch, but yielded in the final furlong. SAKE (FR) laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder approaching midstretch, and lacked a bid. COLONEL
ABY B rated at the rear two wide, and moved up. IMPLOSION tracked two to three wide and between horse, but was crowded among rivals four wide
entering the lane, and gave way. TEXAS SHUFFLE laid off of the pace three wide, launched a five wide rally entering the far turn, but brushed with an inner
rival entering the lane, and got outkicked in upper stretch while flattening out. HASHTAG WINNER laid off of the pace four wide, tipped five wide turning for
home, and faded. PRECURSORY tracked three, then four wide and between horses around the far turn, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
CURL GIRL prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead entering the far turn as an outer rival ranged up alongside, led from that foe while taking that bend
in the two wide, and drew off entering the lane. DESTINE TO RACE stalked three wide, bid entering the far turn along with an inner rival, pressed that foe
from the three path turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and proved second best. K'ANTHEIA saved ground while tracking the
leaders, and ran on to hold show. I HAD THAT ONE TOO tracked from midpack two wide, was urged while chasing in the four path around the far turn, then
was fended off for show through the final furlong. FEARLESS KRISTIE got bumped by an outer rival leaving the gates, settled far back three wide, took the
far turn in the four path, and moved up. QUEEN OF THE RODEO broke a step slow, and failed to factor from the three path. LEXA broke slowly, raced far
back two wide and between horses, improved four wide entering the far turn, but tired thereafter. PALETA bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the
pace along hte inside, and failed to factor. CALL ME TONI broke slowly before being forced inwardly at the start, trailed in the two path, and made little
impact. PRINCESS CAIRO set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders leaving the three furlong pole, and weakened around
the far turn. SOULTITLESREADY lacked speed in the three to two paths around the first turn, and tired. TIME TO RACE got keen while far back along the
inside entering the first turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
STRONG QUALITY showed the way loose and uncontested, and held firm from an outer chaser through the lane. POINT ME BY stalked two wide, took aim
on the clear leader in upper stretch, but was fended off through the final furlong to prove second best. COWBOY JUSTICE (GB) tracked from midpack along
the inside, sparred for show with an outer rival while chasing through the lane, and prevailed. VERBAL tracked along the inside, attempted to inch closer
three wide and between horses around the far turn, but lacked a bid before failing to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch, dueled for show with an
inner rival through the final furlong, but was denied. CREED broke a beat slow while brushing with an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the
inside, fanned five wide entering the lane, and only offered a mild kick due to the pace holding together. HIDDEN STASH tracked two wide, got floated four
wide into the far turn, and gave way. FEBRUARY SON lacked speed in the three path, and improved. SCRIPT laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, got floated six wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. RED HORNET brushed an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, but
lost position to rivals on either side with five furlongs to go, saved ground far back around the far turn, floated seven wide in upper stretch, and made little
impact. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) lacked speed three wide, fanned eight wide entering the lane, and had no rally. AMERICAN HERO showed little.

Footnotes
CABALLO FELIZ set a clear pace, opened up down the backstretch, and lasted safely from a pair of chasers. TUSKEGEE CAT stumbled at the start settled
off of the pace along the inside, was urged for gain in the four to five paths around the far turn, stayed on to bid for place in midstretch, and gained that
position at the wire. CLASSIC MARK laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, gained in the four path around the far turn to claim place nearing the
lane, dueled for that position with an outer bidder through the final furlong, but was bested late. LORD DONEGAL chased two wide, and gave way. NORDIC
LIGHT pursued from midpack in the three path, saved ground around the far turn, and lacked a rail bid. MR. BOUMA stalked in the three path, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch. SAN MARCO CITY laid off of the pace three wide, and improved around the far turn. WRITEITONTHEICE
stumbled at the start, trailed in the four path, and made little impact. WORKINFROMHOME pursued from midpack two wide, and weakened. BEOCCA
lacked speed in the four path, but was done early, and eased through the lane. RIVER BOY tracked along the inside, but weakened around the far turn
before being eased.
