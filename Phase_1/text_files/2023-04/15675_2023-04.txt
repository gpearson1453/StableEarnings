NICHOLAS JAMES prompted the pace along the rail into the turn, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace and drew off under mild right
handed urging. CHROMED IMPULSE away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide for nearly a half then couldn't handle the winner while clear for second.
GRAND DEAL unhurried early, passed tiring rivals outside through the stretch. GIANNIS stalked the pace four then three wide and lacked the needed
response. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN with the second flight, weakened inside. UNCLEJACKOMO broke slowly and trailed.

on again along the inside. SOUND OFF failed to menace. HUNTER SCOTT moved up three wide before a half then came up empty. NIGHT TIME RULER

Footnotes
MAMBO KITTEN well placed, responded with a rapid move two wide on the far turn to make the lead near the five sixteenths marker, quickly opened a
daylight lead set the balance of the pace and won under brisk handling. SAKONNA unhurried early, split horses two wide past the quarter pole, drifted out
through the stretch and finished well clear for second in the seven path. DATTTSAFANCYFOX unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the five path path.
ALSANAH passed tiring rivals inside. PACIFIC GROVE was no threat. QIA was no factor. IRON BERTIE rushed up the rail to lead briefly into the clubhouse
turn, prompted the early pace, chased the leader into the far turn then gave way. FREE LOVE sped to the lead two wide on the first turn, opened a clear
advantage before a half, set the pace into the far turn then was used up. AYY LADIES was never involved.
