Footnotes
PICAFLOR was encouraged forward from the start, pressed the pace inside, lost ground into the turn, regained position to bid along the rail at the top of the
stretch, forged clear inside the final furlong under steady handling. MISS CARMEN CIBO got away alertly, set the pace racing off the rail with pressure from
inside rival, edged clear by the three-eighths racing two to three wide, was no match for the winner but held the place. NITRO NINA broke a bit awkwardly
and a length or so slowly, switched outside the leaders stalking that pair four wide into the turn, went three to four deep on that bend, kept on evenly in the
lane and needed more. MS. MORENA switched off the inside, was five deep past the half, drifted out six wide by the end of the turn under urging, ran on
willingly without being persevered with late. PAYNT THE MOON was outpaced and not a factor.

Footnotes
SHELL SHOCKER moved forward inside to force the pace with outside pressure, edged clear in upper stretch, drifted out through the lane while clear and
under steady handling. MESSAGE DISCIPLINE broke outwardly, had the early lead but was soon overtaken by the aforementioned, pressed outside that
one, was carried out into upper stretch, angled in and kept on to hold second. PORTSMOUTH was forced out at the break, angled in past the half, saved
ground on the turn, captured show honors over INSIDE JOB, who was also forced out at the start, chased the leaders going three wide on the turn, needed
more in the stretch. ELDON'S SAMURAI was forced out at the start, moved in to race near the inside on the turn, came out a bit for the drive, was unable to
threaten. GOSPEL DANDY raced three to four wide outside at the back, failed to menace.

AWESOME OUTLAW got away alertly and set the pace racing just off the rail, moved to the rail heading into the turn while challenged and headed by an
outside foe, continued to press inside that one just off the lead, fought on in the stretch and was resurgent about seventy yards from home to inch away.
DASTADLY DAN broke a half-step slowly, raced up on a rival's heels early and tapped on the brakes, switched out and made a rapid advance between foes
to take the lead past the seven-sixteenths, contended two wide through the turn, led till late stretch but was outfinished. LATENT SHADOW chased three
wide into the turn, asked for more at the quarter pole, came out four deep into upper stretch, ran on evenly. OKIE CHROME saved ground racing inside,
went evenly and made no bid. PEPPERMINT CANDY chased from outside four to five wide, weakened.

TIN BADGE set the pace facing pressure from inside rival, kicked clear and held safe. HERZEN pursued from outside going four then five wide through the
turn, was no match for the winner but secured the place over MONET'S DEVIL, who stalked in behind the leaders, went three then four wide on the turn, ran
on. MAGIC CARPET settled at the rear shifting in, saved ground on the turn coming into the stretch two wide and passing tired rivals. GUNNER PAUL was
urged strongly from the break, moved up inside to press the pace, came up empty. GINSBURNED was held up in behind runners two to three wide from the
three-eighths to the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide by the end of that bend, railed to rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
SCARLET POSITION switched outside the leaders, went three wide into the turn, floated five wide into upper stretch taking the lead, forged clear under
stout urging. LIGHTNING HART set the pace saving ground inside into the turn, drifted to the three path leaving that bend, was overtaken and no match for
the winner but second best. HEATIN UP chased from outside then between runners two to three wide on the turn, lost ground and floated four wide into the
stretch, lacked the needed late kick. NOSTALGIA broke just a half-step slowly, pursued the leading trio from the rail into the turn, came out for the drive,
failed to rally.

Footnotes
NOMOREMRNICEGUY was caught four to five wide on the first turn racing outside the second flight, eased back and shifted in up the backstretch tracking
in behind three wide, moved out gradually on the far turn commencing a rally to be six wide at the top of the stretch, bid past the furlong marker and inched
past to prevail under steady handling. POKER PLAY settled inside the second flight on or just off the rail, moved out for the run up the backstretch and
advanced four wide between runners into the far turn, was clear at the three-eighths, challenged in the lane and outfinished. CHOCOLATEICECREAM was
caught three to four wide between runners in the second flight early, tipped out and advanced widest of all on the leaders going six deep into the far turn,
continued five to six wide on that bend, made a brief bid at the three-sixteenths, could not overtake the leader but kept on willingly to be best of the rest.
MAYFAIR HEIGHTS attended the pace from outside three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. LIMBO'S PROMISE raced between runners two to
three wide through the first turn, moved five wide into the second turn to take closer order, could not sustain the effort and flattened out. MORHAWK lacked
early speed racing inside, urged along outside the half, swung six wide for the drive and passed tired foes. JOHN ALLEN contended from between runners,
came up empty. LEGIONARY vied inside for the lead, came up empty. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL broke in the air and about five or six lengths slowly, was
outpaced and not persevered with in the stretch, walked off.

WRANGLERED got away alertly, set the pace shifting in to the two path, was pressured through the turn into upper stretch, edged clear under steady
handling. OUR CORNERSTONE pressed the winner from outside three wide, was second best. CATALE STORM stalked from just off the leaders going
four wide through the turn, held show honors. J B'S LEGACY broke a half-step slowly, chased from inside, kept on but missed show honors. YOU SEXY
BOY came out to pursue the leaders from off the inside going two to three wide on the turn, came out five to six deep for the drive, was not near enough to
threaten. TRUE GLORY bumped a rival at the start, was in a bit tight in the early going, went five wide on the turn in range, tired. RONALD DALE was
bumped at the break, encouraged along three to four wide through the turn but failed to rally.

Footnotes
NEEDABETTERJOCK moved forward to set the pace inside, was challenged at the top of the stretch, headed in upper stretch, dug in to come back and
prevail. ROCKPORT KAT tucked in early racing off the pace in behind rivals near but off the rail, advanced up the backstretch, was on hold late on the far
turn seeking room, found it turning for home, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, dueled thereafter and was outfinished. JACKS SPRING BREAK was
caught five wide in the early going, shifted in racing off the pace to enter the far turn three wide, gradually moved out six wide leaving that bend, was best of
the rest. TOAH was forwardly-placed outside three to four wide just off the leader, moved out a bit up the backstretch, was ridden along four to five wide on
the far turn, kept on evenly. KWIK shifted in early, raced about three wide throughout and ran on but needed more. WIN FOR FUN pressed the eventual
winner two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY shifted in racing at the rear on or just off the rail, failed to rally. TARUCA
chased from the four path through the first turn, dropped back four to five wide on the far turn, tired.
