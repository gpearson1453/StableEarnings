closing run. BIG BEND BUCKAROO followed the pace three to four wide and failed to rally. PRINCE B failed to mount a bid four wide. HUSKER LEGACY

AMERICAN REALITY stalked the pace three or four wide to bid through the far turn then wore down D'WILD MUFFIN in the line to be along in time. D'WILD
MUFFIN tracked the early leader three or four wide to bid into the far turn then could not contain the winner through the closing yards. CALL THE SHOTS
gained position out from the rail going to the first turn to set the early pace and came up empty nearing the lane. NEW YEARS LOVE saved ground and
failed to threaten. BOLD LEGEND weakened two wide. DIVA'S DIVA was always back.

UNUNDERSTANDABLE moved clear racing well off the rail about the three or four path, continued on a clear lead while coming out to the six path into the
stretch and held safe late by a shrinking margin. DOLLY DIMPLE moved three wide to contend through the far turn and slowly closed late but could not run
down the winner. CYCLONE SORORITY settled back three wide off the early pace, angled inside rivals turning for home and made a mild late bid. SABER
QUEEN chased the winner's pace three wide, angled in going to the far turn but lacked the needed late rally. BREW CASA failed to threaten four wide.
PALM COURT saved ground and weakened.

Footnotes
QUEENS HOLIDAY gained a clear lead through the opening quarter about the two path, kicked away going to the far turn then held well clear under a hand
ride. I CINC EYE LUV U chased the winner outside and saved the place late. TALLANDLONG stalked the top pair three wide, angled in on the far turn and
went evenly in the lane. SWEETNESS TO followed the pace saving ground and could not close the gap in the lane. GIVE EM SHADE was not a threat.
QUALITY BOW failed to mount a bid. SERENGETI SIX lost contact with the field before a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LOVETHATCAUSE tracked the pace three wide to bid into the far turn, lost ground turning for home then came again to surge and be up at the wire.
HULEN made the pace on a short clear lead off the rail, was challenged into the far turn, edged clear into the lane then could not hold the winner safe in the
closing yards. DRINK stalked the pace three wide and lacked a final closing run. SCOOTER'S BOY was forced to taken up and go wide to avoid a fallen
rider and loose horse then never threatened. GOOSE DRANK WINE weakened four wide. CRIMSON ZIP came out and appeared to clip the heels of a rival
and stumble into the first turn and unseated his rider, then went riderless around the track and walked off under his own power.

CYBER SNEAKER settled back off the pace four wide, launched his rally five and six wide through the far turn into the lane and closed with a rush to be
going clear late. S C ANGEL dueled on the pace inside a rival to the far turn, was challenged through that bend then could not withstand the winner's late
run. HARLONS COMMISION stalked the pace four wide to bid into the far turn then was outfinished for position in the lane. AUNT IRENE saved ground and
moved up through the lane while not a threat. MILLI STARR was along the inside and lacked a final closing run. GIGGLES AND SMOKE dueled on the
early lead three wide and weakened. MIZZANNA failed to mount a rally. DAKAMO ROSE weakened three to four wide. JOY FOREVER was not a factor.
