Footnotes
THE SANDY SURPRISE was allowed to settle leaving the start, advanced while saving ground on the turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, loomed at the
furlong marker, overtook GRIFFITH PARK nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the final stages. GRIFFITH PARK was forwardly placed in the
early running, stalked FINE SOFT MORNING to the turn then pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, battled with FINE SOFT MORNING to
mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, was not able to match strides with THE SANDY SURPRISE in deep stretch and held safely in the
end for second. NOMI LACKEE tracked the decent early pace, raced two wide along the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, finished evenly in the drive
and ran on to secure third. WOLF'S LIFE lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the stretch, offered a mild late rally and was outfinished for third.
FINE SOFT MORNING was sent leaving the break and established the early pace, set decent fractions into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker,
battled to mid-stretch while holding the lead, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in deep stretch and faded late. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased
the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace in the final
furlong and tired.

Footnotes
MESA EMPIRE was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace into the backstretch run, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, kept
attendance to POLLO D'ORO to the quarter pole, was roused at the top of the lane, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command heading to deep
stretch and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. CHRIS FIX was allowed to settle in the early running, gained ground along the backstretch run,
raced two wide into the second turn, was roused three wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the
winner in deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. POLLO D'ORO was sent to the early lead then rated nicely while setting all of the pace to the
second turn, came under pressure at mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for second, while well clear of the others for third. BIG
STICK broke alertly, took back off of the early pace and tracked the moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, raced three wide to the quarter pole, swung
four wide into the drive and did not offer a late rally. TAKE THE TWO TEN was bothered at the start by POLLO D'ORO and was away a step slowly, was
unhurried in the early running, raced three wide into the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) settled off of the early pace while saving all of the ground, was well positioned through the backstretch run, made a mild gain
on the second turn, was roused heading into the top of the stretch and angled three wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in the late
stages, confronted CARDIFF CRACK nearing the sixteenth-marker, surged in the final strides and dead heated with CARDIFF CRACK for the win.
CARDIFF CRACK was prominent in the early running, prompted the modest fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to DAZZLE THE
COMMAND to the quarter marker, drew to even terms with that foe in upper stretch and battled for the lead to the furlong pole, shook free then was
confronted by NATIONAL GENERAUX nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that bid while fully extended in the final stages and held on to share for the win.
DAZZLE THE COMMAND assumed command in the early running, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, quickened the pace
heading into the second turn, could not hold off the top two inside of the furlong marker, weakened in the final stages and just held for third. KOKO'S MOM
was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate fractions while three wide outside of rivals, maintained position to the second turn, swung
three wide into the stretch drive, lost ground at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and just missed for third.
TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE was allowed to settle early on while not far back, saved all of the ground to the second turn and lacked a late rally.

INCREDIBLE SHOT was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate pace into the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker,
swung four wide for the stretch drive, confronted EDDIE CROSSWIRE at the furlong marker, dueled with that game rival to deep stretch and determinedly
prevailed in the final strides. EDDIE CROSSWIRE rated off of the moderate early pace and tracked the leaders to the turn, gained ground from the rail
nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, took a narrow lead at mid-stretch, met the bid of INCREDIBLE SHOT inside of the furlong marker,
dueled with that rival to deep stretch and was gamely bested, while clear of the rest for second. COOPERKLIMT took back off of the moderate early pace,
improved position on the turn while three deep, advanced at mid-stretch, continued his steady bid to the final stages and was up in time to secure third.
COBRE broke a step slowly at the start, lacked early speed, improved position while saving ground on the turn, made a sustained rally through the stretch
but lacked the needed late response and just missed for third. THEUNTOUCHABLEONE stalked the moderate early pace, pressed the pace to the quarter
marker, lost position in upper stretch and weakened. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW broke alertly and assumed command at the start, set moderate fractions to
the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. CASH'S CAT broke in at the start and was
off slowly, spotted the field in the early running, gained ground along the turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
SPANISH CHANNEL was bumped at the start by SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS, recovered and tracked the solid pace heading to the turn, saved ground into
the bend, angled four wide for the drive, loomed at mid-stretch, took command at the furlong marker, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and
held sway in the final stages. LADY GREGORY tracked the quick early pace while outside of rivals, slipped to the two path along the turn, was steered to
the rail in upper stretch, came in tight nearing the furlong marker, hit the rail when BLUEBERRY MUFFIN drifted in at mid-stretch, recovered heading to the
final furlong, could not match strides with SPANISH CHANNEL in the final stages and bested the rest. ADAM'S CREED was unhurried in the early stages,
saved ground to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, was not able to muster the needed late response
and was outkicked, while clear of the rest for third. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN showed good early speed leaving the start, set quick fractions while pressured
into the turn, showed the way while pressed to the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch, drifted in and crowded LADY GREGORY nearing
the furlong marker, could not keep pace in the late stages and faded. SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS broke out at the start and bumped SPANISH CHANNEL,
was prominent in the early stages, pressed the fast pace to the turn, kept close attendance to BLUEBERRY MUFFIN to the quarter marker, lost position
nearing the furlong pole and tired in the final stages. MANY MARKETS lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not factor.

ALTITUDE broke alertly and was asked to show speed leaving the start, ceded the early lead to AZURE STAR and tracked that rival through fast fractions
into the backstretch run, inched closer to the pacesetter along the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, confronted AZURE STAR at the
furlong marker, battled with that game rival to deep stretch, wore down the runner-up in the final strides and won the nod at the finish to prevail. AZURE
STAR (IRE) showed good early speed leaving the break and established the pace into the first turn, drew off into the backstretch run and set solid fractions
to the half-mile marker, came back to the field a bit while still clear to the quarter marker, was confronted by ALTITUDE at mid-stretch, met that rival's bid to
deep stretch and was gamely bested at the finish, while clear of the rest for second. EXTRA INNINGS rated nicely off of the solid early pace, saved ground
into the second turn, loomed in upper stretch while along the rail, waited for racing room at the furlong marker, tipped out two wide inside of the furlong pole
then came in tight nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the top two in deep stretch and held safely at the end for third. ONE BIG
SMILE tracked the quick early pace, maintained a three wide path along the first turn then into the backstretch run, held position into the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and offered a mild late rally. STRAMA was unhurried in the early going, improved position along the
far turn while two wide, ran evenly to the furlong marker and was gaining in deep stretch. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY was allowed to settle, saved ground to
the far turn and did not factor in the stretch. START THEM UP took back off of the solid early pace, raced two wide along the first turn, angled outside of
rivals to race four wide down the backstretch, improved position while four wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, was outrun approaching the
furlong pole and tired in the late stages. MR MAKUNOUCHI was a bit slow into stride early on then was unhurried along the first turn, trailed through the
backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and did not have an impact in the stretch.

Footnotes
IMPLICITLY was allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of rivals along the turn, circled five wide into the stretch run, rallied to come within aim
at mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages, vied for the lead with three other rivals into deep stretch and surged in the final strides to prevail. IL
CAPITANO was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the fast pace to the turn, chased the pacesetter to the quarter marker, was asked for run
in upper stretch and confronted EVENEREVENWORSE at the furlong pole, battled to deep stretch with that rival and other oncoming foes, vied for the lead
with IMPLICITLY in the final strides and just missed for the win, while just holding for the place. EVENEREVENWORSE showed good early speed and
dictated terms into the turn, drew to a clear lead at the quarter marker while setting quick fractions, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, dug in
and gamely battled oncoming foes to deep stretch, could not find more in the final strides and was gamely bested for the win and place, while holding for the
show. OUR EXPECTATION took back off of the quick early pace, raced two wide into the turn then slipped to the rail approaching the top of the stretch,
loomed along the inside at the furlong marker, was unable to make further headway in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while just
missing for the show. AMANOFMYSTATURE chased the fast early pace, lost ground on the turn while three wide, re-rallied approaching the furlong marker
and was not able to muster a final response. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH chased the quick early pace, lost position along the turn, re-rallied in the drive, ran
evenly in the final furlong and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
DRINKUP BUTTERCUP broke out a bit at the start and crowded DANCING BONBON, showed good early speed, set a solid pace into the turn, rated nicely
along the turn while dictating terms, drew to a clear lead approaching the furlong marker, kept to task in the final stages and was hand urged to the wire.
DANCING BONBON ran off with her rider before the start, was crowded a bit at the start by DRINKUP BUTTERCUP but recovered to be forwardly placed
early on, stalked DRINKUP BUTTERCUP while three wide into the turn, slipped to the two path approaching the top of the stretch, lost ground to the
pacesetter heading to mid-stretch, was not able to make headway on DRINKUP BUTTERCUP in the final stages and was second best at the finish.
CHROME'S BEST COPY chased the solid early pace, was shuffled back a bit heading into the turn and raced three wide to the quarter marker, was not
able to keep pace with the top pair in the drive and outfinished FROSTY DOLCE for third. FROSTY DOLCE tracked the solid early pace, gained ground
from the inside on the turn, lost position heading to mid-stretch, gave way in the final stages and was outfinished for third. PAPER TIGER was away slowly,
spotted the field in the early stages, lost contact heading to the turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
DRESS REHEARSAL broke well but backed off the early pace duel, was encouraged to stay close though the turn then asked for more inside the three
furlong pole, responded with a strong run to vie for the lead while six wide entering the stretch and sustained the run to the wire to win going away.
CRYSTAL PROOF broke a step slow then was rushed into the early mix, saved ground and took a stalking position behind the dueling leaders, tipped three
wide into the stretch to challenge for the lead, took over a the top of the stretch and ran on well but was outfinished for the win while clearly second best.
MAGICAL LADY broke out slightly at the start then had to steady early off heels, spotted the field several lengths head start, angled over towards the rail to
save ground through the turn, came into the stretch boxed in then dove to the rail, steadied, then tipped out to the two path, found some room and finished
well enough to gain third. TIZ A TIGER allowed to settle near the rear of the pack early, had a three wide trip though the turn and into the stretch, kept to
task and passed tiring horses in the final sixteenth. SPUN BEAUTIFUL broke well then went heads up with GRAZEN DEB in a tight battle that lasted to
deep stretch, got the better of that rival inside the furlong grounds but weakened and was unable to fend off the late challengers. GRAZEN DEB quickest
away from the gate then joined immediately to the outside by SPUN BEAUTIFUL, battled that one to deep stretch then tired from those early efforts.
JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT broke well and settled in a tactical position three wide and just behind the dueling leaders, tipped out another path while launching
a bid from the five sixteenths marker, was five wide into the stretch then was unable to keep pace in the stretch. LION'S LAIR stumbled from the gate then
was put in tight quarters from both sides, struggled to stay close through the first half mile, saved ground and made a mild bid through the turn but had
nothing left in the stretch.
