Footnotes
RED RIVER WITCH bumped the inside rival at the start, moved forward between runners three wide to take a clear lead and force the pace, shook off a
challenger in upper stretch and responded to urging by drawing away. HONEY CREEK stalked from outside the eventual winner three to four wide, was no
match but second best. ANGEL WHISPER was forwardly-placed in the two path into the first turn, chased the leader from inside up the backstretch, failed to
rally. MISSWISH saved ground into the first turn, came off the fence, was encouraged along to keep up at the five-and-one-half and again coming to the
half-mile pole, was off the rail for the far turn and gave no response to urging. MOONSHINE LILY was bumped at the break, raced well off the inside at the
rear, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CASINO QUEEN was quickly clear, dictated terms near the inside, was shaken up near the furlong marker, given a few flags of the crop and modest hand
urging to draw away. TAYLOR'S VISION advanced inside foes on the turn, was not a threat to the winner but secured the place. ACERTIVE MISS chased
from inside a rival but off the fence going in the two to three path on the turn, had no late bid. J LOVE was outpaced trailing early racing off the rail, passed a
tired foe. SUNDAY'S VISION chased from outside going three to four wide on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
NORDIC QUEEN pressed just outside the pacesetter racing three to four wide, engaged to duel on the far turn, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, was
clear by mid-stretch and put to moderate urging, held sway. SPELL FREEDOM set the early tempo racing off the rail in the two to three path with outside
pressure, was further engaged on the far turn still racing off the inside, was no match but second best. SAENGER STAR was caught four wide on the first
turn, eased back off the front to stalk the leading pair, advanced along the rail on the far turn but could not sustain the effort. MY SECRETARIAT was caught
five wide into the first turn, dropped back and was outpaced.

Footnotes
BLAKE FROM TISH stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, struck the lead in mid-stretch and edged clear. MISTER TYRO attended the pace from
outside four wide through the turn, bid in the stretch but was outkicked. TUFF MANDATE broke a step slowly, moved forward under encouragement racing
off the rail, raced in behind rivals lacking room coming past the furlong marker then altered out and ran on. ST PATRICKS SWORD set a pressured pace
racing just off the rail, had no extra. GIT AROUND BROWN pressed from between runners three wide, lacked the needed late kick. STAY STRONG settled
off the pace inside, saved ground near the rail on the turn, came out a bit for the drive and improved. EASTER JIM shifted in, saved ground on the turn, ran
on evenly. SERVICEMAN switched outside foes going six then seven wide on the turn racing toward the back, needed more. CRYPTO MINER broke
outwardly, chased from outside foes, went six wide on the turn, faded. MAHOMEITE chased briefly, dropped back three wide on the turn and faded. EL
CONTRATISTA broke a step slowly and failed to menace.

CHILLAXIFICATION got away alertly, set the pace in the clear, was shaken up at the top of the stretch, widened under hand-urging. TOM'S GIRL settled
racing outside mostly three to four wide, was not a threat to the winner but clearly second best. ARTISTIC VISION settled, swung five wide into upper
stretch, was along for show. RUBY THE DESTROYER raced mostly three wide, failed to rally. LISA G fought the rider's restraint early racing off the rail,
failed to rally.

ADRIA contended inside briefly, lost ground on the intent leader and switched outside that one at the half, went three to four wide on the turn with aim, drove
past in late stretch. STAR OF THE NORTH moved forward to force the pace from outside, shifted in a bit once clear but still racing off the rail in the two to
three path, was outkicked. INTO CLASSIC brushed the outer rival at the start, saved ground inside and gained steadily in the lane. SUGAR SHACK QUEEN
was encouraged along midway on the turn racing four wide, needed more. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE was brushed at the start, raced at the back off the rail,
failed to menace.

Footnotes
WEST TEXAS RAIN brushed lightly with a foe at the break, moved forward to take the lead inside a rival after the opening furlong, set the pace inside on or
just off the rail, shook off challengers and kicked clear in the stretch then was kept busy to the wire. TERAWATT tracked from inside, shifted out four wide
coming to the quarter pole, was second best. FIRE EXTINGUISHER dropped back a bit up the backstretch into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend,
kept on in the stretch to get up for show honors. SERENDIP RULER had the early lead for the opening eighth of a mile, continued to press three wide,
needed more in the stretch. ROMANCER exchanged a light brush at the start, shifted in, saved ground early on the turn, tipped out two to three wide late on
that bend, ran on in the lane. VISION OF ELIAS stalked the leaders from outside, was within range four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
STEPPIN SHEP veered in a bit at the gap, switched out and raced two to three wide on the turn, ran on. FROGGY veered in badly at the gap, raced inside
on the turn. EL CHIHUAS chased from between rivals mid-pack, shifted in at the three-eighths, came up empty. TRADE DEADLINE chased from outside,
went four to five wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
CATALE WINEMIXER switched off the inside early, settled off the pace, began to advance three then four wide on the turn, moved between runners past
the quarter pole, drew clear. SURFER GIRL was forwardly-placed between runners, bid three wide, drifted in toward the rail in upper stretch, was no match
for the winner but kept on and just saved the place in a head-bob. SPLITSECONDECISION moved forward inside up the backstretch, raced just off the
leaders saving ground on the turn, altered outside a drifting rival three deep about the eighth pole, kicked on and just missed second. SULPHUR SUE was
reluctant to load, stalked the pace from outside going five wide then forced out six wide late on the turn, kept on late to narrowly miss second and third.
ALTERNATE ABBY raced off the pace going four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. NAUGHTY NOELLE was hard to load, broke awkwardly and slowly,
brought up the rear into the turn and was forced five wide beginning that bend swinging seven deep into the stretch, showed mild late interest to improve
position. HANNAH FO FANNAH was forwardly-placed racing four then five wide on the turn when forced out a bit past the quarter pole, weakened
thereafter. GOSPEL EXPRESSION was in a bit tight on heels near the seven-sixteenths, switched out at that juncture and went three to five wide on the
turn. OKIE HEAT raced mid-pack early near but off the inside, faded. GOLDIE'S LEGACY moved forward inside rivals racing just off the rail to take the lead,
set a pressured pace, gave way. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
