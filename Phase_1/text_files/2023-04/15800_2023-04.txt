Footnotes
ICING angled in shortly after the start and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. NOID was shut off early then saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the
rail, cleared second past the eighth pole and was gaining late on the winner. C R'S MANDATE rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the
chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly to take third mid-stretch. HOT FUDGE SONDE was shuffled
back soon after the start and saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out past the eighth pole and finished
evenly. JUBA'S NOTION rated close inside, challenged at the three eighths pole but flattened stride while drifting on the far turn. HUMPTY GRUMPTY was
shuffled back at the start, settled in the three path on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SMALL FIELD saved ground. The
Stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of Icing for interference soon after the start, lodged by the riders of Noid and Hot Fudge Sonde. As a
result, Icing was disqualified to fourth place.

Footnotes
ONE NIGHT MIKE settled in the three and four paths on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and took the lead two deep toward the
quarter, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was kept sharp through the lane. SPANGLISH rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the
half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. HONEYQUIST took the lead three wide nearing the first
turn, was met at even terms approaching the half mile pole and dueled nearing the three eighths, was caught at the rail toward the quarter and flattened
mid-stretch. PENGUIN PARADE saved early ground, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths
then flattened in the lane. TIMMY settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path of the far
turn. HAPPY YEARS showed little response through the backstretch. SARGENT KOBE had a brief early lead inside, was met at the rail into the first turn,
dropped back and gave chase into the backstretch, but gave way into the far turn. THUNDERINREADYRICK steadied lightly at the start then rated close
four wide from the three quarter pole, moved to even terms nearing the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but gave way into the far turn.

RIDICULOUS saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, dueled for the lead
mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. UNCAPTURED KING rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole,
improved at the rail on the far turn then dug in through the lane to take the nod for second under the wire. AUBURN MILL took a quick lead while tapering in
and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear of Flat Cat approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail through
the far turn but was met mid-stretch and gave up the nod for second under the wire. ROYAL THUNDER rated close, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, raced in range of the lead in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SAG HARBOR saved ground, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. FLAT CAT tapered in and stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
dropped back toward the quarter and weakened off the rail approaching the head of the lane. ANTIPOISON was eased early and ponied off.

Footnotes
JUBA'S HAT TRICK took the lead approaching the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, inched clear toward the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn and dug in determinedly to hold on. DUNCAN IDAHO engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the far turn and dueled
through the stretch to take second the final yards while gaining on the winner. JAZZ WITH DENIS became anxious in the gate then pressured the pace
inside, dropped back approaching the quarter pole and relented second in the final yards. ALDARIGHTTRICKS chased through the backstretch, raced off
the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. DRUNK TEXT was forced in early then gave chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the
lane. CHARITABLE WINDSOR came in at the break, picked up the chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path. LAST OF
BAD BOYS saved ground. COURT TUDOR gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the four path. CRUSH 'N RUN raced wide.

and raced at the rail on the far turn, came between horses past the eighth pole then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. SOCIAL CHIC saved
early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four and five paths of the far turn then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. FREE
SAILIN rated a slim early lead inside, was met leaving the first turn and stayed close past the half mile pole, challenged from the three eighths but dropped
back at the five sixteenths and flattened through later yards. MUAD'DIB raced with the pace through the front stretch then eased out and stalked into the
first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but flattened through later yards. LATE IN THE
GAME saved ground on the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased outward through the upper
stretch and passed some rivals outside. JUNGLE BEAST settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out leaving the turn and gave chase from the three
eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride. NICO rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths

Footnotes
MY CANDY BIZ rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met
at even terms entering the stretch but dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game effort of HAPPY CHAMP, who stalked from the four path
on the first turn and gave chase leaving the three eighths, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, moved to even terms into the lane
and stayed on gamely to the finish. LADDIE LIAM rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the four path and got up for third mid-stretch. EXCALIBUR saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on
the far turn, angled out looking for room through the upper stretch and finished evenly. LOST IN MANHATTAN settled off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn outside and flattened later yards. FORT FORTITUDE rounded
the first turn about the four path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and weakened in the lane. KING NATE
raced well back off the rail on the first turn, rounded the far turn about the seven path and passed rivals. TOP HAT TREASON rounded the first turn about
the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response. CLOSE THE CASE had a brief early lead then stalked on the first turn, gave chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. BEYOND THE VICTORY stalked the pace from the three path the first turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but gave way passing the three eighths and was eased.
