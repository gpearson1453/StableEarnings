Footnotes
BRIGGSEY went to an easy lead to set all the pace throughout, then inched away on the final turn to prove best. HOT TICKET stalked the pace from the
two path to the final turn then was asked to make a bid, moving out to three wide in upper stretch and made a late gain on the leader but was not enough.
DOMINANT OKIE was off the pace in the two path around the first turn and down the backstretch then was coaxed at the seven sixteenths pole but was
empty. PRINCE CAROLINA J tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn and faded in the stretch drive.

LOCK UP YOUR PETS was off the early pace in the three path then took over at the three eighths pole and drew clear into the stretch and held on for the
win. MR GYPSY unseated rider behind the gate, then was roused to make a rail bid into the turn, moving out to three wide in upper stretch and was gaining
late on the leader but was only second best. CLEARLY A JET pressed the early pace to the seven sixteenths pole then was taken up to avoid the loose
horse going into the turn then made a late stretch run to improve position. SHINE JACK'S DREAM was void of speed and passed tiring rivals. RAINBOW
CREST was hustled to the early lead from the inside to the half pole and faded. CAT NAMED HERCULES lost rider after start.

CONNORS OUTLAW pressed the pace from the two path to the top of the stretch then took command and drew off to prove best. DANCING DEVIL tracked
the leaders from the three path then was asked at the three eighths pole making a three wide bid, moved out four wide into upper stretch but was not
enough to catch the winner. CINCO STEVE was off the pace on the inside then moved out to two wide at the quarter pole but lacked the late response
needed. HUNTER QUICK stalked the pace down the backstretch from the four path then moved out to four or five wide in upper stretch but failed to
menace. MIRANDEN went to a pressured lead to the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly.

TIFFANY TWIST tracked the leaders from the three path down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole to take over at the
quarter pole and held off the outside closing rival to prove best. CANADA CANDY was off the pace in the two path then moved out to three or four wide in
upper stretch and closed well but was no match for the winner and was a clear second. PATSY R vied for the lead from the two path to the turn then dueled
outside of MARIA ELENA Y. G to the final yards to be a game third. MARIA ELENA Y. G was hustled to take a pressured lead from the inside then dueled
inside of PATSY R to the final yard and tired. SUPERBLEA was outrun.

HAPPY ROMANCE was off the pace around the first turn and down the backstretch then was asked at the three furlong pole and moved up to engage the
leader at the eighth pole and was able to clear late. KWONTRO went to a clear lead to the eighth pole then was headed and fought gamely but gave way
grudgingly. RACE DAY REBAL stalked the pace from the three path to the final turn then made a three wide mild bid and was the best of the rest. INCA
EMPIRE was unhurried through the final turn and passed tiring rivals. AQUIMINE was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a mild middle move
through the turn and weakened. BIG SKIPPER raced near the back and was never a factor. SWEET BAKER was close up on the pace in the two path to
the three furlong pole and gave way.

Footnotes
GOSPEL SISTER was rushed to the lead, was headed at the quarter pole but came again and won going away. EURA NORTHERN SKY broke well then
was allowed to settle down the backstretch, was coaxed at the half pole moving up on the inside and made a late run to be up for second. DODGEBALL
pressed the pace from the two path through the turn then engaged the leader at the quarter pole but was empty in the stretch drive. OKIE CODE raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside down the backstretch then moved out to three wide on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch drive. RUN DOTTIE
RUN raced in the middle of the pack from the three path but was never a factor. OKIE HOPE raced near the back on the inside and was never a threat. O S
U BUDKE raced in the middle of the pack in the two path to the three furlong pole then dropped back.
