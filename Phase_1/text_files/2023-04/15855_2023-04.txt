Footnotes
STOLICH , clear entering the first turn, was kept in the two path down the backstretch, lost the lead to I'M YOUR VALENTINE mid way down the
backstretch, battled back outside that one leaving the far turn and was kept to his business in the drive. I'M YOUR VALENTINE gained the lead along the
inner rail mid way down the backstretch, failed to hold off the winner in the stretch and finished gamely. KING ZION chased the pace outside horses down
the backstretch, drifted wide entering the stretch and was not a late threat. WICKED SUPRISE , four wide the first turn, saved ground the far turn, gave way
and raced on his left lead in the stretch. LOCOMOTE stumbled leaving the starting gate, was three wide both turns and gave way. C F V NOBODYCARES ,
a bit rank at the break, faltered and was eased late. Due to a timer malfunction, all times were hand timed.

Footnotes
GUN RUSH disputed the pace outside FAITHFUL KING down the backstretch, went clear on the far turn and was kept to his business in the stretch.
PERFUMER lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, angled outside near the eighth pole and passed tired horses. KEEP ATTACKING broke
slowly, lacked speed, raced inside horses on the far turn and failed to menace. TIZWOW stalked the pace well off the inner rail down the backstretch, circled
the far turn three wide and weakened. STRIKE PRICE , no factor, was three wide the far turn. FAITHFUL KING showed speed along the inner rail, dueled
with the winner down the backstretch, checked in close quarters entering the far turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS moved up to take a two wide lead on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, drew away under encouragement and drifted out a bit in
the drive. CAIRO SUMMER , two wide chasing the winner around the far turn, was no match for that one and held the place. WEEKEND PASS lacked
speed, was wide around the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. TWELVE RED ROSES , a forward factor three wide the far turn,
weakened. KITTEN ROCKS , near the inner rail most of the trip, gave way in the drive. SILVERA , slow to begin, stalked the pace down the backstretch,
angled outside in upper stretch and lacked a rally. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER was outrun.

Footnotes
AHEADOFTHEGAME made the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up in the stretch and was kept under pressure. MILLARD'S SMILE ,
well placed down the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, eased out in mid stretch and rallied. JEALOUS EYES prompted the pace
outside the winner and gave way in mid stretch. AVIANO lacked speed, advanced inside horses on the far turn, angled out approaching the stretch and
failed to sustain his bid. COMING UP ACES saved ground around the far turn and weakened. ROCKET HOTSHOT , along the inner rail on the far turn,
angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. MEMPHIS PRAYER , steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the first turn, was not a factor.
JUSTICE ONCE , wide entering the stretch, gave way. T J MUNNINGS , three wide the first turn, dropped back.
