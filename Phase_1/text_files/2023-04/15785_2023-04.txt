Footnotes
WAHOOWA WAHOOWA bumped at the start, stalked the pace, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew off smartly to
prove best, under right handed crop urging. SASSY KING was reserved early on the inside, advanced nicely on the rail to the quarter pole, angled out and
came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to be clearly second best. ALL TIME CLASSIC dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened, held
show award. LTL BEAR SALOON was away alertly, dueled for the lead two wide, then was between rivals by the five sixteenths and weakened.
POCOPSON STATION was reserved early four wide, three wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and had no rally. VISHNU was settled early,
between rivals by the five eighths marker and then weakened. SCARY LARRY chased the early pace and was three wide on the backstretch and tired.
WILD UNION was off slowly, four wide into the first turn, not a factor.
