place. YEGUITA QUEEN opened clear early, then saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened after being headed leaving the eighth pole.
DANCIN DEE was reserved off the early pace, ranged up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive.

LOUD N PROUD saved ground setting the pace, lost the lead to Last Promise nearing the quarter pole, then responded gamely when put to pressure during
the drive and edged clear late. LAST PROMISE was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the half mile pole to prompt the issue, gained
the lead nearing the quarter pole but was unable to match strides with the winner late. ENGLISH LAUGHTER stalked the pace while racing three-wide, but
was unable to reach the top two during the drive. ZONIC vied for the early lead from along the inside, dropped back before going a half mile and then
improved his position during the drive. HONDO GUSTO was prominently placed for six furlongs and gave way. SHAKEM N BREAKEM was forwardly
placed early from between horses and tired.

DR. ANN prompted the pace set by Lyrical while racing along the outside, took the lead entering the stretch and gradually drew clear. JLO CAN DANCE
saved ground while being unhurried, angled out three-wide entering the stretch and finished strongly for the place. LYRICAL saved ground setting the pace
to the stretch, responded when headed and held on well for the show. EAST WING was fractious in the gate, then hit the side of the gate at the start, raced
four-wide after that and failed to seriously threaten. CELESTIAL ORB was prominently placed into the stretch while racing three-wide and tired. ARETE'S
CHALICE broke in the air to get away behind her field and failed to be a factor.

BORGOBYTHESEA saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. FLY FLY AWAY was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and
responded gamely during the drive to hold the place. JOE PHILLIPS was unhurried early, moved up four-wide to reach contention before going a half mile,
offered a bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to sustain his rally. LORD BARNA saved ground while being unhurried early, slipped through along the
inside during the drive and gained his best stride too late. PRINCE AMADEUS weas allowed to settle in stride while racing between horses early but lacked
the needed response when called upon. UNLEVERAGED saved ground while being forwardly placed to the stretch and weakened. SPETTACOLI (ARG)
dropped backed early while racing three-wide and was not a serious factor. CHAOS KID prompted the early pace while racing three-wide and tired during
the drive. CANDY COVE was three-wide early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

final sixteenth. BASKING stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole, gained a slight lead between calls in the
stretch but was unable to resist the winner late. LI'L MISS CAMILLE vied with Pink Shoelaces for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off entering
the stretch, was unable to resist the top two but continued on well for the show. ADIOS BABY was allowed to settle in stride early, came five-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. PINK SHOELACES dueled for the lead from the outside to the stretch and tired. SHE'S MY WARRIOR was off a step slow, then
showed some early speed and gave way.

Footnotes
MINELLA saved ground setting the pace and was ridden out to increase his advantage. BIALYSTOCK chased the pace from the outset, came two-wide into
the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished well for second in a solid effort. STREET COP OFFICER broke in at the start then bobbled off horse's
heels early, saved ground from that point and gradually improved his position. ONCE UPON A DREAM was unhurried early, rallied four-wide and was
gaining slightly late. AWESOME HONOR was carried out on the first turn by Instigating, then settled in the middle of the field and failed to threaten.
FOREVER SAUCY hopped slightly at the start, then moved up between horses on the turn, checked and stumbled entering the backstretch and was unable
to recover. COLPO D'ORO was carried out on the first turn by Instigating, then was forwardly placed from between horses for six furlongs and tired.
INSTIGATING ducked out causing interference on the first turn then moved up to force the issue for a half mile and gave way. DISCREET MAGIC was
prominently placed early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid entering the stretch, ducked out leaving the eighth pole unseating his rider and continuing out
to hit the rail. Following the race, Discreet Magic was unsaddled and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED INQUIRIES INTO THE FIRST TURN,
THE INCIDENT ENERING THE BACKSTRETCH AND ALSO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS, MADE NO CHANGE
IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SISTER SAINT set the pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by Shut It Cali and proved narrowly best in a prolonged drive.
SHUT IT CALI was forwardly placed early while racing four-wide, moved up to engage Sister Saint nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that one to the wire
and just missed in a game effort. UNCAPTURED DREAMS was allowed to settle in stride, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid and
then went evenly late. BELLA'S CUPID was unhurried early, rallied six-wide the final quarter and gradually improved her position. ASHES TO ASHES was
off a step slow and failed to threaten while raciing two-wide. MISS NEO was fractious in the gate, then vied for the early lead from between horses and
weakened. MO TOWN ANNIE was not a factor while saving ground. RED DELICIOUS dueled for the early lead from along the inside for a half mile and
tired.
