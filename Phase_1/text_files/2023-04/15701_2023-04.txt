Footnotes
BARBERA was asked to show speed leaving the break and dictated terms to the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive
while holding the lead to the furlong pole, steadily drifted out while under left-handed urging in the stretch and carried out ENDLESS DREAM, kept to task to
deep stretch and dug in in the final stages to prevail. ENDLESS DREAM was forwardly placed early on and stalked the pace to the turn, kept close
attendance to BARBERA to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit of that foe to mid-stretch, advanced on BARBERA while being steadily carried out by that rival
and was held at bay for the win in deep stretch, while holding safely for second. ROSE ROSE ROSE was unhurried in the early running, saved ground into
the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, closed well in the late stages, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and was up in time to secure
third. SWEET MILLIE lunged at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the decent early pace, gained ground while four wide on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished for third. WHATWASTHENISNOW chased the pace from the inside, ran evenly to the
furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages. PRNCSS OF DEL MAR chased the decent early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not sustain
that bid in the stretch drive and weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT BARBERA STEADILY DRIFTED OUT INSIDE OF THE FURLONG MARKER AND CAUSED ENDLESS DREAM TO BE
CARRIED OUT IN THE STRETCH. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THIS ACTION BY BARBERA COST ENDLESS DREAM THE OPPORTUNITY OF A
BETTER PLACING, AND BARBERA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
MYSTIC TBILISI rated off of the solid early pace while not far back, advanced three wide on the turn, continued that bid and came within aim at mid-stretch,
responded to urging inside of the furlong marker, took command in deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. THISMUSTBETHEPLACE
was prominent in the early going and contested the quick pace into the turn, dueled with HAYDEN'S ANGEL to the quarter marker while carving solid
fractions, shook free from HAYDEN'S ANGEL and took command nearing the furlong marker, was all out nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off
MYSTIC TBILISI in deep stretch and held well for second in the final strides. GOOD FOCUS was unhurried in the early stages, advanced while outside of
rivals on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and just missed for
second, while getting up in time for third. HAYDEN'S ANGEL showed good early speed and disputed the solid pace to the turn, dueled to the quarter marker
while on the front end with THISMUSTBETHEPLACE, lost position at mid-stretch, was outkicked in deep stretch and was just edged out for the minor
awards. WICKLOW HILLS chased the solid early pace from the second flight, gained ground while two wide nearing the quarter marker, came in tight
nearing the top of the stretch, encountered traffic in the drive while behind runners, found a bit of room in deep stretch but could not muster the needed late
response.

Footnotes
SHANAGOLDEN rated off of the quick early pace, improved position along the backstretch run, loomed three wide at the quarter marker, chased in pursuit
of TIGER'S ARROW to the furlong grounds, battled with that rival to the sixteenth-marker, shook free in deep stretch and held in a drive over the oncoming
runner-up. AFRICAN PRINCE took back off of the decent early pace, advanced while holding his position to the second turn, raced three wide into the
stretch, finished well in the drive, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and outfinished TIGER'S ARROW to secure second. TIGER'S ARROW settled
in the second flight along the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, confronted SINGLE MERIT along the second turn, took command in
upper stretch, led to the furlong marker, was confronted by SHANAGOLDEN inside of the furlong pole and battled with that foe to the sixteenth-marker,
weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while clear for third. FANTASTIC DREAM tracked the loose pacesetter through the early stages,
raced two wide into the far turn, advanced at mid-stretch and could not keep pace in the final furlong. MIQUEAS was unhurried in the early going, saved
ground to the top of the stretch and did not threaten. SINGLE MERIT broke alertly, showed good early speed and drew off to a clear lead in the early going,
rated through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, stopped in the stretch drive, was eased to the finish and walked off under his
own power. KID STOLE A KISS was shuffled back then took up leaving the start and spotted the field in the early stages, lacked speed through the
backstretch run, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
DAD BOD was prominent in the early going, tracked the fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, raced two wide into the stretch run, made a
steady gain to the furlong pole, caught TWO TWELVE nearing the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. TWO TWELVE broke
alertly and sped to the early lead, drew to a clear advantage heading into the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, drifted out a path in upper stretch,
maintained a clear lead to mid-stretch, came under pressure from DAD BOD nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold that rival off in deep stretch and
just held for second at the finish. RIVER'S BEHEST was allowed to settle in the second flight early on, raced three wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to
the furlong pole, found his best stride late, just missed for second at the finish and was well clear in the end for third. DR. FLASH DANCER tracked the fast
early pace, raced two wide into the turn, slipped to the rail in upper stretch, lost position at mid-stretch and could not muster a late rally. RANCHO RED was
a bit slow into stride early on, lacked early speed, raced three wide into the stretch run and did not threaten. TIZ A THRILL was unhurried in the early
running, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not factor.

Footnotes
RACKATAPTAP rated off of the early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile pole, continued to gain while
three deep on the far turn, vied for the lead at the quarter marker then took command in upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong pole, was given a
couple of reminder taps nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew away in deep stretch under hand urging as much the best. UPSTART YANKEE was
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the backstretch run and into the second turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, swung widest
into the drive, was no match for the winner in the late stages but was gaining in deep stretch and was up in time for second. BLUE SILVER broke alertly,
ceded the early lead and stalked WAKES AND WEDDINGS through moderate fractions into the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pace into the
far turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch with RACKATAPTAP, could not keep pace with the winner in the drive, weakened in deep stretch and was
outfinished for second, while holding safely at the end for third. STOUT settled in the second flight, was well positioned through the backstretch run, raced
two wide into the far turn, slipped to the rail at the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch and lacked a rally in the final stages. MOVIETIME was
allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, came three wide into the stretch and did not offer a late response. WAKES AND WEDDINGS was
keen in the early stages and pulled to the early lead, raced three wide into the backstretch run, settled along the backstretch and dictated terms to the far
turn, tried to lugged out nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by RACKATAPTAP nearing the top of the lane, chased to mid-stretch and tired in the
drive.

Footnotes
MEDAL ICE tracked WESTERN SIERRA to the turn under a firm hold, bid for the lead leaving the quarter pole, veered out under left handed urging in
mid-stretch but was able to run down the stubborn pacesetter inside the furlong grounds. NICKEL NICKEL NINE broke out and bothered ANOTHER
STRIKE after the break, chased the two leaders from well back while to the outside of EASTER TRIBUTE, moved in tandem with that one through the turn,
swung three wide into the stretch, closed with a rush in the late stages and just missed for the win, while securing second. WESTERN SIERRA broke
sharply then veered in front of ANOTHER STRIKE, was able to seize the early advantage then maintained a clear lead to the stretch, ran on well when
roused down the lane, veered out late and just failed to last. EASTER TRIBUTE got away a bit slowly, saved ground through the turn, came under a ride
approaching the five-sixteenths pole but could not summon the needed response. ANOTHER STRIKE broke in a bit at the start then over-reacted when the
rider tried to straighten out, then had to steady when WESTERN SIERRA veered into the path, fought the rider down the backstretch then made a four wide
bid on the turn to regain contact with the field, was gaining in the stretch drive but could not muster the needed late response.

Footnotes
LIAM'S SECRET was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, was pressed by ARISTEIA to the quarter
marker, turned away that rival in upper stretch, responded to urging inside of the furlong pole, came under pressure in deep stretch, dug in in the final
stages and held in a drive at the end to prevail. NAN ELIZABETH settled off of the early pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn and into the
backstretch run, was coaxed four wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, rallied while widest in deep
stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and was up in the final strides for second. DANGEROUS ILLUSION settled in the second flight early
on, maintained position through the backstretch run while not far back, raced three wide into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, closed fast in deep stretch, just missed for second at the finish and was up in time to secure third. ARISTEIA was forwardly placed into the first
turn, attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, confronted LIAM'S SECRET and pressed the pace into the second turn, lost ground to
LIAM'S SECRET in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and was outfinished in the final stages, while just being edged out for the minor awards.
BIG FAME was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the far turn, tipped two wide for the stretch drive and found her best stride late. STEIN'S GIRL
lacked early speed, raced three wide into the second turn, maintained that three wide path into the stretch drive, trailed to the furlong marker and closed
willingly in the late stages. SNOW HILL took back off of the early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. ST HELENA was prominent in the early going, stalked the moderate pace while two wide along the first turn,
raced within striking range through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch, could not keep pace with
oncoming rivals in deep stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO broke well then got good position on the inside of a three horse speed duel early, shook off the challengers on the turn, responded when
roused at the top of the stretch and finished strong under intermittent urging to prevail. PERFORMATIVE veered in sharply at the break, bumped and
impeded LIVERMORE HEAT then overcorrected in the opposite direction spotting the field a head start, was then unhurried near the rear of the field down
the backstretch and into the turn, made a big sweeping move four to five wide with three furlongs to run, tipped six wide into the stretch then continued to
rally, raced a bit erratically late and came up short. LIVERMORE HEAT bumped and impeded by PERFORMATIVE at the start, lagged far behind the field
down the backstretch, was still out of touch on the turn then started a huge rally from the five-sixteenths pole that carried seven wide into the stretch, shifted
inside mid-stretch to dodge an erratic PERFORMATIVE and gained third. WEE BEASTIE tracked early while saving ground, moved into contention on the
turn, got a clear run into the stretch and ran on well down the lane but needed a bit more. UPDRAFT broke out at the start then had trouble getting
straightened out, hustled to keep contact with the field, was under pressure and ran one-paced from start to finish. PLENTY COUPS broke alertly and was
in the outside of a three horse speed duel early, bid three wide at the top of the stretch then failed to change leads and tired. MY DAD IS THIRSTY vied for
the early lead between horses, was still in contention at the top of the stretch then weakened down the lane. SMOKIN BLAZE chased the early pace, lost
position while three wide on the turn, was outrun in the drive and gave way.
