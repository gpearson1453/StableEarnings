Footnotes
ROUGH DRAFT broke out and bumped a foe, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, came out three wide while roused into upper
stretch then gained to make a bid, took the lead just inside the furlong marker, fought with the pacesetter into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong
urging. CONMAN settled off the pace, saved ground behind the winner around the turn, followed that opponent three wide into upper stretch, idled behind
that foe before being roused with the crop at the furlong marker, moved out some to finally find clear space in front outside the sixteenth-pole and finished
with good energy but was too late while able to garner the place. SANDRONE angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage,
controlled the action while inside around the turn, came off the rail while set down into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was headed
by the winner while drifting out some and was outfinished then lost the place while clear for the show. SINFUL DANCER was taken in hand early then
tracked the pace, stalked the leader while let out in the two path on the turn, was asked for more outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into upper stretch,
chased under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. FEATHERS ROAD settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide
into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GREAT WORKOUT was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went two to three wide
around the turn, came five wide into the stretch then bumped with a foe while in the six path nearing the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. BASIS RISK
was bumped solidly at the start then forced out into another foe, raced between foes while rated off the pace, tugged keenly at the bit under snug restraint
passing the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path while asked, came four wide into upper stretch, dropped in under a drive outside the furlong
marker and also lacked the needed response. BE OF COURAGE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace under urging, went four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch then bumped with a foe while seven wide near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LOOMS BOLDLY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through solid splits, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and held well and safe to prevail kept to task. HELDISH four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home through to the finish while being rebuffed to the end.
THUNDERIAN coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and had
to quickly alter to the two path straightened away to avoid crashing into the back of TORRONE, then offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors.
TORRONE chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish.
WARMAN ROAD coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, climbed a bit facing the kickback of rivals in front
responding averse to it and angled out awkwardly skipping over the heels of THUNDERIAN near the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and
tired.

rated at the rear of the trio, saved ground while let out early on the far turn, made light contact with a foe while moving to the two path late on that bend,
spun three wide into upper stretch in pursuit of the winner, chased outside while remaining on his inside lead, made a bid under a left-handed crop inside

LIFE AND LIGHT chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the front, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths and launching a challenge for command, took over spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive
and was kept busy to the finish. HANG TIGHT five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild kick and was along well clear of the rest and second best. BINGO JOHN got brushed at the start by SIGHT UNSEEN, who broke
outwards, prompted the pace early on from the two path before being shaken off into the turn, tipped three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, weakened while along well clear of the rest for the show honors. ONE MORE SCORE broke outwards
brushing the off side stall at the start, prompted the pace from the outside three wide down the backstretch before advancing on the leader half a mile from
home put to coaxing, took over command at the seven-sixteenths and tucked to the inside midway, came under threat and yielded near the quarter pole,
took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. EXXTOP chased three then two wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch and made no impact. PRINCE OF JOY chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn under coaxing
from the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SIGHT UNSEEN broke out at the start brushing BINGO JOHN, showed the way for the
opening half mile under some pressure to the outside, got overhauled with seven-sixteenths to run and faded through the turn giving chase from the two
path, tipped three wide into upper stretch and folded.

PROVEN HOPE traveled three wide while between foes around the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn
then driven four wide into the stretch, chased while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead while making at the bid
near the sixteenth-pole and got up to narrowly prevail. YORKSHIRE PRINCE moved in to save ground around the first turn, was well placed just off the
pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was put to a drive in the three path into upper stretch, chased the leader into the final sixteenth, made a bid
late and just missed while up for the place. CARLIN CLAN broke out then was corrected by the rider, went three to two wide on the first turn, had a rival clip
his heels later on that bend, moved up on the outside with six furlongs to run, set a joint pace from that juncture, vied three then two wide while asked on the
far turn, shook clear under a drive into upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the show. CHESS SPECTACULAR tossed
his head while keen early, was caught five wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, gained five wide into
the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, loomed a threat into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but missed the trifecta. MAD MAGIC
went four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was asked three wide on the far turn, moved out a touch into upper stretch and lacked
the needed response. PLEASE BABY raced at the rear in the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, traveled around the far turn in the
two path while between foes, was roused near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. STEADY PROGRESS
bumped with a foe while along the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground on the final turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved
further out and was no factor. SECOND AND REED was taken in hand early, raced in the two path on the first turn, tossed his head while tugging hard on
the bit off heels later on that bend, clipped heels and stumbled then was taken up while recovering, settled down the backstretch, saved ground on the far
turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. STORMANDY tossed his head while keen under restraint early, bumped with a foe while three wide on
the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was asked near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and also
failed to rally. UNION TAP was taken under a tight hold early, bumped with foes on both sides while in the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards
the rear, raced in the two path around the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY broke a bit slow and
was last to commence, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled outside towards the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into
the stretch and failed to impact. CARPE CAPELLA went to the front, showed the way while inside on the first turn, was joined on the outside near the
three-quarter pole, came under urging on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way.

NO MORE TALK coaxed from the gate, chased four then five wide advancing midway on the turn quickly into contention, took over command and swung six
wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged clear under a drive kept busy to the finish. CASH NOW hustled from the gate, chased three then four
wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to get up for the place
honors. ZERTZ chased five then six wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. MARVIN showed
the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under some pressure from MAGINIFICENT CHROME to
the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front before swinging four to five wide for home, then weakened in the stretch.
MIDNIGHTCHARLY hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and made
no impact. MAGNIFICENT CHROME hustled from the start, prompted the pace of MARVIN from the outside two then three wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. R BOY BODE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the

Footnotes
KOSUKE established a forward position early, went three to four wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took a short lead in the two path
on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, responded well under the crop in the drive and held gamely under strong urging. STARTS NOW rounded
the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, saved ground behind the leaders on the far turn, came out three wide into upper stretch then moved
further out, gained to make a bid near the eighth-pole, battled outside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied while able to get the place.
ARISAEMA moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven four
wide into upper stretch, chased the winner in the drive and finished willingly to just get the show. SUCCULENT was keen under restraint towards the rear
early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back, traveled three wide under urging on the far turn, gained five wide into upper stretch,
chased outside to the wire and missed the show. LA CONQUISTADORA went to the front, navigated the first turn in the two path, dropped to the rail onto
the backstretch, brushed the temporary fence near the five-eighths, lost the lead to the winner while inside on the far turn, fought on under a drive into the
final furlong and was outfinished. THE SPLENDID ONE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was taken
under tight restraint while near the heels of an opponent around the five-eighths, saved ground on the far turn, shifted three wide into upper stretch and
lacked the needed kick. BOMB SQUAD went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused near the three-eighths, went two to three wide on
the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PINSTRIPEPIZZO moved in early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was
reserved off the pace, saved ground while roused on the final turn and lacked the needed response. ORANGE FREEZE bumped with a foe at the start then
was in tight, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, went three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and never reached
contention. INFLATIONARY TREND brushed with an opponent shortly after the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled well back in the field,
went around the far turn in the two path and failed to impact. GRACEFULNESS saved ground on the first turn, was taken up outside the five-eighths, raced
inside on the far turn and was no factor. ICHIBAN went four wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, dropped back three wide on the far turn and failed
to respond then faltered.

Footnotes
DEKANTER was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, made a bold rail bid inside of a foe while against the rail at the three-sixteenths,
fought inside of three foes under a strong hand-ride, took the lead inside the furlong marker, shook off rivals into the final sixteenth and prevailed without the
use of the crop. ACCEPT THE OUTCOME (IRE) pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, fought between foes in the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the place. QUIESCENT went to the front, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied near the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in the two path at the three-sixteenths, kept on well in the final furlong but was
out-kicked then just missed the place while able to get the show. MISS SAN GABRIEL was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide around the
turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and was also out-kicked.
RISK FREE was forced in at the start, settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking
position in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. LEXI'S SPIRIT broke in then brushed with a foe, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in
the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ROMAN GODDESS stumbled at the start, saved ground towards the rear,
shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. SPELTERINI was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. DIAMOND STATUS broke out and bumped soundly with a foe, was urged along towards the
back, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. MY GIRL JAL was bumped soundly at the start and off a bit slow, moved in while off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, dropped closer to the rail into upper stretch and never reached contention. DARK DAHLIA chased the pace, went three wide
on the turn, was taken in hand outside the quarter-pole, came out six wide into upper stretch and capitulated. TUFANI showed speed on the outside then
chased, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.
