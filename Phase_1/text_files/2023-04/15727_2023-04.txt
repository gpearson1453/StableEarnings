CLOWN OIL vied for the early lead three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then drew off the prove much the best, driving. CASH
CRUZER was rated along early, two wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied well for the place award, second best. RARE COIN
broke thru the gate pre-start, then broke outwardly at the start, vied for the lead inside and weakened, held show award. FUSAICHI WILDCAT checked at
the start, shifted out and was four wide into the first turn, made a four wide middle move to prompt the winner on the turn three wide and then was empty.
LEA COSTA ME was void of early speed, advanced five wide on the turn and had no late rally. ULTIMATE DECISION chased the pace three wide and
stopped. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the start, but after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS left the race as is.

WAY RITE was off a step slow, reserved early, swung out four wide leaving the turn and closed well to get up in time under a drive. FLOWER POWER
tracked the early pace and made a inside bid leaving the turn and led late but was denied late to just miss. ATHENA'S STORM tracked the early pace and
made a three wide bid leaving the turn to go on even terms for command but flattened out late, bested rest. PREMEDITATED LILY was allowed to settle
three wide, came five wide into the lane and had a mild late kick but needed more. EVIL TEMPTATION was reserved on the inside and had no kick. ARIA
APERTA set the pace in the two path, headed leaving the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GREY STORM was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move on the turn and drew off in the lane to prove much the best, driving. I'M A COOL CAT
was four wide into the first turn, made a four wide middle move to take over entering the turn, then dropped down to the two path and was headed by the
winner on the turn, could not go with that rival, second best. HA HA FOR YOU was off a step slow, chased the early pace and made a inside bid on the
backstretch but weakened, held show award. THIRSTY ECHO set the pace in the two path, then was headed nearing the half mile marker and weakened.
WEST TEXAS COWBOY prompted the pace four wide and tired. EVIL ROCKS prompted the early pace in between rivals and stopped.

TIZ MY HOUR pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and slowly edged clear leaving the turn and remained clear to prove
best, driving. ZIVA DA'VID was reserved early, five wide on the turn and rallied well late to gain the place award. ROCKIN MARIE set a pressured pace on
the inside, dueled for command on the turn and gave way grudgingly in the lane. INDIAN EXCELLENCE chased the pace on the inside, eased out on the
turn and came three wide into the lane and had no kick. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane and weakened.
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was reserved early on the inside and had no rally. SHAKE RAG failed to respond.
