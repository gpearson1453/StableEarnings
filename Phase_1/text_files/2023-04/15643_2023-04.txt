Footnotes
ANGELCENTS sprinted clear early and opened up a comfortable advantage, remained well in front along the rail through the turn, put to right-handed
urging in the lane, weakened a bit late but was able to hold on. OVER ATTRACTED broke a step slow, unhurried in the early going, raced two wide into the
turn then a bit off the rail, angled outside rival in upper stretch, flew late in the final sixteenth and just missed. READY JET GO broke a step slow, chased
outside a rival then cleared that foe and moved to the inside around the turn, took aim while tipped out into the stretch but finished evenly in the final furlong.
TAKE A LEAP came out a bit at the start, settled off the pace, rounded the bend two wide, drifted out from the left-handed in upper stretch, kept on through
the final furlong but needed to find more. AUNT OPAL chased along the rail inside a rival into the turn, got put in tight past the three-eighths pole and lost
ground, continued to save ground to the stretch and weakened. LITTLE RACHEL saved ground off the pace and failed to menace. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL
bobbled a bit leaving the gate, trailed on the inside into the turn, exited the bend two wide and never threatened. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CLOONEY chased two wide through the first turn, remained off the rail in the middle stages then angled in for the far turn, gained while saving ground
through that bend, rallied inside GOLDEN SOMBRERO next to the fence and drove past late. GOLDEN SOMBRERO took control from inside, set the pace
with LOOKS RARE applying pressure, tried to shake free in the middle stages but could not, dueled past the quarter pole and maintained a short lead two
wide into the stretch, bumped with LOOKS RARE in upper stretch, continued to battle with a slim lead in the final furlong, finally put away outer rival but
could not fend off the rail rally from CLOONEY late. BLUE DOG bobbled slightly at the start, stalked in the three path early, went two wide into the far turn,
spun four wide into the stretch, rallied five deep in the drive, drifted inward in the final furlong and gained the show. EXCEL CALCULATOR found a good
spot inside stalking the pace, tipped three wide leaving the far turn, launched a bid four deep entering the furlong grounds, got floated in by BLUE DOG and
got edged for the show. LOOKS RARE pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader with a quarter mile remaining, drifted in and bumped that foe in
upper stretch, kept the pressure on to the sixteenth pole then faltered late. MUCINO chased along the three path early, trailed two wide on the second bend,
steered out in the lane and failed to menace.

DORIS MAE set the pace two wide into the turn, remained clear along the rail into the stretch and drew off under hand urging in the drive. BIG SHAMROCK
broke out, stalked three deep into the turn, took aim two wide entering the stretch, could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to secure
the place. SATURDAY HEIST stalked in-hand early, saved ground while chasing inside BIG SHAMROCK through the turn, asked in the drive but flattened
in the late stages. VELLA stalked off the rail into the turn, lost ground two then three wide while between rivals on the bend and faded in the lane.
SQUARED SHADY unhurried in the early going, took the turn three then four wide and lacked a rally. SHE'S A JOKER broke slow from inside, raced along
the rail then two wide on the turn and also failed to rally.

in to bother rivals at the half-mile marker, went three wide around the bend, shifted in briefly in upper stretch and held the show. ANNIE'S JOY stalked
behind the leaders on the inside into the turn, tipped two wide around the bend, moved back inward and churned on from the fence to miss the show.

steered out in the stretch and showed a mild response to improve placings. LULU LEMON DROP broke a step slow on the inside, settled early, traveled
along the rail then angled out on the turn and failed to threaten. IRISH ROSE tracked three deep then got forced in and bumped near the half-mile pole, ran

HONEYMOON SUITE showed good early speed to establish the front, kicked clear on the inside around the bend, then drew off under mild urging in the
lane and was kept to task to the line. CURLY ESA broke a step slow, dropped back then gained up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, drifted
out while closest in pursuit in the drive and had to settle for second best. QUICK INTRO chased between rivals early, three then two wide on the turn and
lacked a bid. MYSTIC TBILISI shifted in at the start, tracked five deep up the backstretch, angled down to the two path around the bend, steered out into the
stretch and lacked a rally. OLYMPIC LEGEND chased off the rail then outside the leader into the turn, lost ground in the two path then between rivals
around the bend and faded. LAMPY broke a step slow, chased four then three wide on the turn and lacked further response. FEROCIOUSLY stumbled

LONG MAYSHE REIGN took control quickly, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, drew away in upper stretch and was never challenged. MAGIC
GAME bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and summoned a mild rally to best the rest.
TIMELY LUCK hit the gate to bobble a bit at the start, stalked the pacesetter between rivals early, saved ground through the turn, lacked the needed late
punch in the stretch but held the show. BOLD CHOICE tracked five deep early, went three to four wide around the turn and could not rally. SQUARE FUN
brushed leaving the gate, stalked outside rivals early, spun three wide into the lane and flattened out. ISABEL LUDLOW was off slow to begin and lost her
path, raced outside a rival off the pace into the turn, ran into traffic and angled out around the bend, drifted inward in the lane and could not summon the
needed response. LOVE OUR FAMILY bumped with inner rival in the beginning, stalked on the inside then was asked two wide on the bend but weakened
in the stretch. BIG UPDATE brushed at the start, stalked four deep early, two to three wide on the turn and faded. WARRIOR LADY broke slow, saved
ground on the inside and came up empty. TAP IN NINE broke slow and never got involved.

Footnotes
SUNRISE JOURNEY cleared quickly with a sharp break, led under confident handling through the turn near the rail, was roused in upper stretch, urged
right-handed in the furlong grounds and held safely. TIGRE DI SLUGO was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased two wide around the bend, could
not threaten the winner but regain the place from RED FLAG late. RED FLAG chased four wide into the turn, three wide leaving the bend, drifted out in the
lane and lost the place. HOWBEIT got bumped on both sides at the start, tracked five then four wide around the turn and lacked a rally. MASTERING
bumped with HOWBEIT at the start, tracked from inside into the turn, drifted out into and upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. COLT FICTION
stumbled badly and bumped at the start, chased outside a rival then suffered a mild shuffle on the turn, continued off the rail into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ATOMIC DROP took the lead early and moved inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground on the front-end through the far
turn, put to right-handed urging in the final furlong and held safely. CLUB CAL broke a step slow from the outside, sat off the pace in the two path, waited
two wide and between rivals on the far turn, angled out into the stretch, put a late run and closed the gap on the winner. TALKLESSWORKMORE stumbled
leaving the gate, was forwardly placed in the two path, closest in pursuit near the inside into the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane, lacked the needed late
punch in deep stretch and lost the place. WORSE READ SANCHEZ was antsy in the gate, broke a bit slow then settled inside off the pace, saved ground to
the stretch, kept on through the lane and rounded out the superfecta. SUNSHINE BABE stumbled at the start, raced on the inside near the back, trailed into
the stretch, tried to rally but found traffic in the lane, angled out to a clear path and improved placings. SHORTMAN was off slow to begin, steered to the rail
at the back then ran two wide around the first turn, traveled three wide into the far turn, angled five wide with a quarter mile remaining and could not
threaten. MAMBA COOL had to steady behind a rival early, stalked in the two path, raced between rivals on the far turn, three wide into the stretch and
flattened. ORTH broke a step slow, stalked from inside then started to pull on the first turn and early on the backstretch, came two wide into the drive and
weakened. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH stalked three deep early on, started to weaken three wide on the far turn and faded in the drive. MISCHIEVOUS PATH
tracked three wide early, chased four deep at the quarter pole, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and weakened.
