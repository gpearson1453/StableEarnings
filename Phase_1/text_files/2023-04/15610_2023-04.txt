BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR dueled for the lead from the inside with ANNIES BOY, disposed of that rival after going a half and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. DEPARTURE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with a steady
bid. ARHAM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. TIGER DAD was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. GRAY MAGICIAN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and did
not offer a bid. ANNIE'S BOY was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

ARMAVEER stalked the pace of PHILLPIE FAST while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards to be going
away late. PHILIPIE FAST sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not hold the
winner safe late. KEENEYE GEORGE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. ABRIERWIN
was forwardly placed from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. SHADYFIED lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and
did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

TRY TO CAPTURE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved in tandem with DIAMOND BLITZ to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with that rival
and drew off through the final furlong. MARK YE WELL lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with
good late energy. DIAMOND BLITZ was reserved just off the leaders while racing from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with the winner nearing the
quarter, vied with that foe and gave way through the final furlong. LAST RENEGADE showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. FASCINATED sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. FREESTONE showed brief speed

Footnotes
MI REYNA was away in good order to duel for the lead with MISTY MATT from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and was fully
extended to hold EVEN PANDURA off by a diminishing margin. EVEN PANDURA lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was gaining on
the winner late. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. RED VENUS pressed
the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. MISTY MATT disputed the pace from between foes
and gave way through the final furlong. RAGING LADY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
MONGOL ALTAI dueled for the lead with MR LOVE MUFFIN while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by BARNFIELD and held that rival safe
to gamely prevail. BARNFIELD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished
with a steady bid. BEL RAGAZZO lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
with good energy. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE broke sharply then raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a
contending position but failed to gain late. ETU BABOU was away alertly to race four-wide through the first turn, pressed the pace while racing four-wide
and gave way through the final furlong. MR LOVE MUFFIN disputed the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way through the
final furlong. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MISTER MAFIOSO set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, responded when challenged in mid-stretch and
re-cleared through the closing yards. ALCAZABA (IRE) was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and was up for the
place. THE GOLDEN EGG settled off the leaders early, raced from off the rail through the turn and finished with good energy. MR. DISRESPECTFUL was
off a step slow, moved up for a contending position before going a quarter, saved ground through the turn, reached the winner in mid-stretch but could not
get by that rival in the drive. BIG WAY lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LOTSA SKY was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not menace. COME ON AMP pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
CROWN PROSECUTOR was off a step slow, lagged far back early and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
