Footnotes
HOT DAME moved clear to set the pace inside on or just off the rail, extended the margin over the field along with the nearest pursuer past the half-mile
marker, came out a bit turning for home, was challenged and just headed near the eighth pole, drifted out a bit in the stretch but dug in to regain control and
edge clear. SEAWARD stalked the winner two to three wide early, followed that one to widen on the rest of the field late up the backstretch, drifted out a bit
in upper stretch, bid near the furlong marker putting a very short head in front briefly but was only second best. DIALED INNA shifted in from three to two
wide on the first turn and nearer the rail for the run up the backstretch in pursuit mid-pack, lost ground late up the backstretch, began to pick it up on the far
turn while gradually shifting out five wide by the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. RONAN bobbled very slightly at the start, settled outside a runner at the
rear two wide into the first turn, moved to the rail on the far turn, was never able to menace the leaders. JULIAISON bobbled ever so slightly at the start,
chased from outside three to four wide, dropped back and faded. A REAL HERO was just a bit rank into the first turn racing inside, was not a factor.

Footnotes
STAR NATION eased back and tucked in three then two wide on the first turn off the leaders, pulled against the rider keenly past the five-eighths to advance
inside just off the leader, switched out at the half and went three to four wide on the far turn coming five deep to the top of the stretch, gained steadily and
forged clear through the final sixteenth. MINNESOTA MOON set the pace racing on or just off the rail, faced pressure up the backstretch and into the far
turn, was clear coming to mid-stretch but challenged at that juncture and outkicked. GO BERTI stumbled at the start, was caught five wide into the first turn
then moved in a bit, continued racing off the pace two to three wide on the far turn, moved a bit nearer the rail in the stretch and fought on to secure show
honors while no match for the top pair. ANCIENT MAN lacked early speed bringing up the rear, moved out to be four wide into the far turn fanned six deep
into upper stretch, thereupon shifted in to be three wide and outside a rival and kicked on mildly. MINING CAMP moved forward four wide on the first turn
and rapidly advanced early up the backstretch to press outside two to three wide, floated wider for the drive still in range but weakened thereafter. CHERRY
ORCHARD raced up close early two wide, began to drop back steadily, was not persevered with in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LATIN CASINO was coaxed forward at the start, set the pace, saved ground on the turn along the rail, shook off rivals and drew clear in the stretch under
steady handling. ALEBRIJE broke outwardly, advanced three to four wide on the turn, engaged a rival to duel for the place and got the nod. LAKE MILLS
pursued the winner two wide, could not kick on with that one, dueled for second but missed. STAR OF KODIAK was reserved early while kept quite wide up
the backstretch, made a rapid move outside four to five wide on the turn to reach contention but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. STALLONE
raced outside a foe at the rear two to three wide through the turn and was not a threat. GAME BOY BENNY chased from inside on or just off the rail, made
no late bid.

MEMPHIS PRAYER was reserved inside off the early pace, came out beginning on the far turn and was about five wide with aim in upper stretch, lugged in
while taking the lead in mid-stretch, dueled late and prevailed. ARROW STRIKE raced in back of the leading pair off the rail in the two to three path, began
to advanced leaving the far turn coming into upper stretch four deep then shifted back in, ground on to bid inside in mid-stretch but was outfinished. GO
FOR IT moved forward outside the leader early up the backstretch to prompt the pace, let that one run on with the lead then again advanced to apply
pressure taking a narrow lead early on the far turn, drifted out into the stretch, dueled, kept on to get show honors. OVER CALENDARED set the pace
shifting in, was pressured up the backstretch, dueled in the stretch while drifting out, was in tight nearing the sixteenth pole as a rival came in, missed show.
IZEONDEC was caught four to five wide in the early going, moved nearer inside to save some ground on the far turn into upper stretch, came out at that
juncture and ran on. FATHER PATRICK was forced out entering the first turn, raced four then three wide on that bend, continued three to four wide on the
far turn, altered inside a rival in upper stretch, was unable to menace. TEA WITH LEMON appeared to clip then jump over a rivals' heels and outward nearly
unseating the rider heading into the first turn, keenly moved forward three wide soon after, went three to five wide late and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE HALF-MILE AND THREE-QUARTER-MILE FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE.

WHERE'D THE DAY GO switched outside the leader into the first turn, moved forward on that one three wide to press the pace beginning near the
three-quarter pole, took over outside the three-eighths, was clear into upper stretch and kept to the task. POWERFUL MAN was forwardly-placed stalking
four deep, kept on evenly but was second best. FLASHY RICHIE shifted in racing mid-pack two to three wide, ran on, held show honors. DEORA STORE
saved ground inside early racing just off the leaders mid-pack, came out two then three wide on the far turn, needed more in the lane. ZARMAE settled near
but just off the rail racing toward the back, swung out turning for home then angled outside foes eight deep in upper stretch and improved position. SON OF
GRACE raced up close but off the leaders five to six wide, kept on one-paced. CHOCOLATE BUNNY moved clear and shifted in to the two path to set the
pace, faced some pressure early up the backstretch, moved clear again midway up the backstretch, was overtaken on the far turn, began to drop back and
angled out five wide at the head of the lane, faded thereafter. GENOMIC broke a step slowly, was outpaced at the rear, not persevered with late and walked
off.

STACY ATTACK moved clear, set the pace inside, held sway under steady handling. BERTRADA settled mid-pack in about the two path, kept on in the
stretch, closed the gap to be second best. MY LADY SLEW chased the winner from outside going two to three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick
while going evenly in the lane. CAIRO SUMMER shifted in, raced at the rear two to three wide on the turn, failed to menace. NIFF failed to threaten racing
inside through the turn and at the back. FIELD DAISEY chased inside, switched out before the turn, raced in the four path coming to the three-eighths,
drifted seven wide into upper stretch, tired.

BLACKTECA bobbled just slightly at the start but recovered to move forward and set the pace, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in mid-stretch while
clear, held sway. BERNIE LOMAX settled off the pace, advanced in the three path on the turn, continued to gain in upper stretch, shifted inside the drifting
leader in mid-stretch and ran on to be second best. CHAD'S FLASH was lightly bumped at the start, raced up close two to three wide and in range turning
for home, ran on evenly in the lane. TIZWOW broke outwardly brushing a foe lightly, settled off the pace, went in the three to four path and improved
position. PERFUMER was brushed at the start, raced mostly three to four wide and improved position. TOM'S LAST GENERAL was bumped into a rival and
squeezed back at the start, raced at the rear, came out three wide for the drive, gained belatedly. SOVIET STANDARD was forwardly-positioned pressing
three to four wide, steadily weakened. K C'S FIRST B M W chased from outside four to five wide through the turn coming out seven to eight deep into upper
stretch, dropped back and faded. PRAIRIE WOLF failed to threaten racing just off the rail. SUNDAY MISCHIEF bumped the outer rival at the start, chased
briefly inside, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
EMPIRE BUILDER had the early lead two to three wide, eased off a rival content to press outside two to three wide, moved clear at will leaving the
backstretch, widened in the lane. PATH TO SUCCESS lacked early speed despite some encouragement from the gate, raced off the pace three wide
through the first turn, advanced three wide and inside other rivals on the far turn, was second best. EVERLOVINGHAND pressed inside the eventual winner
early, switched outside that one going three wide into the far turn, drifted five wide leaving that bend, kept on well enough to hold show honors while not a
late threat for the top prize. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN was unhurried early saving ground on the first turn, moved out and began to pick it up two then three
wide on the far turn, was in tight in upper stretch, lacked room behind runners then altered out at the three-sixteenths, ran on well but too late. MR. SOLO
was up close racing three to four wide, was forced out floating six wide turning for home and ran on. BALADINE raced up close mid-pack outside four to five
wide, made no bid. BEHAVIN MYSELF hit the gate and was away slowly, raced four wide through both turns and was not a threat. BAKENEKO tracked
inside advancing some leaving the backstretch but came up empty for the drive. MISTER CHARMING raced mid-pack in pursuit of the leaders two wide,
dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
FASTNFURIOUS forced the pace from outside, shifted in once clear going in the two path on the turn, drew off under steady urging and was given just
hand-urging through the final sixteenth. GUST OF WIND was in just a bit tight along the inside late up the backstretch, moved outside foes at the rear into
the turn, swung six wide for the drive, hit his best stride late. ROCKET MAN ATTACK was bumped at the break, vied inside briefly then continued to chase,
saved ground, needed more. SMOOTH ATTACK bumped the inside rival at the start, stalked the leading trio in the three to four path, lugged in a bit in the
stretch but kept on evenly. READY MADE was bumped into a rival at the start, had brief speed between runners early, continued to chase three wide,
weakened. NORMANDY ANGEL shifted in heading to the turn, saved ground, failed to menace. ADDIE'S PEACHES was fractious in the gate, bumped
sideways into a rival at the start then steadied and was shuffled back, went three to four wide on the turn, was not a threat. SULLY'S BARRON was a bit
hard to load, raced toward the back going in the two to three path on the turn and was not a factor.
