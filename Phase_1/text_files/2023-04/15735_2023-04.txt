and went clear under steady handling. JUDGE'S BRIBE rallied four wide to bid into the far turn and lead through that bend then could not handle the winner
in the lane. FOR REEL was along the inside to late backstretch, moved four wide in the far turn but could not close on the top pair while best of the others. L
B GOLD failed to mount a rally three and four wide while improving position. KENHEDOIT contested the early lead inside the winner and tired. MR. BIG

the leader in sight before reaching the far turn, wore that one down through the lane and was up late. CHARACTER COUNTS inherited a wide early lead as
the nearest pursuers were carried, carried the lead into the lane and was worn down late by the winner. HAPPY QUEST moved up four wide going to the far
turn then could not close ground in the lane. EXODUS AND HOPE angled five wide into the lane and moved up but could not close ground. MISS GRAND
SLAM was also carried wide in the first turn and dropped back, settled four wide and had no rally. SMILIN JOSIE was not a threat three wide. SPITFIRE
