MINE THAT STAR pressed the early pace, was eased back along the backstretch, loomed five wide through the second turn, took control at the quarter
pole, angled in and edged clear. ZESTFUL was allowed to settle early, angled out six wide through the second turn, was no match late and finished second
best. LIMONITE set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the turns, drifted out late and weakened. SHERIFF BROWN was unhurried early, raced
seven wide out of the second turn and offered no late rally. LOOKING FOR BULL was void of any speed, raced eight wide out of the second turn and was
no factor.

Footnotes
FIRST AGAIN tracked the early pace, raced six wide through the turn, took control late and edged clear. ANOTHERBIKINIMODEL chased the early pace,
raced between rivals through the turn, drifted in through the stretch, took a brief lead and was no match late and finished second best. ART CURATOR
raced in mid pack early, went seven wide and was along for third. HIGH DOLLAR HUSH set a pressured early pace from off the rail and tired. SHAME ON
CHARLOTTE was reserved early, went eight wide and was empty. MARKING'S MIRACLE stalked the early pace, went three wide and gave way. DANDY
MONEY was void of any early speed, raced eight wide and offered no late rally. MY SISTER was unhurried early, went four wide and never fired.
RUTHLESS MONEY was outrun early, raced nine wide and was no factor. PERFECTLY PUNCTUAL was void of speed and was no threat. CHARLIENE
was allowed to settle from between rivals and retreated.
