EXCELLENT MARK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn, switched to
the inside in upper stretch, gained ground while drifting in mildly and got up for the win late. ABE HONESTLY led the field up the backstretch, continued to
show the way from the two path coming around the bend and dueled down the lane, getting caught in the final strides. SIDNEY'S BID raced in the middle of
the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. DUN RIGHT chased
the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. TEDDY'S HONOR
raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid. R D BLESSING trailed the field throughout, saved ground

Footnotes
PRETTY'N AWESOME stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, launched a bid in upper stretch and got
up for the win late. DREAM CONCERT led the way up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and was caught in the final strides. BELMAR
SUMMER raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the four path and gained ground mildly in the stretch while never threatening the top two.
PRINCESS CHESSIE chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the two path and was
outkicked in the lane. DEVRA WARRIOR tracked the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and
continued to fade from there. WISHIN N KISSIN trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.

and gained ground mildly in the stretch. MISTA DONZELLA raced inside in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to save ground
around the far bend and finished evenly. CHESS'S DREAM saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path and weakened in the lane. MR. SARCASTIC raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
between horses, swung out to the five path for the run around the second bend and showed no kick. MARQUET MALICE raced in the three path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the four path and was outkicked in the stretch. HOLD THE

Footnotes
KING CAIRO stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained
ground on the rail in upper stretch, kicked clear and held that margin to the wire. SAN COSTANTINO hopped up and bumped with the horse to his outside
leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the bend and gained ground late. OMATI
led the way on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the two path around the turn and chased on to the finish. UNFLAPPABLE MAX
tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and kept on to the finish. TONY SMALL bumped with the
horse to his inside at the break, raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three path and improved position in the lane while never threatening.
SAVAGE chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and weakened from there. FIERCE WARRIOR
raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane.
