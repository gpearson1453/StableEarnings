FOOLISH INTENT showed the most early speed to gain inside position through the first turn, made the running on a clear lead and held the margin through
the lane under steady handling. BROWN LIAISON bumped with a rival at the start, chased the winner from three wide and could not close the gap while
clearly best of the others. CLASSIC FAREWELL broke to the outside, chased the top pair from three wide and weakened. MISS GRAND SLAM was
bumped and shuffled back at the break then lacked a rally racing out from the rail. HAPPY QUEST was last away and always outrun.

DE OURO settled in reach of the leaders three wide but could not produce the needed stretch rally. ASHWINS ORB saved ground and lacked a final closing
run. BULL RING was not a threat. R DEJA VOO chased the leaders four wide and gave way through the far turn.

Footnotes
CYCLONE SORORITY saved ground following the early pace of OUR PETUNIA, reeled that one in through the far turn, angled three wide into the lane and
drove clear. OUR PETUNIA showed the most early speed to cross over and gain inside position, made the pace to the far turn then could not handle the
winner in the lane. HIGH COST OF LIVIN stalked the top pair three wide and had no rally. S C ANGEL moved up four wide while not a threat. MAGIC IN A
HAT was not a factor along the inside. STERN bobbled after the start and failed to threaten two to three wide. CANDY ANNE followed the pace four wide
and tired. UNTETHERED SOUL was always back.

COLD SNACK THIRTY stalked the leaders four wide through the turn, rallied in the lane and went clear under steady handling. EXPECT ROYAL was just
off the pace three wide, rallied between rivals in the lane and bobbled nearing the wire and just gained the place. DAVE vied outside rivals through the turn
and was outfinished for position late. GETTINHOT'NHERE was on the lead inside rivals and came up empty late. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER was along the
inside and lacked a final closing run. DRYSPELL closed some ground two or three wide but could not threaten late. ZCAT'S CHATAIN was not a factor wide
into the lane. NEW GOSPEL weakened from three wide.
