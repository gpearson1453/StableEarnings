TROPHY DADDY raced near the back on the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole and moving out to four wide in upper stretch
and cruised by the leader for the win. SHARP CHARLIE was away alertly to go to the front to set the pace but was collared in the final furlong while tiring.
CHIEF CHARLIE tracked the leaders from the two path then angled out at the three eighths pole to be up for the show. NUGGET OF GRACE saved ground
to no avail. MO VODKA was off the pace in the two or three path to the top of the stretch and weakened. HALF A BUCK had no speed and was never a
factor. SLOW was forwardly placed to the half pole and dropped back.

Footnotes
LA TRESS GRAY was roused to the lead, dueled from between horses around the turn then shook loose at the quarter pole and drew clear to prove best.
SASSY EMMA was off the pace around the turn then made a four or five wide late run and it was too late but was able to be up for the place.
MYDEALOFTHEDAY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the turn then angled out at the top of the stretch, fought gamely to the wire but
missed the place. JACKS RUN WILD hopped at the start then chased the field to the top of the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DREAM ON IT dueled for
the lead from three wide to the three eighths pole and weakened. LIL ADEAU was hustled along to duel for the lead from the inside to the quarter pole and
gave way. DOLLY'S GUITAR tracked the leaders from off the rail, made a bid on the turn and hung.

Footnotes
RUN ON ACES was forwardly placed down the backstretch then took the lead on the final turn and held off the challenge from SWEET PRESENT and
STEP ON IT in the final furlong to prove best. SWEET PRESENT was unsettled in the gate then was allowed to settle around the first turn, moved up from
three wide on the backstretch then moved in exiting the final turn to make a rail bid entering the stretch drive, angled back out and fought gamely but was
second best. STEP ON IT was restless in the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside down the backstretch then moved up on the final turn then
moved out to three or four wide in the stretch tom make a late gain to be up for show. MY PAL SWEET was within striking distance down the backstretch
and around the final turn but gave way. ASTERN BANKER raced wide throughout and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. ALWAYS LOGAN raced in the
middle of the pack from the two path but was never a threat. LET'S GO RANDOM pinched back early, then settled in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch made a mild bid from four wide on the final turn to vie for the lead but tired. FIGHTING SOLDIER was roused to the lead and set most of the
pace to the final turn and stopped.

WENDY WILECAT pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch then took command on the final turn and drew off. BOSTON LUCILLE was
unhurried down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn and flattened out. THE GREY BEAUTY raced in the middle of the pack to the turn
then made a mild bid but was no match for the top two. KAPPA HILL was unhurried and never a threat. SUNSHINE STAR had brief early foot then tracked
the leaders down the backstretch then retreated. ENOUGH HEART was hustled up the rail to take the lead to the middle of the turn and weakened.

BINDING AGREEMENT was hustled along to be within striking distance down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn to take the lead at the
top of the stretch while drifting out but was able to hold on for the win. SECRET VISTA raced back down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the
turn, had to move in at the top of the stretch but fought gamely to be second best. HOME VISIT raced in the middle of the pack from the inside then dropped
back going into the turn then made a rebid at the quarter pole, moved between horses and was gamely for the show. GOLDEN PALACE raced near the
back down the backstretch then moved up on the turn, angled out to six wide in the stretch for a late rally but was not enough. X CLOWN vied for the lead
early from the inside then was allowed to settle around the turn, made a rebid in the stretch moving between horses to improve his position. JEB'S LUCKY
EIGHT saved ground to no avail. DOCTOR LEO was forwardly placed while going four wide on the turn but lacked the late response. LAURI'S WISH was

Footnotes
MOONLIGHTMADDY was rushed to the lead under pressure to the turn then edged away and drew off in the stretch to prove best. TDZ CORRIENDA
STAR was rushed up to be forwardly placed into the turn then was game in the stretch holding off the outside challenge to hold on to the place. SILK NOT
SATIN tracked the leaders to the turn then moved out on the turn to make a late bid to be best of the rest. PERIPHERAL VISION raced four or five wide
around the turn then angled in to the rail at the three sixteenths pole for a late run but only improved position. SUNSET FLASH was off the pace from four
wide early then dropped back and passed tired ones in the stretch. VALERIE LOUISE had no early speed then made a mild rail bid into the turn moved out
to three or four wide in upper stretch but was not a factor. STARRY STARRY DAY raced in the middle of the pack early then faded around the turn and
passed tired ones in the stretch. LACEY'S STAR raced near the back through the turn then went five wide in the stretch but didn't make a bid. KELLIE MAE
was forwardly placed to the turn and tired. DAISY DE ORO was off a step slow, settled in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. A. P. STYLE pressed
the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and gave way.
