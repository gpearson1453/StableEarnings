Footnotes
RAISE YOUR GAME lacked speed, raced two wide around the turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside EPICUREAN,
led late and drove clear. EPICUREAN dueled outside LILLY SIMONE around the turn, went clear in hand in upper stretch, drifted out late and failed to hold
sway. PROTECTTHEWITNESS , in the two path around the turn, rallied between horses. BRAMBLE BUSH raced along the inner rail throughout and failed
to rally. MINER'S GEM raced along the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, eased out in mid stretch and was not a factor. LILLY SIMONE , racing
without hind shoes, showed good speed, hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace around the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
RED WINE TIME , reluctant to load, hesitated at the break spotting the field about three lengths, found herself far back of the embattled pair up front, was
under strong ride gathering steam leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch, shifted out wider past the three sixteenths, made a grinding run
under left handed asks and on her left lead and forged ahead in the final yards. WATER WITCH , outrun early while saving ground, was put to strong urging
past the five eighths, gained towards the rail past the five sixteenths, swung out five wide soon into the lane, rallied outside to collar the leader near the
sixteenth pole, gained a short lead between runners soon after, kept on gamely but just could not hold off the winner's charge. RATIONALMILLENNIAL
tracked the dueling leaders while saving ground, eased out nearing the far turn, bid three wide outside HEARDITALL nearing the three eighths, sparred
outside that one to the quarter pole, was shoved clear in upper stretch, dug in when engaged approaching the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly.
ALWAJD stalked early outside a rival, was under a serious ride mid way on the final turn, dropped inside for the drive but came up empty. BAD TEMPER set
a pressured pace towards the rail, was headed five furlongs out, stayed on into the far turn, eased out with pursuit near the five sixteenths and gave way.
HEARDITALL rushed up early to join BAD TEMPER, pressed outside that one before putting a head in front near the five eighths, was engaged from her
outside leaving the far turn, battled to the inside of RATIONALMILLENIAL to the quarter pole then gave way. SHE SO COOL , well placed in the clear mid
way through the backstretch run, had no response into the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
DANCER'S MELODY gained a three deep lead near the three eighths pole, went clear leaving the turn, remained well off the inner rail, drifted out a bit
inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed under brisk urging. BACKSTREET AFFAIR , between horses on the turn, eased out to the four path leaving the turn
and closed nicely. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF showed speed along the inner rail and gradually faded in the stretch drive. FUNNYBET , three wide on the
turn, moved to the four path approaching the stretch and passed tired horses. MARVELLA NASTY , a forward factor in the two path throughout, chased the
pace and weakened. CONGRESS HALL , four wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. RAVENEL , four deep leaving the backstretch, moved to the three
path on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. RED QUEEN was not a factor. MS. MALEVOLENCE raced inside horses down the backstretch and on the
turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ROMP rated forwardly outside rivals, edged closer under some coaxing leaving the far turn, bid three deep approaching the quarter pole, gained a slim
advantage dueling outside CHELONIAN leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed asks soon after, had his rider put the stick away for the
final furlong and dug in tenaciously under a solid hand ride to preserve the score. CHELONIAN prompted the pace two wide outside PHRA PHROM, moved
alongside near the three eighths, battled between foes leaving the five sixteenths, emerged in a battle to the inside of the winner in upper stretch, fought
valiantly from there and was able to save the place. DOWN COLD steadied off heels nearing the backstretch, shifted out and stalked between runners,
dropped back after steadying near the three furlong marker, regrouped to advance between runners into the stretch, angled out and came back on with
good energy to gain. THE ADDISON POUR broke a step slow, steadied off heels while wide into the backstretch, remained wide into the far turn, was
floated out near the three eighths and came up empty through the lane. PHRA PHROM took over between runners into the first turn, dropped in and set the
pace, held a clear lead past the five eighths, dug in when joined by CHELONIAN exiting the far turn, sparred to the head of the lane then gave way.
GOLDEN PEGASUS checked off the leader's heels approaching the backstretch, regrouped to track towards the rail, lost his rider when sustaining a
catastrophic injury leaving the far turn then was euthanized on the track. There was a stewards' inquiry. No action was taken.

Footnotes
ALPHA CHI RHO , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained a short lead outside ARISTOCRATIC in upper stretch then drew out under steady
handlling. GREAT DAYS AHEAD , unhurried down the backstretch raced in the two path on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, angled back in in upper
stretch and rallied. HE HATE ME lacked speed, circled horses on the turn, was fanned wide approaching the stretch and rallied outside horses.
ARISTOCRATIC accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, drifted out in mid
stretch and weakened. BACKATYA chased the pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened. YES SIR ROBERT lacked speed, checked and
swung outside the pulled up horse near the half mile pole then failed to be a factor. CHARGE TO VICTORY , fractious in the starting gate, circled the turn
three wide, chased the pace to upper stretch and gave way. BIGMANCAN pulled up lame leaving the backstretch and was vanned off. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.

Footnotes
ABOVE THE LIMIT was nudged from the gate and accelerated clear after a sixteenth of a mile, eagerly moved away into the turn and set the pace under a
light hold, increased her advantage after being shaken up in upper stretch, was kept alert with some left handed asks in mid stretch then maintained a
comfortable lead to the wire. AMANI'S IMAGE , sluggish from the gate, settled well back, raced two wide and between runners past the three eighths,
remained between horses while advancing through the drive and kept on with good energy to earn the place. AFANDI , towards the inside leaving the far
turn, eased out, edge up between horses in mid stretch and kept on willingly outside AMANI'S IMAGE. AWESOME JAZZ was lightly steadied saving ground
into the turn, eased out around a foe nearing the stretch, dropped back towards the rail and kept on with interest. QUEEN SHEBA , well placed tracking
behind foes, worked outward but lacked a serious finish. CAROLINA SUN drifted out at the break and was away last, was hung out wide outside rivals
leaving the far turn, angled seven wide for the drive and had belated interest. THISNAMEISOKAY , three wide around the turn, angled out and came up
empty. SPOOKY SPICE , four deep nearing the turn while appearing to want to get out, shifted out wider for the drive and faded. KILBRITTAIN'S RED
flashed speed, raced in closest pursuit around the turn, came two wide for the drive, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. MURPH had some speed
three wide between runners, chased three wide into the stretch and steadily dropped back. GAVINERA showed speed, gave futile chasing saving ground
into the stretch and faltered through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R bumped GALERIO when bearing out at the break, raced in the two path down the backstretch, was asked near the three eighths pole, swung
four wide leaving the turn, closed determinedly outside horses and was up near the finish. GALERIO bobbled then was bumped leaving the starting gate,
circled the first turn three wide while eagerly to run, raced three wide around the far turn, closed between horses to bid for the lead inside the sixteenth pole
and just missed. EXCELLORATOR assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, finished willingly but was not quite good enough. WISH FOR
PEACE chased the pace two wide, gained a short lead in the stretch and weakened late. TORCH OF TRUTH raced along the inner rail until angled out
inside the sixteenth pole and showed a mild, late gain.

Footnotes
TENAX got into a battle to the inside of BOSS MAN JJ soon after the break, came out a bit into the lane, kept on under right handed asks past mid stretch,
wrested command in deep stretch and held firm. BOSS MAN J J sped to a short lead outside rivals in the opening sixteenth, sparred to the outside of the
winner into and around the turn, maintained a slim advantage while about four wide past mid stretch, continued gamely but just could not hold through the
final yards. PRINCE PERE moved up outside runners early on, gained a perfect tracking spot off the duel, shifted out in upper stretch, gave hard chase past
mid stretch, switched over to his left lead leaving the sixteenth marker and came up empty. MARATHONER had speed then rated back off the top pair,
saved ground into the turn, steadied soon after, regrouped to make a mild inside run past mid stretch then flattened out. SHELLY ISLAND , between rivals
early, eased back off foes then chased outside a rival, came three to four wide into the lane and churned on. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND , roughed up at the
break, trailed into the turn, raced between rivals into the stretch, angled out past the quarter pole and had some mild late interest. E. P. MILTON , bumped
and put in tight at the break, raced in the two path mid turn and lacked a bid. HIGHLAND DREAM came out at the break and was jostled, saved ground off
the pace and lacked a rally. SOUTHERN LAD drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, was taken wide, pursued around the turn then dropped back in
upper stretch.
