Footnotes
READY MADE rated on the front end from inside, moved to a clear advantage when asked leaving the bend then steadily opened up under urging in the
lane to prove much the best. LAGRUE forwardly placed early, saved ground taking the turn and took over second with a sixteenth to go. LIMA ZULU vied for
the lead outside READY MADE, could not keep up leaving the bend and slowly wore down through the stretch. SOHAN crowded briefly at the start, was
soon well back, saved ground and showed late interest in the lane. MISSOURI GENT hustled from the beginning, began to fade from outside on the turn.

handling. WARNING LABEL chased from inside, angled out on the bend, came five wide into the stretch, closed well but was a bit short. WINDIGO SPIRIT
was hustled to contest the pace outside HE'S A FINE MAN, moved ahead on the turn, did not have enough left to hold back EVIDENCE in the stretch and
drifted out late. LAYTON THE DAY angled in entering the turn, swung out for room leaving the bend, was four wide entering the lane and began to level off.
HE'S A FINE MAN displayed early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing three furlongs. GEORGE'S VISION showed little.

ROAD GAME crowded briefly at the break, shared the early lead between rivals, took the rail on the bend, moved clear under urging upper stretch and
gradually lengthened command under steady handling. PRINCE OF MAYHEM vied for the lead outside ROAD GAME, could not stay with that one when set
down for the drive, began to wear down between rivals late but lasted for the place. PEACOCK MAN in the second flight early, advanced three wide on the
turn and shook free for third inside the last eighth. FIXICO broke outward, picked up his pace four wide through the bend and showed some interest from
outside the last furlong. BAM BAM CAM in contention from inside, gave way for the drive. R H SMOAKEM made a small leap from the gate, brushed with
ROAD GAME, displayed early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing two furlongs.

Footnotes
VIOLENZA D'ORO kept close, was two wide on the bend, fanned out to path four entering the stretch, altered outside FAITHFUL RULER near the eighth
pole, steadily angled out to stay clear of the latter in the late going and edged ahead in the waning yards. FAITHFUL RULER moved to the outside early on,
went for the lead on the turn, came into the lane from path three, moved ahead as he gradually drifted out, was challenged inside the last furlong as he
continued to drift, was outfinished but caught BEEASY for the place nearing the wire. BEEASY hustled to a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the
bend, did not relent in the lane, lacked the extra kick needed but was easily best of the others. SHANGHAI SILVER in the second flight between rivals,
began to yield three wide on the turn. SNOOZER saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S HONOR rated on the front end from inside, was roused with two furlongs to go, shook free of CESSO inside the last eighth and was kept to
task to near the wire. CESSO was hustled to contest the pace outside GHAALEB'S HONOR, did not have enough left the final furlong but was clearly
second best. PRIMITY in the second flight early between horses, was three wide on the bend, lost some ground staying outside SHINE DOWN entering the
lane but caught the latter for third nearing the wire. DRAGONFLY KISSES prominent from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, came
widest into the stretch and rallied belatedly the final eighth. SHINE DOWN forwardly placed just off the inside, floated out some into the lane, moved clear
for third upper stretch but began to wear down in the waning yards.

Footnotes
ONE PUTT RICHIE pressed UPBEAT MELODY from just outside, went for the lead on the bend, was carried out by the latter into the lane and through the
stretch as he battled for the lead then edged clear in the waning yards. TONYS MORNING LINE advanced widest on the turn, lost further ground fanning to
the middle of the track for the drive, closed well and caught UPBEAT MELODY for second. UPBEAT MELODY set the early pace from inside, was
challenged on the turn, floated out some into the lane, gradually drifted out and did not have enough left inside the last eighth. LATIN CASINO kept close
from inside, angled out on the bend, lost ground fanning to path six entering the stretch and could not close the gap the final furlong. TAP'S BIG SHOT in
contention early, was boxed in from path three on the turn, moved to the inside into the lane and flattened out. MAC PANDOWDY chased from off the rail,
angled to the outside upper stretch and lacked a significant bid.

Footnotes
ICY RIVER soon had the lead, saved ground on the bend, was asked leaving the turn, widened command, began to wear down in the waning yards, floated
out some nearing the wire but held on. SHEZ STUCK UP was boxed in and steadied briefly behind traffic nearing the end of the first furlong, angled out four
wide on the turn, lost further ground floating out entering the lane, took over second inside the final eighth, lugged in some shortly after that and narrowly
missed for the win. AROSE FOR LYLA was settled inside early on, two to three wide taking the bend, gradually angled out for a clear path as she rallied in
the stretch and moved clear for third late. DOCS SEVEN advanced from outside on the backstretch to gain second outside ICY RIVER on the bend but
weakened for the drive. WAY TOO SMARTE lost ground four to six wide through the turn but showed a willingness to run the final eighth. LIFE OF
SATURDAYS well placed from inside, began to gradually yield before finishing a quarter mile. CARSON RESERVE steadied in traffic briefly just after the
break, altered toward the inside, stayed off the rail taking the turn, moved to the outside upper stretch and passed a couple tired rivals. JUST A WONDER in
contention early, faded three wide on the bend. SWEET JUSTICE in traffic early, altered to the inside before finishing the first eighth and steadily yielded
before finishing two furlongs.
