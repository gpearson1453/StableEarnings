Footnotes
RB AFTERBURN was rank early, then was quickly moving up while five wide to duel with an inner rival on the turn, then kicked clear in the stretch and held
on under a strong hand drive. CONSEQUENTLY was well rated in the middle of field, then bid from the four path on the turn, ducked in slightly in the early
stretch then rallied in the final furlong but it wasn't enough in the end. RB BESSTER stalked the pace from the three path, was in a hard drive throughout the
turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly in the end. MY DANDYLION MHF vied for the lead from the four path, then pulled away to duel for the lead
from the inside on the turn, continue to menace in the early stretch then gave way in the end. COLOR ME GONE MHF settled back along the inside into the
turn, then bid mildly in the late stretch but it was too little too late. WIKISPEEDIA settled along the inside into the turn to make a mild bid in the stretch and
was no threat. WMA NORTH WIND was in a hard drive to vie for the lead from the inside into the turn, was used up and flattened out in the stretch. WMA

TRICKSKI'S GOLD tracked the pace in the middle of the field while two wide, then settled back on the turn, angled in the early stretch, dug in gamely to split
rivals in the late stretch and held on confidently to prove best. BOBBIE O raced in the middle of the field while four wide, then bid on the turn to rally in the
stretch and was closing well and was best for second place. PURRFECT MOON chased the pace from the inside into the turn, menaced from the two path
in the early stretch then gave way in the end and held on for show. TENDER LOVE broke inwardly at the start, was unhurried early, then was gaining
ground on the the turn to close well in the stretch but it was too little to make a difference. EMMYLOU SQUALL chased the pace while three wide, then
rallied on the turn before flattening out in the stretch. TALE OF ATREIDES settled along the inside then bid on the turn and was no menace. TRICKY
CARLA dueled from the inside, gained command before heading into the turn, tried to hold onto the lead in the early stretch, but was used up and gave way
in the end. SLIM CAUSEWAY lead the way early, then dueled to keep the lead from the two path, was in hard drive, then hard used and tired throughout the
turn and into the stretch.
