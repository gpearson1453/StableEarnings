Footnotes
BREAKFAST BALL tracked the pace of FOREST ACCLAMATION from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead and
held off the closing LEMON DROP LADY by a diminishing margin. LEMON DROP LADY lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled
out in mid-stretch and was gaining late. JEWEL AZUL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further
nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. PANCAKES AND BEER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. FOREST ACCLAMATION broke sharply to open a long lead and tired after going six furlongs.
SCATALICIOUS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HERSABIGGIRL sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. GEEJAYTEE was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. LUNAR UNIT was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. SENT BY ANGELS settled off the leaders
early, saved ground through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. GARBET was void of early foot, saved ground through the second turn and was
not a factor. SKEDADDLE'S LEGACY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. DONNA'S MISCHIEF was
rank to place, lugged out through the first turn and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
