JACKIE FLASH chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then bid while three wide entering the lane, then menaced gamely down the lane to be up just
in time. CAMARADERIE chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch, was steadily gaining ground to gain the lead entering the stretch, was in
a strong drive but was caught at the wire and was second best. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA settled in the three path, then was urging throughout the turn to close
well in the stretch but it wasn't enough. FROSTY BREW angled in towards the rail to set the pace down the backstretch, then was outbid by an outer rival on
the turn, was used up and gave way in the stretch. HOP ON IN settled along the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the turn but did not respond in the
stretch.

RED BIRD'S STORM was gaining ground steadily from the three path, gained command at the top of the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was ridden
out confidently. RICHARD'S TX BLING was off slowly, then was moving up the rail swiftly, rallied from the two path in the early stretch then closed willingly
to be up for the place prize. JUST HANGIN RIDGE lead the way into the turn, then was outbid by an outer rival heading into the stretch, continued to rally
but was caught in the end for the place position. HIGH DEF RIDGE raced in the middle of the field from the inside, then made a mild bid from the three path
on the turn to close well in the stretch but it wasn't enough. LET'S TIE ONE ON was under a hard drive to press the pace from the two path into the turn,
was used up and weakened in the stretch. SHANGHAI GOLD chased the pace while three wide into the turn, then made a mild bid in the stretch and was

FARM DOG set a pressured pace from the start, was in a long drive then dueled from the inside in the stretch, bumped repeatedly with JOHN LOUIS'BEVO
and held that rival at bay in the final strides. JOHN LOUIS' BEVO was allowed to settled while racing four wide on the backstretch, rallied three wide on the

UNDER THE GUN chased the pace from the inside, was gaining on the turn to duel for the lead from the inside down the early stretch, then dug in gamely
to kick clear in the late stretch prevailing in the end. READY TO ROLL chased the pace while two wide under a steady drive, gained the lead at the quarter
pole, then was confronted by an inner rival down the lane and was out finished in the end. FIRST AVENUE raced in the middle of the field while two wide
into the turn, then menaced in the stretch but came up evenly in the end. REQUISITION tracked the pace along the rail, then rallied while three wide in the
stretch but it was too little too late. BLING'S BELLWETHER settled in the three path down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the turn to bid from the
four path in the stretch and was no threat. DARE TO BE WILD set the pace down the backstretch and into the turn, was used up and faltered in the stretch.
