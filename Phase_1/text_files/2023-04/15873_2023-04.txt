Footnotes
FLAMAND tracked along the inside, closed in on the tiring leader around the far turn, slipped inside of his entering the lane, took a brush before drawing
clear nearing midstretch, and lasted late from a pair of gaining rivals. CHIQUITA MOSCA trailed, was urged along in the two path around the far turn, rallied
along the rail to gain place leaving the furlong grounds, sustained progress aiming inside of the leader late, bur ran out of ground. TITUBA settled off of the
pace along the inside, advanced in the three path and between horses into the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, delayed her lead change
until the furlong pole, and stayed on willingly while drifting in. PACHANGA LOCA was last away, but sent to the fore entering the first turn, cleared while
tucking to the two path around that bend, opened up down the backstretch, but began to tire around the far turn, drifted in and brushed a rail bidding rival
while being overhauled in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. HUNTLEIGH was keen to place two wide and between
horses entering the first turn, settled into stalking stride in the three path around that bend, chased the clear leader along with an inner rival around the far
turn, failed to offer a bid with that one entering the lane, then yielded three wide and between horses while hanging on her left lead. NEED SOME MONEY
laid off of the pace in the two to four paths around the first turn, improved down the backstretch, but faded around the far turn. PER RULING #23-0057
FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, FLAMAND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
TITO'S N KENZ stalked in the five path around the turn, sustained a grinding charge to offer a late bid, and narrowly prevailed. BUNDCHEN rushed forward
inside of foes after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, led into the turn, cleared while shifting from the two path to the three path turning for home, shifted in as
an inner DONATE LIFE took aim, hung on his left lead, cut down further while changing leads at the furlong grounds, met a pair of bids in the final sixteenth,
and got nailed via a tight photo. DONATE LIFE bumped with an outer rival at the start before taking contact from a different outer foe soon after, laid off of
the pace along the inside, rallied up the fence nearing the lane, took aim inside of the leader in upper stretch, altered course around that drifting rival at the
furlong grounds, produced a bid two wide and between horses in the late stages, but missed. YELLOW SUN DRESS laid off of the pace three wide, shifted
out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes in the final furlong to bear down on the leading trio late, but ran out of ground. INTERMITTENT
FAST prompted the pace between horses early on, chased the leader from the four path among foes around the turn, hung on his left lead in upper stretch,
shied from a left handed crop at the furlong grounds before changing leads, and gave way. LIAM'S MESSAGE broke a step slow before being squeezed
back from tight quarters at the start, raced at the rear two wide, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. ANORIA bumped an inner rival
soon after the start, chased from the two path, but gave way between horses around the turn. FIFTH CIRCUIT was reluctant to load, then got outrun along
the inside. AMERICAN TSUNAMI broke a step slow, lacked speed outside of rivals, but bore out drastically around the turn, and made lilte imapct. NEXT
DOT prompted the pace between horses early on, chased from the three path around the bend, and stopped.

Footnotes
PRANA stalked outside of the leader and in the four path around the first turn, vied in the three path down the backstretch, gained an advantage
approaching the far turn, crossed over to the rail with five sixteenths to go, repelled an outer challenger entering the lane, drew clear, and held safely from a
pair of closing-in rivals late. DEE DEE B pursued from midpack in the two path, came under a drive around the far turn, shifted to the three path in upper
stretch, ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole, and held that position from an outer rival while slowly gaining on the clear leader. CATHERINE BLAZE
laid off of the pace in the three path, was urged along around the far turn, picked up stride while tipping to the four path approaching midstretch, and offered
a belated charge to miss reaching place late. VIEWERS DISCRETION tracked from the three path early on, gained position to stalk outside of the new
leader around the far turn, attempted to offer a bid turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, and weakened on his left lead. IMPECCABLE
TASTE broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace in the three path around the first turn, shfited down before being headed by an outer
rival leaving the half mile pole, gave way around the far turn while shfting ground outwardly, and tired while drifting to the five path nearing the lane.
REPLENISH tracked in the three to five paths, but gave way around the far turn. AGENDA was pinched back between horses at the start, and got outrun.
LIL BIT OF CAPITOL broke slowly and never got involved. CAUGHTINMYWEB lacked speed in the five path around the first turn, but was through early,
and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ARDANWOOD set the pace, shook clear while well in hand entering the far turn, drew off while being set down in upper stretch, and was driven home.
ODDSONTONY tracked two to three wide, gained place while no match for the lead turning for home, and held that position from inner rivals. CODE
VIOLATION trailed, took the far turn two to three wide, and moved up entering the lane to gain show. FLUTE MASTER tracked along the inside while racing
well in the bit around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, but came under a drive entering the far turn, and tired. MAYFIELD STRONG
pressed outside of the leader, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the far turn, lost place to an outer rival turning for home, and weakened between
horses.

Footnotes
WE THE PEOPLE set the pace in hand in the three path around the first turn, shifted down to the two path approaching the eleven sixteenths pole before a
pair of outer rivals pressed nearing the far turn, yet inched a clear margin once let out a notch coming to the three furlong pole, edged further away in upper
stretch, and was driven home while shown a right handed crop through the final furlong. BRITAIN'S KITTEN trailed along the inside, rallied inside of rivals
turning for home, claimed place from an outer foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and ran on in pursuit of the well-traveling leader to prove second best.
DASH ATTACK tracked inside of rivals while a path off of the rail, gained place while taking aim on the clear leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace
with that one in upper stretch, and lost place to an inner rival leaving the three sixteenths pole. BUSINESS MODEL settled off of the pace in the three path,
launched an early advance in the five path and outside of rivals at the five furlong pole, sustained progress around the far turn to vie for place under urging
turning for home, but flattened out entering the lane. THE REDS pursued from midpack in the four path, had his hand forced early by an outer rival to gain a
pressing position with a half mile remaining, but came under urging to sustain position between horses at the three furlong pole, chased turning for home,
but weakened entering the lane. HERO STATUS stalked outside of the pace setter and from the four to three paths, pressed along with outer rivals
approaching the far turn, but weakened once put to tight quarters at the five sixteenths pole.

SUCH SOUNDS saved ground off of the pace, gradually shifted ground out to the eight path nearing midstretch, and offered a late kick to reel in the clear
leader in the closing stages. SAHLABIYA bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way with a clear margin while in hand
around the far turn, kicked away to open up a wide advantage in upper stretch, but began to tire entering the final sixteeth, and was worn down by an outer
on-charging rival in the late stages. RAGTIME BELLE threw his head at the start, trailed along the inside, moved out of last in the three to four paths into the
far turn, shifted out to the six path in midstretch, and offered a late kick to narrowly gain show at the wire. TAWARET tracked in midpack three wide, chased
in the four path around the far turn, sustained stride to bid for place along with outer rivals inside the final furlong, but was outkicked entering the final
sixteenth, and got caught at the wire for show. PENUMBRAS MAKER bobbled before taking bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from
midpack two wide and between horses, crept closer in the three to four paths around the far turn, drifted to the six path entering the lane, grinded away
while hanging on his left lead, attempted a bid for place nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival at that juncture, and was denied
minor placings. PURE COUNTRY tracked three wide, took aim as the leader's main pursuer around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one in
upper stretch, and faltered inside of rivals entering the final sixteenth. DETERMINED GOLD bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and
between horses, chased around the far turn, and faded. CHIROMANTE (IRE) stalked along the inside, chased under urging in the two path around the far
turn, and tired. CAMELOT BEAUTY (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside, but faded at the half mile pole. IZABELLABELLA laid off of the pace three
wide, came under coaxing entering the backstretch, but lacked a response, and was outrun. SELDOM SEEN stalked outside of the pace setter, but
weakened entering the far turn, and wilted between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
LOYAL COMPANY was bumped by rivals on both sides while put to very crowded quarters soon after the start, pursued from midpack in the four path into
the turn, tipped to the five path to take aim on the top pair entering the lane, rallied to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. DARK VECTOR
stalked two wide, took charge from the faltering pace-setter approaching the five sixteenths pole, held sway from a pair of pursuers through midstretch, but
met a bid in the final sixteenth, and got bested. CASTLEWARDEN broke out and nudged a rival leaving the gates, tracked along the inside while tugging in
the bit, gained place from between horses while tipping to the four path turning for home, took aim on the leader entering the lane, but only managed to
chase that foe before being outkicked for place a sixteenth from home. SURFACE TO AIR was floated into inner rivals at the start, was urged along at the
rear of the main group before shifting to the five path into the turn, spun into the lane in the six path, gained fourth from an inner rival in upper stretch, and
failed to threaten thereafter. BAD BOY FRANK was squeezed back when put to tight quarters between horses soon after the start, lacked speed two wide
and between horses, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. MO HOPE chased along the inside, and failed to menace. PILOTE
COMETE took a brush from an inner rival leaving the gates, got floated into an outer foe soon after where he had his hind quarters knocked from under him,
bobbled in the after math as his inner counterpart shifted across his path, then trailed around the turn, and improved between horses. RUNNINGFORJOY
broke slowly, and failed to factor three wide. KING OF KENTUCKY broke sharply, tracked three wide while forwardly placed, chased around the turn, but
was outmoved by rivals on either side nearing the lane, and gave way. GHENT ROAD shifted inwardly at the start, lacked speed along the inside, and failed
to factor thereafter. RUN FOR REAGAN rushed forward to set the pace along the inside, but faltered approaching the five sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS rated off of the pace two wide, tugged forward as an outer rival forced her hand approaching the far turn, bid for the lead under a firm
hold entering the far turn, gained an advantage while shifting to the five path entering the lane to float her outer challenger wider, inched clear of that one in
upper stretch, and held sway thereafter. TEMPLE CITY TERROR tracked along the inside, gained three wide approaching the final turn to press the top pair
around that bend, but was floated to the six path by the new leader entering the lane, subtly failed to keep pace in upper stretch, yet chased that foe home
well through the final furlong. PERSONAL BEST bobbled at the start while last away, rushed forward to set the pace in the three path entering the first turn,
tucked to the two path around the second turn, showed the way from a pair of bidders around the far turn, but proved no match for them entering the lane,
gave way, yet maintained show. ENSEMBLE (IRE) broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, tipped to the two path into the second turn, and made little
impact. CHATON ROUGE stalked along the inside, but faded around the final turn.

Footnotes
BOURBON HEIST tracked two wide, offered a bold bid outside of the new leader at the three furlong pole, quickly took charge passing the five sixteenths,
drew off in upper stretch, and was kept to task while hanging on his left lead. OVERBORE bumped with an outer rival at the start, got keen between horses
leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, and rallied to gain place at the furlong pole. A LA CARTE
allowed an outer rival to clear early on in order to set up shop outside of him down the backstretch, stalked from the three path into the turn, bid in the four
path at the three furlong pole as an outer BOURBON HEIST loomed a danger, but offered no resistance to that one's bid soon after, was quickly outpaced
turning for home, then gave way, and lost place to an outer rival at the furlong grounds. DEBATE tracked along the inside, vacated the rail turning for home,
shifted to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. O P FIRECRACKER bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed, and never got involved. WAR
ROOM bobbled at the start, recovered to clear off soon after, set the pace in the two path, but proved no match for a pair of bidders approaching the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
TURF KING (IRE) tracked two wide and between horses, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide to bid at the furlong grounds, gained an
advantage at the sixteenth pole, and held gamely from an outer rival. MORE THAN LOOKS broke slowly and got keen behind foes early on, settled while
trailing three wide around the first turn, gained in the four path around the far turn before fanning eight wide entering the lane, produced a good kick, rallied
while shifting inwardly in midstretch, bid outside of the new leader in the final sixteenth, but narrowly missed. MIDNIGHT RISING laid far back along the
inside, trailed around the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, but was blocked behind rivals in upper stretch, altered out eight wide at the furlong
grounds, and came with a late kick to gain show. WICO (IRE) tracked in the four to five paths, fanned six wide entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge
while hanging on his left lead, shifted inwardly at the furlong grounds before attempting a bid nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked, and got nailed
for show at the wire. MOVISITOR tracked along the inside, gained place in the two path turning for home, but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the
furlong grounds, and steadied in tight quarters soon after. TIGER PAW (IRE) set the pace in the two path, shifted in and grazed the fence passing the
eleven sixteenths pole, inched a clear margin approaching the far turn, maintained an advantage through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but
was overhauled entering the final sixteenth. ITZOS stalked the top pair from the four path, but yielded between horses five wide entering the lane.
MOONSTRIKE (GB) laid off of the pace along the inside, checked slightly at the eleven sixteenths pole, spun into the lane three wide, searched for racing
room with plenty of run while blocked behind rivals, shifted inwardly leaving the furlong grounds, but steadied hard when stymied in the final sixteenth.
DUNEDIN settled far back two wide, advanced between horses around the far turn, but was blocked in the five path in upper stretch before steadying at the
furlong grounds. LAVER stalked in the three path, chased between horses in upper stretch, but weakened once put to tight quarters among foes at the
furlong grounds. SPY NOVEL laid off of the pace two to three wide, inched closer between horses before fanning four wide entering the lane, but lacked a
kick while hanging on his left lead between horses, then steadied hard once pinched at the furlong pole. GOOD HEART pursued from midpack two wide, but
gave way along the inside around the far turn, and was eased up through the lane. THE RIDER OF SPY NOVEL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF WICO (IRE) FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS
