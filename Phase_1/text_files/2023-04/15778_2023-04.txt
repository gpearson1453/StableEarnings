Footnotes
A CROWN FOR KITTEN saved ground in the early stages while unhurried, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused four wide into the
stretch, came within aim at the furlong grounds, responded to steady urging in deep stretch, drew to even terms with FINNLEY'S KITTEN inside of the
sixteenth-marker and surged in the final strides to prevail. FINNLEY'S KITTEN tracked the moderate early fractions, was roused three wide along the far
turn, advanced nearing mid-stretch, match strides with A CROWN FOR KITTEN to the sixteenth-marker, took a narrow lead on that rival in deep stretch,
battled gamely to the finish and was bested on the wire for the win, while clear of the rest for second. TURIAF broke alertly and dictated terms early on,
ceded the lead to AMANDA ROSE heading into the backstretch run and stalked that rival to the second turn, confronted AMANDA ROSE nearing the
furlong marker, took command into the final furlong, was not able to match strides with the top two in deep stretch and held on for third. AMANDA ROSE
was close up in the early running, prompted the pace along the first turn then assumed command into the backstretch run, set decent fractions into the
second turn, held the lead to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with oncoming rivals in the late stages and weakened. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY lunged at
the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn and offered a mild late rally in the
stretch. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE was allowed to settle, was never far back while saving ground into the far turn, raced two wide into the stretch and lacked a
late rally.

Footnotes
MISS BELLIMBUSTO was allowed to settle in the early running, was roused four wide approaching the quarter marker, loomed at mid-stretch, closed
determinedly in the late stages, came within aim of JUST A LITTLE LUCK inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final strides to win the nod at
the finish. JUST A LITTLE LUCK raced close to the solid early pace, pressed BLACK ZABAT to the quarter marker, battled with that rival in upper stretch
then took a narrow lead at the furlong grounds, was kept to steady urging while leading to deep stretch, felt pressure from MISS BELLIMBUSTO inside of
the sixteenth-marker and was nailed on the wire for the win, while holding for second. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA tracked the decent early pace, advanced three
wide on the turn, chased the leaders while within aim at mid-stretch, closed well late, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was clear at the finish
for third. ELECTRIC LETTUCE tracked the decent early pace, saved ground along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a response in the final
stages. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA was unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the quarter marker, trailed to the furlong grounds and offered a mild late
bid. BLACK ZABAT broke alertly and showed good early speed, was pressed to the quarter marker while slowing down the fractions, was set down in upper
stretch and battled for the lead to the furlong pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT EMPIRE was unhurried in the early going, trailed along the backstretch run, improved position three wide on the second turn, slipped to the two
path nearing the top of the lane, loomed at mid-stretch, matched strides with PERSUASIVE LIPS inside of the furlong marker, took command from the tiring
pacesetter inside of the sixteenth-marker and held the runner-up at bay in the final strides to prevail. PERSUASIVE LIPS stalked the decent early fractions,
raced two wide into the far turn, was roused three wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, matched strides with TWILIGHT EMPIRE inside of the
furlong marker, was held at bay by the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. TEN THE SMART WAY was sent to establish the early pace, set decent
fractions into the backstretch run, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and held foes at bay to the furlong pole, weakened
in deep stretch, was overtaken by the top two inside of the sixteenth-marker and held safely in the end for third. BANDEENA tracked the early pace, raced
outside of rivals along the first turn, maintained a three wide path through the backstretch run and into the far turn, lost a bit of ground heading to
mid-stretch, made a mild rally in the final stages but could not muster the needed late response. LA VIKINA was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended
to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, pressed TEN THE SMART WAY to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in the drive, remained
in contention to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. MOMMA MOCCA was unhurried in the early going, was a bit keen along the first turn and into
the backstretch run, was roused four wide along the second turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and lacked a late response. ESCAPE FREE (IRE)
settled off of the early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn, could not keep pace heading to the quarter
marker and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
JIMMY BLUE JEANS broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated through modest fractions into the second turn, quickened in upper stretch,
extended the lead and drew clear heading to the furlong pole, kept to task to deep stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and determinedly held that
foe at bay in the final strides to prevail. KENNEBEC tracked the modest early pace, saved ground into the second turn, advanced nearing the top of the
stretch, continued to rally from the inside to the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final stages and
held for second. HARMON settled off of the modest early fractions, was well placed through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on the far turn,
ran evenly to the furlong grounds, finished well in deep stretch, could not reel in the top pair in the final stages and was up in time to secure third.
SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the modest fractions through the backstretch run, advanced on the
pacesetter on the far turn, could not make headway in the drive, was outkicked in the final stages and just missed for third. RIMPROTECTOR was allowed
to settle in the early going, raced two wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was gaining in the final furlong but did not make an impact.
LONG LANCE was a bit slow into stride early on, lacked early speed, improved position while four wide on the far turn, lost ground at mid-stretch and could
not muster the needed late response.

MY SUNSHINE tracked the early pace from the second flight, raced outside of rivals while well positioned through the backstretch run, gained ground three
wide on the far turn, slipped to the two path in upper stretch, confronted TIZONA and battled with that foe to the furlong grounds, responded to urging inside
of the furlong marker and took a narrow lead heading to deep stretch, kept to task in the final stages and held in a drive over the stubborn runner-up.
TIZONA was hustled leaving the break and dictated terms in the early going, was well rated through modest fractions to the half-mile marker, held foes at
bay to the quarter pole, was confronted by MY SUNSHINE in upper stretch, met that bid and held a narrow lead to mid-stretch, stubbornly battled against
MY SUNSHINE inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding safely for second. ON RAGLAN ROAD was forwardly placed
into the first turn, stalked the modest fractions from a rail position through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped three wide in
upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, offered a mild late bid but could not reel in the top two in deep stretch and held safely for third. LORD
WIMBORNE (IRE) broke in at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, gained ground along the backstretch run, continued that
advance to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the drive, lost ground at mid-stretch and closed willingly in the late stages. SAFE COMBINATION took
back off of the early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong
grounds and flattened out in deep stretch. DI LAURIAN broke alertly,conceded the early lead and stalked TIZONA through moderate fractions to the second
turn, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way. SYNC was unhurried, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch,
rallied inside of the furlong marker but did not threaten in the final stages. ZOE'S PAPA CEE settled in the second flight along the first turn, lost position
along the backstretch run, lost contact on the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
QUEEN MOLOTOV was sent leaving the break, engaged with LOTSA PEPPER and dueled with that foe through fast early fractions, shook free in upper
stretch, drew to a clear lead inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and held in a drive over the oncoming
runner-up. MARILYN'S SMILE was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide along the turn, was roused in upper stretch, closed with a rush inside of
the furlong pole, could not reel in QUEEN MOLOTOV in deep stretch and outfinished SWANEE to secure second. SWANEE chased the dueling pacesetters
in the early running, raced two wide along the turn, swung four wide for the stretch run, ran evenly to the furlong pole, offered a mile late bid, was outfinished
for second and held safely for third. TURA LURA chased the quick early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, was not able to impact the leaders in
deep stretch but was gaining in the final furlong. HOT RAGEOUS chased the fast early pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked a late response. LOTSA
PEPPER broke alertly and showed good early speed, dueled with QUEEN MOLOTOV through the turn while carving fast fractions, lost ground to that rival
at mid-stretch and tired in the final stages. THE GREAT HAYNES was a bit slow into early stride, lagged through the turn while saving ground and did not
threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN settled in the second flight, kept a two wide path to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
mounted a bold rally while in the six path in deep stretch, came within aim of MISS UNION in the final strides and was up at the wire to prevail. MISS UNION
was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the fast pace from the second flight into the turn, raced three wide along the bend then was steered four
wide into the stretch, vied for the lead in upper stretch then took command inside of the furlong marker, was kept to steady urging to deep stretch, was
confronted by MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN in the final strides and was nailed for the win on the wire, while holding for second. TAMANTARI was allowed to
settle in the early going, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced at mid-stretch, came in tight in deep stretch, navigated through traffic in the final
stages and was up in time to secure third. DULCE EMMA chased the fast early fractions, saved ground along the turn, came in tight nearing the quarter
marker, tipped two wide for the drive, advanced at mid-stretch, was not able to match strides with oncoming rivals in deep stretch and just missed for third.
LADY'S SERMON took back off of the fast early pace, swung four wide into the stretch and finished well inside of the furlong marker. SMILING MOLLY was
forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the fast fractions to the quarter pole, swung three wide into the stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker,
ran on the left lead to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished in the final stages. REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly and showed good early speed,
dictated terms while setting quick fractions to the quarter marker, came under pressure at the furlong marker, battled to the sixteenth-marker, could not hold
off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and weakened. PERFECT STORIES was slow into early stride, lagged through the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
CANDY'S CLONE broke well, got in good position down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair to the turn, began a bid with three furlongs to run, awaited
room turning for home, split horses at the top of the stretch, shifted in to avoid contact with SHE'S SO SHINY then straightened out and ran away from the
field. TAMARA MINE broke outward when bothered by SHE'S SO SHINY after the break which in turn forced the two horses to the outside to break outward
as well, settled on the outside of the tracking trio to the turn, responded when asked to pick it up near the five-sixteenths pole, was five wide as the field
fanned out turning for home, then ran on well down the middle of the track to gain the place while no match for the winner. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) allowed
to settle near the rear of the field in the early going, began a sustained rally from the half-mile marker, kept to the inside through the turn, tipped out for room
in deep stretch and finished up well. MISS IVES broke outward at the break then raced between horses tracking the pacesetter down the backstretch,
moved forward through the turn, had a difficult time finding running room in the stretch but ran some when clear in deep stretch. RESERVOIR was last away
and trailed early, struggled to keep up through the turn despite the best efforts of the rider, stayed near the rail through the turn then mustered a mild rally in
the stretch but was much too late. TOO BOSSY hustled from the break, established the lead with several in close pursuit, held to the three-sixteenths pole
with three challengers to the outside then battled on gamely to the furlong marker but tired and stopped. SHE'S SO SHINY broke out, straightened, rushed
up and settled just behind the lone pacesetter, moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, loomed a threat at the head of the stretch but
weakened between horses and was unable to keep up in the late stages.
