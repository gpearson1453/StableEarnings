BIG STRIKE assumed command in the early running, set a pressured pace into the turn while off of the rail, shook free at the quarter marker, held the
runner-up at bay in upper stretch and edged away in the final stages to prove best. MORO FIRST CLASS stalked the moderate early pace, saved ground
while advancing on the turn, improved position in upper stretch, could not make headway on BIG STRIKE in the drive and was an easy second at the end.
FROSTY DOLCE was away a step slowly, recovered to press the moderate early pace, raced three wide into the turn, was outrun heading into the stretch
and gave way in the drive.

ZAKKIYYAH was prominent in the early going, pressed the solid pace heading to the turn, kept close attendance while three deep at the quarter marker,
swung four wide for the drive, confronted SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS at mid-stretch, took command into the final furlong, kept to task to deep stretch and
held safely in a drive to prevail. ADAM'S CREED took back in the early running, improved position while two wide on the turn, was roused three wide into
the stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final stages and was second best. SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS assumed command in the early stages, set
solid fractions while pressed into the turn, slowed down the pace while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, was confronted by
ZAKKIYYAH approaching the furlong pole, could not go on with that rival in the final furlong, gave way in the late stages and just held for third. SHEZA
QUEEN BEE chased the decent pace while outside of rivals, came four wide into the stretch, lacked a late response and missed for third. HANNAH IN A
HURRY lunged at the start and was off slowly, rushed up in the early running and stalked the pace into the turn, lost ground heading to the quarter marker
and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOING TO SHABOOMS was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the modest fractions through the backstretch run, vied for the lead while
between runners heading to the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, kept to task inside of the furlong marker and drove clear in deep stretch to
prevail. GRIGORO hopped at the break and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early running, was steered four wide into the backstretch run, raced
outside of rivals into the far turn, advanced at the quarter marker, was roused five wide for the drive, was not able to keep pace with the winner in the final
furlong and outfinished REMEMBER SUE to secure second. REMEMBER SUE was allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained
position to the far turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the stretch, advanced at the furlong grounds, lacked the
needed response in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. CLASS CODE stalked the modest early pace, saved ground
through the backstretch run and into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. FANTASTIC SECRET settled off of the early
pace while not far back, raced three wide along the backstretch run and into the far turn, vied for the lead while three deep at the quarter marker, lost
position in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and gave way. LAST INNING broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions
through the backstretch run, came under pressure at the quarter marker, battled with GOING TO SHABOOMS to mid-stretch and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
TERRY'S BOY rated nicely off of the quick early pace, improved position on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, loomed approaching the
furlong pole, overtook NEWPARK inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in the final stages to prove best. NEWPARK (IRE) was sent to the early lead,
set a pressured pace through the turn while carving quick fractions, shook free in upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner inside of the furlong marker
and held safely for second. FULLY LOADED was prominent in the early going, took back to chase the pace into the turn, saved ground to the quarter
marker, made a mild bid at mid-stretch, was unable to match strides with the top pair in the final stages and held for third in the end. AUTISM BLUE chased
from the inside, lost ground on the turn, ran evenly in the stretch and could not muster the needed late response. HAY JUAN showed good early speed,
pressed the fast pace to the quarter marker, lost position in the drive and weakened in the final stages. GREAT STORY lacked early speed, raced two wide
while trailing along the turn and did not factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
IRISH ROYALTY took back in the early going, stalked the pace while well positioned into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, was roused three
wide into the drive, loomed nearing the furlong pole, overtook IRISH CORN at mid-stretch, opened to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth-marker, drew away
in deep stretch and was hand urged in the final strides. HOT CHICKS ONLY chased the quick early pace from the second flight, gained ground three wide
on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages and ran on to earn the
nod for second on the wire. IRISH CORN stalked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, advanced on the turn while three deep, vied for the lead at the
quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, was overtaken by IRISH ROYALTY at the furlong marker, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for
second, while just holding for third on the wire. CHUCKANUT BAY was unhurried in the early running, improved position three wide on the turn, made a mile
gain at the furlong grounds, finished evenly in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. FLY WICKED EAGLE broke alertly, showed good early
speed and set the pressured pace to the turn, vied between rivals on the turn while setting decent fractions, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave
way in the drive. WILD BILLY D chased from the rear in the early going, ran two wide to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch. ARGENTINA
CRIES (IRE) was crowded at the start by MR. FIGHTER and off a step slowly, chased the quick early pace, saved ground on the turn, was outrun in upper
stretch and did not factor. MR. FIGHTER broke out a bit at the start and crowded ARGENTINA CRIES, disputed the solid early pace into the turn, pressed
the pace to the quarter marker from the inside, dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY was asked to show early speed and dictated terms in to the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker while setting solid fractions, shook
free from the pressing rival in upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong pole and kicked clear in the final stages. O'NEILL'S LEGACY was hustled to be
forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the solid pace while three wide on the turn, maintained position to the furlong grounds while running evenly,
was no match for the winner in deep stretch and ran on to secure second. MAGICAL LADY was a bit slow into stride early on, chased three wide along the
turn, ran evenly to the furlong pole, lacked a rally in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. DANCING CRANE showed good early
speed, pressed the solid early pace, kept close attendance to AUSTRIAN NAVY to the quarter marker, chased that foe to mid-stretch, weakened in the final
stages and was tagged on the wire for third. LADY BLACKBIRD chased the quick early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn, came four wide to the
quarter marker and did not factor in the drive. SUPERSONIC FLYER chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
MATCHLESS settled off of the decent early pace, loomed four wide on the turn, slipped to the three path in upper stretch, battled with SERIOUS SECRET
to mid-stretch, disposed of that rival inside of the furlong marker and drew clear under steady late urging. SERIOUS SECRET broke alertly and was
prominent in the early running, disputed the pace with BOB'S VAI then took back off of that rival and stalked two wide into the turn, was roused leaving the
quarter marker, met the bid of MATCHLESS to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the final stages and held well in the end for second.
MARY WALKER was unhurried in the early running, advanced on the turn while saving ground, tipped two wide for the drive, continued to gain ground to
mid-stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong and stayed on to secure third. OTTER POP chased the decent early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn,
swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. BOB'S VAI was hard sent in the early stages, disputed the
pace with SERIOUS SECRET then took command heading into the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired
in the drive.

Footnotes
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, confronted ROUGH NIGHT
nearing the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, shook free inside of the furlong marker and drove clear under steady urging in the final
stages. OUR SILVER OAK was a bit keen in the early running, took back off of the pace and tracked between rivals into the backstretch run, maintained
position to the half-mile pole, advanced two wide between horses on the second turn, was angled three wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong
marker, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure second. KODIACTION took back off of the early pace,
came in a bit tight heading into the first turn, was shuffled back leaving the seven-furlong pole and trailed into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground
into the far turn, advanced from the rail at the quarter marker, continued that steady bid to mid-stretch, needed more in deep stretch and was outfinished for
second, while securing third. WARD 'N JERRY stalked the moderate early pace from the inside, maintained his position through the backstretch run, made
a mild gain at the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished for the minor awards. MEMO DADDY
(CHI) tracked the moderate early pace while outside of runners, raced three wide into the backstretch run, was well placed to the half-mile marker,
advanced three wide on the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch, could not sustain his run approaching the furlong pole and weakened. ROUGH
NIGHT assumed command leaving the break, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure from BLACK CASPIAN nearing the
quarter marker, battled with that foe to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
STORMIN GALILEO broke alertly and went to the front without being asked, allowed THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) to take over halfway through the first turn
and stalked that one in hand to the far turn while always traveling comfortably, took command with a furlong to run and drew off as the rider pleased.
HICKORY WIND tracked from a few lengths back through the first turn, raced three wide and pulled the rider closer down the backstretch, got within two
lengths of the leaders heading into the turn, lost a bit of ground when the top two quickened away but rebid under strong handling and kept on to gain the
place. RULER OF ANGELS settled near the rear of the field racing in the two path to the far turn, began a rally from the three-eighths marker, got bumped
near the three-sixteenths marker by TALISKER BAY but still finished up well while under heavy pressure to get up for third. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) broke
well and took a short lead through the clubhouse turn, set moderate fractions through the first half mile, began to pick up the pace heading into the far turn,
was challenged by STORMIN GALILEO near the quarter pole and hung in to mid-stretch but then gave way and was oufiinished for a minor award.
TALISKER BAY was away a little slowly and trailed well behind the field to the far turn, began to rally with three furlongs to run, got a clear run into the
stretch but bumped RULER OF ANGELS near the three-sixteenths pole, then had trouble getting straight, passed a few once clear but was never a threat.
ASANO'S BACK raced four to five wide into the first turn and down the backstretch, began a moderate bid from the half mile marker and around the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch, was unable to improve position in the stretch and was reported to have bled when pulled up. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE
broke out at the start and made light contact with RULER OF ANGELS, hustled to get position but ended up racing mid-pack while saving ground in the
early going and into the far turn, struggled to keep up when the pace quickened then was unable to offer any response down the stretch. APLOMBADO
broke a bit slowly and was outrun after the break, saved ground while racing well back of the leaders, dropped back to last at the seven-sixteenths pole and
and had nothing to offer from that point.
