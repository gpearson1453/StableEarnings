and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. LUSCIOUS chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two
path and was outkicked in the lane. QUALITY TOO SPARE raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and never threatened.

DUDESFIRSTDARLING led the way on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, kicked clear in midstretch and held that
margin to the wire. MY BATON ROUGE veered in and bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, launched a bid from the four path coming around the turn and chased the winner home in the lane. UCAPTURED AERO bumped with the
horses to both sides leaving the gate, tracked the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and kept on in the stretch. LIVELY
REMARK raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path and finished evenly. FLASH
DEAR bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the two path and showed no kick. ROMAN
PRINCESS bumped with horses to both sides and was blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn
and made no bid. PLANE JANE pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and tired in the

Footnotes
SATURDAY NITE GIRL raced at the back of the pack in the four path through the opening half mile, angled in to began a bid from the rail coming around
the far turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the wire. SWEET DUTCHESS saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and gained ground late. ASTERS D'ORO raced in the two path around the first turn,
settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far bend and improved position in the
lane. THUNDER BUGGY saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch and around the second turn and weakened in the
final furlong. GLITTER BAY raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far bend
from the four path and improved position mildly in the lane while never truly threatening. LALOBA FEROZ was pinched back leaving the gate, raced at the
back of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, moved up from the five path coming around the far bend and passed tiring horses in the
lane. HIGH VIBES raced in the two path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, came around the far turn in the four
path and faded from there. MY MAGGIE MOO trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far
turn in the two path and showed no kick. FAMILY BAND raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch,
continued around the second turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. SINGALONG KAYLA raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader
on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire from there.
