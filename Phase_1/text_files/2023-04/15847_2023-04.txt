Footnotes
MIDNIGHT WARSHIP stumbled a stride out of the gate, trailed into the turn, angled outside, circled his field with a burst of speed to make the lead at the
furlong marker and drew off to win as much the best. THE COACHMAN stalked the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly three wide nearing the furlong
marker then was no match for the winner. GUN LAP never far back, rallied rail along the rail through the turn to make the lead entering the stretch and
finished with good courage. DECEITFUL ANTHONY pressed the pace four then three wide into the stretch and was outfinished. MUTINY away alertly, set a
pressured pace off the rail in the two path into the stretch then weakened. EL MARRO had speed through the turn, swung wide and lost ground.

Footnotes
CAT'S RHYTHM waited along the behind a trio of horses battling for the lead through the turn, shifted out to the thee path when a hole opened up entering
the stretch, responded with a burst of speed to make the lead past the furlong marker and won going away. BOOGIE BOOGEE battled for the lead two wide
into the stretch, gained the advantage then was no match for the winner. PENNY SHOTS allowed to settle, found her best stride late four wide. BISCAYNE
BAY unhurried early, closed a gap late three wide. AUJARA had speed from the start, loomed boldly four wide midway on the turn, matched strides into the
stretch then was outfinished. GAIL'S DANCER contested the lead along the inside into the stretch then weakened. RAINBOW SHIP trailed into the stretch,
swung wide and passed tiring rivals. SUSHI Q veered out at the start, rushed to contention two wide soon thereafter, checked repeatedly behind horses
while lacking racing room and dropped back in the final furlong. QUEEN AIR pressed the pace three wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead
nearing the quarter pole then came up empty.

ALFIO raced three wide through the clubhouse turn, dropped inside, saved ground into the far turn, shifted out three wide, made the lead near the quarter
pole, shook clear entering the stretch and prevailed under mild left handed urging. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR unhurried early, loomed boldly four wide
nearing the quarter pole and finished well clear for second. TIMESATAPPIN slow early, improved position into the stretch and was the best of the rest.
MODUS hopped hitting the gate at the start and was no threat. TONKAWA SPRINGS well placed, failed to respond. LED TASSO dueled for the lead along
the inside for six furlongs then weakened. SWELTER failed to menace. GIACOMETTI matched strides for the lead three then two wide into the far turn and
was used up. RED COMET was through early.

Footnotes
LUCKY STREAK stalked the pace two then three wide into the stretch, surged late under left handed urging to make the lead and just lasted while
extended. ELLIOT THE DRAGON never far back, closed rapidly four wide through deep stretch and just missed. COWTOWN BOSS chased the pace from
the inside into the stretch, shifted out to the three path late and finished determinedly. MOESTER slow early, found his best stride late outside. ZAKARIA
broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch along the inside then was outfinished. STUNT MAN well placed, went evenly. TIDE RISING failed to menace.
SERENDIPITOUS was no factor. KEEPING SCORE was no threat. CHOCOLATE PHILLING had brief speed. RUMBLE STRIP RON was through early.
