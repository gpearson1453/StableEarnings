Footnotes
WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR stumbled at the start, recovered and set a pressured pace on the inside, drew clear leaving the turn and remained clear to the
wire to prove best, driving. IMPULSIVENESS was off a step slow, reserved three wide, advanced three wide on the turn and finished well to be clearly
second best. OPTION was reluctant to load, pressed the pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn and weakened, bested rest. WHERE'S LUCKY
was settled back early, swung out three wide leaving the turn and passed the tiring rivals. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE chased the early pace, then saved ground
on the far turn and tired. RIP IT RYAN was reserved early, came four wide into the lane and had no response.

had a long duel and prevailed late under a drive. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS was sent to the front to set the pace while clear on the inside, was headed nearing
the furlong marker, dug in gamely and battled to the wire to just miss. FIRST MASAMUNE chased the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn
and came four wide into the lane and flattened out. DYNABLUE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. YOU'RE IN
COREY tracked the early pace on the inside, then was two wide and in between rivals by the five sixteenths and weakened. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT CROGE dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid off the turn to shake clear, then drew out to prove best under a drive. MINING CAMP
dueled for the lead on the inside and then proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be second best. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH was well
placed early, made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out, held show award. MERLOTTI hopped and bumped at the start, settled back early, four
wide by the quarter pole and then offered a late rally to miss the show award. TENPAK was bumped at the start, reserved early, two wide on the turn and
had no serious rally. RUSSIAN HAMMER chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. SARAH'S BOY
BLUE was settled early, dropped to the inside on the turn and weakened. BACK TO SELLING broke thru the gate but did not run off, chased the pace four
wide and weakened. The rider on the number three claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference around the quarter pole, after the STEWARDS
reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was not allowed and the race left as is.
