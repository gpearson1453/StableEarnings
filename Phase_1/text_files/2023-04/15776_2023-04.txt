Footnotes
SHANKINSTINE was hustled away from the gate to duel for the lead from the three path to the quarter pole then shook loose briefly but was challenged by
SHOETRICK in the stretch drive and won the nod. SHOETRICK was unhurried down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the seven sixteenth pole
and engaged the leader at the three sixteenth pole, matched strides with SHANKINSTINE down the stretch but lost the nod. TSURIS was off the pace down
the backstretch then angled out to three wide at the five sixteenths pole to make a late run, moved back to the inside in the final furlong but was too late.
PLAY MASTER broke in at the start then dueled for the lead from the inside to the quarter pole and gave way. ST PIERRE was four wide into the first turn
then tracked the leaders down the backstretch ran into traffic entering the final turn and didn't make a bid. MY UNCLE BILLY dueled for the lead from
between horses to the half pole and was through. R T'S IRON MAN was never involved. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF
TSURIS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEYS OF PLAY MASTER AND SHANKINSTINE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START OF THE

at the top of the stretch for a late run and proved second best. FOR REAL ALICE roused to the front to duel for the lead from outside of REBECCA G to the
three furlong pole then inched away, was collared at the eighth pole and tired. REBECCA G was hustled along to battle for the lead from the inside of FOR
REAL ALICE to the three furlong pole then faded. HARLANS WARRIOR tracked the leaders from the inside but failed to menace. A. K. A. GRAMS raced in

JEFFROW was allowed to settle down the backstretch then move to four wide at the three furlong pole tipping out to five wide in upper stretch to cruise
home for the win. MARTINIZED was off the pace around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch to vie for the lead from the two path then was
shuffled out at the seven sixteenths pole, made a rebid and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole but was caught in late stretch but held on to be second
best. TOUCHDOWN JOE was roused to the front to vie for the lead around the first turn then took a brief lead into the backstretch, had to check slightly at
the seven sixteenths pole, re-engaged and fought gamely to mid stretch and tired. SCORING DRIVE was unhurried down the backstretch then made a rail
bid on the final turn and passed tiring rivals. SARAH'S VISION went four wide into the first turn then moved up to take the lead at the half pole but was
quickly collared and gave way. WESTERN STAR cut the corner into the first turn to take a brief lead then pressed the pace to the three eighths pole and
faded. BATTLE OF WILL raced in the middle of the pack and was not a factor.

near the back to the middle of the turn then made a four wide bid at the quarter pole to make a late run and was a clear second. BUNKIE'S SONG was off
the pace early then dropped back to the middle of the pack on the turn then made a late rally to be up of the show. GIMMEASOUND went to a challenged
lead to the three eighths pole and slowly faded. SUN SQUALL raced near the back through the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MOVE IT had no
speed and was never a threat. LET IT B vied for the lead from between horses to the half pole and weakened. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER tracked the
leaders from five wide to the turn then moved in to three wide to make a mild bid around the turn but faltered.

Footnotes
WOODS N WATER was slow into his stride on the backstretch then gained momentum at the five furlong pole and made a looming three wide bid around
the turn while closing willingly to prove the best. FATHER GOOSE was off the pace in the two path then engaged the leader at the quarter pole to take a
brief lead to the eighth pole where he was caught but held on for the place. DRILLING REPORT raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then made a rail
bid into the stretch and fought gamely to just miss the place. BIND FAITH raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a three wide bid
at the three furlong pole and faltered. AZTAR tracked the leaders down the backstretch then moved out to five wide in upper stretch to make a mild bid and
improved position. MAGAWILDTIME raced near the back down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn and drifted out in upper stretch but was
never a threat. FLASHY PREMO had no speed and was not a factor. GOLD PUNCH was roused to a clear lead to set the pace to the quarter pole then was
headed and gave way.

and took the lead at the eighth pole and drew clear. RACY BILLE was rushed to the lead from the three path then was headed at the three sixteenths pole
and gave way grudgingly. CASH HOLIDAY tracked the leaders from the inside then moved out the three wide at the five sixteenths pole to close fastest to
be the best of the rest. CAJUN CONNECTION pressed the pace from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. IRON N STEEL was off the pace
in the four path on the backstretch then moved in to the two path to move up on the turn but lacked the late kick. BASTI BLUE was unhurried to the turn then
made a bid from four wide around the turn and moving out farther to five wide into upper stretch but was empty. MAIN DUDE vied for the lead from the two
