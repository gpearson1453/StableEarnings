KIND WAYS went to the front to set all the pace and drew clear around the turn to prove best. STORM BREACH stalked the pace around the turn then
made a bid from three wide at the quarter pole and was a clear second. KASEN'S SISTER was off the pace down the backstretch then made a mild rail bid
into the stretch and held on for the show. SUFFRAGETTE had no speed while saving ground around the turn then made a late bid to improve position.
COLD HEARTED WENCH forced the pace from the two path to the five furlong pole but gave way. FINNLEYS ENCORE tracked the leaders from between

GENIUS was off the pace in the two or three path then made a three wide bid at the end of the bend and cruised by the leader and cleared late. VEGAS
GUY dueled for the lead from the two or three path then shook loose in early stretch but was collared around the eighth pole but kept on to be second best.
ONE TOUGH CHARLIE sprinted away from the gate, pressed the pace from the inside to the seven sixteenths pole then made a rebid into the stretch, split
horses at the top of the stretch and was the best of the rest. MY LITTLE JUNIOR tracked the leaders while racing four wide and was not a factor.
HOMELAND MESSA bobbled leaving the gate and had to steady slightly, trailed the field through the turn and passed tiring rival in the stretch. CLASSIC
RED RACER dueled for the lead from the two path to the three sixteenths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
HOT LE ROY tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole then moved in to three wide in upper stretch to
take the lead at the eighths pole and won going away. IZZY'S BABY BOY hustled to the lead to the turn then was challenged at the quarter pole and fought
gamely and held the place. I'LL RAISE YOU was off the pace down the backstretch then moved to engage the leader at the quarter pole and fought gamely
in the stretch and missed the place. OUTLAW X. was rank in the early stages then tracked the leaders through the turn then moved out to four wide in upper
stretch but failed to menace. RUN ROCKET saved ground down the backstretch then tipped out to two or three wide at the three furlong pole then moved
out to five wide in upper stretch to show late interest and improve position late. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then saved ground around the turn but lacked a late response. BROAD DECISION stalked the pace from the three path but failed to menace.
TUNE MY GUITAR showed little.

BOYFRIEND MATERIAL vied for the lead from four wide to the quarter pole then drew clear but was collared late, dug in to hold on. FAR BEYOND had no
speed to the turn then slowly gained momentum and went three or four wide at the quarter pole, tipping out to five wide in upper stretch for a late rally and
just missed. B W P SPECIAL tracked the leaders from the four path down the backstretch then moved in to two wide on the turn and lacked room into the
stretch, angled out to five or six wide at the eighth pole and gave a late run to be best of rest. HALFMOON REEF pressed the pace from the inside and
weakened. LODE OF BLARNEY went to a pressured lead to the quarter pole and tired. BET AGAIN tracked the leaders but was never a threat. BIG BELLA

FATHER RED was allowed to settle in the early stages then made a five wide bid at the half pole, tipping in to three wide at the quarter pole to take the lead
in upper stretch, drifted in in the final sixteenth but was able to hold on for the win. MO CREDO raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then
moved up from four wide on the backstretch and launched his bid at the half pole to engage the leader at the quarter pole and fought gamely down the
stretch to prove second best. CHICKEN TRUCK was forwardly placed around the first turn then moved up from three wide to stalk the pace, engaged the
leaders at the half pole and stuck his head in front briefly and tired in the stretch. K V TARGET raced near the back around the first turn and down the
backstretch then made a bid from four wide at the five sixteenths pole to improve position. PEANUT N IKE was off the pace down the backstretch then
made a three wide bid a the three furlong pole to move up but flattened out. DARK MATTER pressed the pace from the two path to the three eighths pole
and weakened. WESTERN STAR cut the corner going into the first turn to take the lead and set the early pace but was through after a half. LITTLE ROCKY
tracked the leaders from off the rail but was never a threat. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then made a mild bid
from five wide at the half pole and faltered. INSPECTOR ED broke outward at the start and was out run. AN OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF

Footnotes
AGAMI had no early speed then launched a bid at the five sixteenth pole, went four to five wide into upper stretch for a late rally and drew off. NODAH
pressed the pace from the two path then engaged the leader at the three eighths pole to take a brief lead but was no match for the winner. STARSHIP
JAMBALAYA tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole for a late run to be up for show. BLESSED
ASSURANCE broke inward at the start then went to the lead to set the early pace, was headed at the three eighths pole and gave way grudgingly.
SPLITTING ACES was not involved. CUSTOMIZED TWIN was off the pace early then moved up to engage the leader at the three eighths pole but gave
way and jogged in.

Footnotes
GILDERSLEEVE raced near the back on the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn, moved out to three wide at the quarter pole for a late run to just
be up. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE was forwardly placed in the early stages then made a three wide bid on the turn to engage the leader at the quarter pole
and drew clear but was nailed in the final jumps. CATINANDSCATIN raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from two or three
wide on the turn but was out kicked late. THE FIVE B'S was off the pace on the inside through the turn then move out to two or three wide in upper stretch
for a late run but was not enough. PALANTE had no impact. EASY CHANCE was roused to the lead through the turn then was headed at the quarter pole
and faded. BERNIE SPECIAL failed to menace. DOUBLE BOGEY prompted the pace to the three eighths pole and weakened.
