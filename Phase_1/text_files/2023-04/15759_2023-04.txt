VALERIE FIRST awaited room behind rivals on the turn, swung wide into the stretch and quickly pulled away while kept to her task. LIVE AID vied in the two
path, led narrowly on the turn, lost the advantage but finished willingly for the place. BOOM BOOM GIRL alternated for the lead inside and continued well in
the stretch. QUASAR prompted the pace four and three wide, led briefly in midstretch then yielded. WHAT A BEAUT lunged in the air at the break losing
any chance, rushed inside then gave way. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD dropped back after the start, chased extremely wide on the turn. THE BEAUTY'S TALE
forced the pace three wide between foes to the far turn and stopped. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

SEAMIALAUGH quickly moved clear, widened on the turn and remained safe throughout while under moderate pressure. LULINDA'S HEART went after the
winner wide on the turn and continued well to gain the place TWIRLING WIND saved ground in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and flattened out. TONALA
lagged far behind then split foes in the stretch with late energy. SWEET LILLY FACTUM made a menacing move to the quarter pole then weakened in the
final furlong. CLASSY MISS steadied leaving the chute, chased wide and was no factor. HALLIGIRL dropped back inside and was always outrun. HEY IT'S
TATI chased within striking range early but gave way readily.

Footnotes
PALM ISLAND stalked the pacesetter, bid on the turn, dueled into the stretch, gained a short lead, inched away, then held sway late after a long drive.
BURN THE EVIDENCE set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival in midstretch, battled back
and continued willngly to the finish. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail and earned the
show spot. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT was outrun early, moved up in the stretch, angled out and closed belatedly for fourth. THREEPETE broke outward,
raced off the rail, off the pace, chased two wide on the turn and weakened. VIRAL VIDEO was outrun early and did not factor. FLORIANOPOLIS raced off
the pace inside, was asked on the turn and failed to respond. PRIVATE CABANA tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and gave way.
