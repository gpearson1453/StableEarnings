Footnotes
STOP THE MADNESS unhurried in the early going, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide rally and drove clear before the wire. MINT JULIUS
raced evenly in the middle of the field in the beginning, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. AMELIES DREAMER went
to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the turn, weakened and lacked a finish. ASEEL raced within contention, made a bid and faded. CRAPAUD
brushed at the start, raced evenly near the back, improved position, but was no factor. SENSING GOLD broke out, steadied and was never a factor. DON'T
LOOK ETHEL raced within striking distance, came down the stretch wide and retreated. HALOS ALARM showed early speed, dropped back and was
outrun. BELLICOSE BABE void of early speed, lost contact and showed nothing.

Footnotes
REINA ACES raced in the middle of the pack, came around the turn four wide, rallied down the stretch and was going away at the end. THROUGH THE
CRACKS lacked early speed, made a steady gain, racing five wide around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. BON CHANCE
BET went to the front, drove clear, forwardly placed throughout and flattened out down the lane. SPARKLE CITY broke poorly, rushed up, pressed the pace
and faded. SHEEZA PRIORITY raced near the back, improved position, but was no factor. MALLORI'S MAGIC raced near the middle of the field and put
forth an even effort. MORO MILE HIGH showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and made a steady retreat. WITH GRACE broke in, always
raced near the back and was never a threat. UMEA ZING GRACE broke in, raced near the back and showed little.
