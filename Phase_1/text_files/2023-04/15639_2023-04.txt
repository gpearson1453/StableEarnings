FICHI and drove clear under brisk urging. LADRO DI FICHI hugged the inner rail on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, fought gamely inside the
winner but was not quite good enough. ISABELLA'S GLORY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed to the stretch while racing along the inner rail,

and tired after six furlongs. VOODOO MAMA JUJU came out leaving the starting gate, was well placed three wide on the turn and gave way. MERGER OF

Footnotes
BYK , off last when hopping at the break, was nudged up between rivals soon after, edged up three wide to take a tracking spot nearing the half mile
marker, went on the attack three deep leaving the far turn, sparred under some coaxing and gained a slim advantage heading to the five sixteenths,
responded to firmer asks and went clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed encouragement and held firm. INDYBOUND rushed along
the rail and joined PUTTHEPASTBEHIND, dueled inside rivals from the far turn to mid turn, eased back off the leaders heading to the lane, altered out and
came back nicely through the final seventy yards. PUTTHEPASTBEHIND opened up soon after the break while two wide, was joined from both sides
entering the turn, battled between runners around the turn, emerged in a tussle to the inside of BYK entering the stretch, failed to kick on with that one in
mid stretch and weakened late. I ONCE STOOD ALONE saved ground chasing the embattled leaders, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a serious
response. MIGHTY MINION , off the pace while saving ground early on, swung five wide into the lane but failed to rally. TROPHY ROOM chased off the rail
and faded.

ANGELOFCANTERBURY dueled inside, shook clear into the lane, drifted out a couple paths past the three sixteenths, was corrected and kept on under
strong handling leaving the furlong grounds then was fully extended to hold off ICE CUBE BABY. ICE CUBE BABY broke slowly, regrouped and edged up
wide into the turn, circled three wide into the stretch, ranged up past mid stretch, wandered outward and kept on grinding to just miss. COAL MINE lagged
off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, was guided well out in the track past mid stretch and closed steadily. MO MARTHA had speed, could not quite
quicken with the leaders into the turn, saved ground pursuing into the stretch, remained inside and kept trying to the wire. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM , carried
out some at the break, recovered and moved up heading to the half mile marker and chased the embattled leaders, raced between rivals leaving the three
eighths and faded. LADY SERENITY drifted out at the start, straightened and dueled outside the winner, was headed past the five sixteenths and tired
through the final furlong.

WAR CRY showed speed along the inner rail, failed to keep up in upper stretch, remained along the rail and passed a tired horse in deep stretch.
PEACHESSWEETNOTION circled the turn three wide, challenged for the lead turning for home and weakened late. SMOKE N SIN raced in the two path on
the turn while outrun. JUMP A FOX hugged the inner rail around the turn while outrun.

Footnotes
CLASSIER rated close up four wide and outside rivals, disputed the issue three deep and under confident handling mid turn, was nudged clear entering the
lane, powered away when put to some stiff asks past the three sixteenths, was kept to urging to the sixteenth marker then cruised home from there. GOING
TO THE LEAD vied early between runners, eased back off the leaders nearing the turn then tracked, awaited room nearing the quarter pole, swung out six
wide for the drive and came back on with decent energy to gain the place. O'TROUBLE rated off foes leaving the chute, edged up between rivals to be close
into the turn, came out a path and continued between runners into the stretch, gave willing pursuit past the furlong grounds then flattened out very late.
SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , four wide making a run past the five sixteenths, gave chase outside runners in mid stretch then faded late. HOLY
SYNCHRONICITY stumbled at the break, recovered and was sent up three wide between rivals to contest the pace, battled in the two path between foes
and under a hard ride mid turn, shifted out a bit chasing the winner soon into the lane, was inside rivals in mid stretch and faded. TREASURE TRADITION
saved ground while not too far back early, was coaxed along mid turn, shifted two to three wide and came up empty. WICKED PRANKSTER took a slim
lead inside horses early on, battled to mid turn and faltered.

Footnotes
IYWAAN stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up three wide leaving the far turn, responded to one left handed tap of the whip in upper stretch,
swept to command in mid stretch and drew away under a hand ride. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , unhurried down the backstretch, swung four wide leaving the far
turn and rallied outside horses. NOSTALGIC RUN took a two wide lead entering the backstretch, set the pace along the inner rail around the far turn and
weakened the final furlong. SHACKLED LOVE bumped and forced out DIXIE DRAWL when bearing out at the break, circled the first turn three wide, chased
the pace outside NOSTALGIC RUN and tired approaching the eighth pole. WORKIN ON A DREAM , bumped by DIXIE DRAWL when that one was forced
out soon after the break, sprinted to the early lead, moved to the inner rail entering the first turn, chased the pace and gave way in upper stretch. DIXIE
DRAWL , bumped around at the start, trailed.

PREPAREFORTAKEOFF broke a step slow then steadied when a bit rank, recovered and accelerated between foes to reach contention, bid three deep
leaving the far turn, dueled outside rivals then gained a slim lead soon into the stretch, briefly went clear, was confronted from her outside in deep stretch
and dug in tenaciously to prove best. RAISE YOUR GAME , forwardly placed four wide, circled five wide chasing the duelers into the lane, drew alongside
the winner inside the sixteenth marker, battled gamely but was denied. EXTRA CRUNCHY , two wide on the early lead, took inside pressure from
ROMANTIC COMEDY into the turn, dueled between runners around the turn, ceded command to the winner near the three sixteenths, fought on to the
inside of that one past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. DIAMONDS N DENIM , in range between rivals early, chased just behind the leading
trio past the five sixteenths, eased out with pursuit in upper stretch and kept trying to the wire. STORMI CAT LADY , off the pace and towards the inside mid
turn, swung well out in the track and had belated action. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , off slowly, raced widest in the drive and had a slight run. ROMANTIC
COMEDY , keen early, moved through along the rail to engage EXTRA CRUNCHY into the turn, dueled past the five sixteenths and faded in the drive.
