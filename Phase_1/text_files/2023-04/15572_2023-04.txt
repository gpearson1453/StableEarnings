BARTENDERS MISTAKE was moved outside through the first turn, moved up remaining four and five wide, rallied into the lane and closed late. FOR REEL
stalked the leaders along the inside, angled out into the lane and rallied but could not handle the winner. PHLASH DRIVE stalked the pace three and four
wide to bid into the lane but could not produce the needed late run. JOEY'S VALENTINE made the pace on a short lead off the rail and came up empty in
the drive. L B GOLD was outside while back early, fanned seven wide into the lane and moved up while not a serious threat. KENHEDOIT stalked the pace
three wide, was caught in tight quarters nearing the lane and was shuffled back then could not recover. WANT TO BE COWBOY prompted the pace two to
three wide, was caught in tight quarters nearing the lane and dropped back. Both the riders of WANT TO BE COWBOY and KENHEDOIT lodged claims of
foul alleging interference turning for home which were not allowed.

CHIVE UP vied outside rivals on the early pace, bid and edged clear early in the far turn then moved off through the lane under steady hand urging while
tapped lightly late. DIXIE PENNY stalked the pace three and four wide while never far back, gained the place late while never a threat to the winner. LOVE
TO LEARN saved ground back off the early, moved out in the lane and rallied to gain third. JAZZ BRUNCH contested the pace along the inside to the far
turn and weakened in the drive. ALWAYS A TIZ contested the early pace between rivals and tired through the far turn. HARLONS COMMISION lacked a bid
racing out from the rail. QUEENS GIFT was always back.

STEPHEN'S ANSWER was on the pace about the three path outside a rival early, edged clear into the far turn then held the margin under steady handling
in the lane. GRAND DESIGN moved out and gained position three wide in the far turn to get nearest the winner but could not run that one down. LARCH
rallied five wide in the far turn to have aim at the top pair but could not close the gap. SHWEET PERSUASION moved outside in the far turn and waited
behind rivals, swung six wide into the lane and moved up. CAPTAIN DON showed early speed along the inside and weakened. WYOMING CONQUEST
stalked the early leaders three to four wide and weakened. BARSTOW was always back.

Footnotes
SCOOTER'S BOY settled back off the early pace three wide, rallied outside through the far turn to come five wide into the lane and ran down
CAESARTHERULER through the closing sixteenth. CAESARTHERULER stalked the pace inside to bid through the far turn and move clear into the lane but
could not hold the winner safe. JUST RIGHT MIKE dueled on the early lead outside AWESOME FAMILY to the far turn and weakened into the lane.
SPORTY FLYER stalked the pace three or four wide and weakened. YOUNG PHILLIP saved ground, angled out once straightened into the lane but had no
rally. AWESOME FAMILY dueled on the early pace inside a rival and weakened. MY TRUE REWARD saved ground and failed to threaten. BREAK FREE
tired racing outside. TWICE THE PRICE reared at the break and got away very slowly, lost contact with the field turning into the backstretch and was pulled
