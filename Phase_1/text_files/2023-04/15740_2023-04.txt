Footnotes
HEADS OR TAILS saved ground around the turn while chasing the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, swept to the lead under urging inside
the sixteenth pole and held sway. GILLIGAN lacked speed, swung four deep leaving the turn and closed outside the winner. YOUNG TURK , taken to the
inner rail after sprinting clear leaving the backstretch, maintained a clear advantage to mid stretch and gave way late. LITTLE BAY had a mild rally near the
inner rail. SUTTON VALLEY , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. DIMMI QUANDO wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. ADDY'S
LADDY T N T gave way mid way on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
LIL SPINNER took over early and set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up after being roused two wide in upper stretch, was kept alert with right
handed asks leaving mid stretch and held firm. AUNTIE RONA , between rivals a long way while pursuing the pace, dropped in approaching the stretch,
eased back out for the final furlong and closed willingly. NAMI settled off the pace and removed from the inside, angled five wide into the lane, straightened
and kept on with a steady grind. SING SCAT bobbled outward at the break, recovered and raced three deep chasing the pace, came four wide the drive,
switched over to her correct lead in mid stretch and faded. MONTANA ROSE prompted the pace two to three wide, was put to a strong ride pursuing past
the three eighths, failed to kick on and faded through the drive. MODERN SOCIETY edged up inside rivals early on, gave chase into the turn, lacked a
punch nearing mid turn and retreated.

Footnotes
SPEAK UNITY , nicely rated in the two path around the turn, worked between horses through the stretch, eased outside BATTLEBUS in mid stretch and
wore down that one late. BATTLEBUS , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead well off the rail in upper stretch and gave way
grudgingly. FLASHINTHENIGHT , well off the rail and off the pace around the turn, checked behind a wall of horses in mid stretch then rallied gamely
between rivals. BOURBON AND ICE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, flattened out in the drive. GREAT GO GO sprinted to the early lead, set
the pace along the inner rail, lost the advantage in upper stretch and weakened late. W W SPRINGTIME , four wide on the turn, floated six deep entering
the stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. BALI'S SHADE , outside horses on the turn, chased the pace, drifted five wide turning for home
and weakened. FIELDER hugged the inner rail throughout and weakened in the drive. RUDY ROD was not a factor. CURLIN'S MALIBU was outrun.

BEST CHOICE BABY , perched three wide off the embattled leaders, moved to engage three deep leaving the far turn, gained a slim advantage battling
outside ALLIGATOR ARMS nearing the quarter pole, responded when put to firm asking entering the stretch, spurted clear in mid stretch then steadily
widened while kept to strong encouragement. ALLIGATOR ARMS disputed the pace two wide outside STEP AHEAD, put a head in front when dueling
between foes near the three eighths, emerged in a tussle to the inside of the winner approaching the stretch, could not match strides leaving the three
sixteenths but kept on with good effort to the wire. BUBBA CHROME , between rivals leaving the five eighths, saved ground leaving the three eighths,
swung four wide into the lane and churned on. STEP AHEAD drifted in at the break and was off a touch slow, corrected and was gunned up to the inside of
rivals to put a head in front, dueled leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace with the leaders into the lane and faded. MUNGO MAGIC broke sharply, chased
three wide and faded in the final furlong. SPUNKY IRISHMAN , away last when rank, lagged back into the turn, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to
menace. MOON STORM , shoved along with early chase, failed to keep up leaving the far turn, saved ground and retreated.

Footnotes
THEGIRLFROMIRELAND rated kindly two wide and in range, advanced three wide under asking and engaged LUSTY entering the lane, took a short lead
soon after, sparred with that one to mid stretch, shook clear then steadily edged away under a drive. LUSTY cleared early, set the pace towards the rail,
was ridden along maintaining a clear lead past the five sixteenths, dug in when confronted near the lane, kept the winner honest past mid stretch then gave
way grudgingly to be second best. DETERMINED EMPIRE drifted out some at the break, corrected and stalked towards the inside, dropped back a bit
under asking near the five sixteenths, angled out for the drive and came back on in willing fashion. WINGS OF A SONG , forced out a bit at the break,
prompted the pace two wide, was hemmed in briefly nearing the lane, chased from the three sixteenths and faded. WARIDI CANDY was steadied between
foes soon after the break, dropped well back while saving ground, gained along the rail nearing the far turn, eased out to move between foes mid way on the
final turn, swung well wide for the drive and churned on. GYPSY QUEEN saved ground in a good spot, was pushed along leaving the far turn but never
generated a serious run. SHE GOT THE MUNNI settled off the pace, saved ground near the five sixteenths, eased out in the drive but failed to menace.
ZIPPY DO DA DAY , bumped at the break, settled off the inside, made a mild four wide advance nearing the lane then flattened out. TENACIOUS
TRAVELER , bumped at the break, raced three wide in mid pack early on, faltered after six furlongs and was being eased late. BROOKLYN GIRL , four
wide around the first turn, remained wide through the backstretch run, retreated leaving the far turn and was eased late. MISS ANTIETAM was steadied at
the break, took up sharply then stumbled when in tight entering the first turn forcing her rider to lose the irons, recovered to be well off the pace and wide,
dropped further back entering the stretch, was eased and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry into MISS ANTIETAM's run into the first turn. No action
was deemed necessary.

drive. BOSSYNESS saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. COCKTAIL DREAMING , bumped by BLACK

then swung to the five path in upper stretch. NEED A MARKER , fractious in the starting gate, chased the pace between horses around the turn and

BRZINA accelerated to the inside of rivals and took the lead after a furlong, moved away under some rating into the turn, widened past the five sixteenths,
was guided off the inside soon into the stretch, kept on under right handed asks in mid stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch and held sway. ROYAL
WHISPER hesitated at the break spotting the field a few lengths, recovered and settled, advanced between runners around the turn, swung five wide for the
drive and finished with good energy. SPARKLE SPRINKLE , taken to rate three wide early on, circled four wide under a ride and picked up some steam into
the stretch, gave hard chase in mid stretch then flattened out late. SUMMER ODDS saved ground off the pace, eased out to go around a rival nearing the
quarter pole, dropped back in and came up empty. TAM CHAR broke a step slow, raced in hand four wide mid turn, came under a ride leaving the three
sixteenths and finished with interest. SHINELIKEADIAMOND had speed between rivals, saw the winner clear off near the half, chased three wide into the
lane, angled in some and gave way. SIZZLING HOT gave early chase, saved ground into the stretch and weakened.

OUT OF LUCK , well back off of a three pronged duel, gathered momentum under asking mid turn, angled five wide into the lane, straightened and
sustained under right handed asking and just got up to nip MARIA FROM MIAMI. MARIA FROM MIAMI dueled to the inside of a pair of rivals into and
around the turn, emerged in battle with SAVI DANCER from the head of the lane, held a narrow advantage past the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly but
was edged at the wire. SAVI DANCER disputed the pace three deep and held a slim lead into the lane, was headed in upper stretch, stayed on to duel
outside the winner through the final three sixteenths, kept on with good effort but wasn't quite good enough. BEST WORST IDEA broke a bit slow, pulled
her way forward and quickly gained along the rail near the half, tracked the dueling trio, angled four wide for the drive, chased past mid stretch but came up
empty late. LADY LANCER saved ground chasing the leaders, dropped back around the turn, stayed inside and came back some in the final furlong.
MUNNIS PRETTY , off the embattled leaders while three wide, had a mild response but failed to threaten. BLONDE SAMARITAN broke a step slow, raced
