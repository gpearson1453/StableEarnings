GENERAL THAYER vied for the early lead from the outside of foe and edged clear late under strong handling. GO FOR THE LAUGH was off a step slow,
vied from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. MASK OFF raced mid pack early on, moved up from the inside around the far turn and slowly closed in
on the top pair. DINOS DA DADDY chased the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late. HOT CHARLIE chased the pace while
racing three wide and had no response. TWO SOCKS MAC was off slowly, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never
threatened. ZENFULLY ZESTY raced off the early going, was five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.
