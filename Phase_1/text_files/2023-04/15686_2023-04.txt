Footnotes
WEDONTBELIEVEHER coaxed from the gate, raced four wide just off the pace, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
a furlong out, dug in knocking heads to the finish and gamely fended off her main rival to prevail. TWICE SMITTEN hustled from the start, showed the way
from the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong
out, fought on gamely inside but was ultimately repelled to the wire. GYPSY JANIE hustled from the gate, chased inside briefly before tipping to the three
path at the nine-sixteenths, tucked back along the inside through the turn before angling out seven wide into upper stretch, then improved position to secure
the show honors. LEFT LEANING LUCY hustled from the start, chased along the inside briefly before tipping to the three path at the nine-sixteenths, went
three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BELLS ON HER TOES two to three
wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. VALLARAND
coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.
EXFILTRATION chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
DESERT DALLIANCE went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, took the lead in
the four path coming to the three-eighths, shook clear with five-sixteenths to run, dropped to the three path into the stretch then responded well while
shaken up, drew away under a solid-hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. WISHING ON A STAR bobbled at the start
then bumped with a foe, became rank nearing the first turn, tossed her head badly while very rank in the two path around the opening bend, remained keen
under restraint early on the backstretch, leveled out before the half-mile pole, came under urging outside the half-mile pole, raced in the two path early on
the far turn then shifted four wide, came five wide into the stretch and earned the place while no threat to the winner. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE angled in
while going to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, was headed nearing the three-eighths, lost touch with the winner late on that bend and
proved no match then lost the place while able to get the show. AFILADA went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three then four
wide on the far turn and failed to rally. DUCKPHAT bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the
back, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn and was no factor. VODKATINI traveled around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace
on the outside of the leader, came up empty while two to three wide on the final turn and retreated. TONIGHT WE LOVE was taken in hand when the leader
crossed in front early, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled on the inside of an opponent, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths then moved in
under urging, saved ground on the far turn and faltered.

COLLOQUY bobbled at the break and was bumped between foes at the start getting away last, raced four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the eighth pole, inched away under a drive to prevail.
MIDNIGHT WORKER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught a furlong from home, ran on to preserve the place honors. CENTAVO chased along the inside, got out to
the two path just inside the half mile pole forcing SALUTE TO AMERICA to steady off his heels and was bumped in behind getting spun out a bit more
before being corrected back to be along the rail, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure
the show honors. SKYLANDER chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish.
HIGHER QUALITY broke out at the start bumping VOLIERO, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
weakened. SALUTE TO AMERICA chased three then two wide and was forced to steady off the heels of CENTAVO when that rival got out directly in front,
make contact with the rear of that rival forcing CENTAVO to spin out a little more than had the contact not been made nearing the seven-sixteenths, tipped
out three then four wide at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. VOLIERO got bumped at the start by HIGHER QUALITY,
chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
REIGNING CHICK dropped back while climbing into the kickback outside the five-eighths then moved to the outside, moved from four to three wide early on
the turn then went back to the four path, shifted five wide late on the bend, was driven seven wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong,
closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up to prevail under steady handling. DIVA BANKER broke a bit awkwardly and was last to
commence, raced off the pace under urging, went four wide around most of the turn then move to the five path, spun six wide into the stretch, rallied to get
the lead inside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the place. TRIPLE P was hustled from the gate, chased the
leading duo on the outside then in the three path around the turn, gained in the four path into the stretch then took the lead near the three-sixteenths, lost
the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then bumped with a rival and weakened while just able to get the show. CHAYSENBRYN was sent hard from the
start then hard ridden on the outside, went four then three wide early on the turn, reached the two path briefly around the three-eighths then moved back to
the three path, shifted four wide later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, made a brief bid nearing the
sixteenth-pole then brushed with a foe, drifted out shortly thereafter and bumped with the same opponent and was out-kicked then just missed the show.
SHASTA STAR broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. TARA'S TALENT dropped back while ridden along, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. BEAUTIFUL KAREN disputed the pace on the outside of an opponent, vied in the two path around the turn, brushed with a foe outside the furlong
marker and weakened. QUALITY STONES contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, brushed with a rival outside the furlong
marker and tired.

CITIZEN K coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, then
drew off under a drive to prevail. FATIMA'S BLESSING lightly coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT tracked along
the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to
preserve the show honors. STARQUIST three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path and tracked from there in closest aim of the leader, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MR. KRINGLE just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide
from mid pack, got set down when angled five wide at the head of the stretch, then weakened in the drive. TIMBUKTU three wide through the first turn,
tracked four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went
five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. NOBLE HUNTSMAN settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked to the inside half a mile
from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch put to some encouragement and trailed.

MERCANTE went three wide around the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused two to three wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch,
closed strongly on the outside to make a bid inside the furlong marker and got up to prevail under strong handling. WHENLOVETAKESOVER saved ground
on the first turn, dropped back onto the backstretch, moved closer with five furlongs to run, raced inside on the far turn, was roused in the two path into the
stretch, moved out approaching the furlong marker, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with foes to the wire and just missed while narrowly able
to get the place. OHANA HONOR was eased back early then dropped in, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in the back half of the field, saved
ground around the far turn, was roused late on that bend, steadied while waiting for optimal room in upper stretch, was roused again outside the furlong
marker, moved out a path or two while gaining outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to get the show. EQUAL PROTECTION moved
from the rail to the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked with three furlongs to run, traveled between foes in the two path on the far
turn, waited while lacking room behind horses into upper stretch, found room while put to a drive outside the furlong marker, gained to make a bid in the final
sixteenth and finished willingly to just miss the show. FAST BOAT TO SKYE went to the front, dropped in entering the first turn, raced inside around that
bend, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, led under a drive
to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just missed the superfecta. WON AN AWARD went three wide around the first turn, settled just off the pace on
the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, chased four wide into the stretch then pursued the leader, brushed with a foe while between

turn, saved ground around that bend, tracked off the rail while in hand down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into
the stretch, brushed with a foe near the furlong marker and was outfinished. TWIRLER leaned in at the start the was grabbed with the right rein, angled in at

out and lacked the needed response. STEADY SCHEMING went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn and
came up empty.

Footnotes
MY FIRST LOVE tracked the pace along the inside near the rear of the field early on before advancing on the front into contention five furlongs from home,
took over command half a mile out and showed the way through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch under challenge, rebuffed that rival nearing the eighth pole, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE broke out at the start
and was corrected, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the
place honors while never threatening the winner. JULIANA'S ROSE bumped at the start by FREDDYMO FACTOR, chased six then five wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, bid four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DASHING DELLA chased five then four wide offering a bid through the
latter portion of the turn to latch on the eventual winner when swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was repelled nearing the
eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. CAPTIVATING CARA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got displaced from the
front half a mile from home and gave chase through the turn under coaxing from midway, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
CHASING DAYLIGHT three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
FREDDYMO FACTOR broke out at the start bumping JULIANA'S ROSE, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to
eight wide into upper stretch and tired. KEEN DANCER five paths off the inside early on, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four to five wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
NOTHING BETTER showed speed on the outside of a foe then moved clear near the half-mile pole, was challenged to his outside late on the backstretch,
vied inside on the turn, fought inside of INTO THE SUNRISE into the final furlong, disposed of that rival coming to the sixteenth-pole and held under strong
urging. STRAIGHT ANSWER (GB) settled at the rear, went three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch then quickly moved further out,
rallied outside into the final furlong and finished fast to garner the place. VOODOO ZIP settled towards the back, raced inside to the two path around the
turn, came three wide into the stretch then angled further out and finished willingly for the show. YES AND YES settled on the outside, was urged three to
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, held a good striking position under a drive into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed
kick then just missed the show. THIN WHITE DUKE settled in the front half of the field, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, chased the leader in the stretch and was out-kicked then just missed the superfecta. INTO THE SUNRISE showed speed on
the inside of the winner then was eased back near the half-mile pole, switched to the outside shortly thereafter, made an outside bid at the seven-sixteenths,
vied in the two path around the turn, battled outside the winner under a drive until inside the furlong marker then weakened. COINAGE settled off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. COMEDY TOWN chased the leading duo on the outside, went two to
three wide around the turn, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and capitulated. SLIPSTREAM settled towards the back, traveled around
the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
