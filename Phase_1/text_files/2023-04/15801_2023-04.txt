Footnotes
WHY BEHAVE set the pace along the inside, shook free in upper stretch, drifted out entering the final sixteenth while a pair of outer rivals chased, and held
sway. HIGH SPEED broke inwardly, recovered to a stalking position, pursued from the two path around the turn tipped outside off the top pair entering the
lane, offered a grinding charge while flopping to, then from, his left lead at the furlong grounds, and did not have enough to reel in the leaders.
HOLDONTOYOURTIARA pressed outside of the leader, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch while pursuing along with an outer foe, and
lost place to that rival at the furlong pole. SHE'S GONE D'WILD lagged behind the rest, then stayed on along the inside. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT tracked in
the three path and between horses, but gave way in the four path in upper stretch. RISATA chased in the four to five paths, and weakened entering the
lane.

Footnotes
DECK OF CARDS took a bump from an inner rival at the start, set the pace from a pressing foe while in the two path before moving to the rail down the
backstretch, met an outer bidder's challenge turning for home, got narrowly headed by her in upper stretch, but took a mild bump from that one inside the
final furlong, regained an advantage in the aftermath, and edged away late. GHOSTLY GIRL came out a touch at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted
outside of the top pair nearing the far turn, ranged up to bid at the quarter pole, forged a narrow advantage from the pace-setter in upper stretch, but shifted
in and bumped that one leaving the furlong grounds, and gradually yielded in the closing stages. THE CLUB leaned out and bumped a rival at the start,
pressed two wide, but required urging to sustain pressing position around the far turn as an outer rival ranged up, but yielded between horses entering the
lane, yet held show from rivals on both sides through the closing stages. LEGERITY laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, but failed to respond to
urging in the four path around the far turn. HASHTAG WINNER was snatch up under firm restraint after breaking in a bit at the start, lagged behind around
the first turn, improved inside of a rival into the far turn, but made little impact thereafter. LA TOURISTA lacked speed in the three to four paths, but was
through entering the far turn.

Footnotes
COUTH prompted the pace three wide, bid under confident handling turning for home, responded to gain an advantage once set down at the three
sixteenths pole, and drove clear. WASHINGTON'S UNION laid off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turn, swung to the seven path entering
the lane, and rallied to gain place in the final furlong. LONE LEADER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, gained an advantage at the three
furlong pole, dug in to resist his outer counterpart's challenge turning for home, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, and tired through the late
stages. KISLOVODSK settled off of the pace in the three to four paths, was bottled up between horses turning for home, split foes at the three sixteenths
pole, but leveled off without reaching contention. BIG POPPER was slow into stride, raced far back along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, and stayed on between horses. BLUEGRASS LUTE pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses, shifted to the five path in upper
stretch, but lacked a bid. HAIL ALLEN got hung in the five path whilst midpack, then gave way in the six path in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead.
LUCKY SMILE broke a step slow, chased the leaders from the two path while inside of rivals, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. KVETCHING MAW
was reluctant to load, lacked speed, and was outrun in the three path. OFF THE CUFF set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, but was headed at the three
furlong pole, and stopped. BATTLE BORN chased two wide and between horses under a strong drive around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SILK TRADE tracked in the four path, bid for the lead turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds,
and held sway from an outer pursuer late. GUN IT tracked in the two path, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, then stayed on well while hanging on his
left lead, gained place at the sixteenth pole, and was closing the gap on the clear leader late. GREENER PASTURES laid off of the pace in the three path,
inched closer in the five path turning for home, gained place while hanging on his left lead at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked for that position at the
sixteenth pole. POLE SETTER set the pace in the two path around the turn, got headed in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but weakened while
changing over in midstretch. LEGAL DEAL laid close up along the inside, but under steady coaxing, then weakened at the three furlong pole. MARKET
ANALYSIS stalked in the three path and between horses, but failed to offer a bid along with his outer counterpart turning for home, and faded. NEWBOMB
took bumped from rivals on both sides, before backing out of crowded quarters soon after the start, and trailed thereafter.

LOVELY PRINCESS stalked along the inside, took aim on the clearing leader two wide entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, led
entering the final sixteenth, and held from an outer bidder late. MISE EN SCENE (GB) fidgeted moments before the gates sprung causing her to spot the
field multiple lengths at the start, trailed two wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes with a late kick in the final furlong, gained place
nearing the wire while closing in on the leader, but ran out of ground. BEECHNUT TROPHY pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader while
floated three wide entering the lane, kept on through the final furlong to re-bid for place in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked for that position approaching
the wire, and saved show. MYRISKYAFFAIR set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer presser entering the lane, but met another foe's challenge
at the furlong grounds, got headed approaching the final sixteenths, and gave way. SHE'S GONE pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted ground out
around the far turn, brushed with an inner rival while spinning into the lane in the four path, then lacked the needed rally to offer a bid, got outkicked for
minor placings at the sixteenth pole, and missed on reaching show. READY LADY tracked two wide, brushed with an outer rival while in the three path
entering the lane, and lacked a bid while chasing behind the main group through the final furlong. KATHAAN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
MISS MARIE laid off of the pace two wide, and faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
CLASS ACTOR vied two wide and between horses, sparred with his inner counterpart through a long battle, edged ahead in the final sixteenth, and
narrowly lasted from an outer oncharging foe late. MR. KEATING bumped an outer rival at the start before taking a bump from that one soon after, laid off of
the pace in the two path, split foes three wide while brushing with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, surged in pursuit of the leader late, but just ran out of
ground. BILLY JACK set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, dueled with CLASS ACTOR through the lane while gamely sustaining the long battle, but
gave in inside the final sixteenth. MOREAU took a bump from an inner rival leaving the gates, returned the favor soon after, pursued from midpack in the
two path, moved between horses turning for home, gained show in midstretch, but was outkicked nearing the final sixteenth, and desperately saved fourth
late. GILDED CRAKEN was a bit tough to load, pursued from midpack tow wide and between horses, was urged along in the three path around the turn,
shifted six wide in upper stretch, and rallied to miss reaching fourth at the wire. DE LA CALLES broke a step slow before being brushed by an outer rival at
the start, lacked speed along the inside, then moved up. FIVE STAR G MAN propped after breaking greenly, spotted the field multiple lengths down the
backstretch, closed the gap while fanning to the ten path in midstretch, and showed good late interest. CIGARETTE BOAT prompted three wide, but yielded
in the four path entering the lane, and weakened while brushing with rivals on either side at the furlong grounds. FAST FORWARD chased from the three to
five paths, and lacked a bid. SOLEVO lacked speed in the three path, and never got involved. CARTOGRAPHER chased along the inside, but weakened
turning for home. TARHE pursued from midpack three wide, but faded in the four to six paths turning for home.

Footnotes
AUNT BECCA rushed to set the pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer bidders into the turn, got headed while remaining in hand approaching the
five sixteenths, regained an advantage at the quarter pole before being set down in upper stretch, and readily responded to draw away. SOCIALLY
SELECTIVE pressed two wide and between horses, forged an advantage approaching the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with her inner
counterpart while spinning into the lane in the three path, quickly proved no match in upper stretch, and remained clear of the rest. CHARLEE MAE stalked
along the inside, but lacked a bid. FROSHADO stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home, but faded while coming into the lane in the four path, lugged
in while changing leads in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead under a right handed crop entering the final furlong, and weakened. DEVIOUS
STARES went wrong behind at the nine sixteenths pole, was quickly pulled up, and got vanned off.

Footnotes
VERSTAPPEN settled off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide into the final bend, swung six wide entering the lane, rallied along with an inner RED
KNIGHT to bid at the furlong grounds, sparred with that foe through the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. RED KNIGHT trailed two wide, took the last turn
in the three path while behind foes, shifted five wide in upper stretch, rallied along to bid along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, dueled with that one
through the late stages, and got outfinished. ANOTHER MYSTERY rated at the rear along the inside, took closer order entering the backstretch, chased
behind the leaders in upper stretch, aimed to split foes two wide at the furlong grounds while being outkicked by the eventual top two, then got through
entering the final sixteenth to claim show. CHANNEL MAKER pressed two wide, vied under urging around the final turn, spun into the lane in the three path,
but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals while giving way between horses at the furlong grounds. TIZ THE BOMB was sent to the fore, set the pace inside
of a pressing rival, held a margin through upper stretch, but was outkicked by outer bidders at the furlong grounds, and subsequently weakened. HOWE
STREET pursued from midpack in the three path, moved closer to stalk the top two entering the second turn, but failed to keep pace with them entering the
lane in the four path, and yielded between horses approaching midstretch. RISING EMPIRE stalked outside of the leading pair around the first turn, tucked
behind them to pursue from the two path approaching the wire for the first time, tracked two wide around the final bend, but lacked a response to urging
behind and among foes in upper stretch, encountered traffic entering the final furlong, but gave way thereafter. VALUE ENGINEERING tracked from
midpack along the inside, shifted out to the three path leaving the second turn, fanned to the five path while between horses entering the lane, but faded
soon after.

Footnotes
RATTLE N ROLL trailed along the inside early on, commenced an early move in the latter half of the first turn, gained inside of rivals to achieve a stalking
position with five furlongs to go, pursued from the two path around the far turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane to take aim on the top pair, drove
past them leaving the three sixteenths pole, inched clear in the final furlong, and held sway. CALL ME FAST bobbled slightly leaving the gates, tracked in
the two path, pursued in hand in the three path while aiming between horses around the far turn, split rivals four wide in upper stretch, and ran on to gain
place in the closing stages. PIONEER OF MEDINA set the pace inside of a pressing rival while just off of the inner rail, turned away that foe while getting
headed by the eventual winner passing the three sixteenths pole, fought on while gradually unable to keep pace with that one in the final furlong, then lost
place to an outer foe late. HAPPY AMERICAN rated at the rear in the three path, inched closer in the four to five paths around the far turn, fanned to the six
path entering the lane, yet only offered a mild kick to gain a minor share in the final sixteenth. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING tracked in the four path, chased
under urging around the far turn, spun into the lane in the five path, but required rider's assistance to change lead at the three sixteenths pole, and gave
way. TRADEMARK pressed the leader from the three path while under snug restraint around the first turn, vied around the far turn, but weakened between
horses passing the three sixteenths pole. TAWNY PORT lacked speed while under consistent light coaxing in the three path, but was through passing the
three furlong pole, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
FRONT RUN THE FED bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, raced at the rear along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted to
the four path in upper stretch, rallied between horses at the furlong grounds, tipped inwardly for clear sailing soon after, and surged between the leaders in
the final sixteenth. MARK OF THE Z bumped an inner rival in the opening stages, tracked in midpack three wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane,
sustained a grinding charge to attempt a bid in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an inner rival in the process, then gained place. JUST MIGHT set
the pace in the two path while feeling pressure from an outer rival, kicked clear in upper stretch, maintained a margin through midstretch, but tired in the final
furlong, was caught in the final sixteenth, and lost place late. NOBODY LISTENS pressed the leader from the three path, failed to keep pace with that
clearing foe while in the four path in upper stretch, yet kept on entering the final furlong, closed in again to attempt a bid in the final sixteenth, but was
simultaneously outkicked by rivals on either side. BEER CAN MAN acted up momentarily while awaiting the off, tracked along the inside, but only managed
to chase in the two path through the lane while lacking a bid. ANGASTON took contact from rivals on both sides soon after the start, trailed in the four path,
swung to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up late. SMOKIN' JAY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, spun to the five path in
upper stretch, but lacked a rally. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. NOBALS got a bit antsy waiting for others to load,
then was bumped by rivals on both sides soon after the start, laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, but backed out of tight quarters at the
three furlong pole, and made little impact. DOWAGIAC CHIEF broke outwardly, laid off of the pace five to four wide around the turn, shifted six wide entering
the lane, and never got involved. CITY DRIFTER stalked two wide, then weakened in the three path and between horses in midstretch.
