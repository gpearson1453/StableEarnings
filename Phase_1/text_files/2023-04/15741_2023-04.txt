Footnotes
MISS DISTINCTIVE broke well, allowed to settle into stride off the pace, launched a sustained rally from the three-eighths pole splitting horses to take
command in the lane and draw off under constant urging. CRIMSON LADY dueled for the early lead down the backstretch, opened a clear advantage on the
turn and could not hold off the winner. POET LAUREATE away at the rear of the field, trailed to the top of the lane and launched a belated five wide rally in
the lane to gain the show. CHEER UP raced up the rail to battle for the lead and gave way through the stretch. MRSG'S LIL DREAMER tracked the leaders
through midway on the turn and tired through the lane while drifting out.

THETEASERGOTLOOSE allowed to settle into stride at the rear of the field, commenced a rally leaving the three-eighths pole from the inside, angled out
for the drive and closed with a rush to be going away at the wire. LIBBIES BABY broke alertly to take command, dueled on the lead, opened a clear
advantage at the top of the lane, could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. MISSINGYOUCRAZY tracked the pacesetters from the rail, angled
three wide to threaten entering the stretch but failed to sustain the rally. SASSY FLYER pressed the pace to the quarter pole and flattened out. RUBY
SOHO well positioned throughout but tired turning for home. DIVAESQUE raced near the rear of the field and never was a factor.

GUNFLASH chased the pace while six wide, was strongly urging throughout the turn and into the lane, dug in gamely mid stretch to kick clear under a
strong hand drive proving best in the end. U. S. ARMY vied for the lead from the inside into the turn, then continued to rally gamely down the stretch and
was best for second place. AARON'S SPIRIT chased the leaders from the four path, then bid on the turn to rally in the late stretch but it was not enough in
the end. FAST TRAFFIC raced behind the field while two wide then made a mild bid on the turn to close well from the three path down the stretch.
KLIMTOMANIAC was impeded at the start, then raced along the inside behind the field, menaced on the turn then bid evenly throughout the stretch.
CLAY'S BLACK OPAL vied for the lead while three deep then rallied between rivals on the turn before giving way in the stretch. PERFECT PRANK chased
the pace while five wide, bid on the turn, then flattened out in the lane. STRAIGHT LUCK vied for the lead while two wide, was in a hard drive throughout the
turn, was used up, then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
PITALE battled on the lead for a half mile, took command turning for home and finished in a drive to prevail. PROPERLY CONNECTED moved up along the
inside to set the pace, battled the winner to mid-stretch, and finished gamely to be second best. LOOPY DUDE broke alertly and stalked the leaders
throughout but failed to gain in the drive. G B'S TURBO raced at the front of the second flight and failed to mount a rally. FREEPORT went evenly
throughout while never threatening. DEVITO settled near the rear of the pack early, rallied mildly in the turn and flattened out. PIONEER TOWN was
prominently placed for a half mile and tired. G'S LAW showed little. WAY TOO WINDY trailed the field and was never a factor.

JACKMAN'S RIDE moved up swiftly along the inside to gain the lead, cleared the turn, then drew clear in the stretch under a strong drive to prevail in the
end. SEIZE THE TREASURE raced along the inside, slowly gaining ground throughout the turn to menace in the upper stretch and finished well for the
place prize. TAPISTAR tracked the pace while three wide, rallied on the turn and into the stretch then gave way in the end and was out finished for place.
FAR FROM FINAL chased the pace from the two path into the turn then rallied from the four path down the lane but came up empty in the end. JR'S
PACIFICO was away well, then was out bid by an inner rival for the lead, then slowly faded throughout the turn, bid in the stretch from the three path and
was no threat. HE'S A BOMB chased the lead while three wide, was moving up to bid on the turn from the two path, lost crop and had no final bid in the
stretch. STAN'S MIRACLE MAN was out run and failed to rally.

Footnotes
GIRL ON THE GO settled in mid-pack along the fence, started a sustained rally leaving the three-eights pole, split horses turning for home and prevailed in
a long drive to the wire. MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL reserved off the early pace, moved into contention down the backside, forced to rally five wide and finished
gamely in a good effort. CHARMING LEAH lacking early foot, raced near the rear of the field, circled through the far turn and closed with a belated rush to
just miss the place. DEAR BEAU (IRE) stalked the pace from four wide through the first turn, moved up to take command down the backside, led in the lane
and was out-finished late in the going. DIAMOND GRAND was well positioned along the rail while prominent to the quarter pole but failed to gain in the
stretch. CONCEAL pressed the pace from between horses for three-quarters and weakened turning for home. GRACIE'S KITTEN well placed down the
backstretch, threatened on the far turn and flattened out. CECE WAVE broke well to set the early pace, dueled for half a mile and tired. MIZZ ALL
AMERICAN was never a factor at the rear of the field.

Footnotes
GAMMA RAY reserved off the early pace, mounted a rally at the three-eighths pole while circling four wide and prevailed under strong urging down the lane.
BIG STORY taken in handed and angled out early to race wide into the first turn, took the lead down the backside and was out-finished in a game effort.
PICKINGUPSTRANGERS raced mid-pack down the backside, lacked racing room through the far turn and finished well when clear. VICTOR VALENTINO
pressed the pace from between horses, challenged at the top of the lane and finished willingly. GIST pinched at the break to trail the field and rallied in the
lane passing tired rivals. ONE MORE BABY well positioned while tracking the leaders to top of the stretch and came up empty. TEXAS PRADO was
prominent early and steadily faded. JOAN'S JUNIOR flashed brief speed and was through early.

dig in gamely in the early stretch, then vied with inner rivals in late stretch and was up just in time to prove best. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT stalked the pace
from the three path down the backstretch, was under a strong drive throughout the second turn, angled in towards the rail to menace in the early stretch,
then vied for win in deep stretch but hung in the end and was second best. TUDELA was two wide heading into the first turn, then gained command in the
early backstretch, cleared the second turn, rallied in the upper stretch, then vied to keep the lead in deep stretch but was out finished in the end and was
best for the show prize. MISSION BELLE chased the pace from the three path, then bid while four wide on the far turn to rally gamely in the upper stretch,
vied for the lead between rivals in the final furlong but hung in the end. PRINCESS PAULINE chased the pace in the middle of the field from the inside, then
bid mildly on the far turn to close well in the stretch. QUINN ELLA lead the way into the first turn, then was over taken for the lead down the early
backstretch, was under a steady hand ride throughout the far turn to rally mid stretch but came up empty in the end. LEARNING TO WIN was unhurried
early, then settled while two wide down the backstretch, was moving up throughout the second turn to bid from the sixth path down the home stretch but it
was too little too late. DISCREET SMILE chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then steadied on the far turn and lost momentum in the
stretch. FEELING HAPPY was shuffled back shortly after the start, was unhurried early, then settled along the rail down the backstretch, bid while four wide
on the turn and into the stretch and was no threat. MY BABYS GONE chased the pace while four wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to rally
in the stretch but did not fire.
