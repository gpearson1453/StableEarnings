CREES VALENTYME set the pace along the inside, then was headed nearing the quarter pole, turned back that bid and edged away late to prove best,
driving. MISS ARKANSAS was well placed along the inside and hard held, tipped out and made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole to go on even terms
for the lead, dueled to the furlong marker but hung while staying on to be clearly second best. CAT TALE SKY was rated along two to three wide, was
roused and guided to the inside leaving the three eighths marker, driven hard and advanced on the inside on the tutrn, shifted out three wide leaving the turn
but flattened out, bested rest. YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and weakened. GOTOTHEWINDOW
prompted the pace three wide and tired. KAVACHI was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four to five wide and stopped in the lane.

CHARM THE LADIES stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and hit the front at the furlong marker and edged away under left
handed crop urging to prove best. KYEMBEA set a pressured pace three wide early, dropped to the inside and shook clear on the turn, then was confronted
by the winner by the quarter pole, then could not go with that rival the final furlong, second best. PRAIRIE DOLLAR pressed the pace on the inside, then
was shuffled back on the turn, then angled off the inside when straightened and ran on to best the rest. BLUESKIESANDANGELS pressed the early pace in
between rivals, then tracked the pace three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and weakened. VLOCK tracked the early pace and made a
four wide bid on the turn, came five wide into the lane and was empty. HES BIG CHIEF was settled back early, shifted out and came widest into the lane
and had no rally. IRA CHAMP chased the early pace three wide, inside on the turn and stopped.
