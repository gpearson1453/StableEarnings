Footnotes
MISSCZECH set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. LARIMAR vied two wide to the turn, fell back,
continued in a steady effort and gained late to narrow the gap. DANCE LADY broke slowly, trailed the field, closed well inside and got up for show. WE ALL
AGREE came in after the start, was taken outside, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. HOLY TUTTA BELLA was crowded along the rail after
the start, stalked the pace along the inside and lacked a stretch response. Following a rider's objection, WE ALL AGREE was disqualified and placed fifth for
causing interference after the start. Hand timed.

LAST RENEGADE swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly and drew off past the eighth pole. HIT THE SEAM got away well to set the pace with a clear
lead, drifted out in the drive, was outclosed and all out for place. DESCENT was never far off the pace, angled out at the top of the stretch to be widest in
the drive and lacked the needed rally. UPPER ROOM showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back, angled out mid stretch and lacked a bid.
MARK YE WELL trailed in an inside trip and was outrun. Hand timed.

SECRET MISTRESS led throughout and held safely while kept to task. SHEZ OUR ARCH brushed start, saved ground mid pack, bid inside into the stretch
and was no match for the winner. TA TA FOR NOW was unhurried early to trail the field, shifted out for the drive and offered a mild bid to be along for show.

and was not urged late. Hand timed.

COCKTAIL SLIPPERS stalked the pace, assumed command between horses into the turn, drew off for a clear lead at the top of the stretch and held well in
a driving finish. SASSY TINKERBELL was never far back, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. OCEAN OF LIES was slow early, moved up
outside to be seven wide along the backstretch, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back at the top of the stretch and settled for show. RAINBOW STEW
came in at the start, advanced along the rail on the turn, bid inside and had nothing left. SHE'D RATHER DANCE was sent to the front to set the pace, was
steadied on the turn and gave way. STAR SO FAR had brief speed only. Hand timed.

T BONES TRICK bumped mildly at the start, was unhurried while racing wide, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. DEPARTURE was
never far off the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, inched away mid stretch, led late and was outclosed. COASTAL KID stalked the pace, rallied
on the turn, dueled to the eighth pole, faltered and held for show. GRAY MAGICIAN advanced to the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, bid and came
up empty. RACE HOME bumped mildly at the start, advanced inside on the turn and lacked the needed late response. THIRD WHEEL raced mid pack
along the inside and failed to threaten in an even effort. THE BLACK STRAT set the pace to the second turn, tired, stopped and was not urged late. Hand
timed.
