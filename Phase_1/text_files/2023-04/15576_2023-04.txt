Footnotes
FOWL NATION broke outward then quickly righted and rated three wide, quickly gained leaving the far turn, took over with three eighths to go, moved clear
into the lane, widened under a drive while on his left lead then was steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. I AM THE MIKE , between rivals early, raced to
the inside of a foe leaving the far turn, swung out six wide gathering some steam into the lane, straightened and closed steadily to gain the place. MISTER
RIPSTER saved ground early, dropped back heading to the turn, worked off the rail around the turn, was taken five wide in upper stretch, altered inward for
the final furlong and churned on to the inside of DISTANT FIRE to nab the show. DISTANT FIRE vied inside early on, allowed the leader to open up heading
to the five eighths, chased while saving ground mid turn, came out for the drive but flattened out late. IRISH WARLOCK , keen early while vying outside a
rival, pulled his way clear then secured the inside heading towards the turn, ceded command mid turn, stayed on with willing pursuit to mid stretch then gave
way. EXPECT LUCKY , forced out a bit at the break, raced four wide chasing the pace into the turn, failed to kick on past the three eighths and retreated.
REAL RAMBO gave early chase, saved ground into the turn and gave way. DOUBLE BID was carried out some at the start, drafted back and dropped in
towards the rail, angled out nearing the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MINER'S GEM , two wide chasing the leader around the turn, gained the advantage outside that one inside the eighth pole and was kept under pressure in
the late going. LADY JEAN , urged to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home and gave way grudgingly.
BACKSTREET AFFAIR bumped with KASHAN leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep and had a slight rally outside horses. SHACKLEFORD
COUNTY , in the three path chasing the pace around the turn, weakened through the stretch. FOLLY , no factor, swung wide in upper stretch. KASHAN
bumped with BACKSTREET AFFAIR at the start, raced along the inner rail on the turn and faltered.

NOTIMELIKEPRESENT quickly went clear and set the pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted past the five sixteenths, responded and kicked
clear two wide in upper stretch, kept on under solid handling past the furlong grounds and widened while kept to task. DON BERNARDO , four wide early
and outside rivals, ranged up three wide past the five sixteenths and threatened the winner, forced the issue into the lane, could not match strides heading
to mid stretch but stayed on well to secure the place. SUPE broke a step slow and lagged off the early pace, was sent up three wide and between runners
entering the turn, took closer order past the five sixteenths, worked between horses into the stretch, shifted out some and continued on with some interest.
HERE AND NOFURTHER saved ground pursuing, was under a hustling ride mid turn, edged up slightly past mid stretch but failed to follow through.
ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS lost ground five wide outside rivals, ranged up nearing the quarter pole, chased to mid stretch and faded. BOBSWORTH broke a
step slow, rushed up between rivals early, chased to the inside of rivals leaving the three eighths, had aim approaching the stretch then gave way.
CHASING STORMS , three wide between rivals, had no punch nearing the quarter pole and gave way. LOOTAH , two wide between runners nearing the
turn, dropped back mid turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GULLEY , up close outside horses down the backstretch, gained a three wide lead approaching the stretch, opened up in mid stretch and held
sway under steady handling. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY , four deep entering the first turn, sprinted clear entering the backstretch, was taken to the inner rail
near the three quarters pole, saved ground around the far turn and finished gamely inside the winner. SEMPER FI chased the pace, raced forwardly in the
two path between the top pair on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and finished gamely. GUILLAUME chased the pace down the backstretch, was
near the inner rail on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and closed the gap late. MIDNIGHT ACT raced along the inner rail most of the trip
and failed to be a factor. DOLICE VITA hesitated at the break, checked behind a rival on the far turn, angled out backstretch, no factor. MAXIMUS MIDANI
trailed.

SISTER CLOUDY , reluctant to load, broke inward and bumped with a rival to be away last, recovered and edged up between foes early on, advanced to
the inside of runners nearing the lane, was steadily guided outward leaving mid stretch, closed in determinedly under left then right handed asks and got up
at the wire. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY took command between runners leaving the chute then cleared, set rated pace two wide, wandered outward under
pressure inside the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but just could not contain the winner's charge. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE , four wide outside rivals
heading to the half mile marker, was pushed along pursuing around the turn, circled five wide into the stretch, remained on her left lead and closed steadily.
GINGER GIRL had speed then rated off the leader, stalked in the clear three wide past the three eighths, drifted four wide under asks into the stretch,
straightened to chase past mid stretch then gave way. DIAMOND SUE , off the pace, angled out around the turn, came three wide for the drive and failed to
menace. RUN AROUND SLEW , bumped at the break, flashed speed, chased the pace while saving ground, failed to go on after a half mile and retreated.
FORTUNE TELLER lacked speed, raced removed from the rail into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ACADIAN GIRL moved clear early and set a rated pace, drew out to a long lead without much asking past the three eighths, came under a ride three wide
soon into the lane, kept on under right handed asks and held sway. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO stalked off the inside, was ridden chasing outside of DOTADA
entering the lane, battled with that one from there, kept grinding and nabbed the place while closing in. DOTADA , brushed at the start, settled off the pace,
commenced a run leaving the far turn, knifed between foes near the five sixteenths, dropped in towards the rail, raced in tandem with FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO from the head of the lane, kept on willingly and was nipped for second. ANNA ROCKS , unhurried early while off the rail, circled five wide into
the stretch and closed steadily. STARTWITHABANG brushed with DOTADA at the break, dropped well off the early pace, saved ground into the stretch and
offered a mild run. ICE CUBE BABY saved ground while in range early, steadied briefly near the five sixteenths, altered out to pursue and faded through the
drive.

Footnotes
TWICE GOLD broke sluggishly, advanced in the two path on the turn, moved to the inner rail entering the stretch, gained the lead inside horses
approaching the eighth pole and drew out. THE GREAT GAZOO , three wide on the turn, chased the pace, was fanned five deep turning for home and
finished gamely. UNION LEAGUE showed speed along the inner rail down the backstretch and gave way leaving the turn. LUV YA BYE BYE speed
showed, raced in the two path on the turn, drifted four wide turning for home and faltered. EMOTIONAL RESCUE trailed.
