Footnotes
LANDSLID broke in the leaders, allowed those two to go when settling outside, three path far turn, asked along second turn, rallied four wide into the lane,
finished willingly while widest of the first flight at the wire to prove best. EXPENSIVE LIAISON in mid pack while racing off the inside, remained in the second
flight into the far turn, called on for run while steering three wide turning for home, also was going well at the end while between foes and inside the winner,
not enough for that one in the final strides. AUTOSTRADA away well, showed the way into the first turn just off the inside, dueled the middle half and into
the stretch closest to the inside, gave ground grudgingly to the top two the final furlong, could not contain the top pair late, while battling back in game
fashion to earn the show. WINDY BAY pressured the early leader from the outside, dueled with that rival up the backstretch and through the final turn, also
proved stubborn through the lane, outkicked for the show late. SANTANGELO four wide through the first turn when off the pace, continued outside and was
three wide through the second, failed to muster a rally. ALITA pulled hard through the first turn when behind the leader inside, continued under restraint onto
the backstretch, had little left for the stretch run. ABBY THE BULL DAWG off slow, trailed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TAPICITA used early to quickly advance and take on the early leader from the outside into the turn, dueled through the bend, disposed of the other speed
into the stretch, well clear past the furlong marker, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. BLUE COWGIRL off a step slow, moved out, began to
advance four wide into the far turn, advanced through the bend to race closest to the winner in upper stretch three wide, proved no match for that one,
clearly second best. LUNCH LADY broke on top, set the pace up the backstretch toward the inside, dueled through the turn inside the winner, could not
match that one or the runner up through the lane, comfortably saved the show. SWEET N SALTY within striking distance along the inside early, continued to
race in the second flight while saving ground through the turn, had little left for the drive. CANARY NATION off slowly, trailed for three furlongs just off the
rail, swung four wide into the stretch, made a belated run out in the track to improve position. MY MOONLIGHT LADY in the main body while racing three
wide, lacked a closing response. SHESTHEBIGGAME remained back while racing off the inside. COURT COSTS in the second flight in the two path,
steadily faded.

Footnotes
CANDY CARAMEL off a step slow, back early, made a good move to reach a contending position turning for home while four wide, quickly clear when
straightened for home, won geared down late, clearly best. BIOGENIC BABE in the second group while in the two path, behind traffic into the lane, shifted
out for room, kicked clear for the place when clear, no threat to the winner. SHIP IT behind the lead pace along the inside, finished up best of the rest. STAR
POSE off a step slow, trailed early, angled out four wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, found best stride too late in improving position.
BIDOFHONEY broke alertly, pressed the pace three wide for a half, began to weaken from between horses turning for home. DESERT GLOW fell back
through the turn to trail into the lane, remained back. MIDSUMMER SOIREE broke in good order, dueled in the two path, vied between horses late in the
turn then gave way through the stretch. ONE MORE LAUGH dueled up front closest to the rail, shortened stride upper stretch, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
HEY EUGENE pressed the issue early off the inside, vied between horses into the stretch, headed past the furlong marker, battled back in game fashion to
be edging away at the end. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL forwardly placed outside, ranged up to challenge three wide late in the turn, narrowly showed the way
past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going. MY UNCLE LEON behind the pace while four wide into the turn, remained outside, drifted through the
stretch, slowly getting to the runner up late. PATTON'S WAR narrowly showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, battled through the turn with the
top two, weakened through the stretch. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR lacked speed, two path into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
threat. MACHO STRIKER off slow, remained back in failing to menace. MORE THAN EASY was never a threat inside.

Footnotes
AL'S ROMEO with the early pace, dueled into the turn along the inside, fell back off the other speed into the stretch, battled back while continuing inside that
one to kick clear at the end. EE YAH away well, dueled up front while angling in a bit into the turn, shook clear late in the bend, continued to show the way
past the furlong marker, relented in the late going, saved the place. OTTOMAN EMPIRE lacked speed, saved ground when sill back through the turn,
moved out around tiring foe midstretch, dropped back to the rail and was up for the show late. VICTORY MARCH in mid pack early while well out in the
strip, four out to five wide turn, improved slightly while missing the show. COMMANDER CARL forwardly placed in the two path, lacked a closing late punch.
AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY in the main body just off the inside, moved out three wide turning for home, also failed to rally late. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN one
paced for a half off the inside, came four wide for the drive, continued evenly to the wire. MAJOR CONTENDER saved ground to no avail. HARMON
KILLER BREW last away, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. SMOOTH SCAT in the second flight outside, three to four wide out of the turn,
backed up in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
POLTERER patiently handled in a forward position. boxed in along the inside far turn, patiently handled behind traffic through that bend, continued to lack
clear racing room upper stretch, moved out, challenged with less than a furlong remaining, kicked strongly clear. CHAPEL BARN broke alertly, set the pace
toward the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage into the lane, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner inside the furlong marker then proved no
match. FORT PECK pressed the runner up from the outside, challenged that one and put a head in front exiting the final turn, also proved no match for the
winner late, outkicked for the place. FLATOUT WINNER devoid of early foot, moved out, four wide turning into the stretch, improved with some mild interest
while well out in the strip. DRIVEN ONE within striking distance three wide, continued to maintain contact with the leader in the three path through the final
turn, set down, lacked a winning response. GOLD BUCKLE last away, made little impact while racing off the inside. COLOSI failed to menace toward the
inside. MULBERRY STREET lacked speed outside, floated out five wide by FLATOUT WINNER turning for home, trailed home in lacking a response.

Footnotes
COLLECTED GLORY close from the start off the inside following an alert break, engaged the early leader from the outside when straightened for home,
wore that rival down then held the runner up safe late. GREEK HEIRESS in mid pack while off the rail, asked along three wide into the lane, lost some
ground to the leaders, continued to be aggressively ridden past the furlong marker, in time for the place. BOOGIE WOOGIE GAL away well, showed the
way up the backstretch toward the inside, continued to hold the advantage through the bend and into the lane, could not match strides with the winner late,
continued to weaken and lost the second spot in the waning strides. HURRICANE FIRE within striking distance along the inside, remained within striking
distance into the lane then weakened in the run to the wire. VALIANT PRAISE broke back, lacked speed, came three wide for the drive, improved a bit in
upper stretch then flattened out. SUPER CINDY void of speed along the inside, passed some tiring rivals while not a threat. RATIFIED in mid pack while
racing in the two path, lacked a closing response. HOT SUMMER DREAM off a step slow, remained back. ACCELERATING BABE in the second flight
outside, three to four wide turn, gave way through the lane.

Footnotes
I'M THE BOSS OF ME with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled early turn, shook clear midway on the bend and maintained daylight to the wire
while being kept to task. PRINCEDREAMCESS outrun in the early going inside, patiently handed behind several rivals through the turn, came two wide for
the drive, finished willingly through traffic to earn the place. HEADLAND in the main pack outside, four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally, outkicked
late for the place. HYPERSPORT last away, void of speed, three wide through much of the turn, rallied belatedly out in the strip to improve position. ASENA
forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer three wide turning for home, chased the winner past the furlong marker and began to falrter. DEALING
JUSTICE raced near the back and the inside, two path through the turn, made little impact through the stretch. AMERICAN LILY in mid pack and the inside,
traffic late in the turn, tired when clear for the stretch run. SPEEDOMETER dueled up front inside the winner for three furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
NAVAGATIONALBEACON away in good order, dueled in the two path through the turn, continued to vie through upper stretch, shook clear past the furlong
marker enough left to hold the next two safe late. KITIARA broke back, lacked speed for almost a half, angled out sharply four wide in traffic late in the turn,
encountered traffic again inside rthe furlong marker, shifted out a bit, finished willingly outside the winner to be getting to that one late. BETTY JO fractious
in the gate prior to the start, broke with most of the field, two path through the turn, set down for the drive, also was getting to the winner late while being
outkicked for the place. CHAI TEA off a step slow, trailed early, picked way through some traffic into the lane and also was going willingly at the end. K J'S
PISTOL ANNIE broke alertly, prompted the pace while racing three wide, little left in the late going. SHE'S HAMAZING lacked speed outside, four wide early
in the turn, five to six wide into the lane, remained widest to the wire while improving position a bit. LORI'S EYES broke well along the rail, dueled inside the
winner for over a half, first to blink when straightened for home, continued to weaken. JERI DAWN fell back after the start, never menaced. MO SILVER in
the second group outside, bothered while four wide and in some traffic late in the turn, backed up through the lane. OOCHIE in mid pack while off the inside,
four wide through the turn, traffic with a quarter to run, gave way in the drive.
