the third spot. LEAD ACTOR showed no speed to the far turn, rallied along in the stretch run to improve position in the late going. HABITUS raced back to
the half, moved up from far turn while mildly in the late going. MIFFLIN raced along evenly with no response when needed from far turn. DESERT

INTRIGUE with leaders three wide to the turn, roused for run into the stretch, responded well and went clear in a good effort. TAP DANCING LADY
unhurried outside to turn, rallied wide into stretch to prove no match while second best. MALLOY speed inside, dueled to the stretch, gave in late and
gamely saved show spot. FAST GISELLE battled between horses to the stretch, could not go on in stretch. HERMANA unhurried outside to the turn, only
improved mildly in stretch. STRONG ODOR inside run to the turn while trapped, no response when clear. MS TEMPTATION never far back to the turn with
nothing left in the drive. ROC'S PRINCESS through early, dropped back readily from the turn.

Footnotes
NOBLE JON four wide run to turn, swept up in hand, roused clear in the stretch run while all out to hold on. GUN RUSH between horses to turn, rallied on in
earnest through the late stretch but just missed on the wire. BIG BOSS BEN broke sharp outside, tried hard to turn and stretch but weakened in the late
going. INDIGO RICH no speed to turn with a widest run and improved position in the stretch run only. UNDISMAYED ran up between horses to turn, battled
on through the stretch but faded in the late going. MY GRASS IS BLUE close up early on to turn, weakened in the stretch run. RENAISSANCE (IRE) no
speed throughout. CLEAT between horses to chase for a half but gave in readily through the stretch. LEVEE PROUD inside run to the turn with nothing left
in the stretch run. SPRINKLEHEAD flashed speed from inside to turn but came up empty and dropped back readily. SPEIGHTMEISTER had a slow break
from outside while always far back.
