Footnotes
APPROPRIATED FUNDS settled off the early pace along the fence, angled out at the quarter pole to mount a convincing rally and pull away late in the drive
in a well handled ride. IT TAKES HEART broke alertly to duel for the lead from between horses, took command turning for home, was no match for the
winner but finished gamely to be clearly second best in a good effort. FOOLISH DELIGHT reserved near the back of the pack in the early going,
commenced a rally at the three-eighths pole, and closed well in a long steady drive. JENNY'S PENNY stalked the lead from three wide, made a bid at
through the turn and flattened out in the drive. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF raced prominently four wide to the turn and faded. MOR PEANUTS rushed up to an
early lead, dueled from the rail through the turn and gave way. SWEET SLEW trailed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
STACI'S RED DRESS was off slowly at the start, then was well rated along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the four path in the early stretch, dug in
gamely, and showed up in the late stretch just in time to prove best. FASHION RAGE chased the pace while two wide, bid from the three path on turn,
gained the lead from the dueling pair mid stretch, continued to menace gamely but was out finished in the end by an outer foe and was second best.
BENDELENE chased the pace along the inside into the turn, angled out four wide in the early stretch to rally and was closing well in the end. RECLUSIVE
tracked the pace while two wide then bid while four wide throughout the turn, came in slightly and brushed rival, re bid and continued to close well in the late
stretch. REDEFINITION lead the way to the top of the turn, then was confronted by an outer rival entering the lane, continued to hold a strong bid down the
late stretch but was out bid in the end by outer rivals. WENDY'S SONG stalked the pace while three off the rail, was moving up throughout the turn to duel
with the pace setter heading into the stretch, continued to bid mildly then gave way in the end. OUTLINING tracked the pace from the inside, was moving up
while four wide on the turn to bid in the upper stretch, but was brushed by an outer rival and had no final bid in the end.

Footnotes
RED DRAW took command entering the first turn, repelled the pace pressers in the far turn and gamely held the closers safe in the late going. JOHN
LOUIS' BEVO well rated off the pace early, rallied four wide in the turn to loom up, dropped back at the top of the lane and came on again late in the drive
splitting horses to gain the place. LOST GOLD raced prominently in striking position throughout and finished willingly while unable to reel in the winner.
EAGLEFORD raced five wide into the first turn, settled off the pace, was put to a drive entering the far turn and rallied well to be gaining late. ASTA
LAVISTA HONEY broke outward into rivals path leaving the gate, settled into a pressing position down the backside, challenged at the quarter pole and
flattened out in the stretch. LITTLE JOHN HENRY reserved off the leaders while racing behind a wall of runners down the backside and failed to respond
when called upon for the drive. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN trailed early, threw his head about leaving the first turn when encountering kickback, made a brief
bid in the far turn and tossed head again turning for home and drifted out when gaining on the field.

RED SUMMERBIRD tracked the pace two off the rail, came out three wide to bid on the turn, dug in gamely and surged past the pace setter in the late
stretch and was up at the wire. TAPITURE JONES moved quickly along the inside to gain the lead around the five eighths pole and into the turn, was in a
hard drive to edge clear in the upper stretch and kept on till the deep stretch but was out finished just at the wire. I'M A COWBOY chased the pace along the
inside into the turn, rallied well to vie for the lead in the early stretch then gave way in the end. MY LITTLE PRINCE was away well to gain the short lead,
then was over taken by an inner rival, continued to press the pace heading into the turn, was in a hard drive to try to gain the lead again but was
extinguished and flattened out in the end. ZAVALA was in a hard drive to stalk the pace while three wide, was used up on the turn and flattened out in the
lane. POSEIDONS WAVE trailed behind the field and was no factor.

Footnotes
SKYKAT rated in mid-pack for the run down the backside, lacked racing room into the far turn, angled out three wide when clear and prevailed in a hard
drive. FOR FUN tracked the pace from the fence, rallied gamely along the rail in the lane to be closing fast late to just miss in a good effort. MALIBU
MIDNIGHT shuffled to the rear of the field down the backside, circled wide and closed full of run. CATO'S LADY stalked the pace at the front of the pack
chasing the run off leader, rallied into the turn to be close up turning for home and was outkicked by the closers. LIL ASHLEY B. raced wide down the
backstretch and mounted a mild late bid. SIMPLE PLEASURE well position three wide down the backstretch, chased into the turn and failed to gain. MRS.
KRINKLES was prominently placed while forced to race wide throughout, made a bid in the far turn and flattened out in the drive. MY GOLDEN BLING
raced off to open a wide lead down the backside in rapid fractions and stopped in the lane. PAINTBRUSH flashed speed for a half mile and came up empty.

HARD GOLD lead the way into the first turn by a half lengths, then dueled with an outer rival down the backstretch and into the far turn, then kicked clear in
the early stretch and held on under a strong hand drive to prevail in the end. MORO TRENDSETTER chased the pace down the backstretch along the rail
and throughout the far turn, then dug in gamely in the upper stretch and found the best stride late and was best for second place. OH SEAN pressed the
pace into the first turn then dueled while two wide down the backstretch and kept on until the far turn then gave way in the home stretch. DEVITO chased
the pace between foes down the backstretch, came out thee wide to bid mildly on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. GHURAIR'S WARRIOR
chased the pace while three wide, lost some ground heading into the turn, bid in the stretch but did not fire and was no threat. MODOC was unhurried early,
then settled along the inside and failed to rally.

WICKED SONG dueled on the lead from the rail, responded to all challenges, persistent in the drive and cleared late in a game effort. L L COOL GREY
settled two wide off the pace in the first turn, made a four wide bid entering the far turn, engaged the leader in a duel to upper stretch and finished well to
hold the place. TWITTER TRAFFIC raced six wide into the first turn, ranged up to stalk the leaders down the backside, was prominently placed turning for
home but failed to gain ground on the leaders. LUMBERJACK LESLIE trailed the field for the first half mile, mounted a wide rally leaving the half mile pole
and finished with a belated close to the wire. BLUEGRASS DIXIE reserved off the pace to the far turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. KAYLEE'S
SHADOW tracked the pace from the fence for three-quarters and finished evenly. HIGH DEF RIDGE pressed the pacesetter for a half mile and gradually
gave way. MAMA'S NIGHT OUT prompted the pace for the first three-eighths between horses and was done early.

Footnotes
REBEL POSSE bid for the lead along the inside into the turn then menaced in the upper stretch and surged to the wire to be up just in time. MY PAL
MATTIE lead the way along the inside, cleared the turn, continued to menace gamely in the stretch but was caught at the wire and was second best.
EXCESS MAGIC was bumped at the start, then was moving up along the inside behind the field, came out three wide on the turn to rally in the late stretch
and was closing well in the end. SHANNON C was in a hard drive to press the pace while three wide into the turn, continued to rally well down the lane then
gave way in deep stretch. SIMPLY WICKED raced in the middle of the field while four wide, then bid on the turn came out six wide in the stretch to rally but
it was too little too late. CHATTALOT raced in the two path behind most of the field, made a mild bid on the turn and into the stretch and was no threat.
LET'S GO ALAMO chased the pace while two wide, bid from the four path in the early stretch, angled in and continued bid but in the end was no threat.
ELUSIVE WAR was in a hard drive to stalk the pace while two wide, then faded throughout the turn, re bid in the stretch but did not respond. BROCK ON
BY was unhurried early and no menace. PIKNITUPLAYNITDOWN broke outwardly at the start and bumped rival then lost rider and did not finish.
