Footnotes
GOVERNOR ANN was well rated while tracking the pace in the two path, bid on the second turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch to edge clear in the late
stretch and was up just in time to succeed. MORE THAN SHAKIN lead the way into the first turn while resisting rating until about the half pole, then made
bid throughout the second turn, menaced in the home stretch but was out kicked in the end by an outer and was second best. RIVER'S END was forwardly
place along the inside, was in a steady drive down the backstretch and into the turn to rally in the upper stretch then flattened out in the end. MYRTLE
BEACH raced behind rivals while four wide on the backstretch then bid from the inside on the far turn but came up evenly throughout the lane. RON'S
LAVENDER was off slowly at the start, sped through the first turn swiftly then gradually faded throughout the second half of the course and was through
early.

Footnotes
CARBON STRYKER slow away in the first strides, rushed up between horses to duel for the lead from two wide, took command at the top of the lane and
steadily drew clear down the stretch as a convincing winner. DAAHERS BULLY reserved along the fence off the early leaders, angled out turning for home
and closed well to be a clear second best. PLAY RULE broke alertly to sprint to the early lead, dueled with the winner through the turn and flattened out in
the drive. SHANGHAI'S DREAM trailed into the lane while wide throughout and passed a tired rival late. MAGIC BOW tracked the leaders in striking position
but could not sustain his bid while tiring late.

MISTER K dueled from the inside into the turn, took the lead in the upper stretch, was challenged for command in the late stretch by an outer rival, but held
onto the lead grudgingly by a nose in the end to prove best. PICKNNGRINN chased the dueling leaders while two wide, then vied for the lead heading into
the stretch, shook clear of one rival, menaced gamely to duel with an inner rival in late stretch but hung in the end. SR. BI BI chased the pace along the
inside, bid mildly on the turn then rallied in the late stretch but came up empty. BEHIND THE CURTAIN dueled for the lead while two wide, lead the way into
the turn by a nose, then vied to keep the lead in the early stretch but was depleted and gave way in the end.

Footnotes
WILD EXPRESS broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, opened a comfortable, well-rated lead down the backside in soft fractions, responded well
when threatened turning for home and drew clear in a well handled ride. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER tracked the pace from the rail always in striking distance,
angled off the rail at the top of the lane, and closed well to be second best. CRAFTY MONEY stalked the pacesetter throughout, loomed up at the quarter
pole to threaten but failed to gain on the leader in the stretch. OH DOO DAH DAY broke a step slow, circled three wide in the first turn while fighting the rider
under a strong hold, moved up in the far turn to challenge and flattened out in the drive. DASHYNS DREAM was well placed in striking distance of the
leaders to the three-eighths pole and finished evenly. CHA CHA DANCER trailed throughout and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SUMMEROSA chased the pace while three wide, was moving up heading into the far turn to rally in the early stretch, dueled with the pace setter then
kicked clear in deep stretch to prove best in the end. JAZZY LASSIE lead the way into the first turn to duel down the backstretch from the inside, shook clear
of that rival at the top of the far turn to lead the way again into the early stretch, was confronted by an outer rival in the late stretch and could not retain rally
and gave way in the end. MUCHO MAMA MIA raced behind most of the field while two wide on the backstretch, then made a strong bid on the far turn to
rally in the early stretch and was closing well but it wasn't enough in the end. SUPERCENTS was under a steady ride while three wide down the
backstretch, then bid on the far turn to rally in stretch and was closing well but came up empty in the end. SIGNE was forwardly placed while two wide into
the first turn to duel with an inner foe down the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn, was used up and weakened in the home stretch.
TALKATIVE was bumped at the start, then raced in the middle of the field along the inside, made a mild bid heading into the far turn then flattened out in the
stretch. JOHNBOYS JENNY was unhurried early, bid on the second turn and was no threat. GOLD MAKIN GIRL bumped rival at the start, then tracked the
pace between rivals down the backstretch, faded throughout the far turn and had no final bid in the stretch.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT HUNTER sped up the fence to duel on the early lead, opened a slight advantage to the top of the lane and drew off as much the best.
PRATHER stalked the pacesetters from three wide to the quarter pole, mounted a challenge turning for home but was no match for the winner while holding
on gamely for the place. MORO'S BULL CREEK tracked the leaders while well positioned, angled out at the head of the stretch and rallied well on the
outside to just miss the place. WINNY'SSPECIALSTAR pressed the winner while dueling for the first quarter, maintained that position until the head of the
lane and flattened out late in the drive. FEW WORDS raced three wide into the turn near the rear of the pack and made a mild gain down the stretch.
CAPO'S DREAM trailed to the quarter pole and passed tired rivals in the lane. IFFY ASSET CLASS was in contention early, dropped back through the turn
lacking a rally and finished evenly as no threat. BLACKHEATH broke mid-pack, dropped to the rail entering the turn, was put to an early drive but failed to
respond to his rider's urging, and faded to the wire.

BIG COUNTRY was well rated while two wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, then bid gamely in the early stretch, dueled with an inner foe in the
final sixteenth and was up in the final strides to prove best. BIG BERNIE showed the way into the first turn and down the backstretch, continued to hold onto
the lead gamely while heading into the home stretch, was confronted by an outer rival in the final furlong and was out finished in the end. HAMAZING
WISDOM was rated in the two path down the heading down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn to rally gamely at the top of the stretch and
was closing well and was best for show. SINGING DIXIE was under a strong drive to press the pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, rallied in the
early stretch but did not fire in the end. OPTIMAL TRIP raced along the rail down the first half then came out three wide on the far turn to rally in the early
stretch but came up evenly. EXETER tracked the pace while three deep down the backstretch, was in hard drive on the far turn then flattened out in the lane
and was no threat. CANATLAN was unhurried early then trailed behind the field down the backstretch, bid from the three path on the far turn and was no
factor. MANOR BORN raced behind the field while two wide, then steadily lost ground and had no final bid in the stretch.
