WEST NEWTON (GB) led throughout, was challenged in the stretch, and just lasted. SCORPION'S REVENGE (IRE) kept pace in back, made a move
before the 9th hurdle, and rallied in the stretch to be held off at the wire. CITY DREAMER (IRE) started well, faded midrace, then made steady gain on
leaders but flattened in the stretch. ANIMAL KINGSTON made a move mid race, faded after the 8th, tired and eased to the finish. FAST VISION (FR) kept
pace, fell landing side of 7th fence, and walked off.
