and proved best in a determined run under all out pressure. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL raced mid pack early on, moved up from the outside around the far
turn through the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. FIRST AGAIN raced five wide around the first turn, pressed the early leader from the outside of
foes and weakened a bit in the final stages. TURN ON ARCH stalked the pace, three wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced even late. CHARITY
WATER raced six wide around the first turn, was near the back of the pack early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and had no late rally. FOXY RED

Footnotes
LUCK IN MY EYES chased the pace from the outside, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole, surged inside the eighth pole and was clear late under
strong pressure. LEATHERNECK showed good early foot from the inside and finished willingly to the wire. I'MAGAMBLER raced with the second flight early
on, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole, angled out through the stretch run and rallied. FORT STANTON SCOUT was coaxed along between
rivals early and weakened in the drive. IZA DADDY raced mid pack early on, was along the inside into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid.
STOCK DEAL raced six wide around the first turn, stalked the early going from the outside, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late
with no closing run. NORTHERN QUEST dropped back early, raced near the inside around the far turn, shifted outside five wide and had no late rally.
SWITCHERONIMO was near the back of the pack early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a solid bid. JEDI WARRIOR lost ground to
race far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
MASSIVE ROAR was coaxed along from the outside, challenged two wide between horses near the quarter pole, dug in near the eighth pole and edged
clear late to prove best under strong handling. JET N G made a quick bid to challenge for the lead three deep from the outside of rivals and kept on gamely
to the wire. DELBERT TOO stalked the pace, raced three wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled six to seven wide and finished gamely to the wire.
ATTILIANNO raced off the early going, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. ALL CHROME dropped near the back of
the pack early, raced near the rail around the far turn and moved up to improve position late. ON A WARPATH quick to begin to set the early pace from the
inside and faded. BODIE GOT GOLD raced off the early going, was three to four wide around the far turn and had no late rally. ELLIOT was slow early on,
raced from the outside in the stretch and never was a factor. PHANTOMOFTHEOPERE chased the pace while racing three wide and faded. The quarter
mile fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
BYE BYE MATTY P was away alertly, set all the pace inside of foes and drew off late to prove best under steady handling. STORM BAYOU stalked the
pace, was near the inside past the quarter pole, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch and rallied gamely for the place position. EVACUEE was slow
early, advanced into the far turn, raced five wide between in the stretch and closed in too late. PROBATE pressed the pace from the outside of foe and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. MCMERCELUS raced four wide around the first turn, raced from the outside in the stretch and raced evenly with no
closing run. LONZO WHO settled early, raced from the outside in the stretch and had no late rally. IZERIGHT raced with the second flight early and failed to
respond. SHINING SOURCE dropped back early, raced three to four wide and had no response. DESERT REWARD chased the early pace and faded
along the inside.
