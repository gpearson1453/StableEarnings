BEVERLY PARK stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the nod at the five
sixteenths, drew clear toward the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. ANTIPOISON rounded the opening
turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and settled for second. AARON'S TAP raced in
the four path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. RUNABOUT rounded the
first turn in the six path and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three and four paths of the far turn and could only improve
his position. PROTA rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail
on the far turn. MUCHACHO MACHO rated close inside, challenged nearing the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. NOON TIME GEM
raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
JOHNNY SWISH exchanged contact with Urban Warrior leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the five path and moved to the front three wide
approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. AMICALOLA FALLS rated the pace inside,
came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, was met approaching the three eighths and gave chase from that point, then dueled through the
stretch for second. SPUNTACULAR settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the
far turn, eased out into the lane and dueled through the stretch to take third under the wire. TYLER TIME rounded the opening turn in the four path and
rated close leaving the turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, took a slim lead between horses at the three eighths pole, raced close near the rail into the
far turn but dropped back midway through the turn and relented in the duel through the lane. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR saved ground well off the pace,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. STAVANGER saved ground well off the pace, gave
chase from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and improved his position. FOREVER THE BOSS rated close to the early pace in the two
and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened off the rail on the far turn.
URBAN WARRIOR exchanged contact with Johnny Swish leaving the gate and rounded the first turn off the rail, was blocked and altered course at the
three eighths pole but flattened in the five path of the far turn. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR rounded the first turn about the six path and showed little response
through the backstretch. MY MIRACLE MAN saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded through the backstretch.
The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Johnny Swish for alleged interference on the far turn, lodged by the rider of
Amicalola Falls.

Footnotes
MASTER THIS rounded the first turn in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, eased to the six path on the far turn and
took the lead leaving the eighth pole and drew off under steady handling. STRONG HEART raced off the rail on the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn and settled for second best. GANDHI'S ORION stalked from the
seven eighths pole, closed to the front toward the three eighths, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole, was met leaving the far turn and flattened
in the lane. PLAYBOY ROY raced off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path
but showed little in the lane. AMERICAN ROCKY raced well back from early contention in the four and five paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole
and improved at the rail on the far turn. SIMILAR TASTE settled off the pace inside, gave chase into the backstretch but showed little response. FARTLEK
rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. GORUN was not a
factor. DAKOTA BOY took over approaching the seven eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure past the half mile pole, was met toward the
three eighths and faded approaching the far turn. FRONT PORCH was not a factor.

weakened in the lane. ENTRY TIME was jostled at the break and raced well back, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and improved position in the

TIMED OUT stalked from the three path on the first turn, closed to the lead approaching the three eighths pole and ran clear at the five sixteenths, rounded
the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled in the stretch. LADY CINCO DE MAYO stalked two deep, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in under steady stretch handling and held second. TIMELY SECRET rounded the first turn about the
three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, came along for third mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. MADY
ROSE broke a step slow then saved ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and
showed little in the lane. ELLIES LIL CASTLE took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met approaching the three eighths pole, gave chase
from that point, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. WILL OR WON'T raced inside on the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. Cousin Winnie became fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

TRUE HEIRESS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and dueled to the front past the eighth pole, drew clear mid-stretch and was
steadily handled to widen. LITTLE BIT OF THAT pressured the pace inside, contested even terms nearest the rail on the turn, was met past the eighth pole
and relented the final sixteenth. CAPTAIN SAM chased, rounded the turn in the four path and dug in through the lane to hold third. MIDNIGHT FLING
chased outside, raced in the six path of the turn and finished well to pass rivals. SWEETONTHEGENTS chased through the backstretch, raced in the three
path on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. SALTY SAUL gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly to pass rivals
outside. SECRET AFFIRMATION chased through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. UNCANNY was
hustled up while tapering in and set a pressured pace, contested even terms from the three path on the turn but drifted into the stretch and gave way. MS
HEADLEY chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. SUPER WILDCAT was never a factor.
