Footnotes
TIMEHASCOME pressed the early pace three wide, then went up to duel for command on the backstretch, made a two wide bid on the turn and shook
clear, then widened the margin to prove best under a drive. ELECTRIC CHARGE was well rated early, made a three wide bid on the turn to loom boldly but
could not go with the winner while staying on willingly to be clearly second best. JACKPOT BOY was bumped at the start, then settled early on the inside,
eased out on the turn and made a mild three wide bid but could not sustain that bid while besting the rest. KING ZION set a pressured pace on the inside
and weakened on the turn. UNCLE DICK was settled three to four wide and then dropped to the inside on the turn but had no response.

the pace and came four wide into the lane and faded in the drive, held show award. PINBALLER set the pace along the inside, was headed on the turn and
weakened the final furlong. UNCLE NICK was checked on the inside into the first turn, then saved ground throughout and came up empty in the drive.
FLASHY RICHIE was allowed to settle on the inside, then shifted out and was three wide by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the furlong marker and had
no rally. BLOOMING GARDEN was bumped at the start, settled back early and had no response.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED ANNSLEY bumped at the start, prompted the pace three wide, made a bid on the turn and took over and drew clear leaving the turn, then
drew off to prove much the best under left handed crop urging. PRETTY IN PRADO set the pace on the inside, headed on the turn and proved to be no
match for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. PRADA'S MIRACLE was settled back early on the inside, shifted out on the turn and made
a three wide run, angled out in the lane and had no late rally, bested rest. LADA KALINA tracked the pace three wide and then was two wide on the far turn
and weakened. LOTTA ROSES broke in at the start, tracked the pace five wide and then was four wide on the far turn and weakened. THIS IS ANFIELD
chased the pace on the inside and stopped. HOLD HER HOSTAGE was settled early and stopped.

FLAMAND was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the drive and closed well to draw clear late to prove best, driving. SPECIALIZIN set a pressured
pace along the inside, then dueled for the lead on the turn, made a bid to gain a short lead leaving the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner, held
place award. MAGNA MASSA was reserved early, three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and rallied well to just miss the place award.
AWESOME SUNDAY pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command, but faded the final furlong.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD TRIPLE prompted the pace three wide, made a three wide bid and had a long drive the final furlong and won the head bob to prevail. BE MY
BESTIE was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace along the inside, then dueled with the winner the final furlong and dug in gamely but lost the head
bob to just miss. CANTOO was settled early, three wide on the turn and shifted out five wide in the lane and had a mild late rally. FREEDOM ATTACK was
settled early three wide, then two wide by the quarter pole and had no kick. TU ROYAL pressed the early pace in between rivals and weakened.
DOMINIQUE chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn and weakened. HIP HOP EMMY steadied early on the inside and then lacked a rally.
WICKED SKY checked after the start, settled back early then was not a threat. FAST KYLIE failed to menace.
