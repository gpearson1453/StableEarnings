Footnotes
QUARTERBACK DAK stalked the pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and proved best under all out pressure. WARRIOR'S MAP rated along
outside of foe, took a clear lead near the quarter pole, dug in late while racing near the rail in a game effort. MOOJAB JR was slow early, loomed five wide
into the upper stretch and flattened out with no closing run on the top two. CELERITY was unhurried early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and had
not enough. TIO BLAS settled early, raced four deep and had no response. CADDO FOX set the early pace and was done early.

Footnotes
SIR LIAM was pulling early on under a tight hold, assumed command near the three eighths pole, raced well clear near the eighth pole and was kept to
pressure to remain clear. DAWSON CITY raced in bit tight nearing the first turn, raced three to four wide in the lane and was no match for the winner.
NERKY ROSE was unhurried early, advanced through the far turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. BAY BE GONE
raced mid pack early on, hard ridden past the three eighths pole, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position. WILD
WING stalked the pace, raced near the rail through the stretch and had no final bid. DREAMS ROCKETMAN showed good early speed to set the early pace
and gave way. MR. MUNNINGS stalked the pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and weakened. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN raced mid pack early
on, was three to two wide and lacked a bid. PRINCE CURLIN dropped back early and failed to respond. WELLWRIT raced far back and never threatened.

aim near the eighth pole and flattened out. CHARLIECANDO was unhurried early on, raced from the outside in the lane and lacked a rally. CUCINA was
forwardly placed to lay up close, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH was off slowly and trailed.
