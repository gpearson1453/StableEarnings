Footnotes
INTO LOVE in the second flight between foes early, bid in hand turn, drew well clear under his own courage to win with something left. GODDESS OF WAR
in the second group inside the winner in the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground turn, improved up the rail to prove game for the place, not a
threat to the winner. SHARP ATTITUDE broke back, moved outside, four wide through the turn, advanced into the lane, long drive for the place, outfinished.
MARY'S BOON settled in mid pack while off the inside, three wide through the turn, also challenged for the place late, outkicked as well. CHANISA headed
up the second flight early between horses, three wide through the turn, challenged for the second spot as well, lacked a closing punch. FIRST LOVE broke
sharp, soon shook clear, showed the way into the turn in the two path, faded down the stretch. BEAUTIFUL BOLT forwardly placed while five wide into the
turn, worked way down to the three path by late in the turn, gave way in the drive. PENZIG remained always back. LUV MAP hesitated then veered out at
the start to spot the field several lengths, remained back in trailing throughout.

Footnotes
PATTERN BET behind the pace, three side into the turn, began to advance in the two path by late in the bend, eased out, brushed with SHE'S STORMING
inside the furlong marker, split foes in the final strides, just up in a determined effort. GRAMERCY PARK broke alertly, narrowly set the pace just off the
inside in the run up the backstretch, dueled turn and into the stretch along the rail, continued to lead until late, nipped at the wire while closest to the inside
of the first flight. SHE'S STORMING prompted the dueling leaders from the three path, lost some ground into the turn, brushed with the winner when moving
closer with that one inside the furlong marker, outkicked late while outside. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER broke in, moved up to duel outside, raced on equal
terms with the winner into and through upper stretch to that one's outside, weakened from between horses the final sixteenth. MOCHA KISS last to leave,
moved up to mid pack just off the rail, traffic turn, rode the rail into the stretch and went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. CHOCTAW
CHARLIE void of speed, raced three wide through the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. FIVE QUEENS in mid pack while well wide up
the backstretch, five path through the turn, lacked response. HAMAZING DEBATE also in the main group out in the strip, four wide when moving a bit closer
midway on the turn, tired through the lane. OOCHIE forwardly placed early along the inside, faded. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF
SHE'S STORMING AGASINT THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
HYPERSPORT off the early pace while racing outside, four wide turning for home, set down, outside bid, long drive, fully extended while edging clear late.
SILVIA lacked speed, lagged far turn, steered four wide turning for home, also rallied outside, just up for the place. VIOLENT POINT narrowly set the pace
along the inside, continued to hold the advantage into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, nipped for the place at the wire. ROLLIN
CHROME forwardly placed while racing three wide, continued within striking distance upper stretch, not enough for the second spot while between rivals.
RIBBONSINHERHAIR behind the pace toward the inside, two path and behind traffic turn, went evenly through the lane when clear. THUNDERS
ROCKNROLL pressed the pace off the inside, dueled two path through the turn, weakened in the drive. JE SUIS RAPIDE off a step slow, remained always
back. OSIRIA in the second flight while between horses, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
FEDERAL JUDGE broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, shrugged off a rival turning into the stretch, drew clear, kept to pressure. RUNAWAY JACK
lacked early foot off the inside, steered out to be three wide for the drive, angled out a bit further when straightened for home, finished willingly to earn the
place not a threat to the winner. ZAMBEZI settled behind the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, finished up evenly to earn the show. MIRACLE
WORKER forwardly placed while three wide, lacked a closing punch the final furlong. CYCLONE void of speed in trailing early, three wide through the turn,
angled in a bit for the drive, displayed a mild amount of late interest. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL pressed the winner early from the outside, challenged that one
and put a head in front late in the turn, gave way in the drive. P R CALL ME MAYBE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
HOPPER in the second flight while racing three, continued to stalk into the far turn, engaged the leader from between horses into the lane, dueled with the
runner up through upper stretch then edged away the final sixteenth under steady handling. CADDO RIVER settled off the pace and the inside, advanced to
challenge three wide late in the second turn, dueled upper stretch outside the winner, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, could not keep up
the final sixteenth. SMILE HAPPY lacked early foot toward the inside, continued to save ground midway on the final bend, traffic late in that turn, angled out
three wide between horses, mild late interest to be slowly getting to the top pair. HERO STATUS in the second flight inside, continued to save ground far
turn, also encountered some traffic with three sixteenths to run, finished up evenly when clear. NECKER ISLAND raced back off the pace off the rail, came
four wide for the drive, failed to muster a rally. SILVER PROSPECTOR off a step slow, raced off the pace while outside, floated out to be five wide exiting
the final turn, lacked response. ATOKA moved up to show the way into and through the first turn, set a glib set of fractions, faltered when headed by the top
two entering the stretch.

five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, went evenly through the lane. DELTA MOON went one paced inside, saved ground to no avail. MAGNOLIA MAE

the turn, angled out four wide for the drive, lacked a rally. MELANIA T in the second flight early, gave way three wide in the turn. MISS DOUBLE remained

STRAIGHT NO CHASER broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch, rebroke entering the stretch, drew off, ridden out. OSBOURNE last away,
moved up the inside, waited in traffic with four furlongs remaining, fell back, moved out, came three wide for the drive, shifted out a bit further when
straightened for home, finished with good energy to be up for the place. RUGGS away well, pressed the winner from the two path, lost contact and chased
that one pace the furlong marker, caught late for the runner up spot. GAR HOLE within striking distance outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting,
came up empty for the stretch run. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK turned in a one paced effort off the inside. SIR WELLINGTON forwardly placed along the
inside, gave way. MUCH BETTER in traffic outside the runner up late backstretch, four wide turning for home, had nothing for the drive.

EYEING CLOVER vied up front early along the inside, fell back off the leader early in the first turn, rank fell back soon after, crept closer up the rail into the
far turn, moved out and challenged soon after, showed the way into the turn, shook clear and held the runner up comfortably at back the final sixteenth.
GUN PILOT lacked early foot while moving outside, unhurried while three wide first turn, four wide and advancing far turn, challenged the winner from the
outside soon after, could not match that one in the drive, clearly second best. CACTUS vied between early, chased up backstretch, moved a b it closer in
the final turn then flattened out through the lane. POWERFUL behind the pace off the inside, continued to raced in the two path second bend while still well
back, steered out a bit, steadily gaining for the show late. ROCKING ROCKET sprinted clear from the outside before a quarter, set the pace, faltered when
headed 2nd turn.

SEEKING UNITY forwardly placed off the inside, stalked the dueling leaders up the backstretch, advanced and challenged that pair in the three path late in
the final turn, dueled, wore down runner up under firm handling. NIGHT EFFECT dueled up front closest to the inside, headed midway on the second turn,
regained the advantage on that rival as the winner was challenging upper start, gave ground grudgingly to that foe, well clear of the others. ROUTE
RUNNER lacked early foot toward the inside, remained in the two path into the far turn, traffic late turn, angled out sharply to soundly bump TAHOE RUN
upper stretch, could do little with those two the final furlong, prevailed for the show. AUTO GLIDE broke in, was straightened to alternate up front off the
inside, regained the advantage midway on the final bend, weakened from between horses in upper stretch. QUALITY CHIC five wide into the first turn, four
wide through the second bend when with mid pack, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late kick. TAHOE RUN lacked speed for six furlongs, moved
out four wide for room turning for home, soundly bumped by ROUTE RUNNER in upper stretch, brushed with that one again midstretch, also lacked a
closing kick. MANTA REY four wide into the first turn, five wide through the second bend, remained back. WAR RASCAL off a step slow, in some traffic near
the back of the pack late in the first turn, fell back, trailed home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH UPPER
STRETCH, NO ACTION.WAS TAKEN.

WET PAINT off a beat slow, remained unhurried for five furlongs off the inside, three wide into the far turn when beginning to move, angled a bit further
while being ridden along late in the turn, came five wide for the drive, put a head in front past the furlong marker, quickly clear under a firm hand ride and a
single left handed crop strike, clearly best. TAXED behind the pace while racing in the two path, in some traffic late in the final turn, shifted out further when
straightened for home, finished willingly to be up in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. OLIVIA TWIST restless loading, broke with the leaders,
prominent in the second flight, challenged three wide in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, caught for the place. CONDENSATION forwardly
placed while racing three wide in the first turn, remained closest to the leader in the two path second bend, within striking distance upper stretch, had little
left the final furlong. GRAND LOVE took command soon after the start, showed the way through the first turn, set a solid set of fractions, briefly responded
when confronted turning for home then faltered. PATE in mid pack and three wide first turn, continued off the inside, finished up evenly in lacking a closing
punch. TOWHEAD forwardly placed inside, saved ground to no avail. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA lacked speed off the rail, dropped to the inside second turn,
failed to muster a rally. ROYAL SPA made little impact while racing four wide. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY in mid pack for a half inside, backed up in a dull
effort.

Footnotes
GO WEST forwardly placed along the inside, eased out and advanced to challenge the leader in the two path by late in the turn, drove steadily clear.
FAVORITE OUTLAW broke sharp, cleared toward the inside before a quarter, dueled with the winner into the lane, could not match strides with that one to
the wire, saved the show. EXXEL prompted the pace while racing three wide, fell back off the top pair through upper stretch, getting back to the runner up
late while fully extended to preserve the show. ULTIMATE in mid pack while racing off the inside, in the two path through the turn, gaining for the show spot
late. EMERALD FOREST in the second flight off the inside, three to four wide early in the turn, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. SUMMER IN
MALIBU brushed start, void of early foot, moved out, briefly lost action three furlongs out, improved upper stretch then finished up evenly. IGNITIS in mid
pack and four wide, angled in a bit inside of a rival early in the turn, went one paced to the wire. RIDER'S SPECIAL hesitated at the start, remained always
back. DR. PERRY behind the pace along the inside, tired. BRESLAU in tight at the start, was never involved. TAPIT'S SPIRIT was finished early, trailed
home.

Footnotes
ANGEL OF EMPIRE unhurried for five furlongs off the inside, four wide into the far turn, began a good move on the outside soon after, gained command
into the stretch, quickly clear, drifted in, clearly best. KING RUSSELL lacked early foot, continued unhurried for five furlongs, asked along far turn, swung
five wide turning for home, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. REINCARNATE in the second
flight outside, remained prominent into the far turn, chased through that second bend, two path into the lane, lacked a closing punch to miss the place.
ROCKET CAN in mid pack and racing outside, crept closer four wide far turn, stalled into the lane while three wide and in some traffic, shifted out a bit,
coming again for the show. AIRTIME in the second flight while between foes, remained within striking distance into the stretch, came up empty in the late
going. RED ROUTE ONE off a step slow, raced well back, four wide into the lane when moving a bit closer, went flat in the final furlong to finish up evenly.
TWO EAGLES RIVER took command soon after the start, showed the way toward the inside, set a realistic pace while not heavily pressured, caved in when
confronted turning for home. INTERLOCK EMPIRE lacked speed, steered out to be four wide into the lane, brush, lacked a closing kick. HARLOCAP
forwardly placed in the second flight inside, backed up through the lane. BOURBON BASH in mid pack early, moved closer along the inside before a half,
waited five furlongs out then began to give way soon after.

Footnotes
TONKA WARRIOR lacked early foot, four wide onto the backstretch, asked along midway on the final turn, came six wide into the lane, outside bid, gained
the nod at the wire. OUTLIER prompted the pace while off the inside, continued to apply pressure into the far turn, put a head in front nearing the furlong
marker, missed between horses at the wire. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS away in good order, showed the way early, continued to set a pressured pace up the
backstretch, vied into the lane, proved stubborn through the lane to also narrowly miss. COSTA TERRA back off the pace, dropped inside in the second
turn, posed no threat to the top three in finishing up evenly. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK off a step slow, moved outside late in the first turn, improved position
off the inside into the lane, flattened out a bit in the late going. MAMZOOJ off a step slow, trailed early in displaying zero early foot, steered out widest for the
drive, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals. BACK RING LUCK within striking distance early, in some traffic onto the backstretch, improved while four
wide into the lane, weakened through the lane. MEGAN'S HONOR in mid pack early while four wide through the first turn, continued outside and raced five
wide through the second bend, tired through the stretch. EFFICIENCY forwardly placed while racing outside, four wide second bend, gave way. KNOCKER
DOWN in traffic along the inside first turn, continued forward, stopped in the drive.
