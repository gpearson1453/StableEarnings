Footnotes
LIKE MOULIN ROUGE stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then took command around the three eighths pole, cleared the turn and kept
to task down the lane to prove best. RB TEXAS HOLD EM chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the turn to menace down the
lane but it wasn't enough to catch the leader. RB RATHOWAYNE settled along the inside down the backstretch and into the turn then rallied in the upper
stretch to close well in the end. VAZS DANCING HESS lead the way from the gate down the early backstretch then slowly faded entering the turn and had
no energy in the stretch. KISSOUUR raced down the backstretch while two wide behind the pack, bid three wide on the turn and was no menace.

Footnotes
MOR PEANUTS chased the pace while three wide, was moving up to gain command at the top of the turn, then drew off in the stretch under a confident
hand drive. CANDY BEE chased the pace in the middle of the pack while two wide into the turn, then rallied in the stretch to close willingly in the end. FAST
TRACK chased the pace while two wide, was in a strong drive on the turn to rally in the stretch but it wasn't enough and was best for show. MY PATRIOTIC
GIRL raced while four wide, then rallied in the late stretch but it was too little too late. THE NEXT BIG BLING bumped rivals at the start, tracked the pace
from the inside into the turn then bid in the early stretch but came up evenly. SING IT BESSIE raced behind the field while two wide, bid on the turn and was
no threat. TEXAS TWINKIES settled along the inside and was no menace. SALT N LIME broke back behind the field, then rushed to lead the way into the
turn, was expended in the early stretch and tired in the end.

MAINLINE dueled for the lead with an inner rival, pulled away from that rival on the turn, then kicked clear in the early stretch and held on grudgingly to
prove best in the end. THINKITASADONATION chased the pace from the inside, then came out three wide on the turn to bid gamely in the stretch and
closed willingly in the end. FLY CONDOR was in a hard drive to duel for the lead from the inside into the turn, then gave way in the late stretch, missing the
place prize in the end. STILL OF THE NIGHT tracked the pace from the inside, then bid four wide on the turn then continued to race evenly throughout the
stretch. SPECIAL TREASURE chased the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn to rally in the early stretch but came up evenly in the end.
GREY HALO was unhurried early along the inside, then bid on the turn but came up evenly in the stretch. FOREVER LIGHTS raced while five wide into the
turn and was no menace. TEXAS THUNDER tracked the pace while two wide then slowly faded entering the turn and was no menace.
