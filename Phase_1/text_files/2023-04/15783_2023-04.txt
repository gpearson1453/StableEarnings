Footnotes
QUEEN OF BEERS stalked the pacesetter from the onset, loomed up at the quarter pole and drew clear through the lane under steady urging. SI QUERE
settled near the rear of the field, saved ground through the far turn while put to an early drive, and rallied belatedly to gain the place. BLONDES HAVEMO
FUN broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well measured pace and responded when called upon into the lane and weakened late in the drive.
EUROROSE chased the leaders from the rail and failed to mount a rally in the stretch while traveling evenly. CHAPARRITA exchanged bumps with HIT'EM
UP leaving the gate, dropped to the rear of the field and showed mild interest while rallying late behind horses. HIT'EM UP bumped at the start, raced up on
the first turn to track the leaders from three wide, made a bid into the far turn and flattened out down the lane.

Footnotes
GUITAR GROUPIE was well rated along the inside while racing down the backstretch, was gaining on the turn, shifted to the three path in the upper stretch,
then kicked clear under a confident drive to prove best in the end. GOLD MEMORIES vied for the lead between rivals down the first half of the course, then
dueled on the turn, continued to rally in the stretch then gave way in the late stretch and was best for second. SHACK IT TO ME was in a long drive to vie
for the lead from the inside, then dueled with an outer rival on the turn, then gave way in the stretch. JULIE'S PASSION was allowed to settle along the
inside down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch but it was too little to late. BLACK CHEETAH was unhurried early then settled
on the backstretch while two wide, then bid in the home stretch and was no threat. MADAME RUE vied for the lead while three wide, was in a hard drive
throughout the first half, was used up on the turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
DELIRIUM taken in hand from the gate, rated well off the leaders through the turn, swung five wide for the drive and prevailed to be going away at the wire.
BREW CREW rated in mid-pack off the leaders, steadily gained between horses in the turn to challenge and finished willingly in a good effort. JAMES'S
MOONSHINE sped away from the gate to take command early, opened a clear advantage to the top of the stretch and weakened late in the drive.
UNCORKED HUMOR was well placed through the turn while tracking the leaders and failed to mount a rally. RECKLESS RED reserved off the early lead,
rushed up four wide in the turn to loom boldly and flattened out in the lane. HARRY raced up the rail to duel for the early lead and was through after a half
mile. SELLING SHORT broke alertly, dropped back steadily.

COLD NIGHT AIR lead the way into the first turn, then dueled down the backstretch, maintained stride throughout the turn, was confronted by a new rival
heading into the stretch then edged clear in late stretch to prove best. RUN WITT RUN chased the pace while three wide, was urging on the far turn to
challenge an inner rival for the lead in the early stretch, then was out finished on the end and held on for the place prize. TEXAS TWINKIES settled along
the inside, bid on the turn to rally in the upper stretch then closed willingly in the end just missing the place position. KAUSE I'M DEVINE was rank early,
then was unhurried, was moving up swiftly while three wide on the backstretch, bid from the two path on the turn to close well in the end but it was not
enough. LEXINGTON DIVA dueled from the two path down the backstretch and into the turn, settled back along the inside, then rallied mid stretch, drifted
out to the sixth path before giving way in the end. TRANQUILITY raced in the middle of the field along the rail into the turn, menaced in the stretch and was
no threat. REASON OVER RICHES settled in the two path, then bid on the turn but did no respond in the stretch.

FOREVER LIGHTS broke near the rear of the pack, rushed up to take command and lead in a three way duel early, put both of the pace pressers away at
the top of the lane and held the closers safe in a well handled ride. TOOTIE reserved off the early leaders through the turn, split horses in upper stretch and
closed with a belated rush to gain the place. SALTAMONTES DIVA rated near the back of the pack early, circled three wide in the turn and closed well on
the outside to be gaining late and just miss the place. PRIDDIS pressed the pace from three wide throughout, engaged the leader midway on the turn and
failed to sustain his rally. TEXAS TIDELANDS showed early speed dueling between horses for half a mile and flattened out turning for home. GANGSTER
RAP trailed early and was never a threat. WILD PROSPECT flashed brief speed and was through early.

CHARLIE T well rated off the leaders early in mid-pack, dropped back in the turn along the fence, angled out turning for home and was up in time in a hard
drive. MEDALLA MATCH raced prominently throughout, ranged up three wide turning for home, battled the winner to the wire and just missed in a game
effort. NEON SUMMER stalked the pacesetter from the gate through the turn, threatened down the lane and finished gamely in a good try. CHIKARA trailed
through the turn and closed with a belated late rush to be gaining down the lane. PRINCESS PHONE went evenly without seriously threatening. TOLONDA
broke sharply to speed off to a clear lead, maintained the advantage to the top of the stretch and tired. STAN'S GOLDEN PATH flashed brief early foot and
flattened out.
