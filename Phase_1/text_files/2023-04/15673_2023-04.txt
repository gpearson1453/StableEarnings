MISSCZECH was away in good order to press the pace of J T'S LA NENA while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off with complete authority. MS PARKSIDE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the
turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. WE ALL AGREE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave
way after going a half. HOLY TUTTA BELLA lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. YATAHEY lagged early, raced
four-wide through the turn and did not menace. J T'S LA NENA set a pressured pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

LOOPY broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin and
was fully extended to prevail by a narrowing margin. PRANCE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, rallied late and just
missed. ALICESHOUSEOFHEART was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with a
steady bid. DADDY'S GIRL lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and finished with some late run. SASSY CAT sprinted clear soon after the
start, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BLESSED ANGEL was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with BOUGIE LIKE NATTY while racing four-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter,
opened a clear margin and was ridden out to the wire to increase that advantage. STAR SO FAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. BOUGIE LIKE NATTY broke sharply to dispute the early fractions with the
winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. STAY BY THE BEACH was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. THRILL TOWN lagged, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. DRAMADORA raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not
a factor. R HAPPY PLACE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. SHES A KILLA QUEEN pressed the pace while

MAD LUTHER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear lead with a furlong to
run and held sway to the wire. BOTTLE OF SMOKE settled off the leaders from between foes, angled out nearing the quarter and finished with a steady bid.
PROVOST was away in good order to dispute the pace with BIG BARREL while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. SPIRE showed
no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. GALLANT OAK was off a step slow, raced four-wide through both turns while
forwardly placed and weakened in the drive. CHEF lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. BIG BARREL set a
pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a half. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HYPERFOCUS lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. MY INDY was away in
good order to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way to the winner through the
final sixteenth. HAPI HAPI chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain late. MOOGIE SON settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn, lacked room in mid-stretch and finished evenly when clear. NORTHCUT sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the
rail while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters. MONGOLIAN MEMORY broke in the air and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
