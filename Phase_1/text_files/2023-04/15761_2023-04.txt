Footnotes
SASSY CHARLEE led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn and held that margin to the wire.
SHALL RETURN raced off the pace on the outside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and improved position in the lane. CSILLA
brushed lightly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. READY TO FILM brushed with the horse to his inside at the start, chased the leader up the backstretch,
navigated the bend from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. WHISKARITA trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
four path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LORD BERRIER dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best.
THAT'S MY BOI TOY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and
improved position in the stretch. ODDS ON tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path and chased
on from there. CAMPTOWN RACES chased the leader on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. GOLOVKIN stalked
the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the bend and was outkicked in the lane. TAPSOLUTE settled in the middle
of the pack between horses through the opening stages, raced into tight quarters headed into the turn, switched out to the four path and was empty in the
lane. ALMASHRIQ dueled on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.
BEASTFROMTHEEAST trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and made no bid.

Footnotes
HIDDEN WARRIOR dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming around the turn, swung wide into the stretch
and dueled gamely to the wire to hold the win. JACKSON STRONG pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, battled from the
four path coming around the turn and continued to duel to the finish, narrowly missing. FREELANCE bumped with the horses to both sides at the start,
tracked the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the five path around the turn and chased the top two home in the lane. AWKWARD PAUSE raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside early, continued around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late.
SKIPPERINI bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the
five path around the turn and continued to improve position in the stretch. AGENT COOPER bumped with the horses to both sides at the break, raced in the
middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly while never threatening. THEJIGISUP chased
the leaders on the inside early, navigated the bend from the two path and weakened in the lane. THORN brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the
gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. GUNMAN veered in and bumped hard with the
horse to his inside at the break, recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming around the turn and
tired in the stretch.

edged clear in the final furlong. RITABOOK brushed with the horse to her inside at the start, recovered to stalk the leaders on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and gained ground late. LAVEAU brushed with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four and five path and gained ground in late
stretch. ATHENA'S WISDOM was reluctant to load, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and continued to duel down the
stretch, weakening in the final strides. OPEN SKY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and finished
evenly. COWGIRLLOVER raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and gained ground
mildly in the stretch while never threatening. NEVER WALK ALONE dueled between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around
the bend and continued to fade in the lane. FINAL NOTE bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the
opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path and showed no kick. SOPRISE ASTRAY veered out leaving the gate, raced off the pace
on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. CELEBRATION DANCE chased the leaders on the inside

Footnotes
STREET GLIDE raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the
three path, fanned wide into the stretch and pulled clear. LORD OF THE NILE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, switched to the outside to find racing room with a furlong to go and kept on to the wire. MAGIC
WIZARD saved ground early, raced off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the second turn and improved position in
the lane. RAGING WHIRLWIND raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path for the run around the far bend
and finished evenly. FINLANDIAS NEAT saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around
the far turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. KENJI'S EMPIRE hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, led
the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and tired in the lane. SAN ANDRES saved ground early, stalked the pace setters on the
inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch. RECTANGLE raced in the four path
around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch and around the far bend and was not a factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE NINE, LORD OF THE NILE,
FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE EIGHT, STREED GLIDE, CITING INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE

win late. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and dueled to the wire to
narrowly miss. LADY FRIJOLES bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile,
began a bid from the five path coming around the turn and gained ground late. ITSAKEYPER raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the bend
from the three path and improved position in the stretch. IDEAL BREEZE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and weakened in the lane. PROPER MANNERS bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses through the
opening stages, saved ground around the bend and never threatened. BAHAMIAN MOON led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the
three path around the turn and faded in the stretch. HUNTRESS MOON bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced off the pace early, saved
ground around the turn and made no bid. THE ISABEL ASTRAY veered out leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and was never a factor.
