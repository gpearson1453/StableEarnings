Footnotes
TEXAS BASIN settled off the pace, bid strongly wide on the turn, lugged in crowding rival at the 1/8 pole, was straightened and drew off. CROATIAN raced
off the pace then closed well to gain the place. FAST BREAKIN CASH set a pressured pace inside, steadied in tight at the 1/8 pole then yielded and was
nailed for the place. WILLY MC lacked speed then advanced wide on the final turn with a mild bid. PLAMEN dropped far behind, bid closer on final turn then
flattened out in the stretch. NIGHT OPS trailed for three quarters, moved very wide on the final turn. PARADISE PRIDE forced the pace inside for half a mile
and faded. ARTISTIC REASON prompted the pace in the two path for five furlongs and stopped. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run of the
race and the third finisher claimed foul against the winner for interference in the stretch resulting in the disqualification of the first finisher to third.

SKERRETT vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, put a head in front nearing the eighth pole, battled heads apart with LOUELLA STREET in the
final furlong, dug in gamely between horses in deep stretch and got the nod at the wire. LA REGALADA stalked close up three wide, chased the leaders on
the turn, raced behind the leaders, then angled out at the sixteenth marker, surged late outside and just missed at the finish. LOUELLA STREET vied inside
for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely inside of SKERRETT past midstretch, battled back determinedly and continued willingly to the
end. THE FURMANATOR raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch drive. HEART LIGHT racd off the
pace, came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly. VERDANDI raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. DYSFUNCTIONAL stalked four wide,
chased on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LORD OF THE NAVY showed good early speed in the two path, set the pace, began to pull away on the turn, drew off under urging and was in hand for the
final yards. STREET LIGHTNING stalked close up outside a rival, chased the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and was clear for the
place award. CAPITAL CONQUEST raced off the early pace, then chased inside, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly in the lane. SPIRIT SKY
raced three or four wide off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, lacked a rally and finished evenly. T'WAS THE NIGHT was outrun early, advanced
inside on the turn and closed belatedly. SEPARATE WAYS raced off the pace between rivals, moved up in traffic entering the turn, then checked, moved to
the inside and failed to threaten. UPFOR PAROLE raced four or five wide off the pace, four wide on the turn and tired. NORLANDER raced off the rail, off
the pace, went five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN chased close up between rivals, chased on the turn and tired.
GAMBLER'S RUN was outrun early and did not factor. OUR RONNY ALAN raced close up early on the rail contesting the pace, then chased inside and
gave way. VENTILATOR raced off the pace between rivals and gave way. A Jockey Objection by the rider of SEPARATE WAYS against the fourth place
finisher was dismissed.

GET THE W dueled inside, moved clear before half a mile and held on determinedly under steady handling. STRUGAR advanced outside on the turn and
made a gradual late gain but could not catch the winner. MR. ROUNDTREE settled off the pace inside then continued along the rail with late energy.
COMMISSIONER G hustled well off the leaders outside then finished full of run too late. NIMBLE BEAST pressed the winner outside for half a mile and
weakened. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE settled just behind the dueling pacesetters and gave way. SUIGU STAR trailed far behind and lacked a rally. TRIGGER
PULL dropped back early and faded steadily.

third. PEARLS AND HEELS stalked outside early on, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, weakened late and lost third. WISHES AND

and failed to threaten. ONE WILD WOMAN raced off the pace and did not factor.
