Footnotes
PARABELLUM moved clear under mild coaxing, shifted in early on the first turn, set the pace racing on or just off the rail, shook off foes in upper stretch and
held sway while being kept to the task. RUNQUIETLY switched outside the leader and eventual winner early on the first turn, stalked that one then edged
closer to press up the backstretch racing two to three wide, lost ground into upper stretch but closed the gap late but was only second best. BIG
NORTHERN RIVER stalked three to four wide, encouraged along at the quarter pole but ran on evenly. GOLDBRIDGE shifted in on the first turn, tracked
inside near the rail, asked for more past the quarter, had no response. GREAT REALIZATION was a bit rank in the early going racing off the inside, saved
ground on the far turn before swinging out for the drive but failed to rally.

Footnotes
KICK IT AGAIN BOB was quickly clear to set the pace racing off the rail, was prompted by an inside rival coming to the half, dueled with that one then
began to edge clear again midway on the turn, was clear into mid-stretch, was shortening stride and kept on desperately to just last over. MAJESTIC
LIAISON , who was bumped into a rival at the start, moved forward to force the pace inside, dueled for a while then began losing ground on the turn, still
had much to do by mid-stretch but kept on late, gained steadily under urging but just missed. HOLCOMBE was bumped at the break, ranged up outside
rivals mid-pack going four to five wide on the turn, was closing willingly but too late. OKIE CHROME tracked from inside the second flight on or just off the
rail, needed more. PONZA raced at the back off the rail but inside a foe, went in the three path mostly through the turn, failed to menace. STOLEN GHOST
bumped the outside rival at the start, raced at the back outside going four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. WARRIOR'S STAR shifted in, chased from
between runners three wide in the second flight, faded. DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL MALFUNCTION, FINISH MARGINS PROVIDED BY CHARTCALLER.
DUE TO MUTUELS MALFUNCTION ALL WAGERS FOR THIS RACE WERE REFUNDED.

RAINBOWS ARE FREE tracked from inside, edged closer and began to move out at the five-sixteenths launching a bid three wide, took command at the
top of the stretch, forged clear. WITSEC was coaxed forward, set the pace racing just off the rail, was challenged turning for home, proved no match but
second best. FREE SPIRITED was brushed lightly after the start, moved forward from the break then settled in to stalk three wide, pursued from between
runners up the backstretch, was still in range three then four wide on the far turn and encouraged along from the three-eighths, had no late response.
SHEZONEZESTREET was bumped at the break, moved forward pursuing the leader from outside four wide, dropped back and faded. SHAWK'S LIL AVA
bumped the outer rival then the inside foe lightly at the start, shifted in to the two path entering the first turn, was outpaced.

Footnotes
SUPERBLEA settled off the pace, advanced outside three then four then five wide on the turn with aim on the leader in upper stretch, gained steadily and
slowly under steady urging and just got up at the wire. SAILSINTHESUNSET stalked the pace early, moved nearer to press from about the seven-sixteenths
going three wide on the turn, took command in upper stretch, had the lead but was just caught. DIXIELAND CANDY settled off the leaders tracking inside,
came out for the stretch and ran on. CAMCORDIA set the pace racing inside on or just off the rail, was challenged leaving the backstretch, overtaken by
upper stretch and yielded. RIVER LIBERTY was taken up a couple strides after the start then urged strongly but lacking early speed, passed outside a rival
four to five wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. SEE WHAT'S WHAT chased briefly from between runners about three wide, steadily
dropped back and faded.

THETRUTHISTHETRUTH broke on top, settled off the leader stalking three wide, advanced to draw even midway on the far turn, took command in upper
stretch and under urging forged clear then was eased up late. BILLIE G was caught outside rivals five wide early, advanced four wide on the far turn, drew
nearly even with the leaders coming to the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but second best. EUTYCHIA settled last but one, took closer order two
wide up the backstretch, came out in upper stretch and improved position. GP'S AMAZING GRACE stalked four wide, lost position on the far turn still racing
four to five deep, needed more but improved position in the stretch. MUSICAL MILLIE settled at the rear inside, switched off the rail past the seven-eighths
then back in, moved closer up the backstretch, came out a bit for the drive and ran on. BID FOR POWER moved clear to set the pace in the two path, was
under a tight hold early up the backstretch and pressured at that juncture, dueled briefly late on the far turn then gave way.

Footnotes
BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY settled mid-pack racing outside four then three wide on the first turn, was encouraged along coming to the five-sixteenths moving
out from three to four wide on the far turn, came into upper stretch five wide, was gaining steadily and surged late to just get up over. CHEROKEE LEGACY
, who shifted in on the first turn making the rail by the six-and-one-half, tracked the leading pair up the backstretch from inside, advanced along the rail and
asked about the five-sixteenths, took the lead just past the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out through mid- to late-stretch and just failed
to last. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE stalked the early pace three wide, edged closer to press the pace past the five-eighths, made a mild bid for the lead three
deep about the quarter pole, needed more. GOSPEL BUZZ broke in the air and bobbled thereafter, raced off the pace two wide, advanced some on the far
turn coming out six wide in upper stretch, ran on. FRIGERATOR was mildly coaxed forward to set the pace racing just off the rail, pressured into the far turn,
weakened in the stretch. MORHAWK shifted in and saved ground early, was not a factor.

SMART OKIE shifted in heading up the backstretch tucking in behind the leaders tracking inside through the turn, bid inside on the rail and took command at
the top of the stretch, kicked clear while drifting out just a bit and widened under steady handling. SAYAAD AIN'T SO set the pace racing off the rail, was no
match for the winner but held the place. RAINBOW SMILES was bumped at the start, tucked in behind the leading group racing three to four wide on the
turn, swung out six deep for the drive, ran on for show honors. ALL AFLUTTER pursued from outside going five wide on the turn needed more. BOUJEE
BRITT chased four wide, lacked the needed late kick. WOW WOW ITS MAGIC tracked the pace two to three wide, was lacking some room late on the turn,
failed to rally. MISS COFFEYVILLE bumped a rival at the start, was off the pace two wide through the turn, swung five deep for the drive, was not a threat.

BOLD COURAGE settled off the leading trio three wide early, advanced on the far turn, was asked for more coming to the quarter pole, took aim in the
stretch, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and edged clear under urging. MANDOLIN WIND set the early tempo inside, was overtaken up the
backstretch, eased back and switched outside the new leader, moved on that one to take the lead at the five-sixteenths, was clear turning for home and
through upper stretch but collared in late stretch. PRINCE OF EARL settled outside a rival at the rear three wide, gained some three to four wide on the far
turn, ran on for show. SOMERSETSLASTRIDE was urged strongly from the break to move forward between rivals on the first turn and early up the
backstretch, edged to a clear advantage to set the terms later up the backstretch, overtaken on the far turn, weakened. SCRIMSHIRE was kept off the rail
but raced well back and failed to menace. CONSTITUTION DAY had brief pursuit of the leaders three to four wide, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
LIL BEAN MACHINE settled mid-pack, went three then four wide on the turn beginning to advance, had aim in mid-stretch and unleased a strong rally to
drive past a sixteenth out. CAT TALE BREEZE was forwardly-placed inside rivals on or off the rail vying for the lead, was relegated back to second midway
on the turn, fought on in the stretch to regain position for the place but was outkicked by the winner. EASTER VISION attended the pace from outside three
to four wide, took the lead by the five-sixteenths, was in command in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. BIKER BABE pursued from outside
going five wide through the turn and ran on evenly. GREEN LIGHT GIRL was in the rear half of the field racing off the inside, swung six wide into upper
stretch and improved position. DEVINE CANDY was forwardly-placed vying between runners two to three wide briefly, dropped back, had no extra. ENVEY
N ICE got away slowly and a bit awkwardly, settled at the back outside, swung five to six deep and passed rivals. SALT CREEK GAL lacked early speed
despite some encouragement racing off the inside part of the track, failed to menace. QUICK OKIE chased two wide, came up empty. GOOD LIQUOR was
never a threat racing off the rail. DA COACH'S WIFE tracked from mid-pack inside, was eased through the stretch, walked off.
