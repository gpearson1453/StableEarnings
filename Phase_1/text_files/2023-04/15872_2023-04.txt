three eighths pole but flattened in the three path of the turn. YESSIROFFICER gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. DIVA

pressure past the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. RAGTIME RICHES rounded the first turn
about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and settled for second while finishing evenly.
CORRECTED PEDIGREE stalked in the three path the first turn, took a brief lead past the nine sixteenths pole, was met approaching the three eighths and
gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the rail leaving the five sixteenths and flattened in the lane. TAKE AIM rated close two deep on the first turn,
gave chase toward the seven sixteenths but flattened in the three path of the far turn. GOLDEN ADAGE rated close inside on the opening turn then faded
through the backstretch. MAJOR NELSON raced in the six path on the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn outside and showed little in the lane. ROCK ANNA ROLL took the lead and angled to the inside,

Footnotes
SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY saved ground on the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn, dug in for the
lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. SOMEBODY LOVES ME was hustled for early position with the lead inside but dropped back through the
first turn, recovered stride leaving the half mile pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, left the turn outside and dug in to take second the final yards.
GILDED QUEST rated close off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, took the lead passing the five sixteenths and drew
clear leaving the quarter, but was caught flattening stride in later yards. CUT FROM CLASS took the lead two deep into the first turn and raced with the
pace inside, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail into the far turn and flattened
stride. BLONDE SAMARITAN raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane.
DREAM OF GOLD stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but steadied between horses at the five sixteenths
pole and weakened off the rail on the far turn. ALICORN showed little response. AWESOME LUCKYCHARM dropped well back early on. This race was
hand timed.
