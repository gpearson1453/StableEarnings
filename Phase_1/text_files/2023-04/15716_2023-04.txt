Footnotes
VANISKY settled off of the early pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn then into the backstretch run, advanced to come within aim heading to the
far turn, was roused three then two wide nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, extended the lead to the furlong marker and kept to
task in the late stages to prevail. LYING GHOST broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, ceded the early lead to INDIANERA and stalked that
rival through moderate fractions into the backstretch run, steadied in tight quarters entering the second turn, chased VANISKY to mid-stretch, was not able
to make headway on the winner in the final stages and just held for second at the finish. RUNAWAY KRISTIN was unhurried in the early stages, trailed to
the second turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong pole and just missed for second, while getting up in time to secure third.
BEROLIJEAN (FR) was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight while not far back through the
backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, gained ground heading to mid-stretch, was not able to muster the needed late response and was
outkicked in deep stretch. CARSON'S LEGACY chased the moderate pace, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn, could not sustain that run in the
stretch and flattened out. WILD WAGER settled off of the early pace while not far back, raced four wide into the far turn, was outrun to mid-stretch and
lacked a late rally. INDIANERA was prominent into the first turn, assumed command into the backstretch run and set modest fractions to the half-mile
marker, came under pressure from VANISKY at the quarter marker, was overtaken and chased that rival to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
GROSS PROFIT was prominent into the first turn, attended to the modest fractions through the backstretch run, confronted EFFECTIVE GIG nearing the
quarter marker, dueled with that foe to mid-stretch, continued to battle with EFFECTIVE GIG to deep stretch while exchanging bumps and determinedly
prevailed at the finish. EFFECTIVE GIG broke alertly and dictated terms in the early going, set modest fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted
by GROSS PROFIT nearing the quarter pole, met that bid and battled to mid-stretch, continued to duel with GROSS PROFIT to deep stretch, traded bumps
with that rival through the final stages and was gamely bested at the finish, while clear of the rest for second. DOS VICIOS was unhurried in the early going,
raced three wide along the first turn, trailed into the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, made up a bit of ground at mid-stretch, closed well in
the late stages and was up in time to secure third. NORTHERN JEWEL stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the backstretch
run, gained ground three deep on the far turn, could not match strides with the top two in upper stretch and was outfinished for third in the final stages.
HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE tracked the pace from a ground saving position into the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and did not offer a response in
the drive. CALI CONQUEST was allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, was not far back heading to the far turn, was steered three wide
to the quarter marker, lost position in the stretch run and lacked a late response.

BANDERA AZTECA stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, loomed at mid-stretch, drew to even terms with
HORSE DOCTOR inside of the furlong pole, dueled to the outside of HORSE DOCTOR to deep stretch and determinedly won the nod on the wire to prevail.
HORSE DOCTOR broke alertly, ceded the early lead to PAPAPIFAS and pressed that foe into the turn, advanced nearing the quarter pole, overtook
PAPAPIFAS in upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong pole, was confronted by BANDERA AZTECA at mid-stretch, met that bid to the
sixteenth-marker, took a narrow lead in deep stretch, could not match strides with BANDERA AZTECA in the final stages and was gamely bested, while
clear of the rest for second. GRIT AND CURIOSITY chased in the early stages while not far back, maintained position while three wide on the turn, rallied
three wide into the drive, gained ground at the furlong pole, needed more in the late stages and was clear in the end for third. AWESOME DUDE chased the
decent early pace, raced two wide into the stretch and did not threaten. PAPAPIFAS was hard sent in the early going and established the lead heading to
the turn, set decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
REV REE took back off of the decent early pace, tracked the leaders through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn, came within aim while three
deep nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead in upper stretch then took command approaching the furlong pole, kept to task under steady urging to deep
stretch and proved best in the end. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was allowed to settle in the early going, improved position while three wide on the second turn,
raced four wide into the stretch, drifted out a bit coming into the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages, was not able to reel in REV
REE in deep stretch and won the nod for second on the wire. JACRODRA'S DEVIL broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms along the
first turn, drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run then widened the lead heading to the half-mile pole, held a clear lead to the quarter marker, was
overtaken by REV REE in upper stretch,chased to the furlong marker and stayed on to deep stretch, could not impact the winner in the final stages and was
nailed on the line for second, while clear of the rest for third. ZELAIA was asked to show speed and was prominent early on, took to a stalking position along
the first turn, chased JACRODRA'S DEVIL through the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter on the far turn, could not make additional headway in
the stretch and weakened in the final stages. MISS MAIA bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight through the backstretch
run, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive and did not offer a late response. CIELO DIAMANTE was unhurried in the early
stages, saved ground through the backstretch run and into the far turn, was steered five wide to the quarter marker, slipped back to the two path for the
drive and did not factor in the late stages.

GARDEES WORLD broke alertly, showed good early speed and set the pace to the turn, drew to a clear lead at the the quarter marker, extended the lead
to mid-stretch, kept to task while under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, felt late pressure from MAYCEE JO and held in a drive at the finish to prevail.
MAYCEE JO was squeezed at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, improved position while three wide on the turn, closed
well in the drive, put late pressure on GARDEES WORLD but could not reel that one in and held safely for second. CLOCHARD STREET chased the solid
early pace from the second flight, raced two wide along the turn, was roused four wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in deep stretch and
was up in time to secure third. HALF HOPING chased the early pace from the second flight, gained ground from the rail on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and was outfinished for third. HEAD START chased the fast early pace, lost a bit of ground while two wide on
the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and stopped in the stretch. COASTAL STARLITE was shuffled back at the start, spotted the field in the early stages,
saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not factor.

HANDR'SDREAM showed good early speed and established the pace, set solid fractions to the turn, drew to a clear lead at the quarter marker, was in hand
to mid-stretch, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker under steady urging and held sway in the final stages to prevail. SIERRA MELODY chased the solid
early pace, lost ground on the turn while two wide, was steered four wide into the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the late stages, was
not able to reel in the winner in deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. HUNTERS GHOST chased the fast early pace, raced three deep into the
turn, slipped to the two path for the drive, gained a bit of ground at mid-stretch, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in the late stages and was
outkicked for second, while holding safely at the end for third. PHANTOM DROP bobbled at the start, was prominent in the early stages then took back off of
the solid early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, gained ground at mid-stretch, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished in deep
stretch. HEREDIA BOXER was squeezed at the start and was off a step slowly, was forwardly placed in the early running and chased the solid pace to the
turn, lost position heading to the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch run and lacked a late rally. SATANTA was unhurried in the early stages,
saved ground to the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch run, closed willingly in the final furlong but was unable to threaten.

ONE FAST BRO broke a step slowly and was unhurried in the early going, settled through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, tipped two
wide for the drive, loomed nearing mid-stretch, split rivals at the furlong pole, assumed command into the final furlong, was kept to steady urging to deep
stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prove best. CONUNDRUM was forwardly placed in the early running, slipped to the rail heading into the first turn
and stalked the pace from a ground saving position into the backstretch run, advanced while saving all of the ground into the far turn, gained ground in
upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, could not keep pace in deep stretch with ONE FAST BRO and just held for second at the wire. ENOS
SLAUGHTER was allowed to settle early on, raced two wide into the backstretch run, improved position along the backstretch run, gained ground while two
wide on the second turn, swung seven wide into the stretch run, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for second at
the wire, while just getting up to secure third. SUPERMAZEL showed good early speed and dictated terms into the first turn, set a pressured pace into the
backstretch run, carved out solid fractions while under pressure to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, was overtaken by ONE FAST BRO
at the furlong marker, chased that leader to deep stretch while still within aim and was outfinished on the line for second and third. TABLE FOR TWO was
prominent in the early running, kept close attendance to SUPERMAZEL through solid fractions into the backstretch run, kept pressure on the pacesetter to
the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch run, lost a bit of ground while still vying for the lead at the furlong marker and tired in the final stages.
BIG FLAME was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn, gained ground while three
wide nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, encountered a bit of traffic in deep stretch and was gaining in the final sixteenth.
GALLANT WARREN settled in the second flight in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, gained ground while two wide on the second turn,
rallied three wide into the stretch drive, came within aim at the furlong marker, could not match strides in deep stretch and was outkicked. CHIEF WILD
EAGLE settled off of the early pace while not far back, raced four wide into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the half-mile marker, ran five
wide into the stretch run, made a mild late bid but could not muster the needed late response. ACCLIDER was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked
the pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run, lost position heading to the half-mile marker, came four wide into the second turn, was steered six
wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker while within aim of the lead and gave way in the final stages. LOST IN SPACE (IRE) took back off of
the solid early pace, raced four wide into the backstretch run, lost ground heading to the half-mile marker, improved position four wide at the quarter pole,
swung six wide into the stretch drive and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
ST. PADDY'S CHARM last out of the gate, got back into contact with the field quickly, steadied off heels just past the five furlong marker, launched a steady
and sustained bid with a half mile to run, was stuck behind horses turning for home, squeezed through a narrow opening near the sixteenths pole and
surged ahead in the final jumps. DEBS TIZ broke alertly then settled behind the dueling leaders, rallied wide though the turn, emerged six wide into the
stretch, rallied strongly and came up a bit short in a good effort on debut. BOB'S BLUE MOON raced mid-pack down the backstretch, began to move
forward through the turn but was in traffic, then in tight as the field turned for home, powered through an opening in mid-stretch, bumped SLEW'S JOY
several times while running on well to the wire. MY BUCKET LIST broke well, made light contact with TEAGANS ATM from the inside, rushed up with that
rival to get a share of the early lead, dueled to the stretch, gained a brief lead, held on gamely with a host of challengers to the outside then weakened in the
final yards. SLEW'S JOY broke well and was up with the early leaders, steadied near the half-mile pole then was boxed in through the turn to mid-stretch,
moved willingly through an opening in deep stretch and finished well under intermittent urging while being bumped repeatedly by BOB'S BLUE MOON to the
wire. XANDER broke in slightly and tried to avoid making contact with MY BUCKET LIST to the inside then had to steady slightly when DEO came over a
few steps out of the gate, then was allowed to settle into stride, saved ground through the turn but was held up behind horses while full of run, swung nine
wide into the stretch and closed willingly. MURLOC BAY broke inward and bumped mutually with BOOMING BERNARDO after the start, attempted to gain
better position but was forced to race four wide through the turn, tipped six wide into the stretch and was part of six across the track battling for the lead, was
finishing well then was forced to steady hard when ST. PADDY'S CHARM cut off the path yards from the finish. BOOMING BERNARDO broke out and
bumped mutually with MURLOC BAY just after the break, cleared off and angled inward to get the lead, then was quickly joined to the inside by TEAGANS
ATM and MY BUCKET LIST, backed off the duel while heading into the turn then re-bid with three furlongs to run, took a brief lead at the top of the stretch
but could not sustain and was outfinished in the final furlong. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF was outrun from the break, chased the field from far back, kept to the
inside through the turn and finished well enough to pass a couple of stragglers late. DEO fractious before the start, broke inward at the break then over
corrected to the outside and made light contact with XANDER, was close up but behind horses then shifted to the inside, was prompted to keep up through
the turn then was done just past the quarter pole. TEAGANS ATM broke out and brushed lightly with MY BUCKET LIST, rushed up to grab a share of the
lead racing on the rail, dueled to the stretch then tired just past the three-sixteenths pole.
