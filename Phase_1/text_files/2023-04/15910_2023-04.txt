Footnotes
CAT BANDIT broke alertly, sped to the early lead and set solid fractions while pressured into the turn, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the
furlong marker, was kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and drew away in the final stages. CUTE RENEGADE took back off of the solid early
pace, saved ground along the turn, was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch but made a mild late bid and outfinished A PERFECT PATH in the final
strides to secure second. A PERFECT PATH chased the fast pace from the inside, advanced nearing the quarter marker, was outrun by CAT BANDIT into
the drive, was outfinished for second in the final strides and held safely for third. CALIGRAPHY chased the fast early pace from a two wide path, was
steered four wide into the stretch and weakened in the drive. ABBEY OOPS asked to show early speed, pressed the quick pace while outside of CAT
BANDIT into the turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CARSON'S LEGACY unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the turn, tipped three wide and was roused at the top of the stretch, advanced
nearing the furlong marker, took command at the sixteenth-pole and drove clear in the final stages. RIVER'S BEHEST prominent in the early running, took
back and stalked the moderate pace into the turn, ran two wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong pole and
just held for second on the wire. THE SANDY SURPRISE allowed to settle while outside of runners in the early stages, raced two wide into the turn, was
coaxed three wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong grounds, just missed for second at the finish and just held for third. MEDAL ICE broke
alertly and showed early speed, pressed RANCHO RED into the turn, lost ground to that rival heading to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch,
weakened in the final sixteenth and was just edged at the finish for the minor awards. RANCHO RED sent in the early running, set a pressured pace into the
turn, shook free midway through the bend, kept to task to the furlong grounds, was overtaken by CARSON'S LEGACY nearing the sixteenth-marker and
gave way in deep stretch.

INCREDIBLE SHOT forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace while three wide through the backstretch run, advanced three deep
approaching the quarter marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch, took command inside of the furlong pole, showed a good late kick and drew clear in the
final stages. LORD OF LIGHT settled off of the moderate early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run while saving ground, maintained that rail
trip through the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, split rivals at the sixteenth-marker, was outkicked by the winner in the late
stages and ran on in deep stretch to win the nod for second. NORTHERN JEWEL allowed to settle, maintained his position through the backstretch run,
raced three wide to the quarter marker, offered a mild rally in the drive and just missed for second, while getting up in time to secure third. DE LA LUNA
settled off of the early pace, was never far back through the backstretch run, raced two wide between runners into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
lacked a late rally and missed for the minor awards. CUT ACROSS SHORTY prominent in the early running, attended to the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter at the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch while between runners and gave way in the final
stages. CALI CONQUEST bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker
and did not threaten. JERRY JEFF WALKER assumed command in the early running, set moderate fractions while well rated into the backstretch run, was
confronted nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole and faded in deep stretch.

confronted in upper stretch, battled for the lead to the furlong grounds, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in the final stages and just held for third

Footnotes
CAROLE LOMBARD unhurried in the early running, settled off of the fast pace through the backstretch run, improved position three wide on the far turn,
swung four wide into the drive, ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed with a rush in deep stretch, came within aim of PROOF SHE ZIPS in the final strides
and won the nod on the wire to prevail. PROOF SHE ZIPS prominent in the early stages, contested the fast early pace with ROUSING JEWEL, disputed
fast fractions into the far turn, took back off of that foe and stalked to the quarter marker, overtook ROUSING JEWEL nearing the furlong marker, kept to
task and drew to a clear lead at the sixteenth-marker, felt pressure from CAROLE LOMBARD in deep stretch, could not hold that one off in the final strides
and was gamely bested, while well clear of the rest. SELL THE DREAM allowed to settle, was floated out a bit entering the first turn, maintained position
through the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the second turn, raced three wide into the stretch, offered a mild rally in the drive, was not able to impact
the top two in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. ROUSING JEWEL broke alertly, contested the early pace with PROOF SHE ZIPS and carved
out fast fractions through the backstretch run, shook free heading into the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased in pursuit to the furlong marker
and gave way in the final stages. LIKE NO OTHER chased the fast early pace, raced closest to the dueling pacesetters through the backstretch run, saved
ground into the far turn, remained within aim to the furlong pole and tired. GET MY POINT settled while not far back in the early running, maintained position
in the second flight through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn, lost contact in upper stretch, was eased through the lane, walked off
under her own power and was reported to have bled when pulled up.

Footnotes
LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH hustled leaving the break, contested the early pace with STRETCH RUN then drew to a clear lead into the turn, set quick fractions
to the quarter marker, kicked clear into the drive, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch, was fully extended in the final strides and lasted for the
win over the oncoming runner-up. STRETCH RUN showed early speed and disputed the pace with LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH, took back and tracked that foe
through fast fractions into the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, lost ground to LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH heading to mid-stretch, rallied in deep
stretch, came within aim of the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. EL CHARRO
CHAMP settled off of the quick early pace, improved position three wide on the turn, was outrun to mid-stretch, offered a mild late rally and passed tiring
rivals to secure third. PHANTOM DROP chased the fast early pace, improved position three wide on the turn, lost ground in the drive and gave way. AWE
chased from the inside and lacked a response in the stretch. EMERALD MAGIC chased the fast early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE crowded a bit at the start by UNDISTURBED and was off a step slowly, was a bit keen in the early running while just off of the pace
into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, maintained position while three wide into the far turn, was roused four wide into
the drive, loomed at mid-stretch, confronted REV REE at the sixteenth-marker, battled with that game rival to the finish and determinedly won the nod on the
wire to prevail. REV REE settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, saved ground through the backstretch run and into the second turn, was
roused at the top of the lane, rallied along the rail and loomed at mid-stretch, took command into the final furlong, met the bid of TROJAN CLUBHOUSE at
the sixteenth-marker, battled gamely with that foe to the wire and was gamely bested, while holding for second. ALOHA KITTEN stalked the decent early
pace, maintained her position through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, came in tight approaching the top of the lane, angled three wide
into the stretch, waited behind runners to the furlong marker, shifted out inside of the furlong pole, closed well in deep stretch, came within aim of the top two
inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the win and placed, while holding safely for third. UNDISTURBED broke in at the start, crowded TROJAN
CLUBHOUSE and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, settled at the rear through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn,
was steered four wide for the drive, gained ground at mid-stretch and was gaining in the final stages. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) allowed to settle, maintained
a two wide path through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the second turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong
marker, could not sustain that bid in the late stages and finished evenly. MADEIRA WINE a bit keen in the early running while close to the pace, assumed
command into the backstretch run and set decent fractions while prompted into the far turn, was overtaken by REV REE in upper stretch, chased that one to
the furlong marker and gave way. LA REINE'S LEGACY lunged at the start, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, raced three wide while
outside of rivals into the backstretch run, pressed the decent pace to the half-mile marker, dueled with MADEIRA WINE to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit of
REV REE to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WORTHY OF MAGIC broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, set the pace into
the first turn, dropped back nearing the six-furlong marker, was pulled up into the backstretch run and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
STARSHIP CHEWBACCA engaged with HANDR'SDREAM soon after the start, dueled for pace duties with that rival into the turn, continued to battle on the
front end while setting fast fractions to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, kept to task under steady
urging to deep stretch and remained clear to the wire. WOUND UP chased the fast early pace, improved position on the turn while saving ground, lacked
the needed response in the stretch, was not able to impact the winner inside of the furlong marker and just held for second at the finish. BLAZE OF
DREAMS unhurried in the early running, improved position on the turn while three wide, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, closed well in the late stages, just
missed for second at the finish and was well clear of the rest for third. HANDR'SDREAM broke alertly, engaged with STARSHIP CHEWBACCA soon after
the break and dueled with that foe into the turn, continued to battle to the quarter marker while setting fast fractions, lost position heading to the furlong pole
and weakened in the drive. COUNT ASHER chased the fast early pace, improved position two wide on the turn, was outrun approaching the furlong marker
and gave way in the late stages. MASHHAD FLATS chased the dueling pacesetters in the early running, saved ground into the turn, dropped back nearing
the quarter marker and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HACKING IT UP was well placed in the early running, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, made up a bit of ground while two wide along the
far turn, angled four wide and was roused heading into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong pole, closed determinedly in the final stages, came within
aim of CLOVISCONNECTION inside of the sixteenth-marker, wore down that foe in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail.
CLOVISCONNECTION was a bit keen in the early running while close to the pace, stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch run from a three wide path,
advanced to press PLEASE FOCUS to the half-mile marker, kept close attendance to that rival to the quarter pole, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, took
command into the final furlong, kept to task to deep stretch, was all out in the late stages to hold off HACKING IT UP, was tagged in the final strides for the
win and held safely for second. COUSIN RICHIE was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far
turn, lost ground heading to the furlong marker, found his best stride late, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was up in time to secure third.
HAPPY DOES unhurried, was content to trail through the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn, advanced at mid-stretch, shifted three wide
inside of the furlong marker, closed willingly in the late stages and just missed for third. PLEASE FOCUS broke alertly, showed good early speed and
dictated terms in the early running, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run and into the second turn, battled for the lead with
CLOVISCONNECTION to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final stages and weakened. RODRIGOKNOWS was forwardly placed in the early running,
stalked the decent pace from a ground saving path through the backstretch run, maintained that rail position through the far turn, advanced in upper stretch,
lacked the needed late response and was outkicked in deep stretch. CHARBONNEAU was prominent in the early running, lugged out entering the first turn,
recovered and stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide between runners on the second turn, ran evenly to the furlong
grounds and tired in the final stages. BOB'S BLUE MOON settled in the second flight early on, lost ground along the backstretch run, improved position two
wide along the far turn, was outrun to mid-stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but could not muster the needed late response. MOTHER'S PRAYER was
allowed to settle, raced three wide along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, came three wide between runners into the second
turn, advanced at the quarter pole, was steered five wide for the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. TRINIDAD took back in
the early running, raced four wide into the backstretch run, improved position at the half-mile marker, raced outside of rivals while gaining ground on the
second turn, swung six wide into the stretch run, dropped back approaching the furlong pole and came up empty in the late stages.

Footnotes
GABBY HAYES broke a little awkwardly then became rank and hard to place in the early going, angled over to the rail, was in tight going into the turn then
came into the stretch behind horses, found a hole in mid-stretch and rallied to get up just in time. THUNDER OF ZION sat off the flank of HOLIDAY
HUSTLE down the backstretch, moved up to engage passing the three furlong pole, dueled, then got the better of that foe near the furlong marker, opened
up a clear lead but was tagged at the wire. FAR WEST broke well and raced up close to the early pace, was put into a drive with three furlongs to run,
tipped out four wide into the stretch, ran on well but came up a bit short. SIPPIN N KISSIN settled well off the early pace four wide down the backstretch,
managed to get over to the two path through the turn but became blocked behind a wall of horses turning for home, idled while awaiting room, got clear just
before the sixteenths pole and made up ground late. IDIOT'S GOLD spotted the field a head start after the break, rushed up to get into contention before the
turn, started a bid from the five-sixteenths pole and loomed a threat a the top of the stretch then weakened and was outfinished with a furlong to run.
HOLIDAY HUSTLE broke in a tangle then quickly gained the early lead, set a pressured pace to the three furlong marker then was joined by THUNDER OF
ZION, dueled that one to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ROCKTILLYOUDROP came away well then settled at the back of the pack, was
content to trail down the backstretch, lost contact with the field heading into the turn then attempted a rally three furlongs out, swung four wide into the
stretch, came on late but did not threaten in the final stages.
