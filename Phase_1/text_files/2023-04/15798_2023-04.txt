Footnotes
MONBEG STREAM (IRE) tracked the leader through the first half of the chase, top pair went clear of the group heading towards the barn, always near the
front, sent to the drive after the final jump, went clear of rival through the wire. RENEGADE RIVER took the lead across the road, always on or near the
front, stayed with rival through the final two fences, conceded stubbornly in the final furlong. SHOOTIST raced in the middle of the pack, could never sustain
a bid to catch top pair, clear for the show under the line. WITHOUTMOREADO (IRE) raced off the pace through out, one paced , could not close gap
through the final jumps. ROYAL RUSE raced off the pace, had no late kick, through the stretch. MASTER SEVILLE slow into stride, never factored through
the final furlong. OUR FRIEND (IRE) fell soon after the start.

GREAT ROAD sent forward after the start, stayed well clear of rival through the middle stages of the race, came under pressure through the final hill, held
on late under a heavy drive. BLACKHALL (IRE) tracked off the early leader, traveled well through the middle stages of the race, surged into contention
nearing the final jump, could not reel in leader, finished well clear for the place. ROCKET STAR RED raced off the pace early on, could not quicken with top
pair through the final jumps, evenly under the wire. HILL TIE set the pace across the road, unable to keep up the tempo through the middle stages, faded
through the lane.

CHOSEN MATE (IRE) sent to the front, controlled the tempo through out the contest, when asked to quicken kicked clear under a steady drive. FLETCHED
found good position through out the chase, handled the jumps while racing off the solo leader, took a run entering the stretch, could not catch that rival,
clearly second best today. RAKHAA (GB) raced middle pack through the first part of the race, inched up in contention headed to the barn, could not sustain
bid, finished evenly through the wire. HUYANA slow into stride, never a threat to the leaders. IT'S NOTHING pulled up.
