Footnotes
BENEDICT CANYON broke out, unhurried early on and moved inward, closed in around the turn on the inside under patient handling, exited the bend two
wide, rallied between in upper stretch and drove clear. PROCRASTINATION stalked the top pair up the backstretch, loomed three wide into the stretch,
launched a bid four deep in upper stretch but got outkicked by BENEDICTA CANYON in the late stages. DENIM IN GOLD stumbled badly leaving the gate,
jumped onto the dirt crossing, raced outside a rival into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and was along for the show. POWER SURGE broke a step
slow then was sent to press the pace from inside, dueled around the turn along the rail, fought to the eighth pole and weakened. LIV AND LET LIV set the
pace outside POWER SURGE up the backstretch, dueled with that rival around the bend, fought to upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BLURSDAY bumped leaving the gate, sped clear from outside, crossed over and showed the way along the rail through the turn, put to left-handed urging in
the drive, switched to the right-hand late and held gamely. SMILING AMY got brushed leaving the gate, raced up close inside the leader early, altered
outside that rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, took aim two wide through the turn, finished gamely while drifting out a bit in the lane but had to settle for
second best. SHAMBALA GIRL broke very slow and inward, lagged behind early, swung out and bumped rival entering the stretch and gained the show.
SHEZA LUCKY CHARM came in and bumped rival early on the backstretch, chased along the rail through the turn, moved out in the lane and lacked a bid.
MISS JO'S CANDY broke a step slow, raced off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, got bumped four wide into the stretch and could not rally.
DON'S DAYNA got bumped from outside early, idled for a bit at the half-mile pole to let rival pass, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. OAK
CREEK GAL chased off the rail then lose her path behind SMILING AMY early, moved back into range and traveled two to three wide on the turn but came
up empty in the drive.

TOO MUCH HEAVEN took control from inside, set the pace with VANDALIA to the outside, cleared around the turn, put to right-handed urging in the lane
and stayed clear to the wire. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) stalked the top pair from inside, saved ground to the stretch, chased the winner through the lane from
the fence and could not threaten in the final sixteenth. FLAT OUT JOY was unhurried at the back and steered inward, saved ground around the bend under
coaxing, tipped out at the top of the lane and rallied to nail VANDALIA for the show honors. VANDALIA pressed the pace from outside early, lost touch with
the winner and chased two wide to the lane, churned on down the stretch and got nailed for third. CODE RIBBON tracked off the rail, rounded the bend

Footnotes
SIX FEET took control from the inside, challenged into the turn, shook free with a quarter mile remaining, drew away into the final furlong and remained
comfortably in front to the wire. GHOSTLY ACT sat off the pace and moved into the three path, angled to the rail around the bend, steered back out in the
lane and summoned a mild rally to best the rest. TIZZ A GOOD THING bumped with inner rival at the start, was closest in pursuit early, bid from outside at
the seven-sixteenths pole, failed to keep up nearing the quarter pole, kept on through the lane and saved the show. SHIP AND SCAM bobbled then got
bumped on both sides leaving the gate, raced near the inside then two wide on the turn off the pace, kept on trying through the lane while altering out late
and rounded out the superfecta. BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK broke well then stumbled shortly after the start, stalked three deep into the turn, asked three wide
leaving the bend but flattened out in the furlong grounds. UNCLE JOHN was off slow to begin, raced a bit greenly up the backstretch, trailed on the inside
through the turn, angled out in the lane and improved position. PARS AND BIRDIES was hard to load, broke out and bumped rival, raced off the pace along
the rail into the turn then two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. WE NEED MARKETING stalked four deep into the turn, lost ground five wide on the
turn and weakened. GOLD EXPRESS bobbled then got sandwiched at the start, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor.

the eight pole and dug in late to gamely prevail. MIGHTY MATT raced up close four then three deep, vied outside inner pair through the turn, bumped with
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL at the eight pole, battled through the final furlong and missed. AFTERNOON HEAT raced up close three deep between rivals early,
dropped back a bit to chase into the turn, went two then three wide around the bend, drifted out through the lane and gained the show. VICENTE'S
SHADOW was hard to load, hit the gate and came away slow, made progress from outside up the backstretch, took aim three then four wide into the
stretch, drifted out through the lane and got outkicked for the show honors. MR. CLUTCH broke a step slow, stalked off the rail, steadied briefly at the
half-mile pole, chased a bit off the rail through the turn and finished evenly late. BOX OF CHOCOLATES threw his head and broke very slow, trailed on the
inside into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. CATBERNAY broke a step slow, set the pace early inside rivals, held

Footnotes
CLOSING REMARKS took a bump from outside at the start, settled off the pace near the inside, was on the move two wide then took aim three wide into
the stretch, bid four deep in upper stretch, gained command while starting to drift in at the eighth pole and drew clear. SCHOOL DANCE stalked the pace
from inside, moved closer around the far turn but had nowhere to go when boxed in behind the leader at the quarter pole, had to idle then tip out into the
stretch, tried to rally between foes approaching the eight pole but lost the opening and had to alter out, finished well through the late stages and edged
VERY SCARY for second. VERY SCARY stalked in the two path, bid outside the leader with a quarter mile remaining, took over and held a short lead into
the stretch, lost command with a furlong remaining and got outfinished for the place honors. HONEY JAR bobbled to the front at the start then sprinted clear
while moving inside, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured on the far turn and relinquished the lead exiting the bend, fought to the eighth pole then
flattened to fourth. NADETTE (FR) bumped inner rival at the start, reserved early and moved inside, tipped three wide late on the far turn and lacked a rally.
SEISAI (IRE) was off slow from outside, trailed on the inside into the first turn, went outside a rival on the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane and failed
to menace.

Footnotes
BATUKHAN (IRE) bumped with outer rival at the start, chased two wide early, moved out on the backstretch, coaxed into the far turn, ranged up and took
over four wide leaving the second bend, cleared in upper stretch, drifted inward and held over the runner-up. DONTTESTYOURLUCK stalked the lone
leader outside a rival, launched a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, fought three wide into the lane, stayed on inside the leader through the final furlong and
finished a game second. TAKE CHARGE CURLY stalked the pace from inside then moved off the rail, moved back inside to chase around the far turn,
steered out in the lane and finished willingly outside the top pair. SHADY STAR was off slow to begin from outside, chased four wide near the back early,
remained wide through the far turn, lugged out in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. STORMING CHROME sprinted clear and crossed to the
inside, rated up the backstretch, pressured midway around the far turn, lost command entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CHAOKOON
was off a bit slow and crowded some at the start, trailed two wide on the first turn, passed a weakening rival in the middle stages, went two to three wide on
the far turn and was not a factor. AGAPETOS stumbled badly and bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace throughout and failed to menace. TIM'S
TRIBUTE broke a step slow, raced three wide off the pace in the early going, dropped back to last on the backstretch, eased on the far turn and down the
lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GLENALL (IRE) had to idle when crowded a bit at the start then started to pull early, settled four then three wide early, went three wide into the far turn,
spun five wide into the stretch, rallied widest through the lane, drew alongside AN AGENT MISTAKE in the final sixteenth and got up. AN AGENT MISTAKE
bobbled leaving the gate, raced three wide early, settled outside a rival in mid-pack, closed in three wide on the far turn, took over in midstretch and got
overtaken by the winner in the closing moments. WEEMISSGRAMMY broke out and bumped rival, stalked in the two path early, remained two wide on the
far turn, could not advance in traffic from upper to mid-stretch, gained a clear path with a sixteenth to go and finished gamely for third. GOOD BOO JOO
away quickly in the beginning then ceded command and took a stalking position on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room in traffic briefly in
upper stretch, then gained a clear path and finished willingly but was outkicked in deep stretch. SLAM DIEGO got pinballed leaving the gate, raced two wide
near the back early, raced outside a rival on the far turn, lacked room from upper to stretch to the sixteenth pole, then found a clear path and kept on to
improve. GHOSTEM veered in and bumped rival at the start then began to pull, settled in mid-pack on the inside, saved ground to the lane, lacked room
from upper to midstretch, tipped out and finished well in the final sixteenth. REAL FIRE dueled three wide into the first turn then took a stalking position from
outside, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, lost command midstretch and faltered late. KATERINI bumped twice leaving
the gate, tucked inside early near the back, went between rivals at the three-eighths pole, angled four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
PEPPERMINT FLIRT trailed two wide into the first turn, spun three wide into the stretch, angled out and failed to menace. BYE BYE BUGGSY was off a bit
slow and veered in at the start, went up to duel from inside into the first turn then cleared outer rival, roused when challenged at the quarter pole, lost
command in upper stretch and faded. SPANNING THE GLOBE got bumped and forced in leaving the gate, raced on the inside at the back, ridden along
through the far turn, angled out in the stretch and failed to get involved.
