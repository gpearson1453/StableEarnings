Footnotes
KING'S OVATION broke a step slow, rushed forward to stalk from the three path while traveling well in the bit around the first turn, offered a bid entering the
far turn along with a rail-skimming FIELDSTONE, sparred with that one turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and edged away.
FIELDSTONE tracked two wide and between horses around the first turn, moved forward to gain an inside stalking position approaching the final five
furlongs, offered a bid through a vacated rail entering the far turn, dueled with an outer bidding KING'S OVATION turning for home, but was bested by that
one in the final furlong. JOB SECURITY laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the first turn, then chased the leaders around the far turn, and
ran on to secure show. HE'S GOT THIS broke slowly, raced at the rear in the three path, improved between horses down the backstretch, chased two wide
and among foes while creeping closer around the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid and flattened out. ROGUE ELEMENT tracked along the inside, but
failed to sustain that position entering the backstretch, raced further off of the pace while swinging from the two path to the five path turning for home, and
failed to factor. DROP ANCHOR cleared off while tucking to the two path around the first turn, but met bids from rivals on both sides entering the far turn,
and weakened with five sixteenths to go. MR. PETERKIN was outrun in the four path.

HONORIFIQUE tracked four wide, spun into the lane in the five path, ranged to the leaders in midstretch, struck the front at the furlong grounds, and drove
clear. CENTER STAGE tracked while tucking to the two path entering the turn, crept closer behind the leading trio turning for home, split foes two wide at
the three sixteenths to offer a bid along with an outer foe in midstretch, but was outkicked leaving the furlong grounds, and held place. KLIMT'S MUSE was
urged along while off of the pace in the three path around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and ran on to gain show approaching the wire.

Footnotes
OLLIEMYBOY laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order down the backstretch, loomed a danger behind the top pair around the far turn, shifted
three wide entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge between horses while hanging on his left lead to bid at the sixteenth pole, and inched an
advantage late. BEAR OAK stalked the top pair from the four path, came under urging to sustain a chase around the far turn, floated four wide entering the
lane, and ran on outside of rivals to gain place at the wire. BACKGROUND set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a bit off of the rail, rode the fence
while sparring with that foe around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in the final
sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire for place. ORDER AND LAW prompted the pace two wide, dueled around the far turn, sustained the long battle while
not able to gain an advantage through the lane, then got outkicked for minor placings late. MOBSTER GUN laid off of the pace three wide path, was roused
in the five path around the far turn, and faded. UNINVITED GUEST tracked in the two path, retreated to last at the five sixteenths pole, and was outrun from
there.

FOR THE FLAG set the pace in the two path, led from a pair of outer pressers around the far turn before an inner rival attempted to slip through turning for
home, shifted down to deter that rival entering the lane, shook clear in upper stretch, and held off an outer challenge late. LILAC GIRL tracked in the four to
five paths around the first turn, steadied when an outer rival cut down at the half mile pole, pursued from between horses around the far turn, tipped to the
six path entering the lane, rallied to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, but was fended off. TEQUILERA laid off of the pace in the five to six paths around the
first turn, tracked in the five path around the far turn, rallied to bid for place between horses at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival for
that position at the sixteenth pole. FAST AND FLIRTY stalked along the inside, bid for the lead in the three path and between horses entering the far turn,
vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and chased thereafter. PIONEER'S EDGE raced at the rear while hung in the
five to six paths around the first turn, gained ground in the six path around the far turn, but leveled off in upper stretch before flattening out. LAKOTA SPIRIT
settled far back along the inside, took closer order in the latter half of the backstretch, gained a two wide tracking position entering the far turn, but lacked a
kick along the rail in upper stretch. QUIERO MAS got rank and steadied behind rivals while far back in the four to five paths around the first turn, continued
to tug in the bit down the backstretch, retreated to trail in the four path entering the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, and moved up. BREAKER OF
CHAINS laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, crept a bit closer down the backstretch, but yielded around the far turn, then surpassed
tired rivals in the final furlong. FRENCH CUFFS stalked while shifting ground from the two to four paths around the first turn, got floated to the six path by a
head-strong inner rival entering the backstretch, tucked down approaching the far turn, chased three wide and between horses around that bend, then gave
way entering the lane. DO YOU LOVE ME raced forward in the three path, was taken in hand while keyed up entering the turn, pressed around the first
bend, was guided outwardly entering the backstretch in hopes of settling, but continued to fight the rider thereafter, prompted in the four path around the far
turn, and caved between horses in upper stretch. MINT EDITION tucked at the rear to the three path entering the first turn, but steadied along while rank
around the opening bend, checked hard entering the backstretch, steadied again while hard to handle at the five furlong pole, checked while altering around
an outer rival at the half mile pole, saved ground around the far turn, then remained blocked through the lane, and faded. PRESENT MOMENT (IRE)
bobbled slightly a few stride out of the gates, steadied while rank passing the wire for the first time, had the rider take a firm hold while remaining keyed up
around the first bend, tugged forward to a stalking position entering the far turn, attempted to slip inside of the leader to offer a bid turning for home, but was
sawed off by that foe entering the lane, and stopped.

Footnotes
LITTLE DIXIE chased two wide and between horses, got floated to the four path turning for home, sustained a grinding charge along with an inner rival to
produce a bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. SAVE YOUR TEARS chased along the inside, shifted to the three path turning for home, sustained a
slow gain along with an outer rival through midstretch, closed in on the weakening leader with that one to bid at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked in the
process before gaining place. TESHIMA took contact from an inner rival at the start, laid close up along the inside, dueled with an outer rival approaching
the turn, wrestled an advantage while put to coaxing nearing the three furlong pole, shook away under an all-out drive turning for home, built a wide margin
in upper stretch, but weakened in the final furlong, and was worn down by a pair of bidders passing the sixteenth pole. PADDY GAL stumbled and bumped
an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on. MELINOE sparred with an inner rival
for the lead approaching the turn, was driven while getting headed entering the bend, gave way turning for home, and weakened. MIDNIGHT FAVORITE
tracked three wide, but steadily faded in the four path into and around the turn. SPEIGHTSY HOT never got involved. STRONG PROFILE was outrun three
to two wide.

LIMITED LIABILITY settled off of the pace in the three to two paths around the first turn, gained ground in the four path around the far turn, but lost all of his
progress by spinning into the lane in the six path, regained stride to re-rally outside of rivals through the final furlong, produced a bid in the final sixteenth,
and forged an advantage at the wire. BAKWENA prompted the pace three wide, pressed down the backstretch, tucked to the two path to vie around the far
turn, gained an advantage in upper stretch, inched clear approaching the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, changed over entering the final
sixteenth before being confronted by a pair of outer bidders, and got nailed on the wire while holding place. ALEX JOON prompted between the leaders
early on, backed off to track entering the first turn, took that bend in the two to three paths, stalked around the far turn, spun into the lane in the four to five
paths, sustained a grinding chase while keeping inner rivals hemmed in behind the leader, offered a mild bid entering the final sixteenth as an outer rival
loomed large, then got outkicked and was denied place. BUY ME CANDY tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, came into
the lane in the three to four paths whilst between horses, chased while searching for racing room behind the leader, shifted inwardly in hopes of aiming
inside of that one nearing the final sixteenth, but brushed and put an inner ENCOURAGE to tight quarters in the process, and lacked a bid thereafter.
HIGHESTDISTINCTION set the pace along the inside, got headed in upper stretch, and gave way. ENCOURAGE stalked along the inside, pursued from
the pocket around the far turn, shifted off of the fence while brushing an outer rival entering the lane, remained hemmed in behind the leader while chasing
between horses in midstretch, then steadied when put to tight quarters entering the final sixteenth. READY FOR THE LADY was outrun throughout. THE
RIDER OF ENCOURAGE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BUY ME CANDY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING
THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT, BUY ME CANDY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SIXTH.

TUMBARUMBA pressed in the four to three paths and between horses into the turn, bid turning for home, spun into the lane in the four path, drove past
inner rivals while dueling with his outer counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, was herded inwardly entering the final furlong, took a pair of bumps while
pushed to the innermost lane entering the final sixteenth, yet gamely prevailed. SCOTLAND stalked in the five path early on, pressed the top pair from the
four path around the turn, ranged up turning for home, entered the lane in the six path, sparred with an inner rival entering the final furlong, gradually shifted
inwardly to float that foe in soon after, bumped that foe twice passing the sixteenth pole, and narrowly missed in the spine-tingling battle. B MINOR laid off of
the pace, took the turn two wide, gained show from an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and chased the embattled leaders home. KING'S GLORY broke
inwardly, set the pace in the two path, led from a pair of pressers while taking the turn in the two path, but proved no match for those at the three sixteenths
pole, and weakened. SPURS UP broke inwardly before being hustled for position, chased along the inside into the turn, but weakened nearing the five
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
AFTER EIGHT set the pace in the two path while unpressured entering the backstretch, felt light tension from a pair of outer rivals around the turn while
remaining well in hand, then drew off once set down entering the lane, and was eased up in the final sixteenth to win with a safe margin. FREYDIS THE
RED (FR) tracked two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds, and held off an outer rival for that position while
slowly closing in on the clear leader. TIME TO RACE trailed along the inside, shifted out around the far turn, fanned eight wide entering the lane, rallied to
gain place approaching the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay from reaching place. BOLTORO settled off of the pace in the three path and between horses,
shifted out to the five path in midstretch, and moved up among foes. GOLDEN RUNNER rated off of the pace in the two path, saved ground around the far
turn , rallied two wide and between horses in upper stretch, tipped in at the furlong grounds in hopes of sustaining a bid for minor rewards, but flattened out.
ROSY TOMORROWS was hung in the four path while off of the pace, swung seven wide entering the lane, and only offered a mild kick. SUMMERTIME
ROSE pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, shifted five wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides nearing
midstretch, and lacked a bid. ASTRILA stalked along the inside, gained place while shifting off of the rail at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked for
that position at the furlong grounds, and faltered. MENDED WE STAND stalked in the four path, ranged up in the three path around the far turn, but quickly
failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and folded between horses at the furlong grounds. ROYAL BLOOD stalked in the three path and
between horses, but required urging to maintain forward position in the tow path around the far turn, failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and
caved through the final furlong. RED JAG tracked in midpack along the inside as the rider grabbed a hold around the first turn, then saved ground, but to no
avail. MISCHIEVOUS GAL pursued from midpack four wide, shifted six wide entering the lane, and tired on his left lead.
