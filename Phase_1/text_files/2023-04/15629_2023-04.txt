SHOW SLIDING HOME chased early, rallied at the quarter pole and gained a slight lead, battled through the stretch and prevailed late under left handed
urging. RONNI'S STORM sec the early pace, was hooked at the quarter pole, held grudgingly after a long battle and just missed. OFTEN ENOUGH was
never far back on the inside, rallied on the rail and finished willingly. BUCKEYE RUCKUS had good position early on the inside, angled out four wide in the
stretch and went evenly. JOES A ROCKIN had brief foot and was through early. ONE CRAZY RIDE was outrun. The rider of RONNI'S STROM claimed foul
against the rider of SHOW SLIDING HOME for alleged interference in the stretch. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

PHARIBE had good position early and lacked a late response. AUCTION FEVER raced wide early and was no menace. ADMONISH slow early, was outrun.
PEACH BELLINI raced mid pack and tired on the far turn.

ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS was away alertly and quickly made the lead, led throughout and prevailed late under left handed urging. DANZING CHICK had
good position on the inside, could not gain late on the rail, finished willingly and was second best. SMARTY PANTS had good position on the inside, needed
more late. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN was allowed to settle early, swung wide in the stretch and was no threat. ONTOTHENEXT tracked three wide and went
evenly. CAJUN HEIR was off a bit slow, angled out in the stretch and was no menace. WILL VIRGINIA DARE raced four wide and was outrun.
