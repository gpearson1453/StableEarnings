Footnotes
SQUARED SHADY set the pace along the inside, met the bid from HOTITUDE on the turn, battled down the stretch and won the bob on the line.
HOTITUDE was away quickly then took a stalking position to the outside of the pacesetter, drew alongside to apply pressure on the turn, drifted out
midstretch while dueling outside SQUARED SHADY and lost the bob at the wire. KLEEN KARMA bobbled leaving the gate, stalked three deep into the turn,
chased the top pair three wide into the stretch and held the show. BIG HOPES stalked from inside to the stretch and finished evenly in the furlong grounds.
VELLA sat off the pace, saved ground through the turn, moved off the rail in the lane and failed to menace. BOSS LADY was forwardly placed early outside
rival then tracked just out of range leaving the backstretch, took the turn two wide and lacked the needed response in the drive. LOV U MEAN IT was off
slow to begin, bobbled crossing onto the dirt, trailed two wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAGIC LIGHT stalked from inside early, tracked out of range into the far turn, saved ground into the lane, moved off the rail in upper stretch, then angled in
to launch a bid inside LUMINIFEROUS and drove past late. LUMINIFEROUS went up to duel two wide into the first turn under a hold then was rated behind
the leader in the two path, applied pressure still under a hold in the middle stages, challenged around the far turn and took over into the stretch, put away
inner rival in upper stretch, met the bid from MAGIC LIGHT in the late stages and yielded grudgingly. MARINAS TINA (IRE) broke a bit slow, settled in the
two path outside a rival, closed in around the far turn, took aim three deep in upper stretch, faltered in the final sixteenth but saved the show. ANKYRAH
settled inside, lacked room when running up behind a rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail and put showed a
mild response to miss the show honors. HAPPY HAPPY broke slow and outward at the start, raced two wide then along the inside near the back on the
clubhouse turn, went outside a rival on the second bend, moved out in the lane and kept trying but needed to find more late. CREATIVELY (IRE) bobbled
leaving the gate, dueled into the first turn then cleared around the bend, took pressure from outside up the backstretch, dueled on the far turn, lost the lead
into the stretch and weakened. SAREEHA (IRE) stumbled badly leaving the gate, trailed throughout, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

BLUE DOG pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader nearing the quarter pole, took over briefly late on the far turn before being passed by
YELLOW BRICK, chased that rival in upper stretch, shifted in to bother FLAT ON at the eighth pole, re-bid in tight quarters in the final sixteenth, bumped
with YELLOW BRICK and surged past. YELLOW BRICK stalked three deep early, bid outside the top pair at the quarter pole, took over exiting the bend,
cleared in upper stretch, drifted to the inside and was re-engaged by BLUE DOG in the final sixteenth, bumped with that rival and was overtaken and
steadied near the wire. PALAGIO trailed near the inside or two wide on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch, rallied four wide around the far turn,
flattened in the final furlong but held the show. FLAT ON set the pace from inside while pressured, was headed at the quarter pole, lost command leaving
the far turn, got forced in by BLUE DOG at the eight pole and weakened. TEXTHELEGEND stalked the pace along the inside, ridden along through the far
turn while continuing to save ground and weakened down the lane. SEVENTEEN BLACK stalked between rivals in-hand early, pushed on two wide around
the far turn, moved out in the stretch and weakened. EL PERFECTO chased three wide into the first turn then began to climb while shifting down to the rail,
chased along the inside into the far turn, dropped back while moving out five wide on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE stalked two wide then moved inside, saved ground through the final turn, tipped out into the stretch, drew alongside EXIT SOUL
past the eighth pole and dug in for the victory. DUVET DAY (IRE) stalked from inside then dropped back off the pace, remained along the rail to the stretch,
started to gain then had to alter outside the top pair with a sixteenth to go, surged three deep but was too late. EXIT SOUL controlled the pace from inside,
inched away around the clubhouse turn, held a diminished lead while still clear at the quarter pole, showed the way into the final furlong, received the
challenge from QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE shortly after crossing that marker, fought back from inside and yielded grudgingly. ZEYARAAT unhurried in the
early going while two then three wide, moved forward first time through the stretch and was closest in pursuit into the clubhouse turn, was on the move from
the two path through the final final turn but flattened out in the final furlong. SEISAI (IRE) tracked two wide outside a rival throughout, asked left-handed
down the stretch and failed to respond. SCARABEA tracked from inside early then moved out to the two path for the clubhouse turn, continued two wide to
the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MASTERING chased from inside then moved to the two path on the first turn, stalked the top pair to the far turn, launched a bid three deep into the lane,
took a short lead in upper stretch and held over ULTIMATE GAMBLE to the wire. ULTIMATE GAMBLE chased two wide early then got moved to the three
path early on the clubhouse turn, went up to duel from outside around that bend, fought to the far turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, lost command in
upper stretch, stayed on gamely inside MASTERING and battled to the wire. KATONAH chased three to four wide on the first turn, took aim three wide
around the far turn then bid four deep into the lane but flattened in the final furlong. ZIMBA WARRIOR unhurried from inside, saved ground to the stretch,
angled out in the lane and failed to threaten. GOT THUNDER showed speed outside a rival then cleared and crossed over nearing the first turn, was
challenged from outside around the bend and dueled along the inside, fought head to head into and around the far turn, lost touch into the stretch and gave
way. GHAZAALY broke well then took up at the start, dropped back and began to climb early, around the first turn and into the backstretch while pulling,
raced outside at the back into the second bend, trailed into the stretch and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
MACADAMIA (BRZ) reserved along the inside early, ridden along and gained ground while angling three wide at the quarter pole, closed in on the leader
and took over at the eighth pole, quickly cleared and held well over the runner-up. QUATTROELLE (IRE) stumbled badly leaving the gate, tucked inside at
the back, made progress while continued to save ground on the far turn, steered out in upper stretch and finished well but had to settle for second best.
VERY SCARY stalked the pacesetter from inside, took closer order into the far turn, tipped off the rail and took aim at the leader from the two path but could
not summon the needed response in the stretch run. CLOSING REMARKS unhurried in the begging while moving inside, steered out around the far turn
while moving closer and came four wide into the stretch, chased within striking distance entered the final furlong but finished evenly late. CANOODLING
went up to take control and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, offered little resistance when challenged in upper stretch and flattened
in the late stages. THUNDER RUN was off slow in the beginning, tracked outside a rival early on, dropped back two to three wide on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
MOOSE MITCHELL stalked from outside, flanked the leader into the turn, bid two wide around the bend, put a nose in front at the quarter pole, put away
inner rival entering the stretch, then drew off under a drive and was ridden out to the wire. SUPER CHIEF showed early speed dueling with MY MAN BAGS
then ceded command to that rival, remained close up and had to steady inside the leader past the seven-sixteenths pole, tipped off the rail and came three
wide into the stretch and gained the place. MY MAN BAGS stumbled leaving the gate, went up to duel outside SUPER CHIEF then cleared that rival,
pressured by MOOSE MITCHELL on the turn, lost command at the quarter pole, chased the winner along the rail into the stretch, flattened in the furlong
grounds and lost second. STAY IN THE GAME tracked two wide into the turn, raced a bid off the rail into the stretch and weakened. SMILE FOR GLORY
settled outside a rival, went three wide around the bend and lacked a rally. GOLF DRAMA threw his head and came away slow, trailed four wide around the
bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOOLISH broke a step slow then went up to be forwardly placed, stalked from inside into the turn, tipped out and challenged two wide into the stretch,
kicked clear from inner rival and opened up into the furlong grounds and was able to last in the closing moments. STRIKINGLY traveled in mid-pack two
wide into the turn, shifted out into the lane, rallied and drew alongside the winner late but was not enough. FREE AND HUMBLE sat off the pace along the
inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit and rallied between rivals in midstretch and got up for the show. SOCIALLY SMART stalked the
pacesetter from outside up the backstretch, traveled two to three wide around the turn, finished willingly through the drive and got edged for the show
honors. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE chased out of range early, went two to three wide around the bend, tipped out into the lane and kept on while outfinished for
the minor placings. JENSCO was off slow to begin, jumped the track crossing back onto the turn, went two wide into the turn, moved closer while angling
out and came four wide into the drive, lacked room from upper to midstretch and was coaxed along through the final sixteenth. JAI HO was reluctant to load
into the gate, bumped with inner rival at the start, hopped crossing surfaces, rounded the bend two wide, lacked room in the lane and could not threaten
once getting a clear path. LA PEER bumped in the beginning, bobbled crossing the dirt, saved ground from off the pace and could not rally. UNJOKABLE
was off a bit slow to start, tracked two wide into the turn, raced four deep briefly at the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and weakened. CARSON
JEN cleared early, set the pace from inside into and around the bend, was challenged entering the drive, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and gave
way. ROCKIN TO THE BOSS was off slow and dropped back, took a bad step at the nine-sixteenths pole, trailed off the rail through the turn and was never
involved.
