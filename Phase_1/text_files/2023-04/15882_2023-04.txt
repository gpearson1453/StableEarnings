Footnotes
MISS STONES was recalcitrant behind the gate, broke in but was away fast, moved in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, was
asked for more while three then two wide on the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, drew off under a solid hand-ride into the final furlong and
proved much the best with her ears pricked under light coaxing to the finish. JESSICA'S RIDE bumped soundly with a foe while off a step slow, dropped
back while climbing then was taken up some, raced at the rear under urging, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch
then moved further out and finished willingly to get up for the place. SHORT SHIFT was off slow and spotted the front two a few lengths, raced at the rear
under urging, hugged the rail around the turn, drafted behind foes late on that bend, got through along the rail into the stretch then moved out at the
three-sixteenths and missed the place while clear for the show. PHOTON was away alertly, angled out early then chased the pace, went four then three
wide early on the turn, shifted five wide near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the crop and tired. BON ADIEU was restless in the gate,
broke a step slow then moved out early before being corrected, raced just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, was bumped nearing the
quarter-pole and capitulated. SHE'S A NINE bumped soundly with a rival at the start then was taken up a bit while off a bit slow, moved up on the outside
under urging then chased the pace, went five then four wide around the turn, lugged in late on that bend then bumped with a foe near the quarter-pole,
lugged in outside of a foe while not urged in the stretch and dropped out.

Footnotes
BALPOOL six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight
wide into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. DOWNTOWN MISCHIEF prompted the pace
of UNIFIED ALLIANCE from the outside five paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to take command three
furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, got headed straightened away and ran on to secure the place honors on the wire. CRYPTO
MAMA four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. UNIFIED ALLIANCE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide before tucking
along the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths when challenged and headed for command, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LADY MINE settled off the early pace, began to climb severely near the eleven-sixteenths, fell well back while climbing very badly and pretty much bucking
until around the half-mile pole, lost many lengths on most of the field, leveled out in the five then six path around the turn, swung nine wide into the stretch,
rallied outside under a left-handed crop into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. JOLLY MISS JILL chased the pace on the outside then
four wide on the turn, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch then kicked clear, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught
while clear for the place. QUICK POWER NAP was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide early on the turn then moved to the five path, came
eight wide into the stretch, gained on the inside of the winner coming to the sixteenth-pole but flattened out late while able to get the show. MOSTLY
HARMLESS was urged along off the pace, came out around a path near the nine-sixteenths, caused AUDIT COMMITTEE to clip her heels, went two to
three wide early on the turn then moved to the four path, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS was
urged along on the outside, went five wide around the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. JET SET JULIET contested
the pace on the outside of two opponents, vied in the three path on the turn and came up empty. FULIGNI was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on
the inside of a duo, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND disputed the pace between horses,
vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. PREDETERMINED was off slow then dropped well behind, moved from the
three path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point into the stretch and was no factor. AUDIT COMMITTEE left the gate under urging, was
taken up while shut-off near the nine-sixteenths then clipped heels and stumbled, dropped back quickly while trying to recover, went four wide around the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TWO THIRTY FIVE went to the front then was well rated while showing the way, controlled the action in the three path around the turn, responded well
when asked five wide into the stretch, drifted out while maintaining a advantage inside the three-sixteenths, continued to drift out outside the sixteenth-pole
then was given one final pop of a right-handed crop and proved best under a hand-ride from that point to the finish. HEALING was rated in a good position
just off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, was asked for more in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch under the crop,
chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to secure the place. GOLDINI settled on the outside, was urged along
passing the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn, bumped with a foe inside the three-eighths pole, was driven six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner
under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. JUMPSTER stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the four
path on the turn, bumped with a rival inside the three-eighths, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. STANDUP moved out early then raced just off
the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the
drive and tired. CORKMAN was last to commence, raced on the outside under urging, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and failed to
respond. AMERICAN LINCOLN was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, fell well behind after going three-sixteenths, went four to five wide
on the turn and was no factor.

mid-stretch before digging in to hold safe to the finish from a late closing rival. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to just latch on the winner as he hit the wire. KING JAMES five
then four wide in aim of the front, advanced on the leader and was set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear for

MO REWARDS bumped with a rival at the start, moved out while settling off the pace, commenced a rally while two to three wide early on the turn then
angled five wide at the three-eighths, rallied outside to get the lead in upper stretch, shook clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under good
handling. DEE'S SPEEDSTRE settled on the outside, was roused five then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch, fought with two foes
to near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. GINNSU WARRIOR bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, chased the leaders into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show.
LET FREEDOM SPRING went to the front, moved in outside the three-quarter pole, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two
path, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought to near the sixteenth-pole and tired. STAR ATTITUDE was well positioned down the backstretch, went
three wide under urging on the turn and came up empty. REUNION TOUR settled on the outside, was roused near the half-mile pole, went five to six wide
on the turn and was no factor. KONG LOVES A FIGHT was last away then dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch then
drifted out and showed little. ROMANOATSEE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back near the half-mile pole,
came up empty in the four path on the turn and retreated.
