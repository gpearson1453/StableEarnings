Footnotes
SCENIC VIEW bumped with an outer foe at the start, led in the two path around the first turn, allowed an outer foe to take over pace-making duties into the
backstretch, tipped out to the three path into the far turn, bid passing the quarter and retook the lead from the four path into the stretch, opened slightly
passing the eighth pole while gradually drifting out against right handed urging, and held on. TAKE THE PODIUM brushed with an inner foe from the four
path rounding the first turn, was wellback in the five path down the backside, under a drive in the four path early around the far turn, was in the six path
entering the stretch, and ran on for place. KESTENNA (GB) bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, tipped out to the five path while
ridden along into the lane, and finished evenly for show. SWEET ACTRESS got bumped between foes at the start, tracked in the three path, was cued
turning into the lane, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, but was no factor. POLITELY CROWNED travelled in the five path around the
first turn and moved up to set the pace in the four path down the backside, shifted inside into the far turn, but yielded in the stretch. CHESS NOT
CHECKERS bumped an outer foe from the two path early around the first turn, rated along the inside, shifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, but never
threatened. STRONG EMBRACE checked and was bumped between foes early around the first turn, and was always behind from the two to five paths.

Footnotes
THE PENINSULA was in tight soon after the start, raced off the early pace four wide, was bumped nearing the five-eighths pole, advanced between rivals
down the backstretch and four wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. I AM THE GAME led early, was hard
held inside just behind the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole and ran on to be clearly second best. STARSHIP WIZARD raced off the pace two
and three wide, shifted widest turning for home and bested the rest. GLOBES trailed in the three path around the first turn, moved widest down the
backstretch, took the lead three wide near the five-sixteenths pole but came up empty in the lane. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK prompted the pace three wide,
bumped with winner nearing the five-eighths marker, bid two wide between foes rounding the far turn but had little left for the drive. SLOW DECISION had
early speed inside, was quite rank rounding the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn and retreated through the lane. TI SENTO (IRE) set the pace
along the rail and gave way readily nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

BRYCE CANYON rated around the four path, advanced between foes under rousing early around the far turn, was under left handed urging while tipping
out to the six path into the stretch, rallied while tipping inwards into the final furlong and drew past a pair off inner foes in the final strides. RACE CRAFT
raced prominently in the four path, was put to a ride early around the far turn and bid in the five path at the top of the lane, ran on to sustain that bid into the
final furlong, was outfinished by the outer eventual winner, but wore down the pacesetter to get up for place. FLY THE W set the pace in the two path, was
roused into the far turn, challenged by an outer foe from the three path at the top of the stretch, dug in under left handed encouragement to hold on to the
lead into the final furlong, but was caught by a pair of outer foes late to show. BURNING MAN tracked in the three path, was under coaxing along the inside
rounding the far turn, but was empty in the stretch. ATTENTIVE was out in the six path rounding the first turn and moved up to prompt the pace into the
backstretch, but gaveway rounding the far turn.

OCTANE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. IRON WORKS chased the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and was
clearly second best. CANDY TYCOON tracked the pace two and three wide, angled further out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and was along for
the show. MISH broke in a tangle then was shuffled back, made a strong three wide middle move around the turn then tired in the lane. LAUGHING BOY
had speed three wide and faded after a half. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK was outrun outside. LOGICO played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SOVIET EXCESS raced prominently in the five path, was cued right handed and bid in the four path around the far turn, took the lead into the stretch, and
drew clear. TYPEY prompted the pace in the four path, was driven between foes while making a bid around the turn, was in the two path entering the lane,
and chased home the winner for place. KARA AND COLLEEN was brushed by an outer foe at the start, rated in the five path, was roused in the three path
into the far turn, under right handed urging while tipping out to the five path into the stretch, and was up for show. A J'S MEMORY chased in the six path,
was put to a ride in the four path around the far turn, swung back out to the six path into the lane, but evened out late. POET'S WOODS set the pace in the
two path, was under a nudge early around the far turn, lost the lead passing the quarter and steadied just after, and faded in the stretch. SILLY LILY broke
slow but was unhurried in the four path, was under urging inside turning into the lane, but was no factor. BOMBERELLA settled in range from the three path,
lost ground and was under coaxing going into the far turn, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and was one paced. MILLENNIUM PARK broke in
and bumped an inner foe, stalked in the four path but was tired entering the lane. STARSHIP SIGRUN got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the
start, raced off the pace in the six path but did not factor. WAND rated in the three path but never threatened. PARTY DREAM was wellback in the two path
and never menaced.

SMOKIN CLOUD raced in range four wide, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. MYSTIC LANCELOT stalked the pace in the three path, took
a narrow lead between rivals near the quarter pole, edged ahead leaving the eighth pole, brushed with JET WINGS nearing the sixteenth pole and led until
the final strides. JET WINGS set the pace in the two path, was collared near the quarter pole, fought on inside, was brushed by MYSTIC LANCELOT
nearing the sixteenth pole then came in and exchanged hard bumps with GRAND VALLEY soon after. GRAND VALLEY raced off the pace three wide, dove
to the rail in midstretch, bid inside of the pacesetter, was bumped hard and forced to take up near the sixteenth pole and was not urged from there.
BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH failed to menace while racing two wide. MOGALU was
outrun while racing three wide. SUTTON BREEZE played no factor while racing five wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND DISQUALIFIED JET WINGS FROM THIRD AND PLACED HIM FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH.

Footnotes
KHOSEA tracked in the six path, was roused from the five path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, rallied into the final furlong,
and was up on the wire to win. LA RUSIA stalked in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, back in the five path entering the stretch,
ran on and briefly led inside the final sixteenth, but was caught by an outer foe to place. DOMINEERING prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three
path around the far turn, took the lead and opened up while shifting inside into the lane, but was caught by a pair of outer foes to show. SHE NASTY rated in
the two path, was under urging from the rail rounding the far turn, tipped out to the three path into the lane, and finished evenly. DIVINE EXCHANGE was
fractious in the gate, raced off the pace in the five path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS rated
in the four path but never threatened. MORNING COLORS pulled while setting the pace around the three path into the backstretch, received a right handed
cue in the two path midway around the far turn, was steadied inside of foes while trying to drift out into the lane, and gaveway. CAPRIDREY hopped at the
start and trailed throughout around the two path.

Footnotes
THE BEST DISTANCE set a clear pace in the three path, was confidently handled from the two path as the lead lessened rounding the far turn, rebroke and
opened up from the three path into the lane, and was driven clear. MY BOY BLUE raced off the pace in the five path, circled inner foes around the far turn
and was in the six path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE chased in the six path, was driven from the four path into the lane,
and kept on for show. CUPID'S DUDE rated in the two path, waited for room in the four path rounding the far turn, was roused from the five path into the
stretch, shifted in to the three path passing the eighth pole, and stayed on. RESTORED ORDER tracked in the two path, shifted to the rail into the far turn,
received a right handed cue in upper stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND raced in midpack around the five path, was roused
from the three path into the far turn, but faded in the stretch. T VILLE was unhurried in the three path but never threatened from the six path in the stretch. J
P CORNETTA stalked in the four path but gaveway around the far turn. POWER (BRZ) checked from the rail into the first turn and always trailed.
