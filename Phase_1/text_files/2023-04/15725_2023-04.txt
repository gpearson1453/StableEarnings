Footnotes
R DOC showed the way early, relinquished the advantage into the first turn, tracked in the run up the backstretch inside, advanced and took over along the
rail far turn, drew off through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. TRIVISTA behind the pace inside and under stout restraint onto the
backstretch, continued to save ground behind the winner, followed that one along the rail into the stretch, no match, clear second. BOLDISH fell back to trail
after the start, continued devoid of speed while saving ground, steered out to be three wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to be clear of the others, no
threat to the top pair. SONO GRATO in mid pack while in the two path through the first turn, moved closer before a half, chased the winner midway on the
final turn, weakened in the drive. BRAVO BRAVO broke on top, worked way clear and toward the inside the opening quarter, allowed the winner the inside
second turn, began to weaken when headed by that one. BAYOU SARGE forwardly placed early outside, three wide second turn, tired. EGO last to leave,
remained back and never menaced while four wide into the stretch. RYE HUMOR mid pack, steered out, four wide far turn when asked along, stopped and
finished far back.

Footnotes
FABULOUS FANNY broke well, cleared soon after, set all the pace along the inside, increased advantage through the lane, ridden out. CHARTREUSE
forwardly placed along the inside behind the winner, proved no match for that one in the drive, clearly second best. BODI ODI off a step slow, lacked speed
angled out three wide turning for home, staged a modest rally out in the strip to be along for the show, no match for the top two. TIZ SWEET CANDY
chased the winner for over a half in the two path, weakened in the drive. LOVELY JOYCE went one paced while racing outside. KEEN CONTENDER fell
back to trail after the start, dropped to the inside early in the turn, continued to save ground into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. BEER CAN LADY hesitated at the break, continued to lag into the turn, floated out four wide into the stretch, failed to rally. THE X
FACTOR off a step slow, raced in mid pack just off the inside for four furlongs, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
PROMISING SHOES jostled soon after the start, raced back early as a result, began a steady advance just before a half, rallied through traffic to be up in
time. WILLOW CREEK ROAD jostled when in tight just after the break, quickly recovered to move up and duel in the two path, continued to alternate up the
backstretch, showed the way into the stretch, clear past the furlong marker, drifted out late, caught in the final strides. DINNER AT CRUMPIES in the
second flight inside, asked along in the second turn, rallied inside the winner into the lane, ran with that one to the wire to miss while closest to the inside of
the first flight at the wire. ONE TEN STADIUM lacked early foot three wide, continued back, angled out to be three wide entering the stretch, displayed some
belated interest while widest at the wire. BELLAMYS ROAN forwardly placed off the rail, chased the runner up in upper stretch, bothered slightly by that one
late when that same foe lugged out, finished up evenly between horses. BIG SUCCESS off a step slow, raced back, made little impact. ASPEN CLUB
dueled up front closest to the inside, first to blink late in the final turn, gave way through the lane. WESTOVER bumped at the break, was finished after a
half, trailed home well back.

Footnotes
KINGDOM broke on top, set the pace inside, shrugged off a foe turning for home, drew off under steady handling. SOYBEAN MAN settled off the early pace
while four wide, continued outside in the second flight, three path through the final bend, finished willingly to be cler for the place, not a threat to the winner
late. MANTA REY lacked speed, in some traffic early in the first turn, advanced four wide through the second bend, saw that progress stall a bit through the
lane but managed to gain the nod for the show. HARD SPUN FANTASY last away, trailed for over a half, came three wide for the drive, in some traffic,
briefly waited a sixteenth out, missed the show. TEJAS back off the pace along the inside early, continued to save ground and was covered up through the
second bend, in traffic with a furlong remaining, finished up evenly when clear. SHARP STICK chased the winner early from between rivals, fell back before
a half, lacked a closing kick. HUNTSVILLE forwardly placed early off the rail, closest to the winner the middle half while off the inside, had little left for the
stretch run. MAD HUSTLE remained always back. DARIO rank into the first turn outside, angled in when advancing, steadied first turn when rank, pulled
backstretch, stopped.

Footnotes
SIR WELLINGTON broke sharp, narrowly showed way inside, drove clear past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. TUT'S
REVENGE bobbled at the break, lacked speed in mid pack, angled out a bit in some traffic, tight into the lane, set down, finished up willingly to be getting to
the winner. FORE LEFT pressed the winner from the two path, had little left for the stretch run. NECKER ISLAND lacked speed outside, four wide into the
turn, fanned five wide for the drive, staged a mild rally to improve position a bit. SUMMER IN MALIBU fell back to trail after the start, lacked speed for a half,
came four wide for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. ATOKA forwardly placed inside under snug hold, continued to rate
into the turn, came up empty for the stretch drive, vanned off after race. CHATTALOT within striking striking distance while three to four wide late in the turn,
tired through the stretch. MOWINS last away, not involved.

Footnotes
LEGENDARY GIFT broke with leaders, closest to the first flight turn,slipped through along the inside into the lane, shook clear, kept to task. DISTORTED
SECRETS in mid pack while just off the inside, continued in the two path turn, rallied inside of several rivals to be clear for the place. JAMMINJL in the
second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, mild late energy to be up for the show. MY DAMS ATITUDE lacked speed outside, five to six
wide turning for home, improved position, not enough for the show late. HAVE I EVER bumped at the start, raced back, angled toward the inside turn, saved
ground into the stretch, encountered some traffic inside furlong marker, angled out then back in, improved a bit. HOUSE WRECKER broke alertly, pressed
the issue outside, three wide turn, weakened through the stretch. MELODY ROSE off a step slow, void of speed for a half, three wide through the turn, also
improved position without posing a serious threat. CHASING SHADOWS in mid pack and outside, four wide exiting the turn, railed to mount a rally as well.
ROYAL BONUS lacked speed, raced in the two out to three path through the turn, lacked a closing response also. EMERALD PRINCESS broke with the
leaders, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to show the way in the turn, gave way when headed by the winner when straightened for
home. KEWPIE DOLL remained always back in failing to menace. SHOW ME GRACE flashed brief speed between horsed, began to give way before a half.

Footnotes
SKELLY broke alertly, was clear before a quarter under light restraint, continued in hand turn while staying clear, unloosed stretch, remained clear to the
end under continued steady handling. STROBE in the second flight while outside, four wide through the turn, closer late in the bend, set down when
straightened for home, slowly getting to the winner late while holding sway for the place. TEJANO TWIST broke back, lacked speed, four wide into the lane
when under pressure, shifted out a bit further, continued to rally while closing the gap somewhat on the top two. SURVEILLANCE back off the early pace,
dropped to the inside while still well back turn, came off the inside a bit to improve upper stretch, flattened out in the late going to finish up evenly. PIRATE
RICK away in good order, raced closest to the winner while moving to the inside, continued to chase into the lane, had little left the final furlong. PAYNE a
bit washy, void of speed while three wide into and through the turn, improved a bit with some modest late interest, no real threat. COGBURN in the second
flight three wide, continued within striking distance through most of the turn, backed up through the lane. EDGE TO EDGE behind the pace, in some traffic
late in the turn, roused when clear for the drive, had little left for the final furlong. RADICAL RIGHT off a step slow, four wide through the turn when back, no
response late. CANDY MAN ROCKET in mid pack while racing three wide, gave way in the drive to trail home well back.

Footnotes
JOE FRAZIER broke alertly, allowed the leaders to go early, stalked into the turn, angled out three wide when moving to challenge into the lane, drove
strongly clear. ESPIONAGE broke in, bumped foe, dueled up front on the outside into the turn, dueled through the bend, offered brief resistance to the
winner turning for home, proved no match in the run to the wire, remained clear for the place. LOST IN LIMBO dueled up front along the .inside, weakened
gradually through the lane but managed to save the show. SHIP IT RED one paced while four wide, continued in the four path through the turn, continued
evenly through the lane. PAPA ROCKET broke back, raced unhurried for a half, tilted out four wide into the lane, improved through upper stretch then failed
to maintain that advance the final furlong to finish up evenly. JERRY'S EIGHTY in tight at the start, raced back, four wide out of the turn, bettered his
position a bit while not a serious threat late. SLAM DUNK SERMON lacked speed, four wide through the turn, also picked off a few rivals through the lane
while not a serious threat either. BIG NICK in mid pack while racing outside, four out to five wide turn, lacked a closing response. UPSTRIKER well off the
early pace while moving toward the inside, two path through the turn, had little left for the stretch drive. TIZHOTNDUSTY in the main body along the inside,
failed to respond as well when called on for the drive. CITY RAGE cut off just after the start, remained back. COSMO staged a steady retreat three wide.

Footnotes
CLAIRIERE encouraged just a bit after the start, settled in the two path first turn, asked along while saving ground through the second bend, set down with a
firm right handed crop nearing the furlong grounds, took dead aim on the leader and kicked down that rival under continued firm handling to be in time.
SECRET OATH broke loose on the reins, closest to the leader while within herself up the backstretch and into the far turn, began to reel that rival midway
on the bend, collared that same foe from the outside turning for home, quickly clear in upper stretch, could not contain the winner, no danger of losing the
place. HOT AND SULTRY broke very sharp, well clear immediately, set a soft early quarter, quickened into the far turn, offered but brief resistance to the
runner up late in the final turn, no match for the top two through the lane. I FEEL THE NEED last away, fell further back soon after, was never a factor in
trailing in a one paced effort.

MUSIC MISTRESS away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed into the lane, well clear, maintained. DELTA MOON
back off the pace and the inside, four out to five wide turn, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. ALOHA BABY mid pack while racing off the the
inside, three to four wide through the turn, advanced to be closest to the winner with a furlong remaining, could do little with that one late, caught for the
place. ICONIC BONNET headed up the second flight two off the rail up the backstretch, steadied in some traffic late n the turn between horses, went evenly
through the lane. NEXT THURSDAY bumped then clipped heels soon after the start, raced back, four to five wide into the lane, rallied to improve position.
COUNT IT ALL JOY bothered, bumped early, back, came four wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. CASHMERE BABY
behind the pace toward the inside, in traffic late in the turn and into the lane, steadied, went evenly through the stretch. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY bumped at
the start, raced back and failed to menace. ZONGS IRISH FROST prompted the issue for a half in the three path, had little left for the last time. MELANIA T
came in after the start, bothered a couple of inner rivals, remained always back. NGALA broke in good order, dueled inside, stopped after a half. PRINCESS
HADLEY bumped at the start, in mid pack early while along the inside, steady fade. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE EARLY
RUNNING, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
