Footnotes
FREUDIAN was hustled from the gate, settled under some urging, came under stronger encouragement late on the backstretch, gained in the four path to
make a bid with three furlongs to run, took the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole then was put to a left-handed
crop into upper stretch, drifted out while remaining clear in the final furlong, was put to a hand-ride near the sixteenth-pole, shied from the post parade tracks
about seventy yards from the wire and switched to her inside lead but was much the best. RAFFINITY moved out then tracked the pace, was urged along
passing the nine-sixteenths, gained in the three path to make a bid between foes at the three-eighths, dropped behind the winner coming to the quarter-pole
then was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued that foe while remaining on her inside lead and drifting out in the drive, swapped to the proper lead at the
sixteenth-pole and was second best. APRIL ANTICS was away awkwardly but with the field, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path under
urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted out while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response while best of
the rest. SHEA ON A MISSION broke a step slow, settled on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, was urged three then two wide around the turn
and failed to respond. SYNONYMOUS moved out while lacking early speed then was hard ridden on the outside, went five wide around the turn and came
up empty. RACING COLORS settled off the pace, dropped well back near the five-eighths, went three wide early on the turn then moved to the four path,
angled six wide around the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch, drifted out some in the drive and was no factor. RHUBARB MARTINI went to
the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path under threat early on the turn, lost the advantage outside the five-sixteenths and
stopped.

three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. THE GOLDEN ONE chased
five to six wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. MILAGROSO three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. STRATEGYFORYOU away last as rivals came his way at the
start, got coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch then got out a bit into the turn to be three wide at the seven-sixteenths,

Footnotes
SYSTEMIC CHANGE established a forward position early, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the
three path with three furlongs to run, dueled outside of the runner-up under a drive into upper stretch, brushed with that foe while engaged in a spirited
tussle outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted in some late and gamely prevailed on the wire. RESERVE CURRENCY angled in while going to the front, was well
rated while setting the pace in the two path, came under urging with three furlongs to run, was asked for more while dueling with the winner into upper
stretch, drifted out outside the furlong marker, continued to fight with the winner while brushing with that foe, battled gamely to the wire and was denied
while well clear for the place. CENTAVO was taken up off heels nearing the first turn, went four wide around that bend, settled on the outside, was given his
cue near the seven-sixteenths, chased in the four then five path around the far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and weakened but held the show.
COMPLETE AGENDA dropped to the rear early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the back, was urged three wide on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch then shifted further out and was no factor then was reported to have bled. AFJAN was urged from the gate then taken up off
heels early, raced in the two path under restraint around the opening bend, was rated off the pace, came under encouragement while shifting from the two
path to the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in and bothered a foe around the three-sixteenths, came in some more under a
right-handed crop in the final sixteenth and failed to respond. EXIT RIGHT was hustled from the gate, steadied off heels nearing the first turn, was rated just
off the pace on the inside under a snug hold, came under urging on the far turn, spun three to four wide into upper stretch, was forced in by a rival around
the three-sixteenths, raced hesitantly while put in a bit tight by that foe against the rail in the final sixteenth and was no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE,
THE RIDER OF EXIT RIGHT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST AFJAN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AFTER THE STEWARDS'

Footnotes
WARRIOR RICHARD was bumped at the start, established a good position just off the pace, was given his cue inside the three-eighths then made a bid
inside of the pacesetter, reached even terms for the lead into upper stretch, gained a short advantage approaching the eighth-pole, battled inside the
runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. VALENZAN DAY broke in and bumped with a foe then was hustled to the front, showed
the way down the backstretch, was challenged to his inside while in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, lost the
advantage near the eighth-pole, fought with the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the place. SUPER ROCKER had a shoe repaired in the
paddock, was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn and weakened but just held the show. OUTLAW
COUNTRY was urged along at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop then moved out and just missed the
show. HOT ROD LINCOLN was last to commence, settled off the pace, was roused late on the backstretch, dropped back in the three path around the turn,
floated five wide into the stretch and faltered. BAD WATER lost his footing at the start but broke with the field, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three
then four wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
SHERIFF BIANCO settled nicely off the pace, chased the leading duo in the four path around the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get
the lead outside the eighth-pole, fought outside the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. SECRET RULES showed speed then
pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage approaching the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to
the winner nearing the eighth-pole, fought on well in the final furlong but missed while clear for the place. NABOKOV broke a step slow then was taken up
off heels, raced at the rear under urging, went three wide under stronger encouragement around the turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick while willingly able to get the show. HAPPY FARM angled out then settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CHATEAU moved in while displaying good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the
two path around the turn, lost the lead nearing the five-sixteenths, fought under a drive into the final furlong and tired. GULFSTREAM WAY was urged along
on the inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. SURPRISE BOSS bumped with a rival at the start, chased the early pace, dropped back late on
the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, floated five wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
LITTLE LINZEE chased along the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader before tipping to the two path into the turn, advanced and took
over command at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in clear to the eighth pole drifting out two paths under a
left handed crop albeit safely in front, continued on now under growing threat drifting and came out two more paths being corrected by a right handed stick
and brushing LES BON TEMPS to the outside, had that rival switch sticks to his right hand and lean inwards, got turned out by the pressure of that rival
leaning on her hindquarters and came outwards through the final sixteenth more dramatically despite the rider attempting to correct while leaning on one
another and gamely holding to victory on the wire. LES BON TEMPS four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying and angling out as the aforementioned foe drifted two paths safely in front a furlong out, got brushed when
just latching on that rival twice inside the eighth pole, then had the rider switch sticks and leaned inwards turning out the hindquarters of the leader forcing
her to lean outwards through the final sixteenth and come out more drastically due to the leans while whittling away at her margin to the end, but ultimately
missed on the line. After receiving several kicks when her next door stall rival flipped in the gate prior to the start necessitating a scratch, MIDTOWN
LIGHTS chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot to secure the
show honors. DREAM ON CARA chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a bid at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into
upper stretch and weakened. CLOVER STREET coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into
upper stretch and tired. HYPNOCURRENCY chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no
impact. HONEST BANKER broke a bit awkward as the rider was against the mouth of his charge, showed the way in hand three wide down the backstretch
and into the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of LES BON TEMPS alleging interference against LITTLE LINZEE in
the stretch. After review, it was deemed that LITTLE LINZEE had interfered with LES BON TEMPS and therefore LITTLE LINZEE was disqualified from first
and placed second before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
EIGHT AND SAND bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed while well out in the track, led in the three path around the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch, drew off under one light tap of a right-handed crop near the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under a solid
hand-ride from that point to the wire. RED D G P was well placed down the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the
stretch and finished willingly to get the place. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL broke a bit slow, chased the pace on the outside then five wide on the turn, pursued
the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished with good courage but missed the place while well clear for the show. RHUM PRESSURE bumped with
an opponent at the start, showed speed then disputed the pace, chased in the two path around the turn and tired. CENTRAL STATION chased the pace
down the backstretch, dropped back near the half-mile pole, came up empty along the rail on the turn and faltered.
