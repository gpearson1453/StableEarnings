Footnotes
MAGIC BUBBLES unhurried early outside, continued back and in the three path into the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, outside bid, quickly clear,
drifted in steadily while increasing her advantage. CLOAK OF MERCY within striking distance while also racing in the three path, closer turning for home,
briefly put a head in front nearing the furlong grounds, proved no match for the winner late while holding sway for the place. FLIRTING GIRL dueled up front
in the two path, continued to vie into the stretch, could not hang with the top two the final furlong, narrowly lasted for the show. LOUPIT broke back, raced
off the pace in the two path, within range late in the final turn when briefly forced to wait in traffic, came up empty when clear for the drive. DIXIE TAP off a
step slow, trailed for six furlongs, angled out three wide into the lane, lacked a significant closing response. PENZIG dueled inside, held a narrow advantage
midway on the final turn, stopped through the stretch, jogged in late.

Footnotes
KYANDI away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, well clear, maintained that comfortable
advantage the final furlong under steady handling. BRIARTOWN last away, lacked speed while racing outside, came four to five wide into the stretch, could
do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. ASSET BASIS in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a
closing kick. CHARLIE WHISKEY broke on top, vied in the second group closest to but not on the rail, in traffic into the lane, altered course to the inside,
finished up evenly. BOURBON ON FIRE went one paced while racing in the three path, also lacked a closing response when called on. MOON
CONNECTION lacked speed while between horses up the backstretch and into the turn, steered out three wide into the stretch, remained back. RANSAM
PAYNTER away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, first to blink turning for home. P R CALL ME MAYBE remained always back.

Footnotes
ESPIONAGE broke in to tighten up ALEX'S STRIKE, raced back early in lacking speed, began to advance three wide through the turn, engaged the leader
past the furlong marker, exchanged bumps with that one then drove well clear. LIGHTNING STRUCK off a step slow, raced back toward the inside early,
steered out three wide turning for home, lodged a belated rally to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. COLONEL KLINK back off the pace
inside early, angled out four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally only to be oukicked for the second spot. MUCH BETTER dueled up front while in the
two path, shook off the other speed to be clear by midway on the turn, continued to show the way upper stretch, exchanged bumps with the winner a furlong
out and began to falter. ALEX'S STRIKE squeezed at the start to be away slowly, trailed early, improved toward the inside, not a serious threat. TANGO
CHARLIE in the second flight while racing outside, tired through the stretch. TAPIT'S SPIRIT in the second flight along the inside, began a steady fade
before a half. SQUARE DEAL dueled up front along the inside, stopped after three furlongs.

Footnotes
WREAKING HAVOC behind the pace, blocked first half of the turn, angled three wide to hit a seam in upper stretch, outside bid, kicked clear. TRUE
EMOTION in mid pack early, shuffled back to fall back and trail midway on the turn, dropped inside, moved back out to the two path into the lane, rallied to
be clear for the place. MISCHIEVOUS ME lacked early foot, three wide advance into contention turn, took over, lugged in as the winner was challenging
inside the furlong marker, faltered. LUV MAP off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, bore out into the seven path turn, improved position a bit down
the middle part of the strip through the stretch. BODI ODI pushed out at the start, in the second flight while three wide into the turn, closer in the two path by
late in the bend then lacked a further response. HER NAME WAS LOLA pushed out at the start, four wide through the turn when off the pace, failed to
muster a rally. JERSEY DOLL moved up to set the pace along the inside, faltered when headed. I'M BETH DUTTON broke through the gate prior to the
start and ran off for approximately a furlong, reloaded, broke out, was straightened to chase the leader up the backstretch, stopped in the turn, reported
home well back.

Footnotes
QUICK TO BLAME bumped lightly break, in mid pack while racing off the inside, came four wide and between horses into the lane, challenged soon after,
drove well clear. FAST LANE in mid pack while well wide, five path into the lane outside the winner, could not match strides with that one the final furlong,
clearly second best. NEW DICE void of early foot off the inside, swung out five wide into the lane, staged a belated rally out in the strip to annex the show,
too late for the top pair. KOSELIO broke back, lacked speed in the three path early turn, came four wide for the the drive, improved position. RISKY
SITUATION fell back to trail after the start, two path early turn, swung out to be widest in the drive, improved position with some modest late interest.
SUITABLE off a bit slow, raced back, went one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. PREMIUM in the second fight off the inside, moved
closer to lodge a brief bid three wide late in the turn, faltered in the drive. EL MONGO broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, weakened through
the stretch. MO CHOCTAW broke in to lightly bump with the winner, was quickly straightened, dueled in the two path for a half and also faltered when the
real running began at the head of the lane. SKYLINE forwardly placed while three wide into the turn, gave way stretch. MOURVEDRE in the second group
while racing off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
HOPPIN JOHN broke back, advanced four wide turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied, bid, took over, led late, held late. READY SHOES broke in, lacked
speed toward the inside early, came four wide for the drive, finished willingly while too late outside the winner. COLONEL BARTON back off the pace two off
the inside, lacked room in traffic into the stretch, improved position when clear. DANCIN ROCKET pressed the issue up the backstretch from along the
inside, rail bid, showed the way past the furlong marker, faltered late. IMPOVERISHED prompted the pace outside, floated out to be four wide into the lane
while being brushed, also weakened through the lane. HEART HEADED ARKY broke on top, cleared early, set the pace in the two path, faltered when
headed nearing midstretch. PERIPATETIC went one paced while racing along the inside. OLD TOBY put in tight and shuffled back just after the start, raced
back, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ALL IN GOOD TIME within striking distance off the inside, three wide turning for home, brushed,
backed up through the stretch. FANCY PAYNTER in mid pack while three wide early, moved in a bit to the two path late in the turn, tired. MUDDMAN
finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
JAMMINJL in mid pack early while off the inside, steered out three wide turning into the lane, launched an outside rally and closed with good resolve to be
up in time. DREAM STREAK away well, narrowly set the early pace in the two path, garnered a larger advantage in the turn, responded after allowing
LEGENDARY GIFT the inside into the lane, outfinished that one for the place spot while giving ground grudgingly to the winner. LEGENDARY GIFT within
striking distance while racing in the two path, dropped in late in the turn, challenged inside the runner up past the furlong marker, outkicked by that rival for
the second spot. BETCHA pressed the runner up off the inside, three wide through the turn, continued to force the issue past the furlong marker, missed the
show between horses. IZEONPOINT off a step slow, raced back and inside, improved inside of several rivals into the lane, finished up flat the final furlong.
SIMONA'S CHOICE void of speed while racing outside, fanned seven wide into the lane, improved position while well out in the strip. BECKY'S TATTOO in
mid pack off the inside, four to five wide late in the turn, failed to rally. LA MORENA four out to five wide midway on the turn, six wide into the lane, lacked
rally. MI CRESCENDO second flight, three to four wide in the turn, tired. FIRST EMPRESS back off the pace and the inside, went wrong entering the
stretch, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
TAPE TO TAPE broke alertly, clear early, set some quick early fractions in the two path, continued to hold a daylight advantage upper stretch, extended that
lead past the furlong marker and held it to the wire under steady handling. FAVORITE OUTLAW back off the pace while three wide into the turn, two path
into the stretch, traffic, tight, altered course to the outside approaching the furlong grounds, finished willingly to be clear for the place. UNDER THE GUN
came in after start to bother inner rivals. in the second flight early, dropped inside midway on the turn, chased the top two home the final furlong, lasted for
the show. BANDIT POINT fell back after the start, trailed off rail, four to five wide into the lane, rallied, flattened out a bit late to miss the show. LOCHMOOR
bumped at the start, jostled in traffic soon after, remained back while three wide into the stretch. EXXEL moved up to race closest to the winner while
moving outside that one in the three path, tired through the stretch. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN bumped at the start, in tight early, failed to menace.
COLTONS DREAM jostled in tight quarters soon after the start, raced four wide through the turn and failed to rally. COWBOY CASANOVA saved ground to
no avail in remaining back.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHARM broke running, showed the way into and through the first turn just off the inside and under restraint, relaxed onto the backstretch,
continued to set a moderate pace into the far turn, plenty left when called on for some run into the lane to separate herself from the field, steady hand ride to
the end. GUNNING bothered at the start when LOVELY RIDE broke out, moved outside and raced five wide through the first turn when within striking
distance, continued outside, three wide through the second bend when asked, long drive for the place, fully extended for that position, no threat to the
winner. BUTTERBEAN settled early along the inside, in traffic into the far turn, fell back along the rail, moved out to the two path when asked for run midway
on that bend, split foes with a sixteenth remaining, narrowly missed the place. LOVELY RIDE broke out to bother the runner up, prompted the pace off the
inside, continued to chase into the lane, had little left late to lose the place. TAP DANCE FEVER off a step slow, lacked early speed while in some traffic first
turn, moved closer after a half toward the inside, flattened out in the drive. LET'S CRUISE stalked the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued
outside, four wide again in the second bend, stopped through the stretch and jogged in.

Footnotes
RYVIT broke alertly, dueled inside, shucked off the faltering other speed early in the turn, large lead into the lane, coasted home. MO STRIKE lacked early
foot, continued to dawdle early turn, asked along aggressively midway on the bend, came four wide for the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the
winner, clearly second best. ARMAN forwardly placed in the two path, chased the winner into the lane, flattened out in the late going, caught late for the
place. RELEASE MCCRAKEN last away, trailed early outside, five wide into the lane, dropped inside late in the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest
to improve position. COUNT DE MONET broke in, settled along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, went evenly through the lane. ALTO
ROAD lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn, failed to rally. JOKING WAY off the pace three wide, backed up through the drive in failing to
threaten. TYLER'S TRIBE dueled early outside, stopped in the turn, eased stretch, returned bleeding.

Footnotes
OUTLIER stalked the pace while in the three path, crept a bit closer on the outside into the far turn, challenged when straightened for home, gained the
advantage inside the furlong marker, responded when challenged by the runner up in the final strides, gained the nod while on equal terms at the wire. MR.
THUNDERSTRUCK settled in midpack, raced outside, ,four wide into the far turn, three wide into the lane when beginning to rally, late bid outside the
winner, missed. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS dueled early off the inside, took over just before a half, continued to show the way through the lane, responded
when the top two came alongside stretch, gave ground grudgingly, comfortably saved the show. TWISTED DIXIE off a step slow, four wide through the first
turn, moved a bit closer three wide through the second turn, went flat through the stretch. NOTARY lacked speed, lodged a mild middle move toward the
inside into the far turn, little left drive. RIDER'S SPECIAL a bit restless in the gate prior to the start, went one paced toward the inside, lacked a closing
response. LORD DRAGON broke back, lacked speed in the three path through the first turn, four wide through the second bend when still back, lacked rally.
HERN off a step slow, was always outrun. MAGOO dueled early inside, stopped, jogged in well back.
