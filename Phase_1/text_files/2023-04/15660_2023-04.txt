Footnotes
ONE FLEW SOUTH bobbled leaving the gate, stalked from inside to the stretch, chased inside rival then brushed with that foe in the lane, tipped out and
launched a bid in the final sixteenth and drove past. THORNE HOUSE pinballed leaving the gate, steadied off heels then pulled a bit early, angled in for the
turn, had to pause behind a rival then gained a clear path around the bend, tipped out and rallied between rivals and got up for second. KING APOLLO
chased between then got shuffled, moved to the inside, angled out on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied five deep in the drive and got edged
for second. DOITFORANDREW (GB) took control early, set the pace on the inside around the bend, remained unchallenged to midstretch, then was
threatened by ONE FLEW SOUTH in the final sixteenth and yielded late. FORGIVING SPIRIT stumbled leaving the gate, went up to be forwardly placed
while racing keenly, rounded the bend two then three wide, took aim at the leader in the lane while brushing with ONE FLEW SOUTH but could not find the
needed late kick. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) broke in and bumped rival, raced outside a rival at the back early, went three wide into the turn, angled out
and came six wide into the stretch, steered out further to be widest in the drive and failed to threaten. SUBSIDIZE traveled near then at the back early, got
put in tight along the inside and checked entering the turn, kept on through the lane and improved position. DANCING RINCA was a bit crowded early
behind a rival, chased four then three wide on the turn then angled out and came seven wide into the stretch and could not rally. ADARE was off slow to
begin, got put in tight between and checked early, remained between rivals then angled out and entered the stretch five wide and weakened. HEAT'S ON
ZAP was off a bit slow, checked hard between early, shuffled into the turn, found traffic at the quarter pole, moved out, lacked room and altered out near the
sixteenth pole and was too late to rally. ANMER HALL got bumped from outside leaving the gate, stalked outside rivals, three wide into the turn, exited six
wide and weakened.

Footnotes
CEILING CRUSHER away quickly in the beginning, pressed TOM'S REGRET up the backstretch, moved up on even terms and took over past the
three-eighths pole, put away inner rival with a quarter mile left to run, began to open up and asked left-handed in upper stretch, then widened in the final
furlong while coasting in the last sixteenth. TOM'S REGRET lost his footing at the start, quickly recovered and went up to gain command, set the pace with
CEILING CRUSHER to the outside, lost command early on the turn, failed to keep up approaching the quarter pole, churned on down the lane and
managed to save the place. CHOLLY stumbled leaving the gate, chased out of range on the inside into the turn, tipped off the rail around the bend, kept on
through the lane but could not get by TOM'S REGRET for second. LOV U MEAN IT was off slow in the beginning, sat off the pace in the early going,
entered the turn three wide, exited five wide and failed to menace. ABSOLUTELY ZERO climbed a bit up the backstretch and was taken off the inside, went
two wide into the turn, lost ground around the bend while easing further out, entered the lane four wide and faded.

TIME TO PARTY settled off the pace and angled in on the first turn, started to move while tipping out but got boxed in from the five-sixteenths pole to the
quarter pole, moved out to a clear path and bid three deep with a furlong left to run and proved best in the final sixteenth. YES THIS TIME was prominent
early outside the leader then chased nearing the first turn, got bumped three deep into the bend, remained closest up the backstretch, bid outside on the far
turn, fought between rivals in the final sixteenth and got outkicked by the winner. YENG AGAIN grabbed the lead from inside early, controlled the pace to
the far turn, pressured from outside around that bend, carried a short lead into the stretch, fought inside a pair of rivals in the final furlong and yielded late.
FLASHIEST was off slow in the beginning, sat off the pace in the two path, chased three then four wide into the lane and improved position. FAYATHAAN
(IRE) broke out and was quickly corrected, took hold briefly to avoid a shuffle but then became rank and pulled forward to bumped outer rival into the first
turn, saved ground through the far turn and flattened in the lane. TIDAL FORCES got pinballed between rivals entering the first turn, stalked outside a rival
up the backstretch, rounded the far turn three wide and weakened. CARMELITA'S MAN was off slow, trailed on the inside, passed a rival and came two
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CASH EQUITY (FR) stumbled sharply leaving the gate, chased four wide into the clubhouse turn, bobbled and
had the rider take hold around the bend, raced near the back up the backstretch, trailed into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

NAVY MAN got bumped on both sides at the start, went up to prompt the pace from outside, dueled head to head around the bend, battled down the stretch
and proved best in the final sixteenth. DILLINGER set the pace with NAVY MAN to the outside early, dueled around the turn and into the lane, battled
through the lane and got outfinished in deep stretch. CAVENDISH bumped at the start, chased three then two wide around the turn and bested the rest.
BRING HIM HOME chased at the back on the inside into the turn, entered the lane two wide and failed to threaten. EL PERFECTO broke out and bumped
rival, stalked off the rail then moved to the rail to save ground around the turn, then weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
OFFLEE NAUGHTY bobbled leaving the gate, moved to the inside, trailing the field, steered out to gain ground and went between rivals, had to pause when
lacking room past the half-mile pole, chased between then got put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside, tipped out midstretch and
overhauled the top pair late. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) bobbled leaving the gate, went up to take control from OPRY then crossed over to the inside,
pressured around the clubhouse turn then moved clear again, dueled into the far turn, lost command at the three eighths pole, regained command at the
quarter pole, inched ahead into the final furlong but was overtaken by the winner late. OPRY away quickly from inside then ceded the lead early, rated under
a snug hold, drew alongside the leader on the first turn then stalked in the middle stages, applied pressure once again leaving the backstretch, put a head in
front at the three-eighths pole, dueled around the far turn and lost command at the quarter pole, fought through the lane alongside DICY MO CHARA (GB)
but faltered in the final sixteenth. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) settled off the pace and steered into the two path, took closer order three deep in the middle
stages, got floated out and bumped by MIDNIGHT JOSTAR late on the far turn, finished willingly through the final furlong and earned a minor award.
MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS was off a bit slow to begin, moved into the two path and took a stalking position, put in mild bid three deep at the
seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the top pair around the bend, bobbled a bit late on the final turn, chased within striking distance through the
lane but finished evenly in the furlong grounds. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR also broke a bit slow, steered in to stalk from inside, drifted out and bumped GOLD
PHOENIX late on the final turn, slipped and fell at the top of the stretch, was eventually caught by the outrider following the race and walked off.

PRACTICAL MOVE broke a step slow then steered to the inside to give chase, pulled the rider along at the three-quarter pole, inched closer from inside in
the middle stages, applied pressure from the rail into the far turn, took over under confident handling at the five-sixteenths pole, roused two wide into the
lane and moved clear, met the challenge from MANDARIN HERO (JPN) in the final sixteenth, drifted out a bit late and gamely prevailed. MANDARIN HERO
(JPN) bumped with inner rival at the start, settled in the two path, took closer order up the backstretch, coaxed into the far turn, angled to the rail around the
bend, cut the corner into the stretch, tipped out and bumped with SKINNER in the lane, then rallied between foes in deep stretch and just missed. SKINNER
got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, reserved three wide early, went three deep into the far turn, range up four wide outside the leaders leaving the
bend, bumped with the runner-up in the lane, fought three deep into the final sixteenth and finished a game third. NATIONAL TREASURE bumped at the
start, tracked three wide early, raced outside rivals up the backstretch, continued in the three path on the far turn, lacked room behind ONE IN
VERMMILLION at the quarter pole, moved out in the lane and kept on to earn a minor award. ONE IN VERMILLION sped to the front in the two path,
showed the way up the backstretch, pressed by PRACTICAL MOVE on the far turn, relinquished the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, stayed on three wide
into the stretch, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and flattened. I DON'T GET IT stumbled a bit to come away slow from inside, trailed two wide
early, angled out on the far turn and exited the bend five wide and lacked a rally. DAZZLEMESILVER settled off the pace on the inside, lost ground along
the rail through the second bend and had little left for the drive. LOW EXPECTATIONS raced up close outside the leader early, dropped back around the far
turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
KANGAROO COURT was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, drew alongside BUS BUZZ at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought from outside through the
turn, bumped twice in upper stretch, continued to battle in the final furlong, got bumped again at the sixteenth pole and dug in late to edge the runner-up.
BUS BUZZ sped clear up the backstretch and crossed over to the inside, met the challenge from KANGAROO COURT at the seven-sixteenths pole,
maintained a short advantage along the inside then two wide on the turn, bumped with outer rival twice in upper stretch, continued to hold a slim lead into
the final furlong, drifted out and bumped again at the sixteenth pole and was edged in the closing moments. CLOUSEAU broke slow, sat off the pace early
on, saved ground on the turn then came two wide into the stretch, moved out further in the drive and finished a clear third. LEFT HAND MAN was antsy in
the gate, broke slow and bumped with inner rival, raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, tipped out in the lane and improved position.
CLOVISCONNECTION stumbled a bit and bumped with LEFT HAND MAN at the start, tracked off the rail, two to three wide on the turn, then weakened in
the stretch run. GOOD N THIRSTY tossed his head at the start but still came away quickly, chased outside a rival out of range up the backstretch, spun four
wide into the lane and weakened. BARELY FUNTIONAL stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced at the back on the inside into the turn, saved ground to the
stretch and failed to make an impact. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF GOOD N THIRSTY AND AFTER A REVIEW
RULED THAT THERE WOULD NO CHANGE. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN KANGAROO
COURT AND BUS BUZZ AND RULED THAT BUS BUZZ INITIATED THE CONTACT AND SINCE KANGAROO COURT WENT ON TO WIN, NO CHANGE
WOULD BE MADE.

Footnotes
GENERAL MATHIS tracked three to four wide early, rallied four wide on the far turn, took over and cleared while lugging inward in upper stretch, then
inched away from COALINGA ROAD in the final sixteenth. COALINGA ROAD trailed three then two wide on the first turn, moved closer in the middle
stages, waited for room behind the leaders in the two path, angled out leaving the bend, took aim at GENERAL MATHIS in the final furlong but could not
find the needed late kick. SILVER SURFER (GB) broke well then took a stalking position off the rail, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, took
over at the five-sixteenths pole, exchanged bumps with IRISH PROPHET entering the stretch and relinquished the lead, could not kick on with the winner in
the final furlong and flattened to third. IRISH PROPHET chased two wide into the first then had to check between rivals early on the bend, bid three deep
into the far turn, exchanged bumps with SILVER SURFER (GB) entering the stretch and weakened. BALLADEER sent for the lead from inside, set the pace
under pressure in the middle stages, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders from the rail past the quarter pole and tired in the drive.
JEWELED SHILLELAGH angled to the inside early off the pace then began to pull into the first turn and had to check, chased along the inside into the far
turn, weakened around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
LOVESICK BLUES stumbled leaving the gate, chased outside a rival up the backstretch, rounded the bend three wide, drew alongside the leader in
midstretch and proved best in the end. JOE DON LOONEY set the pace to the turn, met the bid from TETON VALLEY and put away that rival away around
the bend, challenged by LOVESICK BLUES in midstretch and was outfinished in the late stages. MANITOWISH bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace
near the inside then two wide on the the turn, moved out in the lane, put in a late run and gained the show. CLEM LABINE dropped back off the pace under
coaxing, went three wide into the turn, spun five wide into the drive, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. JOKER BOY chased off the rail,
angled in on the turn, steered back out a bit in the lane and lacked a bid. MY HARBORS DREAM chased well off the rail in the early going, rounded the
bend four wide and failed to threaten. TETON VALLEY stumbled and bumped with inner rival at the start, was closest in pursuit early, bid from outside on
the turn but failed to keep up late on the bend, then weakened in the stretch run. SELF TAUGHT was off slow in the beginning, trailed three wide on the turn
and improved position. NEXT REVOLT took an awkward step then pulled up near the nine-sixteenths pole and walked off.

Footnotes
FAIZA broke well then took a stalking position outside a rival, gained up the backstretch and bid three deep into the far turn, dueled outside CLEARLY
UNHINGED around the bend, took over at the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the lane and powered away under left-handed urging and was in-hand
nearing the wire. AND TELL ME NOLIES chased three to four wide around the first turn, got bumped while three deep at the three-eighths pole, took aim
three wide into the stretch but could not make any headway on the FAIZA and churned on to best the rest. WINDOW SHOPPING was off a bit slow, sat off
the pace a bit off the rail early, had to check hard behind VENGANZA and altered out to bumped CLIQUISH nearing the three-eighths pole, entered the lane
four wide and finished willingly for the show honors. CLEARLY UNHINGED broke a step slow, stalked two wide into the first turn, gained ground on the
leader in the middle stages, launched a bid between rivals into the far turn, took over at the three-eighths pole, dueled with the winner around the bend and
lost command at the quarter pole, could not keep up at the top of the stretch and weakened in the lane. VENGANZA was off slow in the beginning, chased
from inside, took closer order up the backstretch, had to check and altered out when getting blocked behind GILA early on the far turn, chased two wide into
the lane and weakened. DON'T GET PICKLED trailed four wide on the first turn, remained wide to the stretch and passed tired rivals. CLIQUISH broke a
step slow, chased two wide into the first then had to steadied behind rival, chased between on the backstretch, got bumped hard and had to take up at the
three-eighths pole and was not persevered with in the final furlong. GILA bobbled leaving the gate then sprinted clear and opened up around the first turn,
held a diminishing lead nearing the far turn, was overtaken with three furlong remaining, tired around the far turn and had little left for the drive. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN AND FOLLOWING A REVIEW RULED THAT GILA CAUSED THE
CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN SEVERAL RUNNERS AND SINCE SHE FINISHED LAST NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.
