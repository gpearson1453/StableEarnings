no rally, missed show award. OMACHE KID was reserved early, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. THIRSTY JUNIOR lacked a rally. THE

RAISE OUR FLAG dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and edged away to prove best, driving. JEDI JENNIE dueled for the
lead three wide and could not go with the winner late while running on to be second best. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE chased the pace and was three wide
on the turn and came four wide into the lane but lacked the needed winning bid. MS. LEA was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn and swung out
four wide leaving the turn then had a belated rally while drifting in slightly. KELL'S KISS chased the pace on the inside and weakened. BERNICE WHO was
reserved early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. LA DIAMANT was void of early speed, four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. HOT LIL MESS was
allowed to settle two to three wide and then dropped back, tired.

Footnotes
AR YA WEEGEE was three wide into the first turn, went up to set the pace and cross over to the inside while clear, then drew off in the stretch to prove
much the best while being ridden out. SHAME ON ROOSTER was allowed to settle three wide, rallied well for the place award while no match for the
winner. GRIFTER chased the early pace and made a mild bid three wide but flattened out, bested rest. RIGHT JAB tracked the pace on the inside and
weakened. CRYSTAL WHO was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally while saving ground. WATFORD was reserved early and lacked a rally.
DAVE'S ENCHANTMENT failed to menace. GONE PROSPECTING failed to respond. SMARTY'S BERTRANDO showed little.

FLAXY LADY tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and was clear leaving the furlong marker, then held on late to prove best,
driving. CORRINA CORRINA was reserved on the inside, then advanced splitting rivals through traffic on the turn while easing out, then swung out six wide
for racing room leaving the turn and closed with a rush to just miss. BOSSY BABY pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to gain a short
lead, then faded the final furlong, held show award. MARKED BY A STORM was well placed early on the inside, swung out four wide for racing room and
finished willingly. QUATRO was rated early three wide and lacked a rally. BYE BYE BRANDI was crowded into the first turn, shifted out and was wide on the
backstretch and had no rally. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS chased the early pace four wide and made a five wide bid nearing the turn but weakened. INDIAN
FIREBLOSSOM set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way.
