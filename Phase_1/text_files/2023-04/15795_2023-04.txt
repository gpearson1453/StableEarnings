Footnotes
AMARI S. rated on the front end, was let out two wide leaving the bend then gradually opened up under urging in the lane. MAZLAN without early speed,
picked up her pace between rivals on the turn, angled four wide for the stretch run, rallied belatedly the last eighth and gained second. OH LA DE DA
advanced from inside on the turn, took over second with a sixteenth left but was outfinshed for the place. W W VALID displayed early speed from inside but
flattened out for the stretch run. GULF BENDER hustled between rivals, failed to keep up three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive and
continued to give way. PRINCESS RULER was a contender from outside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend.

Footnotes
JIM'S RIVER RUNNER shared the early lead inside UNCLE O. G., moved ahead on the turn, drew clear upper stretch and maintained control under steady
handling. WEST COAST CHROME forwardly placed from outside, was three then four wide taking the bend and took over second nearing the last sixteenth.
THACKER FROMM advanced just off the inside on the turn, altered in for a clear path inside the final furlong and improved position late without closing the
gap on the leader. UNCLE O. G. bumped with GREEN GOBLIN at the start, was hustled to contest the pace briefly but began to wear down outside JIM'S
RIVER RUNNER leaving the bend. ANUNKA soon trailed then passed between tired ones in the stretch. DERRICKS MEDALLION also bumped with
GREEN GOBLIN at the break, was an early factor but faded two wide on the turn. GREEN GOBLIN was pinched between rivals briefly at the start,
prompted the pace two then three wide but gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
KIANA'S LOVE shared the lead outside PLAY TWENTY, fanned out some for the stretch run, was all out late and began to draw clear in the waning yards.
PLAY TWENTY disputed the pace along or just off the rail and did not have enough left the final seventy yards. TWO MORE TIMES void of early speed,
picked up her pace between rivals on the turn, steadily advanced in the lane, gained third inside the last eighth and narrowly held her position. TEMPLUNA
chased from between rivals, lost ground fanning widest for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. GHAALEB'S MAGIC in contention early
between rivals, came five wide into the lane and flattened out. BEIRUT BEAUTY pressed the early pace, was three then four wide on the bend and drifted
out some as she gave way for the drive. LOUIE P chased from outside and failed to menace. ARCH FLYER gave way from inside on the turn.

ONE WAY HOME prominent between rivals, took over when asked leaving the bend and gradually opened up under urging. YABA DABA DOO displayed
early speed from inside, was no match for the winner when set down for the drive but stayed clear for the place. GEMO RAIN forwardly placed toward the
outside, took the turn four wide, fought for third in the lane and edged ahead for the show late. MADE TO FIT raced in contention in a ground-saving trip,
dueled for third in the stretch but leveled off in the waning yards. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was also an early factor, lost ground five wide taking the turn and
lacked a significant stretch bid. STOSH advanced two wide on the bend, progressed between rivals to battle for third in the stretch but could not sustain his
bid. WILLOW RIDGE broke in the air and was never a factor. RIPE ATTACK went for the lead three wide on the turn but gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
INSIDE THE CIRCLE broke in stride, soon had the inside, was settled, responded to urging in the lane and steadily drew off. LUKE ATTACK pressed
INSIDE THE CIRCLE from just outside, floated out further leaving the bend, could not stay with the latter when set down for the drive, drifted out under
left-handed urging the final furlong but was easily best of the rest. BILL'S HONOR unruly in the gate, was taken out and reloaded after approval from the
veterinarian, raced in contention between horses, gained third three wide on the turn, swung out further for the stretch run and could only just hold his
position late. ON THE MONEY RED hesitated then altered in to keep clear of others at the start, circled rivals five wide on the turn and was closing in for
third deep stretch. HIGHLY PERFECT chased from inside and could only improve his position two wide in the lane without threatening. RUN THE TABLE
prominent early, began to steadily yield from along the rail once on the turn. NAGY AND DA BEARS failed to menace in a wide trip. EIGHT MAY somewhat
unruly in the gate, chased from paths two or three and was not a factor. NOBLE CREEKER chased from midpack between horses, was four wide taking the
turn and gave way for the drive. DARREN'S LEGACY showed little.

BASEBALL POLITICS bumped at the break, vied for the early lead from outside, was three wide through the turn, shook off CINDY'S G MAN near the
sixteenth marker and held on under steady handling. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY in contention early, failed to keep up two wide on the bend, rallied in the lane,
angled out for a clear path midstretch, closed well, came up short but gained second in the waning yards. CINDY'S G MAN vied for the lead between rivals
from the beginning but gradually wore down from inside the last furlong. LONESOME DREAM was taken outside early on, four then five wide through the
bend and only made up minor ground late. TWO COOKIE RULE prompted the early pace, did not keep up three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the
stretch run and finished evenly. MUD ISLAND displayed early speed from inside but gradually began to yield with three furlongs to go. MY LITTLE TIPSY
broke inward, bumped BASEBALL POLITICS, stumbled and was always outrun.

Footnotes
TORIN bumped with CITY POSITION at the start, soon had a clear lead, gradually angled in nearing the turn, put to urging upper stretch, widened
command and proved much the best while kept to task to the waning yards. NOT AGAIN JACKIE crowded and checked behind traffic just after the break,
was settled well back, just off the inside taking the bend, altered out to the middle of track upper stretch, made a strong move the last furlong and caught
LITTLE MIGHTY MAN for second. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN in the second flight early, took over second three wide on the turn, edged ahead for the place in
the stretch but began to weaken late and was outfinished. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was bumped and steadied shortly after the stat, progressed two wide on
the turn, fanned out behind LITTLE MIGHTY MAN into the stretch, moved outside the latter approaching the last eighth and showed a willingness to run in
the late going. CRAPS SHOOTER drifted out some after the break, crowding those outside him, raced in the second flight from inside for three furlongs then
began to yield. KING TITO bumped and forced in some just after the start, was an early factor between rivals but wore down the last two furlongs. IT'S
BELLAMY TIME altered out some to stay clear of CRAPS SHOOTER at the break, bumped MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, prompted the early pace from between
rivals but gave way the final eighth. CITY POSITION bumped with TORIN then KING TITO at the start, was an early factor but began to fade four wide on
the bend.
