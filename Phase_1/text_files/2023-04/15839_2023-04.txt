Footnotes
SWEET SAVANT lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off with complete authority.
BOSS NINE broke sharply to duel for the lead with AMERICAN GRIT while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and gave to the winner
through the final sixteenth. AMERICAN GRIT bobbled at the start, dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final sixteenth. GUEST
CHECK settled off the leaders early, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. AIR JOCK was void of early speed, saved ground through the
second turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

FLIPLIT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the lane, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off with complete
authority. LADY CREATIVE broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a
clear margin into the lane and yielded to the winner through the final sixteenth. UPTOWN RHAPSODY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through
the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. EASY DOES IT showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the first
turn, moved five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SHES A KILLA QUEEN was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the
inside, weakened after going three-quarters and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SANTALUZ DREAMIN broke sharply to press the pace of KING LEBRON while racing three-wide, moved up to take over the pacesetting chores nearing
the half, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with something left. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, could
not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. KING LEBRON sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace,
relinquished the pacesetting to the winner after going a half, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. REDACTION lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. RANCHER hopped at the start, raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. FINAL ROSE raced off the pacesetters from between foes, moved three-wide through the
second turn and lacked the needed rally. SPIRE was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid. CHEF raced
four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders and gradually weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MR. WHO broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, responded when challenged by CONVENTION nearing the quarter, drifted out to
impede that rival through the lane and held gamely. CONVENTION was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn,
was carried out by the winner through the lane and lost momentum. OVIATT CLASS settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and
finished evenly late. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER was off a step slow, lagged, raced three-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. FATHER
O'FLAHERTY was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF CONVENTION LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST MR. WHO CONCERING THE DRIFTING OUT AND CAUSING
CONVENTION TO BE CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE LANE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT MR. WHO WILL BE
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND DUE TO THE INFRACTION. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

AWESOME BID was away alertly then hustled along to open a clear margin before going a quarter, saved ground while setting the pace and held sway to
the wire. DARKSABER broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, could not reach that foe in the drive but held on well to save the place.
ROCKY JACK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. LIMITED OFFER settled off the
leaders early, saved ground through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. FASCINATED was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved
six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. LIVING VICARIOUSLY was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. DIAMOND WILLOW lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. SHELBY R. showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. PLATINUM EQUITY lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not threaten. THE RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
LILA'S LUCKY LADY was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and wore down
CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) in the closing yards. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, moved to offer a bid
nearing the half, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter but could not resist the winner from over the top. MS SALLY settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. TALES OF MAKENNA pressed the pace while racing four-wide
throughout and lacked the needed closing response. PARTY POLICE set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. ALL NATIVE
lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
