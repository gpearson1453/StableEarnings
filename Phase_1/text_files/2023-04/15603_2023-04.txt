Footnotes
ZIO JO rated on the inside early, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, steered back to the fence, rallied inside the top pair and
drove clear in the final sixteenth. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) was closest in pursuit from the two path early, bid outside on the far turn, dueled into the lane,
fought to midstretch, then could not kick on with the winner but held the place. PAULLIAC (IRE) settled inside off the pace, was boxed in on the far turn and
while lightly coaxed along, steered out to a clear path late on the bend, moved out further in the drive and got up for third. POST FACTO brushed the gate to
lose a step to the others, chased while a bit keen under a hold three wide into the first turn, moved into the two path, tracked outside a rival in hand up the
backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and finished evenly late while getting nailed for third. PLEASE FOCUS sprinted clear from inside then set the
pace while in hand, dictated terms through the middle stages, met the bid from outside on the far turn, maintained a short advantage to the eighth pole, then
weakened in the final furlong. CRYPTO RIDE pulled briefly early, sat off the pace two wide, coaxed along on the backstretch, continued two wide on the far
turn, lugged out under left-handed urging late on the bend and failed to menace.

Footnotes
KANT BEAT THE ROCK stalked behind the leaders early, hand to pause when running up on heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved closer again on the
rail then two wide into the stretch, bid between rivals at the top of the lane, took over at the eighth pole, held a short lead over BRACE FOR IMPACT into the
final sixteenth and drew clear late. BRACE FOR IMPACT was forwardly placed off the inside early, chased two to three wide around the turn, tipped out and
bid four wide into the stretch, kept the pressure on the winner from outside into the final sixteenth but faltered in the closing moments.
WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME broke well and went up to duel for command from inside, battled through the turn and into the stretch, flattened in the furlong
grounds but managed to save the show. BIG SPLASH broke slow and lagged behind early, went three wide into the turn, asked around the bend and came
five wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and whittle the gap late while earning a minor award. DIVINE RASCAL dueled for command outside rival
up the backstretch, around the turn and three wide into the stretch, got crowded a bit between foes at the eight pole and flattened.

Footnotes
JOHANNES unhurried in the beginning, steadied when running up behind GAME TIME approaching the first turn, settled in the two path outside a rival,
inched closer while angling out on the far turn, challenged four wide entering the stretch, quickly took over and cleared under hand urging in upper stretch,
then drew off in the final furlong while drifting inward. GAME TIME was away well then stalked WIZARD OF WESTWOOD into the first turn from the two
path, moved up to apply pressure into the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and led three wide exiting the bend, could not offer any resistance to the
winner in upper stretch but stayed on to secure second. WIZARD OF WESTWOOD took control early while moving to the inside, gained company leaving
the clubhouse turn, held a short advantage over GAME TIME up the backstretch, fought with that rival through the far turn and relinquished the lead late on
the bend, stayed on to upper stretch, then flattened to third in the furlong grounds. KEEN TO GO rated along the inside early, saved ground to the stretch
and lacked the needed response when called upon.

HOLIDAY AROUSAL cleared early and led a bit off the rail, met the challenge from outside entering the far turn, maintained a short lead inside a pair of
rivals while in the two path entering the stretch, shook free under right-handed urging in upper stretch and inched away. MR. T'S THIRSTY stalked three
then two wide early, continued in the two path on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly for second. FOOTHILL chased three to four
wide around the first turn, bid four then three deep on the second bend, failed to keep up with the winner in upper stretch and churned on to save third.
SUZIE QZZ BROTHER bumped with STAR PROSPECT leaving the gate, stalked from inside, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a bid. STAR
PROSPECT bumped leaving the gate, paused briefly then began to pull and steadied when running up behind rival into the first turn, continued to tug and
pulled the rider forward while angling outside the top pair, challenged the winner around the far turn and into the stretch, then lost contact in upper stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
GREENBOW was off slow from inside, sat off the pace raced along the inside then two wide on the turn, moved back inside at the top of the stretch then
moved off the rail while closing fast and surged by the runner-up to win going away. DEVIL MOON dueled for command early then cleared outer rival up the
backstretch, showed the way along the inside through the turn, continued unchallenged into the final furlong but was no match for the winner in the final
sixteenth. ADMIRAL HALSEY settled inside, got boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, angled out into the clear and rallied for
the show. STOP AND A TRES dropped back early, trailed two wide into the turn, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to round out the
superfecta. SAI CON (FR) dueled from outside early then ceded command, was closest in pursuit in the two path to the stretch, then weakened down the
lane. LASMUIGH (GB) coaxed to a forward position then had to alter in from behind SAI CON (FR) early, chased along the rail then two wide into the lane,
moved out in the stretch and flattened. CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) dropped back off the pace, raced three wide on the turn, got floated out to the five path
leaving the bend and could not rally. AZOV SEA tracked outside a rival into the turn, raced two wide then got floated out leaving the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BELLA RENELLA stalked off the inside early, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole, took over three wide into the lane, cleared VEGAN in upper
stretch and inched away under right-handed urging. VEGAN set the pace up the backstretch, challenged from outside nearing the quarter pole, lost
command while leaving the two wide and stayed on for a clear second. TALKATIVE GAL stalked the lone leader from inside, angled out late on the turn and
lacked a bid. BEACHGRASS was off a bit slow in the beginning, lagged behind up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch,
angled in upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EXAULTED was antsy in the starting gate, dueled three wide into the first turn then pressed from outside, lost touch with the leader but remained close up in
the middle stages, re-engaged BOB AND JACKIE from outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drove clear in the final sixteenth. IRIDEO
(ARG) was fractious in the starting gate, unhurried in the beginning and steered inside, trailed while saving ground to the stretch, moved off the rail in the
lane and finished well to earn the place honors. BOB AND JACKIE dueled for the lead from inside into the first turn then inched ahead around the bend,
inched away from EXAULTED up the backstretch, pressured again by that rival on the far turn, maintained a short lead to the top of the lane, lost command
in upper stretch, got outfinished in deep stretch and saved third. DU JOUR chased off the rail then got bumped to the four path entering the first turn, moved
into the three path around that bend, stalked outside a rival to the far turn, traveled two wide then spun three wide into the lane, got bumped at the
three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly in the late stages. EARLS ROCK (IRE) broke a step slow from inside, drifted out and bumped rival into the first
turn, stalked along the rail into the far turn, went two wide into the lane, bumped DU JOUR again at three-sixteenths pole, finished evenly inside that rival
through the furlong rounds and got edged for a minor award. VANZZY settled off the pace while moving to the rail, angled out on the far turn and came four
wide into the stretch but lacked further response.

Footnotes
OLE SILVER raced up close five wide into the first turn then moved over to the three path, went up to apply pressure at the midway point, dueled on the far
turn and led into the stretch, carried a short lead over MONGOLIAN PANTHER into deep stretch and drew clear late. MONGOLIAN PANTHER vied four
then three wide around the first turn then cleared around the bend, gained company at the half-mile pole, dueled inside OLE SILVER on the far turn,
relinquished the lead late on that bend, fought into the final sixteenth and faltered late. CHARLOTTE HARBOR tracked four wide into the first turn then
moved down to the two path, urged three wide around the far turn, finished willingly down the lane and finished a clear third. CLASSICAL ROMANCE away
quickly then became rank when trying to rate early, went three wide into the first turn then angled down to the rail, chased in the two path on the far turn and
kept on to improved position. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER chased four wide early then angled into the two path, navigated the far turn three to four wide and
could not rally. EVERLYS GIRL vied for the lead from inside then ceded command around the first turn, stalked along the rail through the far turn and
weakened in the drive. WHISTLER'S STYLE coaxed from the gate, chased along the rail into the first turn then steadied off heels around the bend, moved
off the rail and went between rivals, got shuffled a bit near the seven-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
LUCKY FOR YOU sprinted clear and crossed to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, then drew off when asked right and left-handed in the lane.
LUMINIFEROUS settled off the pace and steered to the inside, gained up the backstretch and far turn, moved out into the stretch, could not threaten the
winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. MARINAS TINA (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, traveled two wide near the back, chased three
deep at the five-sixteenths pole, steered in then back out in the lane and was along for the show. SAREEHA (IRE) pulled early while forward early off the
inside, went four then three wide on the first turn, angled in while gaining up the backstretch, was closet in pursuit entering the stretch but weakened down
the lane. HAPPY HAPPY was off slow to begin, raced two wide at the back early, went two to three wide on the far turn and churned on to improve position
in the stretch run. MYGALSDAWNNLORI pulled hard and bumped rival nearing the first turn, stalked the winner up the backstretch, traveled two then three
wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. THREE STRANDS raced two wide then moved inside off the pace, went between rivals then along the rail on
the far turn and failed to menace. PRINCESS OF TIME was off a bit slow and bumped at the start, raced along the rail at the back early, lagged behind into
the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and passed tired rivals. CRUISINGTHECHANNEL was off a bit slow in the beginning, pulled shortly after then
settled in a stalking position on the inside, tired around the far turn and had little left for the drive. SOUL OF A WARRIOR broke out and bumped rival,
moved to a forward position between rivals then got bumped approaching the first turn, chased three wide then three deep into the far turn, tired and
dropped back around that bend and came up empty.
