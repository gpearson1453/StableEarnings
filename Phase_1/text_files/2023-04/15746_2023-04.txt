Footnotes
INSIGNIS raced in the four path around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the
far turn and gained ground in the final furlong to get up for the win late. DREAMING OF TOGA raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole, kicked clear in
midstretch and was caught late. MISTER MOORE raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, came around the far
bend still in the four path and gained ground late. FAR FROM HOME raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled
while saving ground around the second turn and gave way late. BALLINDINE raced in the three path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the
inside, raced in the two path around the far turn and improved position in the lane. DEPOLI saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half

around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened from there. KING MIANO raced in the three path
early, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. BALI ROLLING TIDE
saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and tired
further in the lane. POORONYO was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a
factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE FOUR. POORONYO, HAD A
FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.
