Footnotes
HOPE OVER FEAR set the pace in the two path, was coaxed approaching the quarter, opened slightly and was cued right handed from said position in
upper stretch, and held sway. ALHAAN tracked in the five path, moved up to bid under a ride from the three path early around the far turn, was under left
handed urging from the three path at the top of the lane, and chased on for place. READY SHE IS was bumped around between foes early and steadied
into the first turn, trailed around the three path into the backstretch, moved up inside a pair of foes from the two path early into the far turn, angled out to the
seven path in upper stretch, and finished evenly for show. DANDELION bumped with an inner foe early, rated around the three path, was roused in the four
path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but flattened. BULLET VALENTINA raced wellback along the inside, shifted out to
the five path early around the far turn, but never threatened. BONNIE SANDRA bumped with an outer foe early, prompted the pace from around the four
path into the backstretch, but backed up early around the far turn.

Footnotes
SPONGER set the pace in the three path, was roused passing the quarter, opened up from the two path into the stretch, and was driven clear.
INTERESTING GEM prompted the pace in the four path, lost ground to the winning pacesetter around the turn, but chased on from around the five path in
the stretch to hold place. ALWAYS CONNECTED stalked in the three path, tipped out to the four path and was ridden along early around the turn, was in
the six path entering the stretch, tipped inwards thru the final furlong, and kept on for show. BEER BALI bumped with an inner foe at the start, was held up
off the pace in the three path, advanced from the five path rounding the turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and evened out late. OUR LA
DOLCE VITA settled up close in the three path, was roused from the two path into the turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. CASTLE BORN
chased in the four path, was ridden along inside of foes around the turn and into the lane, but did not threaten. YOU LOOKING AT ME bumped with an
outer foe at the start, tracked along the rail, waited for room early around the turn, but was empty from the three path into the lane. SHE'S RED HOT was
wellback in the six path and never menaced. APPLE SAUCY was always behind from the five to seven paths.

Footnotes
KIKILOVE set the pace two wide between foes, kicked clear in upper stretch and just lasted under right-handed urging. TAP'ER LIGHT pressed the pace
three wide, could not match strides with the winner late on the turn, steadily narrowed the gap through the final eighth and just missed. ESOTERIC chased
the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally but stayed on to gain the show. SISTREN raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide near the
three-sixteenths pole and was one-paced through the lane. GUARDIAN ANGEL pressed the pace from the rail and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
NATE THE GREAT stalked in the two path, was ridden along the rail rounding the far turn, bid from inside into the lane, was briefly stymied passing the
eighth pole, but got thru and was up in the final strides. KING D'ORO bumped with an inner foe early into the first turn and had to check hard, rated in the
two path, was stymied inside of rivals around the far turn, coaxed from the three path into the lane, and ran on between foes in the final furlong for place.
IMMENSE FAITH set the pace inside, was roused into the far turn, fought on under left handed urging from the two path down the stretch, but yielded late to
be caught on both sides in the closing strides to show. COMPOSER'S DREAM settled off the pace in the four path, tipped out to the six path and was cued
into the far turn, and stayed on down the lane. JEBY was unhurried in the three path, coaxed while tipping out midway around the far turn and received a left
handed cue while in the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on. JUSTIN'S LEGACY bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the
two path, was driven from the rail rounding the far turn, but was no factor while angling out to center down the stretch. ONE FAST DREAM bumped with an
inner foe at the start, was prompted along from up close around the four path, bid into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. SAINT IN THE CITY
bumped with an outer foe and steadied early around the first turn, raced wellback in the six path down the backside and never threatened while wide in the
stretch. AJAAYB tracked around the five path but dropped back rounding the far turn. VOY Y VENGO broke out at the start, pressed in the three path but
gaveway from the four path turning into the stretch.

I'LLSMILEAGAIN prompted the pace in the four path, bid rounding the far turn, stayed on from the five path into the lane and took the lead into the final
furlong, was herded inwards by a challenging outer foe but held on. GUSTAVOR stalked in the five path, ranged up under coaxing around the far turn, bid
from the seven path into the stretch, ran on but drifted in under right handed urging bothering a pair of inner foes, and was up for place. DONTONIO tracked
in the three path, was driven from the two path around the far turn and out in the four path entering the stretch, tipped inwards while staying on thru the
stretch, but had to steady from an inward drifting pair of rivals late to show. ENSIGN SKIP lost the blinkers into the first turn which were held by the rider
thereafter, rated in the three path, was coaxed while shifting inside into the far turn, had to steady briefly nearing the final sixteenth, and was unable to
factor. RANSEUR set the pace in the two path, was roused when challenged by an outer foe early around the far turn, and yielded in the stretch. TIO TONY
broke in a tangle, raced wellback along the inside early but was no factor from out in the six path down the stretch. MAJESTIC DRAMA chased in the four
path, was under urging around the far turn, but was empty going into the stretch. SPY TOWN travelled wellback in the three path early and never menaced.
AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE STRETCH RUN, GUSTAVOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR
DRIFTING IN, HERDING THE EVENTUAL WINNER, AND CAUSING DONTONIO TO HAVE TO STEADY HARD IN THE CLOSING STAGES.

Footnotes
YES I AM FREE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. SOUPER SUCCESS saved ground in midpack, got through at the rail in upper
stretch and finished willingly to gain the place in the final strides. WARRIOR'S PRIDE prompted the winner in the three path, was no match for that foe in the
lane and just missed second. FULL DISCLOSURE was bumped at the start, raced in range inside and lacked the needed rally. CHESS MASTER was
bumped at the start, chased the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. OMAHA CITY failed to menace while racing three wide.
FAMOUS GENT had his head turned at the start, broke in and bumped FULL DISCLOSURE, dropped far back, raced four wide around the turn, swung
widest in upper stretch and never threatened. CHARMED (GB) played no factor while racing four wide. NOVGOROD THE GREAT was fractious in the gate
and outrun while racing two wide. UNCLE B broke in and bumped CHESS MASTER, prompted the pace in the four path and retreated through the lane.

MONFORTE was hustled along up close in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, took the lead from the four path in upper stretch, and dug in
gamely to hold on. CORDUROY ROAD settled in range around the five path, ranged up and bid in the four path around the turn, was in the five path
entering the stretch, and ran on but hung to finish with place. DOO WOP DON raced off the pace in the two path, was under right handed urging into the
stretch, and rallied to get up for show late. HEALS THE SOUL chased in the three path, was under right handed urging inside of rivals turning into the lane,
and mildly stayed on. EARTH was pushed along in midpack around the three path, tipped out under a drive around the turn and was in the seven path
entering the stretch, but finished evenly. HIGH PRESS rated in the six path into the turn, was ridden along and floated out to the eight path into the stretch,
but was one paced. UNTITLED was hustled off the pace in the four path but was no factor from the seven path in the stretch. HANDSOME PRINCE stalked
along the rail but backed up around the turn. TELEPHONE TALKER raced wellback in the five path but never threatened. OFFICER COUNTRY trailed in

BIG AND CLASSY set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and lasted under right-handed urging. BIG DADDY DAVE tracked the
pace from the rail, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, closed outside and just missed. NIC'S BRO settled off the early pace, bid three wide around
the turn, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths marker but was no match for the top two in the lane. REDDINGTON pressed the pace two wide
and faded after a half. HE'S IN CHARGE failed to menace while racing four wide. BRACCIO DI FERRO trailed while racing in the two and three paths.

WIN FOR THE MONEY settled up close along the inside, switched out to the three path midway down the backstretch and was roused to bid into the far
turn, led from the two path at the top of the lane, drifted out to the four path passing the eighth pole, then drifted back inwards appearing to bother a closing
inner rival late, and held on. YAMATO tracked in the two path, waited for room under a nudge rounding the far turn, was coaxed while shifting inside into the
stretch, ran on to bid into the final furlong, but had to check late to place. LURE HIM IN bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, was
cued right handed along the inside midway around the far turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on to get up for show late. OLYMPIC
RUNNER stalked in the four path, bid under coaxing midway around the far turn, was still in the four path at the top of the lane, evened out passing the
eighth pole, and was caught to miss minor rewards. ELDON'S PRINCE bumped with an inner foe at the start, was unhurried in the two path, put to a ride
around the far turn, got floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly. KYGO (GER) bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the
five path, was driven into the stretch, but flattened. JOURNEYMAN bumped with an outer foe and steadied at the start, trailed around the four path early and
never factored. CALIFORNIA FROLIC rated in the six path but never threatened. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) set the pace in the two path but gaveway
turning into the lane. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF YAMATO, WIN FOR THE MONEY WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING INWARDS IN DEEP STRETCH CAUSING YAMATO TO HAVE TO CHECK HARD
AND COSTING A CHANCE FOR THE WIN.
