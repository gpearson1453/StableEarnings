four paths off the inside down the backstretch settling in closest aim of that leader, tucked to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch brushing with GIFTED while issuing a challenge for command straightened away, took over the
front with three-sixteenths to go and edged away sloshing home along the inside to the finish kept busy to the end. GIFTED away to the front, raced three
wide through the first turn before tipping out four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch to show the way in hand, tucked three wide into the far turn
and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch under challenge and brushed with the aforementioned foe straightened
away, yielded command with three-sixteenths to run and ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest. KAYLEIGH'S PRIDE broke out at the start
brushing TOOSHAY, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing five then four wide, came under urging at the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and tired. TOOSHAY brushed at the start by the aforementioned rival, raced forwardly placed along the rail inside the top pair
through to the midway point on the opening bend before easing off to chased three wide, came under urging half a mile from home and continued three
wide through the far turn, went four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

IRISH JACKSON broke a bit slow then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, angled out under urging early then chased the leader, went two to
three wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, rallied fast to get the lead inside the furlong marker, moved clear into the final sixteenth and
proved much the best under steady urging with her ears pricked late. PRINCESS SONYA came inward just after the start then was corrected by the rider,
sped to a clear advantage, traveled around the turn in the three path, spun four wide into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was
overtaken while clear for the place. WINE GODDESS was hustled from the gate then urged along at the rear, went four then five wide around the turn, came
eight wide into the stretch and just earned the show. MRS BELL was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in
the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch and just missed the show. LA CHANCE broke in at the start, moved out early then was urged along on
the outside, went five then four wide around the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MY GORGEOUS chased the
pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch and tired.

KNOW IT ALL AUDREY went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the three path, showed the way with an uncontested advantage, responded well
when challenged near the three-eighths, shook two rivals in the three path at the five-sixteenths, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker,
had the rider put the crop away outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under a strong hand-ride to the finish. LAY THE GROUNDWORK saved ground
on the first turn, settled off the pace, gained inside early on the far turn, made a bid at the three-eighths, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, came out
four wide into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive in the lane and was second best. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN bumped twice with a rival at the
start, dropped back on the outside then moved in at the rear, rounded the opening bend in the three path, settled at the back, dropped further behind the
leader near the five-eighths, was urged two then three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TO A T
bumped twice with a foe at the start, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, gained to make a
bid in the four path at the three-eighths, dropped back late on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TODAY'S FLAVOR went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the four path around the turn, responded well when
asked for his best in upper stretch, turned back challengers under the crop into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. SHERIFF
BIANCO was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final
furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. AMUNDSON chased the pace, moved out near the half-mile pole, went three wide early on the turn
then shifted five wide, came seven wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. SCOCCIATORE broke
a step slow, was urged along on the outside, brushed with a foe late on the backstretch, went five then six wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. MY BOY TATE dropped back then was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. LOBSTA was
urged along on the inside of a rival, brushed with that foe near the half-mile pole then dropped back while taken in hand, went around the turn in the four
path and faltered.
