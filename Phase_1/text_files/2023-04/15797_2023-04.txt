Footnotes
NIGHT PROOF broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting moderate fractions, was confronted
nearing the quarter marker, turned away UNION GIG and drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, felt pressure from HANS GRUBER inside of the
sixteenth-marker, dug in in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. HANS GRUBER tracked the moderate pace while three deep on the first
turn, was well placed through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, inched closer while three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased NIGHT PROOF
to mid-stretch, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. UNION GIG was prominent into the first turn,
stalked the early pace then advanced to keep close attendance through the backstretch run, pressed NIGHT PROOF to the quarter marker, could not keep
pace with NIGHT PROOF heading to mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. SUGAR
BEETS took back off of the moderate early pace, maintained a two wide path into the second turn while not far back, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied
in the final stages but lacked the needed late response. SPEED GRAZY hesitated at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early running,
saved ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and did not rally.

Footnotes
GET MY POINT was a bit keen in the early running, stalked the moderate fractions from a rail position through the backstretch run, was given her cue
leaving the three-furlong marker, tipped two wide into the stretch, overtook the pacesetter heading to the furlong marker, was kept to steady urging to deep
stretch and held safely in a drive to prevail. SMILE AND PROFILE was allowed to settle in the early going, was well positioned through the backstretch run,
raced three wide into the second turn, slipped to the two path approaching the top of the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in
the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. ROSE ROSE ROSE settled in the second flight in the early stages, saved ground while not far back
through the backstretch run, improved position in upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response and was outclosed for second, while clear at the
finish for third. I'M GONNA SHINE showed early speed and was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the modest pace through the backstretch
run, lost ground on the second turn, drifted out a path nearing the top of the lane, chased in pursuit to mid-stretch and gave way. SWEET TESSA assumed
command leaving the break and set moderate early fractions, was well rated through the backstretch run, extended the lead nearing the quarter marker,
came under pressure nearing mid-stretch, was overtaken by GET MY POINT at the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. LOOKOUT PASS was
allowed to settle, raced three to four wide along the backstretch run, slipped to the two path heading into the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and
did not factor. SILVER FLIRT was unhurried, saved ground to the second turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
NEVER HAD I EVER was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the fast pace into the turn, ran in pursuit of AZOV SEA while two deep on the turn,
overtook that foe in upper stretch, confronted PRACTICAL BID nearing the furlong pole, dueled to the inside of that rival while on the left lead into deep
stretch, took a narrow lead at the sixteenth-marker and determinedly held the runner-up at bay in the final strides to prevail. PRACTICAL BID bobbled
slightly leaving the start, chased the fast pace heading to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, rallied three wide into the stretch, was confronted
by NEVER HAD I EVER nearing the furlong pole, dueled with that rival to deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and just
held for the place at the finish. BRONZE ONE chased the quick early pace, saved ground along the turn, came in tight at the quarter marker and
encountered traffic into upper stretch, shifted out nearing the furlong pole, closed willingly in the late stages and just missed for the win and place, while well
clear of the rest for the show. ANOTHER STRIKE chased the solid early fractions, raced two wide into the turn, was steered four wide for the drive and
lacked a late rally. AZOV SEA broke alertly and showed good early speed, dictated terms to the turn, slowed down the pace heading to the quarter marker,
was collared in upper stretch, tired in the drive and was reported to have bled when pulled up. SMUGGLER'S COVE lacked early speed and did not factor.

Footnotes
CALLHERCONTESSA broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well handled through the backstretch run while carving out moderate fractions, drew
to a clear lead at the half-mile marker, showed the way to the quarter marker while in hand, was asked for more in upper stretch, held foes at bay to the
furlong grounds, was kept to steady urging to deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prove best. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) took back in the early
stages, improved position on the backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn, was steered four wide into the drive, gained ground at mid-stretch,
closed well in the final stages, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and held for second at the finish. SCARABEA was
unhurried in the early running, saved all of the ground to the second turn, was roused at the top of the lane, came in tight at mid-stretch and shifted to the
two path for the final furlong, rallied in deep stretch and just missed for second at the finish, while getting up in time to secure third. PACIFIC ZIP was
forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit of
CALLHERCONTESSA to mid-stretch, could not make headway in the final stages and was outfinished. VRONSKY FEINT settled off of the moderate early
fractions, advanced on the backstretch run, continued that run along the far turn while saving ground, ran evenly to the furlong marker and could not muster
the needed late response.

on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while within aim, overtook ANNA'S MUSIC inside of the furlong marker, switched to the correct lead inside of the
sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final stages to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. DOLCE GHOST chased the quick early pace, raced three wide
along the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong marker, rallied in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final
stages and was up in time to secure second. ANNA'S MUSIC was asked to show early speed, engaged with MOJAVE PRINCESS and dueled with the foe
through fast early fractions, took a narrow lead on MOJAVE PRINCESS in upper stretch and battled to mid-stretch, was overtaken by
GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA inside of the furlong marker, gamely stayed on to deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just holding for third. I'M A
RISQUE GIRL broke in at the start and was green in the early running, lacked speed heading to the turn, saved ground while trailing to the quarter marker,
improved position in upper stretch, finished well in the final stages and just missed for third. ALFONSIA was bothered by FIRST POINT at the start, lost her
path and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early running, saved ground to the quarter marker, angled five wide into the stretch and closed willingly in the
late stages. MOJAVE PRINCESS was prominent in the early running, dueled with ANNA'S MUSIC into the turn, continued that duel to the quarter marker
while setting fast fractions, battled with ANNA'S MUSIC to the furlong marker, could not keep pace with oncoming rivals and gave way in the final stages.
ANGI'S THIRSTY chased the fast early pace, advanced two wide on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker while still within aim and weakened in deep
stretch. FIRST POINT broke in at the start and bothered ALFONSIA, chased the fast early pace, raced three deep on the turn, swung five wide for the drive,
dropped back nearing the furlong marker and did not factor.

CARMEL BY THE SEA was prominent in the early running and tracked the pace into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch
run, kept attendance close attendance to PRINCESA DEL TIGRE to the quarter marker, advanced and confronted that rival in upper stretch, battled to the
furlong marker, dueled to the outside of PRINCESA DEL TIGRE while under steady urging to deep stretch, responded in the final stages and determinedly
won the nod on the wire to prevail. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE broke alertly and dictated terms in the early going, was well rated through the backstretch run
while setting moderate fractions, showed the way to the quarter marker, was confronted by CARMEL BY THE SEA in upper stretch, battled with that rival to
the furlong grounds, kept to task while under firm urging to deep stretch, dueled gamely to the finish and was bested on the wire, while clear of the rest for
second. ISABEL LUDLOW ducked in slightly at the start and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight early on, saved ground through the
backstretch run, was well positioned into the second turn, advanced along the inside in upper stretch, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was
clear at the finish for third. BULLETPROOF TOO came under a tight early hold heading into the first turn, chased the moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn while within aim, lost ground heading to mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. CHEEKIEST
hopped at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early running, trailed through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn,
improved position in upper stretch and closed willingly in the final furlong. SWEET BLUSH stumbled leaving the start and was off slowly, settled off of the
early pace while not far back, advanced along the backstretch run, raced four wide into the far turn, was outrun in the stretch and did not rally. THE RIVER
MANGITA was away in good order, was shuffled back in the early going and settled toward the rear, saved ground into the far turn and did not threaten in
the stretch. GRAZED N' CONFUSED was forwardly placed in the early stages, was a bit keen on the run into the first turn, lost position along the

AUSPICIOUS STYLE was prominent leaving the start, contested the early pace with a host of rivals then took a narrow lead into the backstretch run, set a
pressured pace to the half-mile marker while carving decent fractions, dueled with HARBOR SKY to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, was set
down for the drive at the furlong pole, drew off under firm handling in deep stretch and was hand urged in the final stages as much the best. TWIRLING
DERBY settled in the second flight early on, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn, was coaxed four wide into the
stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to secure second. DEALERS HAND was allowed to settle in the early going, raced
two wide into the second turn, swung five wide into the stretch run, finished evenly in the drive and ran on in deep stretch to secure third. BRONZE
WARRIOR was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace while four deep on the first turn, was steered to the three path and chased the decent
pace through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for
third. HARBOR SKY was prominent in the early running, contested the early pace while three wide on the first turn, disputed the decent fractions through
the backstretch run, dueled with AUSPICIOUS STYLE to the quarter marker, could not match strides with AUSPICIOUS STYLE in upper stretch and faded
in the drive. BROOKYS TAPIT was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running, was
roused two wide along the second turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch, was outrun nearing the furlong grounds
and did not threaten in the final stages. LUCK IS GOLDEN broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, stalked the decent pace from the rail through
the backstretch run, maintained position into the second turn, lost ground at mid-stretch and gave way in the late going. CANYON CREST was unhurried,
saved ground through the backstretch run, trailed into the second turn and did not factor.

JACKS OUTLAW broke alertly, conceded the early lead to CHIEF JACKSON and stalked that rival through decent fractions to the half-mile marker,
advanced two wide nearing the quarter pole, collared the pacesetter in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, was kept to task to deep
stretch and drew away in the final stages to be much the best. HOLY GHOST was shuffled back leaving the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle in
the early running, improved position three wide on the second turn, swung five wide into the drive, made a steady gain to mid-stretch, could not close into
the winner's margin in the final stages and was best of the rest. CHIEF JACKSON was prominent in the early running, was sent to establish the lead into the
first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, was collared by JACKS OUTLAW in upper stretch, chased
that rival to the furlong grounds, tired in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. POUR ON THE COLE chased the
decent early pace from the inside, saved ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and did not offer a late rally. LIL MIRACLE MAN was a bit
rank in the early running, chased the pacesetter from a two wide path into the backstretch run, slipped to the rail and saved ground into the far turn,
advanced nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid to the furlong pole, could not sustain that rally in the final stages and weakened. MAGIC TIGER
stumbled leaving the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, was
steered five wide into the stretch and did not factor. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) was forwardly placed into the first turn, chased the pace while four wide
heading into the backstretch run, made a steady gain along the backstretch run and into the second turn, came within aim while four wide nearing the
quarter marker, was outrun in the drive and gave way. ROISTER stalked the decent early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained
position to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide on the second turn, could not keep pace heading into the drive and came up empty in the final stages.

Footnotes
BIG SIS LITTLE SIS broke well, was always traveling well and up close, kept to the inside through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch to challenge
GOLDEN PRAYER for the lead while still in hand, responded when roused mid-stretch, quickened away and won as the rider pleased. TESSA (GB) got
squeezed a few strides out of the gate, fell back early but kept in the clear to the outside, began a sustained rally from the half mile pole, circled the field four
wide through the turn to get into contention then swung five wide turning for home and continued the rally down the lane to gain second while racing on the
wrong lead. MAGIC CHROME broke well, briefly had the early advantage then allowed GOLDEN PRAYER to take over the lead, raced in the middle of a
trio of chasers through the turn, made a brief bid, was unable to match strides with the top two, kept to task and held third. JERSEY SUNSET broke best but
ceded the lead down the backstretch, gradually worked over to the two path, came into the stretch with a chance but was unable to find another gear and
finished evenly. BOBBY'S GENIE off a step slow and outrun early, was prompted to keep pace early, made a sustained bid through the turn, was behind
horses to mid-stretch, angled out for room, and finished up with some interest to improve position. GOLDEN PRAYER broke broke in and forced TESSA
(GB) into the path of BREVILLE, sped to the front and opened up a clear lead heading into the turn, held sway when challenged, dueled to mid-stretch, was
no match when the winner quickened away and faded in the late stages. STORMY ROUGE was pushed to join the early mix, got inside and saved ground
through the turn, briefly loomed a threat but stalled under pressure while racing greenly. FIVE O COCKTAIL broke well, was close up but very wide through
the turn, made a mild bid five wide from the three furlong marker but began to lose ground from the five sixteenths and was outfinished down the stretch.
SWALL outrun from the break, fell back to last early, kept to task and managed to pick off a few down the stretch. ROSE OF MOONCOIN had good position
early, struggled to keep up through the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch. DRINK AND A WINK broke well and was up close through the first
quarter mile then began to fall back, stopped, and was not persevered with from that point. BREVILLE got put in a tight spot after the break by TESSA (GB)
, had to take up, rushed up to rejoin the field down the backstretch, came under a hard ride near the three eighths pole and was never a factor.
