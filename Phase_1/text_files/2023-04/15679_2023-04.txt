Footnotes
FOOLISH DREAMS unhurried in the beginning, racing in the back, made a steady gain, rallied from the outside and drove clear before the wire. GENERAL
EISENHOWER raced four wide around the first turn, moved up, took the lead at the 3/4 pole, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second.
GOTTATAKEHIMTO lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. MONITOR MILLS vied for the early lead, forwardly
placed throughout and faded. HOPE FOR CHANGE raced in the back of the pack early and passed tired ones. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER pressed the pace,
saved ground around the final turn and was finished early. STONE ALLIANCE raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. JOEY'S LIGHTENING
raced within contention and dropped back. THE THREE KS flashed brief speed, saved ground and stopped.

contention, but proved no match for the top two. REMEMBERIN RONALD broke poorly, racing near the back, quickly moved up, but lacked a late kick.
SCARLET STORM lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. TIME TO CLOSE raced near the middle of the field and finished evenly.

Footnotes
HOLY BAYOU broke sharp, challenged near the front end, pulled away down the stretch and proved much the best. COMANCHE WARRIOR raced within
striking distance, made a late bid, was no match for the winner, but held on the second. GOLDENLUTE unhurried in the beginning, raced outside around the
turn, made a wide bid and missed second. HOOSIER lacked lacked early speed and was never a threat. GEAUX SUGAR went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground and faded. ALL OF US void of early speed and showed little.
