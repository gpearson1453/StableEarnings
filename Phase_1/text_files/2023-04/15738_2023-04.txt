Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE moved forward and shifted in to set the pace inside but just off the rail while attended by an outside foe, was further engaged by
that one coming to the midpoint of the far turn, dueled inside, drifted out gradually through the stretch bumping that rival lightly just past the eighth pole while
edging away late. COSMIC TREASURE pressed from outside about three wide, forced the issue at the five-sixteenths, was carried out in the stretch and
bumped lightly in the vicinity of the furlong grounds and was outfinished. NOT VERY GENTLE raced between rivals in the second flight two to three wide
through the early going, began to drop back heading toward the far turn, swung eight wide for the stretch run and closed willingly to secure show honors.
FORT RIDGE settled outside foes mid-pack three to four wide, continued well off the inside on the far turn in pursuit of the leading pair swinging five wide
into upper stretch, ran on evenly and made no bid. IRISH MAJOR tracked from inside the second flight, came out a bit on the far turn before moving back in,
ran evenly and made no bid. HONEST TO GOODNESS trailed racing near the inside and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF COSMIC TREASURE AGAINST MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS
TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
CHIEF MYSTIQUE was forwardly-placed early chasing in behind the leaders, gradually dropped back three wide into and on the turn, swung out seven
deep for the top of the stretch, rallied and surged past late. DURANGO CHROME broke awkwardly and slowly, steadily advanced three wide up the
backstretch into the turn, came out a bit for the drive still advancing on the leaders, bid past the eighth pole, dueled and defeated the dueling partner but
was outkicked by the aforementioned. STAN THE CAMERAMAN moved forward to duel inside a rival but off the rail, put that one away then faced a new
outside challenger past the quarter pole, quickly dispatched that rival, lugged out a bit in mid-stretch and was engaged by yet another foe, was outfinished
by that one and outkicked by the winner. CALICO JOE was bumped at the break, shifted in settling off the pace, came out to the three path leaving the turn,
gained willingly in the lane. C F V NOBODYCARES switched off the inside, raced outside foes four deep into the turn, swung nine wide turning for home,
kicked on mildly. SUPER CITRO appeared to false break then bumped a rival at the start, was encouraged forward pursuing the leaders three to four wide,
made a swift advance leaving the turn to make a brief and mild bid at the top of the stretch, came in a bit in upper stretch and could not sustain the effort.
LOOKING SALTY had the early lead under urging just briefly, steadily retreated. HOUR CAT forced the pace from outside, dueled three wide into the turn,
faltered and faded.

Footnotes
TEE BURNS moved forward rapidly inside to take the lead outside the five-eighths, was put to hand urging while clear in upper stretch, given a single tap of
a left-handed crop for encouragement past the furlong marker then more hand-urging and some waving of the crop to hold safe. RACARINO shifted in and
tracked in behind off the leading pair two wide, moved out four wide turning for home, kept on under urging to close the gap but was only second best.
ROCKET HOTSHOT settled at the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, came a bit wider for the drive, gained late but was no threat to the top pair.
TALKTOEACHOTHER pursued from outside off the leading pair, went four wide on the turn, was floated out seven wide turning for home by a drifting rival
and ran on without late impact. T J MUNNINGS switched off the rail, raced last but one in the two to three path, failed to menace. SNOWMOBILE was urged
clear at the break, had the lead just briefly then continued to chase outside the eventual winner two to three wide, drifted six deep turning for home and gave
way.

I'M YOUR CAPTAIN brushed a foe lightly at the break, moved forward to take command and set the pace inside, was clear heading into the turn, came out
a bit in late stretch while being kept to the task and was well clear. DASH TO THE CASH settled off the pace shifting in, went two to three wide on the turn,
angled five wide turning for home with room at the quarter pole, kicked on to be second best while no threat to the winner. A P BLAZING GREEN was urged
at the break but quickly overtaken, chased three to four wide, drifted out a bit turning for home then lugged in slightly, fought on and held show honors. MAN
ON ATTACK was lightly brushed at the start, pressed the early pace, continued the pursuit two to three wide, drifted in and out through the stretch and
needed more late. J J'S SOLUTION settled at the rear, swung out turning for home, shifted inside foes once in upper stretch and rean on. MEDAL KING
shifted in and made an early advance to be close up off the leaders late up the backstretch, was one-paced thereafter and flattened out. SILVER CHILLER
chased from outside four to five wide on the turn, veered nine wide leaving that bend and faded.

Footnotes
BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER settled at the rear, switched off the rail about the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, bid outside in
mid-stretch, edged clear under urging. OVERBEARING was urged clear from the break, shifted in and set the pace near but just off the rail, jumped abruptly
coming past the quarter pole, met a challenger's bid and brushed with that one but could not kick on with the top foe. HATCHET CREEK tracked in behind,
saved ground inside on the turn, moved out a path leaving that bend, bid in mid-stretch, exchanged a light brush soon after and evened out. IRISH TUFF
moved forward when coaxed into an early advance three wide, continued to press three then four wide on the turn, began weakening while drifting six wide
into upper stretch and faded thereafter. MITZRAYIM moved forward outside a rival four deep in the early stages then just as quickly eased back off the
leaders, failed to rally. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND settled off the pace, was close up four wide on the turn, carried out seven wide coming out of that bend
and faded.

Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE was urged clear and shifted in, set the pace inside, held sway under steady handling. SNOOTY stalked the eventual winner two
wide and within range, was only second best. COUGER was held up on heels and switched outside a rival past the five-eighths, went two to three wide on
the turn, moved back nearer the rail for the drive and gained willingly. FANCY EMPRESS raced outside four to five wide through the turn mid-pack, drifted in
a bit in upper stretch and ran on. WATCHIN THE WHEELS brushed a rival lightly at the start, settled off the pace, entered the turn two wide, moved out four
wide by the end of that bend, came out a bit further in upper stretch and had decent late stride but needed more. NO NANNETTE NO chased the leaders,
dropped back three wide on the turn, failed to rally. TAP N TWINE was lightly brushed at the break, settled at the back, swung six wide, was never near
enough to threaten. RANK AND FILE was very rambunctious behind the gate and hard to load, chased briefly inside on or just off the rail, came up empty.
PER RULING #HAW-2023-1262 FROM THE ILLINOIS RACING COMMISSION, APOLLO U ANYWHERE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED
DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

RUSSIAN ALPHABET attended the pace from outside going three then four wide on the turn, took over at the quarter pole, was clear soon after under some
urging, held sway. PRIZE FIGHTER stalked in behind the leading trio racing in the three path into the turn, came out four wide turning for home then altered
inside the leader for room, continued to move in through the lane and ran on but was only second best. VERRAZANOINTHESKY exchanged a very light
brush at the break and was in just a hair tight, settled at the rear three to four wide into the turn, kicked on well to gain show honors while no threat to the top
pair. U S HONOUR NAP chased from mid-pack, was encouraged along from the two path on the turn, came out five wide at the top of the stretch and ran
on. ALL OVER OLIVER exchanged a very light brush at the break, settled off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, tipped out six wide for the
drive, needed more. MODAZZLE exchanged a light bump at the break, lacked early speed despite some early encouragement, raced off the rail into the
turn going two to three deep through that bend, angled out in the stretch for room and finished up willingly. VALIANTLY DISCREET exchanged a light bump
at the break, was coaxed forward to press then vie for the lead inside, came up empty in the lane. HURTS SO BAD was urged at the start, set a pressured
pace, dueled two wide on the turn, began to weaken in upper stretch, was in a bit tight near mid-stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
DREAM KEEPER moved forward and clear to set the pace, faced moderate outside pressure early up the backstretch racing on or just off the rail, moved
clear heading into the far turn, given urging in upper stretch and held safe under just moderate hand-urging late as the wire neared. PROTONIC POWER
was bumped at the break then urged forward while shifting in, raced along the rail early on the first turn before switching out late on that bend, advanced two
then three wide heading into the far turn, drifted out a bit through the stretch and under stout urging closed the gap but couldn't reach the winner. BANDIT
SWANSON raced off the pace two wide into the first turn, moved to the rail about the five-eighths, advanced inside up the backstretch, was in a bit tight and
steadied slightly coming to the quarter pole, had room in upper stretch and ran on to gain show honors inside SILVER QUARTERS, who broke inwardly,
was unhurried bringing up the rear racing off the rail, shifted out more while advancing on the far turn coming four wide to the top of the stretch, evened out
and lost show honors late. EDITOR IN CHIEF was forwardly-placed three to five wide early, steadily dropped back three to four wide and continued to
weaken. LAVENDER EARL bumped a rival at the start, raced up close two to four wide, applied some pressure early up the backstretch, dropped back
three then two wide on the far turn and came up empty.

QUEEN IN THE NORTH settled off the leaders to stalk mid-pack, went three wide on the turn, struck the lead inside a rival in upper stretch, was quickly
clear, held safe under just moderate urging. BELLS OF JOY settled toward the back racing off the inside, came into upper stretch five wide, kicked on well
late to get up for place over. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC , who was encouraged along mid-pack chasing from inside, kept on in the lane but was outfinished for
second. SEQUAYA settled off the pace racing outside foes, came into the stretch seven deep and ran on evenly to improve. HEY MA was urged at the
break, moved forward to vie inside, was clear entering the turn, drifted out on the bend coming five wide to the top of the stretch and had no extra for the
drive. EVIE saved ground racing inside early on the turn, improved position. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER was in a bit tight at the start and shuffled back,
settled at the rear, passed tired foes. FROST WARRIOR stalked four wide just off the leading pair, floated six wide into upper stretch and had no late kick.
OCEAN HONEY vied outside a rival two to three deep, came up empty.
