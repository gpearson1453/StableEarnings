Footnotes
SANURA established the front from the get go, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE stumbled at the start pawing the
ground before being able to get upright, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick running on willingly to the finish. NEW GINYA just off the inside tracking the front from near the rear of the field, remained on hold until let out
angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. SILKEN DOLLAR tracked the pace along the inside under patient handling until set
down tipped three wide into upper stretch, then kept on under a drive to the finish but was out-finished. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS forwardly placed three
wide through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. CURLY GIRL grew keen pulling under restraint just after the start along the inside and brushed the temporary rail near seven and a half
furlongs to run, tracked along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AMANDA'S FOLLY stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, turned up the pressure in the three path around the turn, was given her cue late on that
bend, took the lead into upper stretch, inched clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging. BRAVO REGINA was corrected with the left rein at
the start, established a good position just off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole,
chased the winner in the stretch and finished with good courage for the place. HANDLE THE TRUTH was forwardly placed on the outside, went around the
turn in the four path, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased the winner while outside in the drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show.
AFILADA broke out and bumped with a foe then was corrected by the rider, settled under some urging, went three wide around most of the turn then moved
to the four path, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under the crop while outside into the final furlong and gained mildly but missed the
trifecta. TEKILA was hustled from the outside post, angled in while going to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, was put to
increased pressure in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. IN
TRAFFIC was well spotted just off the pace, steadied off heels inside the half-mile pole, went two then three wide around the turn and came up empty.
JOEY THE FISH was bumped at the start and forced out, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch
then moved further out and was no factor. WICKED LADY sat back at the start and was off slow then taken up, spotted the front several lengths, saved
ground on the turn, remained on her inside lead in upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LOVE APPEALS chased just off the inside from just off the pace down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under light coaxing and
tipping back to the two path at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command three-sixteenths from home, then
drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages. SWEETLOU'SGOTACES chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive proving no match for the top one while just holding on for
the place honors on the wire over a flanking pair. GEORGEES SPIRIT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and ran on to just miss for the place honors while up to secure the show honors. SENIOR PRANK crossed directly to the three path
after the start growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch and ran on to miss for the place and show honors. FANCY AZTECA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, cut
the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in and was collared a furlong out, weakened through to the finish. CHASING AFTER YOU coaxed from the start,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
FABULOUSLY FUNNY chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and tired.

BE UP pulled under restraint into the first turn, raced in the four path on that bend, was rated just off the pace on the outside, ranged up three to four wide
on the final turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the advantage into upper stretch then kicked clear and proved best under steady urging. LINNY
KATE was hard held in the three path around the first turn, raced outside under reserve but with cover, moved out from behind cover near the half-mile pole,
was roused four to five wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner to the finish and just got up for the place. ERIN'S
ENTHUSIASM went to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner into
upper stretch, chased that foe into the final furlong, kept on in pursuit into the final sixteenth and just lost the place while clear for the show. MARIAH'S
FORTUNE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand after leaving chute, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was roused near the three-eighths,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. GIRL'S ON FIRE was taken under a snug hold early then rated in the two path,
went two to three wide while let out on the final turn, bumped with a foe outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick.
FORTY SMOOTH tugged her way forward while keen under tight restraint, rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked outside of the leader, was let out
in the two to three path on the far turn, dropped back between foes at the five-sixteenths, bumped with a rival while crowded and dropping out of contention
outside the quarter-pole then capitulated. MORE MANGO was bumped at the start, dropped back while taken in hand nearing the first turn then angled in,
saved ground towards the back, came off the rail under urging around the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.
KEEN DANCER broke out and bumped with a foe, dropped well behind early, saved ground on both turns and was no factor.

JAKE ROCKS displayed good speed, showed the way on the inside of a foe, moved clear at the nine-sixteenths, controlled the action while inside on the
turn, responded well when set down in the two path into upper stretch, maintained a length advantage into the final furlong and held under strong urging.
MILTON THE MONSTER bumped with a foe just after the start, settled off the pace, was roused late on the backstretch, went three then four wide around
the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out, was carried out between that point and the eighth-pole, chased outside in the final furlong
and finished willingly to garner the place. NUCLEAR OPTION stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the three
path around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was outfinished while able to get the show. THINKABOUTIT pressed the pace on
the outside of the leader, chased that foe late on the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, came out significantly into upper stretch and just
missed the show. CHARLIE FIVE O tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, was urged four wide around the turn then
driven five wide at the quarter-pole, drifted out while chasing the winner in upper stretch, pursued that foe into the final furlong and weakened. LAFITTE'S
FLEET settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. LOST IN ROME bumped with a rival shortly after the start,
brushed with a foe near the three-quarter pole, settled in a good position, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and came
up empty. GLORY ROAD brushed with a rival under coaxing near the three-quarter pole, passed the nine-sixteenths under stronger encouragement, saved
ground on the turn and was no factor. RUSSIAN TO WIN dropped back then settled near the rear on the outside, traveled five wide around the turn, spun
six wide into the stretch then moved further out and faltered.

Footnotes
PAROS settled nicely off the pace, went three wide early on the turn then shifted to the five path, rallied outside to take the lead in upper stretch and edged
clear under steady urging. BOBBY THE TANK went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked
outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while just able to get the place. THUNDERIAN bumped
with a rival at the start, angled out inside the three-quarter pole, was urged along on the outside, went five then six wide around the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, drifted in some around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show.
PLAYINGWITHMATCHES was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. WINNING CONNECTION broke out and bumped hard with a foe, dropped well behind, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.
ROL AGAIN DANCER bumped with foes on both sides at the start then was hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide around the
turn and tired. AMERICAN GRANT bumped hard with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. SORPRESO had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, climbed badly early then angled to the
outside, dropped from six to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MAMA'S GOLD broke out and bumped with a rival
then was hustled, established a good position just off the pace, saved ground on the turn and faltered.
