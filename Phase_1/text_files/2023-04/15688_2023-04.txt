Footnotes
TUCKER THE GRUMP unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the turn, racing five wide, rallied down the stretch and was going away. MULETRAIN
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, finished inside, proved no match for the winner, but held on for place. PAC THE PULPIT lacked early speed,
made a steady gain and was outfinished for second. MO HAWK MAN raced within striking distance, finished wide down the stretch and was outfinished for
show. ONE MORE SLEEP pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and weakened. SEXY IN THE GRASS broke poorly, racing in the rear and was
never a threat. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY went to the front, drove clear and was finished early. HARD KINGS raced within striking distance, dropped back and
was no threat late.

START WELL unhurried in the early going, moved up, racing four wide around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. BRI raced near the
back in the beginning, came around the second turn five wide, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. CRIDER CHASE vied
for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was no match for the top two. DAVE'S RONDA pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn
and was outfinished for third. LUCKY DEAL was bumped and forced out around the first turn, racing within striking distance, moved up around the second
turn and faded down the stretch. KAITLYN'S COURT drifted out and bumped rival around the first turn, raced near the back and was never a factor. LADY
CHURCHILL dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final turn and was finished early. ST MARIA trailed throughout and showed little.

TIME TO MOVE raced within striking distance, moved up between rivals down the home stretch, dueled to the wire with OUT MAKING TREBLE and
prevailed for the win. OUT MAKING TREBLE lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the turn, dueled to the wire and was outfinished for the
win. TAPIT TO THE LINE was an early factor, made a bid, took the lead and lacked a late kick. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE raced in the middle of the field,
saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and finished evenly. WILDCARD GOLD raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, showed late interest,
but was no real factor. SASSI ASPEN lacked early speed and passed tired ones late. LONG ARROW raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
WHISKEY GENT hopped at the start, rushed up, came around the turn on the outside and faded. PRODUCTION TIME void of early speed, moved up and
faded late. JOHNNY JUDE lacked early speed and showed little. CATINANDSCATIN went to the front, drove clear and retreated to the rear.
