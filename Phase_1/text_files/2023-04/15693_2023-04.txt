Footnotes
SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND bumped with HIS ROYAL G soon after the break, stalked the pace down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, found
ample room along the inner rail to sweep to command in upper stretch then drew out. OPEN THE BOOKS , a forward factor in the three path on the turn,
chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened. NOTION TO TAPIT lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through out and rallied mildly. PATRIOTIC PARTY ,
unhurried down the backstretch, lost ground on the turns, was five deep in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. HE ROLLS , four deep chasing the pace
around the turn, gave way. THRUSTER broke slowly and was outrun. HIS ROYAL G bumped with the winner soon after the break, showed speed in the two
path inside horses around the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ARISTOCAT cleared soon after the break and set a rated pace just off the inside, secured the rail taking pressure leaving the far turn, staved off two outside
challenges entering the lane, responded when set down leaving the quarter pole, opened up under solid left handed ask in mid stretch and was kept to
pressure through the final seventy yards. MAJESTIC FRONTIER , four wide outside rivals prompting the early pace, applied more pressure three deep mid
turn, forced the issue under asking into the lane, failed to kick on with the winner past the quarter pole, drifted in a bit and gave willing pursuit to be well clear
of the rest. DESPITE ODDS , three wide attending the early pace, bid between foes leaving the far turn, was under coaxing to hold position into the stretch,
failed to go on in mid stretch and faded. NEVER CHANGE hesitated at the break, dropped in and rushed after a quarter mile, stalked the early issue, angled
three wide leaving the far turn, was under a hearty ride mid turn but came up empty. COUSIN BOB saved ground around the turn and faded. CALL ME
MAESTRO , taken to rate early while three wide, circled four wide under a ride into the lane, lacked a punch and gave way through the final three sixteenths
of a mile.

Footnotes
DON'T TELL DEREN got involved with a pace battle to the inside of THENCOMEMORNING around the first turn, eased back off of that one near the far
turn, angled out and came back to rebid with five sixteenths remaining, secured command into the lane and eagerly drew away under a solid drive.
DUNDER BOSS lagged back off the dueling leaders while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch and kept on with some interest to gain the place.
THENCOMEMORNING disputed the pace outside the winner, shook clear into the far turn, was re engaged leaving the three eighths, ceded the advantage
into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. IRISH LACE , four wide into the first turn, settled outside a rival as the pace scrum went on up front,
took closer order under coaxing heading to the far turn, reached a striking spot past the three eighths, failed to kick on nearing the lane and gave way.
PRUSSIAN BLUE lagged back off the duel while removed from the rail, was under urging around the final turn and failed to respond. GRASS CUTTER
saved ground and faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
BERKS set a pressured pace along the inner rail, opened up in hand entering the stretch, was put to the whip near the eighth pole and eagerly pulled away.
WHAT DOES IT TAKE stalked the pace, moved up three deep to loom turning for home, was no match for the winner and held the place. HARDSPUN
REASON lacked speed, entered the stretch in the three path and passed tired horses. FOLE'S NOTION lacked speed, advanced in the four path turning for
home and lacked the necessary late effort. ROYAL NUMBER , a forward factor four deep leaving the turn, gave way. BATON lacked speed, hugged the
inner rail on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. REMEMBERING WILBUR , along the inner rail around the turn, steadied lacking room in upper
stretch and was eased. DOLICE VITA bobbled at the break, prompted the pace outside the winner, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
WONDRWHERECRAIGIS was kept well off the rail early while disputing the pace inside BORRACHO, dropped down a few paths into the turn, battled two
wide past the five sixteenths, shook clear under strong handling inside the sixteenth pole, had his rider rise up a bit for a stride or two in deep stretch then
grittily prevailed. WITTY , off the early pace while between rivals, took closer order three wide into the lane, advanced between runners near mid stretch,
worked outward for a clear run inside the sixteenth marker, closed gamely under pressure and just missed. BORRACHO , five wide outside the winner early
on, battled in the three path outside that one around the turn and to mid stretch, failed to match strides from there and gave way grudgingly. CHATEAU , in
hand prompting to the inside of the dueling leaders, moved through around the turn to challenge, rated back off the pace near the quarter pole, swung out
five wide to pursue then came up empty in the final furlong. WHISKEY AND YOU , off the duel, came three wide for the drive, had belated action but failed
to menace. NOBLE GASTON broke a step slow, recovered and edged up about five wide early, drafted in some and chased four wide past the five
sixteenths, shifted out, lacked a kick past mid stretch and faded. WAR TOCSIN , off the pace, angled very wide for the drive but lacked a significant
response. HUNTER JOE saved ground with some early pursuit then gave way.

ALL THREES hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace, asserted himself turning for home, drew away and was under brisk urging in mid stretch.
FRIGHTLAND stalked the pace in the two path around the turn, angled to the three path near the quarter pole and lacked the necessary rally. CROSSLAND
lacked speed, swung to the six path at the head of the stretch and rallied outside horses. GALLANT GOLD stumbled at the start, circled foes four wide
around the turn, was fanned five wide by CAPTAIN QUIINT entering the stretch and flattened out. SHADY MUNNI disputed the pace outside the winner to
the stretch then faded. JARDANI , outrun, raced along the inner rail in the stretch. CAPTAIN QUINT , in the three path around the turn chasing the winner,
drifted four wide turning for home and faltered. MR JEFFERSON was outrun.

Footnotes
MID DAY IMAGE settled nicely off the leaders and in the clear, angled five wide with momentum into the lane, straightened away and forged to command
outside rivals in mid stretch, responded to left handed asks and drew clear. KADRI , in the clear stalking the pace, shifted four wide for the drive, moved up
to challenge between runners in mid stretch, failed to match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth, kept on willingly and narrowly saved the place.
BOAT'S A ROCKIN prompted the pace while saving ground, advanced to the inside of rivals past mid stretch and churned on with interest. PYRON drafted
back off the pace, shifted five wide for the drive and offered up a belated bid. BACKNTHEWOODS tracked the pace three wide, bid to challenge mid turn,
took a short lead into the stretch, failed to hold off challengers and faded late. DEFEND sped to the front, set the pace two wide, was joined past mid turn,
battled into the lane then weakened near mid stretch. NO SABE NADA dropped off the early pace and failed to generate a response.
