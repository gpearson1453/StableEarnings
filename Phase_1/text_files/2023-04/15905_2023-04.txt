Footnotes
OF GOOD REPORT lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and was up late. THICK HAZE stalked
the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied and gained a brief lead but could not resist the winner late.
CIBERTRUCK chased the leaders from between foes, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. N. K. ROCKET MAN sprinted to a long
lead soon after the start and gave way through the final furlong. MONGOL ALTAI showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and
failed to rally. POLITICAL RIOT was off a step slow, raced just off the leaders from the inside and gave way after going three-quarters. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT
was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

I'LL TAKE THE SOUP sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. BOOSICAL LADY
broke sharply to chase the winner throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. MAKARA was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. SMART LEAH lacked early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. DANGERELLA was off slow, lagged early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. WAYWARD
STORM raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ROLINGA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards. GIANNA'S
WILD CAT sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late.
MOONSHINE MOXY chased the leaders while racing four-wide, could not reach the leaders late but finished with a steady bid. WRIGHT WINGED was
forwardly placed early, checked nearing the half-mile pole, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. MISCHIEF MAMA raced off the
pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. TIZ TENACIOUS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not
threaten. NO KITTEN was never far back, raced three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. PALACE STAR lagged early, raced seven-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. THATSALOTOFBLING lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
