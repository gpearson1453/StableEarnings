Footnotes
JETOVATOR tossed his head and got bumped leaving the gate, stalked in hand early, bid two wide around the turn, took over at the top of the stretch,
inched ahead from TOOK CHARGE, maintained a short lead into deep stretch and lasted in the closing moments. REDLINE raced at the back on the inside,
tipped two wide exiting the bend, moved out further at the top of the stretch, closed late three deep but could not get by the winner. SOUTHERN HORSE
(ARG) unhurried in the beginning, raced outside a rival and two wide into and around the bend, steered out in upper stretch, launched a late bid and got
edged for the place honors four deep at the wire. TOOK CHARGE bumped with JETOVATOR at the start, cleared and crossed over, challenged by that
same rival around the turn, relinquished the lead at the top of the stretch, fought back from inside through the lane and stayed on to the wire while getting
outfinished. CREW DRAGON tracked off the rail then outside a rival, rounded the bend two wide and finished willingly while needing to find that needed late
kick. COMMANDER (FR) settled inside, coaxed along through the turn and flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
VIRASANA broke alertly from outside, pressed the pace up the backstretch, took over past the three-eighths pole, put away APPLE FEST approaching the
quarter pole, roused at the top of the lane and widened when flagged with the whip, then coasted in nearing the wire. CONQUISTAR settled off the pace,
entered the turn two wide, coaxed around the bend then had to pause when trying to go between runners near the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into
the stretch and finished willingly to best the rest. RUBY NELL stalked the top pair up the backstretch, ridden along from the rail then two wide into the stretch
and could not produce a bid. APPLE FEST went up to take control and set the pace with VIRASANA to the outside, was overtaken by that rival past the
three-eighths pole, could not keep up with that rival with a quarter mile left to run and faded in the lane. COLLECTMYTHOUGHTS was off slow and bumped
in the beginning, moved into range off the rail, took the turn three wide and weakened. DUCHESSOFBAYRIDGE bumped with inner rival at the start, raced
greenly while reserved early, saved ground through the turn, came out in upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN bobbled and broke in a bit leaving the gate, tracked two wide in hand at the back into the turn, angled widest across the dirt to
launch a bid five deep, dueled with AIR FORCE RED in the final sixteenth and dug in to edge the runner-up. AIR FORCE RED stalked the pace two wide
into the turn, bid from outside around the bend and three wide into the stretch, bumped at the three-sixteenths pole, fought through the lane and carried a
narrow lead into deep stretch, dueled to the wire but was edged in the closing moments. INDIAN PEAK was off a bit slow in the beginning, stalked along the
rail, launched a bid from the fence in upper stretch, reached the front at the eighth pole but faltered in deep stretch. BURNIN TURF got put in a bit tight early
next to the outer rail, tracked three wide around the turn, put in mild bid four wide entering the stretch but flattened in the late stages. SUNRISE JOURNEY
broke well to establish the front quickly, showed the way along the inside into the turn, got pressured by AIR FORCE RED around the bend, dueled two wide
into the lane and bumped with that rival at the three-sixteenths pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.

PRINCIP chased off the inside, went two wide into the turn, angled out around the bend while gaining ground, spun five wide into the stretch, dueled with
EVER A REBEL late and dug in for the victory. EVER A REBEL stumbled leaving the gate but was still away quickest, stalked three wide into the turn, took
aim four wide into the drive, gained the lead with a furlong remaining, dueled with PRINCIP in the final sixteenth and was bested in the end. MOR TEQUILA
was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, challenged two then three wide around the bend, gained the lead in upper stretch but was soon overtaken by
EVER A REBEL at the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. BRAZEN BULL took control early from inside, met the bid from MOR TEQUILA on the turn,
dueled two wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOTORCADE was off slow to begin, steered to the inside
while off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and never threatened. AMERICAN LIVIN was off slow to begin, raced two wide then near the inside into the
stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
KISS MY KAT took control early while pressured from outside, kicked clear from CAL on the turn, roused in lane and remained comfortably in front under
hand urging to the wire. SILENT BEAUTY chased four wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, finished willingly through the drive but was no match
for the winner. JORDAN chased between briefly then dropped back off the pace, rounded the bend three then four wide, kept on through the drive and held
off inner rivals for the show. SHEMAKESCENTS chased along the inside, lost ground around the bend, remained along the fence into the drive and missed
the show. LASTING LOVE was off slow in the beginning, raced along the rail into the turn, exited three wide, showed a mild response and got outfinished
between rivals for the show. CAL bumped with outer rival at the start, pressed the pace from outside early, failed to keep up with the winner into the turn,
chased three then two wide around the bend, drifted out in upper stretch and faded. IT'S SAUL RIGHT bumped with CAL at the start then dropped back,
trailed three wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ZZYZX was off slow and bumped in the beginning, raced near the back into the turn, was on the move passing rivals from outside and loomed four wide
entering the stretch, took over midstretch under left-handed urging and kicked clear. BOGINSKAYA raced near the back of the pack into the turn, angled to
the rail then steered back out into the drive, moved back to the fence in the lane and rallied to gain the place. COPPER BO TEN bumped with outer rival
leaving the gate, went up to prompt the pace from inside, lost contact with the leader leaving the backstretch, re-engaged from the rail on the turn and took
over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the lane, was overtaken by the winner in midstretch and was outfinished for second. STAY IN LINE stalked
from inside then had to steady entering the turn, lacked room coming up next to COPPER BO TEN near the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch and
kept on for a minor award. CHEVY GIRL broke inward, angled out while rushing up into range, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, could not stay on
with the leader into the lane and weakened. CLASSY CANDY sat off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out in the drive and failed to
menace. SHAMBALA GIRL was off slow and veered in at the start, trailed from inside then two wide into the lane and was not a factor. TIME TOGETHER
set the pace under pressure early then cleared past the half-mile pole, challenged from both sides around the turn and lost command past the
five-sixteenths pole and retreated in the lane. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM raced up close early, chased two wide into the turn, four wide into the lane and came
up empty.

Footnotes
ROSIE FORECAST dueled for the lead from inside early then ceded command and stalked through the middle stages, re-engaged PALACSINTA midway
around the far turn, took over past the quarter pole, drew clear into the stretch, met the bid from TIMELY LUCK with a furlong left to run, drifted out late and
gamely prevailed. TIMELY LUCK tracked outside a rival early, asked three then four wide on the far turn, drew alongside the winner in upper stretch, kept
the pressure on through the final furlong while drifting out some and could not get by. IDESSIA broke a step slow then settled inside, ridden along while
steered off the rail to entered the stretch three wide, finished well in the furlong grounds and but ran out of time. CANDY ON TOP moved inside and took a
stalking position, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, stayed within striking in the lane but finished evenly late. BETSY IS THE CODE was off slow in the
beginning, raced two wide near the back, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. ELA CALIMERA MOU stumbled leaving
the gate, trailed on the inside into the first turn, went outside a rival in the two path on the second bend and improved position. YVETT'S SURPRISE raced
three then two wide around the first turn off the pace, had to steady approaching the half-mile pole, went two wide into the far turn, four wide into the lane
and failed to rally. TAPIT ROCKS raced two wide at the back outside a rival, moved closer three deep on the far turn, moved out around the bend and came
six wide into the stretch and weakened. PALACSINTA dueled from outside into the first turn, cleared inner rival and showed the way up the backstretch, was
challenged midway through the far turn, lost command past the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY was off a bit slow and bumped leaving the gate, settled inside, moved out and looked to rally on the far turn but ran into traffic, had
to steer six wide into the lane, rallied from outside and dueled with ECONOMICAL in deep stretch and dug in to win the photo. ECONOMICAL forwardly
placed while moving inside early, came off the rail and started to pull on the clubhouse turn, remained off the rail to the second bend, took aim four wide into
the drive, took over in upper stretch, dueled with CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY in the final sixteenth and lost the narrow photo. BIG SWEDE chased along the
rail then drifted out on the clubhouse turn and pulled the rider up behind the leaders around the bend, stalked the top trio into the far turn, lacked room
around the bend and upper stretch, gained a clear path with a furlong to go and finished willingly for the show. MISSED CALL vied three deep through both
turns, led three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. CARELESS KITTEN got bumped inside at the start,
settled in the two path, rallied while angling five wide on the far turn, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered. DIVINE FEMININE vied inside a pair of rivals
for command, lost touch with a quarter mile left to run and weakened in the drive. CRYPTO MUNNY raced off the rail early then got floated out around the
clubhouse turn, entered the stretch six wide and failed to menace. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY vied between rivals to the quarter pole, could not keep up into
the stretch and faded in the lane. GUARDSMAN PASS stumbled leaving the gate and never got involved.

Footnotes
KEEN TO GO settled inside early, moved out on the backstretch, rallied three wide on the far turn, took over past the quarter pole, dueled with THE KEY IS
UNITY down the stretch and gamely prevailed. THE KEY IS UNITY unhurried in the beginning from inside, went two wide into the far turn, rallied while
angling out to the four path around the bend, dueled outside KEEN TO GO in the lane and could not get by. RUSSELLS HUSTLE raced two wide then
moved inside around the first turn, gained ground two then three wide on the far turn, finished willingly through the lane but could not threaten the top pair.
STORM THE NIGHT stalked outside a rival early, reeled in the leader and bid between foes at the quarter pole but was no match in the stretch run.
BLUEGRASS RYDER chased two wide early, went three deep into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. CRYPTOHOLIC
stumbled leaving the gate, raced along the inside early, went two wide around the far turn, then swung out and lacked a rally. BELMONT BILL sped clear
first time through the stretch, opened up around the first turn, remained well clear into the far turn, clung to a rapidly diminishing lead at the quarter pole and
folded once overtaken. TRUMP FORTY FIVE failed to make an impact. CHURCHMEISTER stalked along the inside, tired and dropped back on the far turn
and had nothing left for the drive. HORNUNG bumped leaving the gate, raced three wide early, went two wide into the stretch and was never a factor. TIZ A
CLASS ACT was off slow and bumped with inner rival at the start, lagged behind to the far turn, eased and pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.
