Footnotes
LADY WITH A CAUSE raced forwardly along the inside, bid through a vacated rail with nine sixteenths to go, dueled with an outer rival around the far turn,
and inched away from that foe entering the lane. DIALHERUP set the pace in the three path while well in hand around the first turn, vied with an inner bidder
down the backstretch, dueled with that one around the far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch while drawing away from the rest. LA VILLAGE
LUMIERE settled off of the pace in the two path, took closer order to track down the backstretch, but only managed to chase the embattled leading pair
around the far turn, and was best of the rest. FIRST HILL raced a bit head-strong while stalking outside of rivals from the six to four paths around the first
turn, then gave way entering the far turn. HONOR HALLAREN tracked in the three path, but failed to keep pace with the rest of the field approaching the far
turn, and was eased through the final furlong. HIGH END VIXEN showed little and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
AMERICAN RASCAL broke prominently, stalked an outer clearing rival entering the turn, shifted to the three path and outside of him at the five sixteenths
pole, saddled up alongside in upper stretch, exploded past with a quick turn of foot when let out a notch at the furlong grounds, and cruised away under a
firm hold through the late stages. PRINTS MONEY pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses, then stayed on among rivals, and claimed
place in the final sixteenth. PRINCE OF POWER broke a step slow, gained from off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and sustained moderate
progress while hanging on his left lead. FROSTY THE GIANT broke a step slow, raced rank under restraint in the four path entering the turn, shifted out to
the seven path in the final furlong, and ran on. LOUDERMILK sped clear while tucking to the two path entering the turn, but offered little resistance to the
eventual winner's bid approaching the furlong pole, toiled in that one's wake leaving that marker, and stopped. INNOCENT MAN saved ground off of the
pace, attempted to offer a mild bid for minor placings leaving midstretch, but lacked a kick. WOODCOURT tracked in the three path, but weakened between
horses in the final furlong. FAMILY FACTOR steadied inside of rivals leaving the chute, trailed around the turn, and never got involved. LEGAL TITAN
lacked speed two wide, and made little impact.

Footnotes
OCEAN CITY bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, set the pace along the inside, inched away to a clear margin entering the far turn, and held well
from an outer pursuer through the lane. CAMILO tracked two wide and between horses early on, tucked to the rail approaching the far turn, gained place
from outer rivals turning for home while in pursuit of the clear leader, took aim on that one in upper stretch, but only closed in slowly through the final furlong
while not having enough to reel him in. NOW THAT ICAN ROCK stalked forwardly along the inside while briefly keen around the first turn, settled before
being asked to back off to midpack at the nine sixteenths pole, saved ground around the far turn before re-bidding for show in upper stretch, gained that
position at the furlong grounds, and held off an inner rival late. QUIET RIDE pursued from midpack in the two to three paths, encountered traffic entering the
lane, shifted in at the furlong grounds in hopes off offering a bid for show, but was kept at bay for that position late. BERRETTINI laid off of the pace in the
three to five paths, and ran on evenly. WRITE OFF JERRY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, crept closer in the four path and among foes
around the far turn to vie for show with inner rivals in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and yielded. HIGHEST RATED (IRE) railed to
factor three wide. AMERICAN ONLY broke a step slow and never got involved. DUBAI AND BACK (IRE) tracked from the four path early on, chased the
clear leader from the three path around the far turn, then faded between horses in upper stretch. RIVER IN EGYPT pursued from midpack in the three to
two paths, but was shuffled back turning for home, blocked entering the lane, but subsequently weakened, and was eased up in the final furlong. TIGER'S
LEGACY made contact with an inner rival at the start, stalked that foe from the three path, chased in the two path and between horses around the far turn,
but caved among rivals in upper stretch. PEARSE saved ground off of the pace, but was done early, pulled up in upper stretch, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MINISTERIAL vied three wide, led from an outer bidder around the far turn while his inner counterparts gave way, repelled that outer challenger entering the
lane while embracing JEEPER's rail bid, got briefly headed by that one at the furlong grounds, yet dueled gamely through the late stages, and prevailed.
JEEPER stalked behind the leading trio and from the two path, pursued in the three to four paths around the far turn before deciding to cut inside of the
leaders entering the lane, offered a rail bid in upper stretch, led briefly entering the final furlong, but was outdueled to the wire. HOKU stalked four wide, bid
around the far turn, but was turned away entering the lane, and held show thereafter. COALMINER'S KITTEN dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals,
but gave way with five sixteenths to go. SAILOR'S RETURN broke slowly, trailed along the inside early on, moved out of last before chasing under urging in
the four to five paths around the far turn, and lacked any kick. YONO lacked speed in the three path while under snug restraint around the first turn, and
never got involved. MONKEY ZONE laid off of the pace in the two path, and was done early. TAP THE CANDY sparred for the lead two wide and between
horses, but weakened with five sixteenths to go, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
DARING DO took bumps while crowded between horses at the start, tracked four wide under snug restraint into the turn, tugged forward to loom a danger
turning for home, bid entering the lane, led before coming under light coaxing entering the final furlong, and narrowly lasted from an outer surging foe late.
HIDEKI bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, shifted out five wide in upper stretch, offered a good late kick in hopes
of reeling in the top pair late, but just came up short. ONLY KIDDING was backed out of the gate as a precaution after his inner counterpart acted up, but
was reloaded without incident, stalked three wide and between horses, bid along with an outer rival entering the lane, sparred through midstretch while
slightly headed, and kept on well. LOST MY SOCK broke out and bumped rivals at the start, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, shifted four to
five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses. MASSARD tracked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and pursued evenly.
RETAIL THERAPIST laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, encountered traffic in the four path entering the lane, then lacked the needed kick
six wide in the final furlong. CODE FOR SUCCESS checked out of tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, fanned seven
wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. MORNIN' BOSS broke a step slow before being bumped and put to tight quarters between horses at the start,
then raced at the rear along the inside, and made little impact. PEACH COBBLER broke out at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied with a trio of
outer rivals turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and tired. CUZZYWUZZY broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner rival into an
outer rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three to four paths around the turn, swung eight wide in upper stretch, and made little impact. FUNNY MONEY
HONEY (IRE) was fractious in the gate requiring an extensive veterinarian exam before being cleared and reloaded, then bumped with an inner rival at the
start, pressed two wide while hard to handle among foes, vied turning for home, but faltered in upper stretch.

NIFTY tracked along the inside, tipped to the four path to be outside of the top pair in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge on his left lead to bid at the
furlong grounds, led soon after while changing over to his correct lead, and kicked clear. BLUE KENTUCKY brushed with an outer rival at the start, trailed in
the two path, tipped two wide entering the lane, then offered a rail rally through the final furlong to gain place in the final sixteenth. MY MAN FLINTSTONE
vied for the lead inside of a trio of foes, led around the turn as a pair of them faltered, shook free of his last remaining presser in upper stretch, but offered
little resistance to NIFTY's challenge at the furlong pole, tired between horses in the late stages, but narrowly saved show. TILTED TOWERS prompted the
pace four wide, tucked two wide turning for home, but yielded to the leader in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, kept on to re-bid for minor
placings along with an inner rallying rival, got outkicked leaving the sixteenth pole, vied for show late, but hung. DEVIL'S TOWER laid off of the pace five to
four wide into the turn, improved position turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leaders while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch. SUMMER
SPLASH brushed with an inner rival leaving the gates, laid off of the pace two wide, was shuffled back behind tiring foes turning for home, and failed to
factor. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT vied for the lead two wide and between horses, and faded leaving the three furlong pole. ONE LAST HAND vied three
wide and between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
SHERLOCK'S JEWEL stalked two wide, bid in the three path turning for home, inched clear while hanging on his left lead in midstretch, and narrowly lasted
from a pair of outer bidders lat. BALTHAZAR tracked three wide, tipped to the four path entering the lane, chased while hanging on his left lead, changed
over at the furlong grounds, gained to offer a bid along with an outer rival nearing the wire, but just missed. CYBER NINJA saved ground off of the pace,
launched a rally while fanning four, then six, wide entering the lane, sustained his steady charge outside of foes in the final furlong in hopes of bidding
nearing the wire, but was too late. ANCHOR MANNE took bumps from rivals on both sides leaving the gates, stalked along the inside while well-positioned,
pursued from the pocket around the far turn, chased the leader from between horses through midstretch, but tired in the closing stages. ST. NEOTS
bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses while under a firm hold around the first turn, shifted out to the five
path in upper stretch, but was blocked behind traffic entering the final furlong, tipped out, and offered a late kick. JUST SO tracked two wide, then lacked a
kick in the four path in the final furlong. SIG bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace while rank around the first turn, got headed by a bidding rival in
upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. GOLD FRANC (IRE) laid off of the pace three wide, but gave way under cautious handling between
horses in midstretch. FORGE IN FIRE bumped an inner rival before contacting an outer foe at the start, saved ground in midpack, but faded. QUALITY ART
never got involved. JOINT VENTURE lacked speed in the three path, checked entering the backstretch, then weakened in the four path turning for home.
