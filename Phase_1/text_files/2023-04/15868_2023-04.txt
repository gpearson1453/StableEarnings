MONAASIB raced off the early pace, moved up through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch, bumped with Butler Cabin nearing the eighth
pole, lugged in through the stretch, jumped shadow near the wire and prevailed under strong pressure. CALIBRACHOA KID was sent along from the
outside to set the early pace, raced just off the inside down the backstretch, dug in and just missed in a game effort late. FLAT OUT AMERICAN stalked the
early pace while racing just off the inside and kept on through the drive while racing two to three wide. BUTLER CABIN raced mid pack early on, moved up
four wide near the three eighths pole, was fiver deep near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. CATCHIN DRAMA was off a step slow, raced four to five
wide around the far turn and never threatened. VIKING LEGACY raced mid pack early, was three to four wide in the lane and lacked a bid. ITS WILD
AGAIN saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
KAJUN KARMA tracked the early leader, raced from the outside in the stretch and edged clear late under strong handling. THE BOSS SOSS settled off the
early pace, moved up three to two wide in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. SONO showed good early foot from the inside to set the pace, raced
well off the inside in the lane and gave way grudgingly. GOLDENLUTE rated along early, made an inside bid near the quarter pole and flattened out in the
drive. MR. CROMWELL raced mid pack early on, angled widest into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no closing run. FATHER MARK dropped back
early, raced along the inside and lacked a bid. RANCH WATER saved ground and trailed.

Footnotes
GOLDUSTER pressed the early pace while racing between rivals two wide, surged late from the inside and got up late under all out pressure. GOT ME A
CHRYSLER stalked the pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch, had a clear lead near the sixteenth pole and was caught near the wire. KNOT THE
ONE vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened a bit in the drive. Z'S GUITAR settled early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and moved
up to improve position. PARTY LITTLE BOY raced mid pack early, was near the inside near the quarter pole, angled six wide and moved up late.
AWESOME CAJUN settled early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and raced evenly late. DEVIL'S HARVEST stalked the pace,
raced five deep into the upper stretch and weakened. TRIPLE RED ACES saved ground and never threatened.
