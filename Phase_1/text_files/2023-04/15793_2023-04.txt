the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a bid entering the stretch and bumped MEAN AMERICAN but stayed on for a late gain but was too late.
MEAN AMERICAN was off the pace while saving ground through the turn then was in tight and bumped with CZAR'S BALLERINA into the stretch, made a
rebid to be up for the show. TRINITY HOPE was unhurried around the first turn then moved up from four wide on the backstretch then moved in to three
wide around the final turn and showed late interest to improve position. TARGET VISION tracked the leaders but failed to menace. IRON BANNER was
allowed to settle from off the rail down the backstretch but was always back. SERAPE stalked the pace from the two path to the final turn and gave way. AN
OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF MEAN AMERICAN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF CZAR'S BALLERINA FOR ALLEGED
INTERFENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO CHANGES WERE
MADE.

DRAFT CHOICE was roused to the lead to set the pace and held on late. COLOR FAST had no speed down the backstretch then moved up from three
wide on the turn and made a late stretch rally to be up for the place. GOLDEN PASSAGE was off the pace down the backstretch then made a rail bid into
the stretch and was out kicked late and missed the show. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a late
stretch bid to improve position. LT. BONURA was hustled along to press the pace to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. QUANA DUDE failed to
menace. CLEAR HUMOR tracked the leaders on the inside but lacked a late response. PRAY IDE SING was away sharply to vie for the lead from the three
path then floated out into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ARCTIC ROSE has an awkward start and was rank around the first turn then split horses entering the backstretch to take the lead, was headed at the five
sixteenths pole and matched strides down the stretch inside of SCREENPLAY and dug in to win the nod. SCREENPLAY went to the lead around the first
turn then pressed the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader at the five sixteenths pole and fought gamely outside of ARCTIC ROSE down the
stretch but lost the nod. SMOKY TOPAZ was forwardly placed through the turn then lacked room entering the stretch and moved out to three wide to show
late interest to be up for the show. FOOLISH DREAMS was allowed to settle inside into the first turn then checked at the seven furlong pole and veered out
to the three path down the backstretch then moved out to four wide around the final turn to move up and challenge the leaders but was empty late.
CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST was off the pace through the turn then ran into traffic and moved out to five wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response.

Footnotes
DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) was hustled away and cut the corner around the first turn to take a clear lead and proved much the best. GLUCKSTADT stalked
the pace from the two path, moved up on the backstretch but was no match for the winner. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT saved ground down the backstretch then
moved out to three wide on the final turn to make a late run to be up for the show. MY LIL DUDE was away alertly to show brief foot to the first turn then was
placed off the pace down the backstretch but retreated. UNITEDAPPEAL broke in sharply and trailed. B W P SPIRIT tracked the leaders from the four path
down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
JOEY'S GAME was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and angled out to three or four wide at the eighth pole and
cruised home. BUCK'S GLORY was hustled along to press the pace from the two path then faded slightly on the final turn but dug back in to match strides
with UNCLE JETT in early stretch but was out finished by the late closer. UNCLE JETT was rushed up the rail to take a pressured lead down the
backstretch then inched away briefly with three furlongs left but was challenged again in a stretch duel with BUCK'S GLORY to the eighth pole and tired.
GOLDEN CONFUSION chased the leaders then looked to make a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole but never gained traction. RICKY RIGHT saved
ground to no avail.
