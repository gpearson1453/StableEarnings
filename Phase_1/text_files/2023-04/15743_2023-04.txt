SHORTLIST unhurried for five furlongs while three wide, closer late final turn, steered out a bit and came four wide into the lane, collared the leader inside
the furlong grounds and drew clear under steady handling. WINDCRACKER pressed the issue from between horses, took over turning for home, clear with
a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner late. THUNDERSHOOK void of speed while saving ground, continued to race inside far turn, swung out
five wide and outside the winner into the stretch, staged a mild rally while widest down the lane to be along for the show.. HUGE BIGLY broke on top,
narrowly set the pace inside, headed entering the stretch, tired. DOUBLY BLESSED behind the first flight along the inside, came up empty drive.
OFFSHORE AFFAIR pressured the pace three wide, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT RAIN forwardly placed while three wide, continued to apply pressure through the second bend, engaged the leader from the outside inside the
furlong grounds, wore that rival down under firm handling. PUT A BOW ON IT broke on top, cleared toward the inside, pace in the two path, continued to
show the way final bend, responded when the winner challenged with just under a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly to that one, remained clear for
the place. LANTERN'S CANDY steadied when in tight along rail into the first turn, settled along the inside off the pace, moved out, closer four path midway
on the final turn, lost some ground to the top two into the lane, could not get to that pair late, clear of the others. LIL'S TURN settled off the pace and the
inside, in some traffic midway on the second bend, steered out for room, went evenly through the stretch. TWENTYTWENTYREDO within striking distance
while racing in the two path, came up empty for the stretch run. TIME FOR GOLD pressed the runner up for six furlongs along the inside, had little left for
the drive. CLOSE TO ME last away, void of speed in trailing four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four path again late in the second bend, lacked a
closing kick. IZEONPOINT never menaced.

past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. SKYPED away in good order, cleared to the inside, set the pace inside, continued show the
way by daylight second turn, responded when confronted by the winner with a furlong to run, proved stubborn to the end, remained clear of the others.
WHERE'S RANDY broke back, pulled, shuffled back with just over five furlongs remaining, advanced in the two path late in the final turn, moved out a bit
and was getting to the top two with a belated surge at the end. BLACK APPLE three wide when off the pace through the first turn, continued outside, four
wide second bend, went flat through the lane to finish up evenly. BACKGATE RED fell back to trail, four wide into the stretch, improved then also flattened
out a bit in the late going. STREET COMMANDER in some traffic into the first turn, saved some ground, moved out three wide for the drive, improved
slightly while not a threat. AFLEET SKY within striking distance while racing just off the inside, came up empty for the stretch run. WICKED PRINCE chased
the leader while moving off the rail, dropped back inside late in the final turn when beginning to tire, continued to back up through the lane. REUP dwelt at

Footnotes
TABLE MONEY behind the pace just off the inside, patiently handled behind the first flight into the stretch, split foes past the furlong marker, gained the
advantage and held the lugging runner up safe late. COLONEL BARTON lacked speed three wide, came four to five wide into the lane, lugged in repeatedly
despite a left handed crop through the lane, engaged the winner late while continued to lug in, could not get by that one, clear of the others. P R CALL ME
MAYBE broke back, lacked speed, advanced along the inside turn, came in the two path for the drive, moved out a bit further, rallied belatedly to garner the
show. FANCY PAYNTER floated out at the break, also raced back off the pace, four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane, improved position. HUEY
DUEY broke out, pressed the issue from the outside, three wide through most of the turn, put a head in front approaching the furlong grounds, could not
last. R R EMPIRE off a step slow, back and inside, passed a few tiring foes late after the issue had been decided. UPTOWN SOCIAL with the pace in the
two path and between horses, vied into the lane then faltered the final furlong. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE set or forced the pace while racing along the inside, still
prominent midstretch, also gave way in the final furlolng. MATTFOLEYVANMAN in mid pack behind the pace, steadied with four furlongs to run, evenly
paced through the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
TEXAS RED HOT last to leave, unhurried off rail, angled five wide into the lane, rallied, bid, edged away under light encouragement while drifting in to win
ridden out. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS fell far back to trail after the start, continued to lag turn, also swung out six wide turning for home, rallied down the
middle of the strip to be in time for the winner. MAC DADDY TOO away well, pressed the early leader from the outside, dueled late turn, took over, clear a
furlong out, proved no match for the winner late, nipped for the place. RAM behind the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, lacked a
closing kick to finish up evenly. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY prompted the pace while off the inside, three wide into the lane, had little left the final furlong.
PENETRATOR flashed some brief speed along the inside, faltered when headed. BLOW TORCH in mid pack while off the rail, in some traffic three wide
late in the bend, came up empty when clear for the drive. MUMAYAZ in the second flight outside, moved closer four wide midway on the turn, gave way in
the drive.

Footnotes
HASKELLED tracked the leader along the inside under firm restraint, continued forward and inside the middle half mile, moved up inside the leader to
challenge along the rail with less than a furlong remaining, outfinished that rival and the runner up in a determined effort. DARYL'S BOLT away well,
prompted the issue in the three path, advanced and challenged in the second turn, held a narrow advantage past midstretch, oukicked by the winner late.
RANSAM PAYNTER broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, responded when confronted by the runner up in the final turn, dueled with that one into the
stretch, allowed the winner the rail soon after, weakened in the late going. KID SHELLEEN settled off the pace while racing three wide, continued outside,
went evenly to the wire to finish up evenly. CHROME RUN off the pace, rank early backstretch, settled, lacked serious bid stretch. KING DOODLE four wide
when off the pace first turn, continued well wide, four wide again through the second bend, failed to rally. ASSET BASIS remained back in lacking a rally.
DISCOVERY PEAK fell back to trail, fell further back after five furlongs, well beaten.

RECKER POINT prompted the issue up front in the three path, bid, took over when straightened for home, drew off through the final furlong under firm
handling. G T FIVE HUNDRED pressed the issue up front, challenged between horses second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive while
holding the place late. GIROOVIN moved out three wide in the first turn, raced in the second flight while remaining in the three path, steadied midway in the
second bend in traffic, recovered and was getting to the runner up late. JUDO took command start, continued to set the pace the middle half, weakened
when headed into the stretch. ACCIDENTAL HERO settled in the second flight along the inside, saved ground to no avail. TRES SOLES lacked speed,
shuffled back in traffic in the first turn, remained back in failing to threaten. SIR last to leave, remained back.

second duel past the furlong marker, edged away then held late. MAMZOOJ void of speed, advanced five wide through the second turn, headed up a busy
second flight late while widest of that group, proved game for the place. MEGAN'S HONOR off a step slow, lacked speed, raced three wide out of the final
turn, vied to the wire for the second spot between rivals, missed. TEN GAUGE in mid pack while off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide through
the final turn, dueled into the stretch, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, faltered late. OUTLIER in the second flight along the inside, lacked a
closing kick. BANDIT POINT fell well back to trail, came three wide for the drive, shifted out a bit wider, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve a
bit. BEER CHASER lacked speed while racing outside, four wide into the first turn, again late in the second bend, failed to rally. SUPER CONSTITUTION
behind the pace while inside early, steered out to be four wide by late in the final turn, tired. LANSDOWNE broke on top, set the pace, stopped when

the strip to annex the show, gaining for the place. VYING EDGE broke alertly, alternated up front closest to the inside, weakened the final furlong to lost a
couple of positions. KINFOLK broke back after hopping at the start, lacked speed, three wide out of the turn, improved position without posing a serious
threat. LORD M within striking distance, three wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. POINT BLANK broke back, raced back, traffic late in the turn
when moving a bit off the inside, made little impact through the lane. WESTHEIMER STREET lacked a response after saving through through the turn.
