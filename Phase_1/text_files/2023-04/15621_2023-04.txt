Footnotes
IMPASSIONED CLAIM sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through
the lane with complete authority. WINTER SOLDIER lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy to gain
the place. ALEX'S DREAM raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. SUPER
CREATIVE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. CLASS COMPOUNDS chased the leaders while racing four-wide,
lugged out through the back-stretch and gradually gave way. DEPUTY KNIGHT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor. GABE'S MONSTER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. SCRATCH ME chased the leaders from
the inside for a half and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. BURNIN VERNON showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with good energy. NORTHERN COCKTAIL broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing
three-wide from between foes and gave way after going a half. LEFT THE BAR vied for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half.
ENDALE ARCH settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. I'M MR. SHENANIGAN lacked early foot, raced seven-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

CASHANOVA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths
pole and was ridden out to the wire. WILLY THE COBBLER was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn and failed to gain on the winner
in the drive. BLUE SKYE JADE pulled to vie soon after the start, saved ground while dueling for early advantage, stayed on well in the drive but was no
match for the winner. JOKER MATT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. OF GOOD REPORT
showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR was off slow, raced off the pacesetters

CRAZY ABOUT YOU hopped at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached MACLEAN'S BELLA with a furlong to
run, vied with that rival and edged away late. MARGOT'S GIRL settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady
rally. MACLEAN'S BELLA dueled for the lead while racing four-wide, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch and gave way late. LIP'S OF
WINE lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. RATTLEME disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave
way after going a half. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MISCHIEVOUS EMMA vied
for the lead from the inside, rider lost irons nearing the half and gradually weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
