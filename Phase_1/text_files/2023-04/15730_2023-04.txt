ITS A CHEAP DATE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as the handiest of winners. SISTER
COUSIN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. DON
JUAN BUBBA chased the winner from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. BIG MOONIE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and finished with some late run. HUSTO chased the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going three furlongs. GONZAGA BAY lacked
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHUDDER was off slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer
a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

CALEBS LADY sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. X RAY VISION chased the leaders
from the inside throughout, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. ACES OVER DEUCES was off a step slow, raced unhurried
early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. PERFECT MISCHIEF chased the winner while racing four-wide and failed to
gain in the drive. ESCAPEFROMPARADISE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn from between foes and gave way in the drive.
GENERAL CROOK was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. DISCO GIRL showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

WORKIN NINETOFIVE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away
late. DEL MAR FLASH dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths marker and gave way grudgingly to the
winner late. SUE ETTAS GHOST lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached a striking position but failed to gain
late. BIG CYN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with a belated bid. RED
PANTY NIGHT was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by DEL MAR FLASH nearing the quarter, vied and gave way
through the final furlong. PIRATES CROSS showed brief speed and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ARIZONA JEREMY was off slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was up in the closing yards.
SANTALUZ DREAMIN was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by RIVER ROSE nearing the
three-eighths marker, vied with that rival, re-cleared with a furlong to run and just failed to last. POLITICAL RIOT was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn, rallied late and just missed. RIVER ROSE pressed the pace of SANTALUZ DREAMIN while racing three-wide,
moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, vied and gave way through the final furlong. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES settled off the leaders early,
angled out sharply nearing the quarter, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. CHEST CANDY was forwardly placed throughout, angled out in
mid-stretch and lacked the needed closing response. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor. ESTEEMED lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. TELLER showed brief speed and weakened. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LUVLUV settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the third turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore in tandem with TARTINI
with a sixteenth to run, vied with that rival and proved best in the stiff drive. TARTINI raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the third turn,
angled out further into the stretch, vied with the winner through the final sixteenth and just missed. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT lacked early speed, raced
six-wide through the third turn and finished with a late bid. NO SLO MO was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the third turn, angled in with a
sixteenth to run and finished willingly. BIGFOOT CITY sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong.
STITZY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the third turn, offered a bid into the lane and gave way in the drive. SONNY SMACK was void
of early speed, raced off the rail through the third turn and finished with some late energy. CLUB MESQUITE raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground
through the third turn, reached a striking position in mid-stretch and weakened in the drive. ZESTFUL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
weakened after going a mile. MYOPIC tracked the leaders from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. SHINNY showed no early speed, saved
ground through the turn and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
