Footnotes
RIVERBOAT GAMBLER never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch under right handed urging, made the lead late and finished full of
under to win going away. AMIGO'S AFFAIR broke in front, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gained the advantage then was no match for the
winner. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK bumped at the start and had a mild late rally in the middle of the racetrack. SHADOW TRACER stalked the pace form the
three path, offered a mild bid into the stretch then faded late. MAKING ME CRAZY bumped at the start and was no threat. MON CAMO matched strides for
the lead along the rail into the turn, checked nearing the quarter pole, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
HERE'S MY NUMBER was in tight soon after the start, allowed to settle, raced under strong restraint through the turn, swung out to the seven path, closed
with a burst of speed under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. MY PINK BUNNY TALE pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, made the
lead late then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. SUGAR LOVES IT never far back, finished with good courage three wide while in the six path.
DOMINIQUE'S NIGHT had a mild rally late in the seven path. STEALTH MODE stalked the pace two wide and went evenly. DOMINUS O'S ME offered a
mild bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. VILLAGE CAT rushed to the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then
weakened. OUTPOST GIRL had brief speed. DEE'S KY WILDCAT was outrun. OH EYE SEE forwardly placed three wide, was through after a half. LIVIE
ANNE had good early speed four wide and faltered in the stretch. JUPITER ECLIPSE was never a threat/
