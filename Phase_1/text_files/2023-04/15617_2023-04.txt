Footnotes
MIDNIGHTMAKESSENSE tracked three wide, had a quick move at the three eight pole and gained the lead, drew off late under firm handling.
CANDYMONIUM dueled on the early lead, was no match late for winner, but was second best. LORDHEARMYPRAYER stumbled soon after the start and
trailed, rallied in the stretch and improved. TWELVE SHARP was never far back, saved ground, and went evenly late. MISS BRIGHTSIDE was allowed to
settle, angled out down the backside and was no menace. SAIDAR was no factor. TATHBEET allowed to settle, failed to menace. DONNARUMMA
contended for three quarters, then gave way. KISS IT GOODBYE pressed the pace and was through after a half. I'VE BEEN THINKIN dueled for a half,
then stopped.
