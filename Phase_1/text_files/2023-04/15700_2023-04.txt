Footnotes
LITTLEBIT DON bobbled at the break but quickly recovered track the pace and bid between rivals going up the backstretch, shook off BER MIS BOY
through the far turn and moved off under steady handling. BER MIS BOY moved four wide to bid with the winner going to the far turn then could not go with
that one in the lane. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN moved up three and four wide to best the others while not a threat. WHISKEYSPENT gained a clear early
lead along the inside but had nothing left nearing the lane. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT was not a factor. SPORTS HIFLYER drifted over heels then was
climbing into the first turn and trailed.

ROBUST vied on the lead three to four wide outside rivals, dueled R VOO'S TABOO through the lane and surged late to be up in the closing jump. R VOO'S
TABOO contested the lead inside rivals, dueled the winner through the lane and missed in the closing jump. LEVEL contested the lead between rivals to
late in the far turn and and little left while holding clear for the show. RING TAILED TOOTER followed the pace three to four wide, moved in nearing the lane
then steadied midstretch as a rival lugged in and improved position while not a threat. SUPER SIZER bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace three
wide, lugged in midstretch and weakened. DE KOTA CAPTAIN leaned into the gate to get away last and was not a threat three wide. RYAN EXPRESS
bumped with a rival at the start and lacked a bid out from the rail. DOMERGOO saved ground and was always back.

Footnotes
TAYLOR'S BEAUTY tracked the early lead three wide to bid into the lane and moved clear under a mild drive. OVER EXPOSED was midpack outside and
rallied belatedly through the lane to gain the place. OUR PETUNIA broke in the air and made a mild rally four to six wide. S C ANGEL lacked a final closing
bid three wide. SENTIMENTAL CROSS weakened racing out from the rail. AUNT IRENE was not a threat. MIZZANNA was always back. SING THE SONG
showed the most early speed to make the running out from the rail and stopped through the lane. UNTETHERED SOUL was outrun.
