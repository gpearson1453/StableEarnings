Footnotes
AMERICAN PURE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace two wide, gained between horses in upper stretch to be right behind the top pair at the furlong
grounds, altered course inwardly for a rail seam, bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. BEAVER HAT tracked two wide and between horse, split
the leaders entering the lane to offer a bid, struck the front outside of the furlong grounds, but met an inner rival's bid at the sixteenth pole, and got
outkicked. PURE PANIC prompted the pace outside of the leader from the four path, vied in the two path around the turn, led turning for home, but was
headed by an inner bidder nearing the furlong grounds, and kept on. SURF AND TURF chased along the inside while under moderate coaxing, then
improved position between horses in the final sixteenth. MASAI MAN pursued from midpack three wide, chased between horses around the turn, but failed
to keep pace with the top flight in upper stretch. PICASSO laid off of the pace four wide, inched closer around the turn, but tired in upper stretch, and gave
way while hanging on his left lead. SEA TO SUCCESS set the pace inside of a vying rival into the turn, but was headed approaching the five sixteenths
pole, and weakened. RICOCHET was outrun and eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SINFILTRE showed the way unencumbered in the two to three paths, remained well in hand along the inside around the final turn as a pair of foes gave
chase, shook away from them in upper stretch, and lasted safely to the wire. ELLE EST FORTE tracked in the three path, inched closer around the final
bend to claim place at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, changed over in
midstretch while chasing, and kept on to narrow the margin late. I'M SO SORRY bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, stalked from the two path as the
leader's closest pursuer, but was outmoved for that title turning for home, then chased along the inside through the lane while holding show. KISS YOU
LATER (IRE) nudged the inner half of the gate before taking a bump from an inner rival at the start, was last away in the process, tracked from midpack two
wide, was urged to gain around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch with multiple lengths to find, but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid.
CECILITA saved ground off of the pace, and faded. LIVY B rated at the rear two wide, took the final two turns in three path, and failed to rally. LUMINIST
trailed along the inside, and was outrun.

Footnotes
HOCUS took a light brush from an inner rival at the start, rushed to the fore soon after, cleared leaving the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way with a wide
margin while well in hand around the turn, then held sway under driving pressure. HOOEY broke a step slow before being hustled forward between horses,
pressed inside of the leader briefly, but failed to sustain pressure at the nine sixteenths pole, chased under all out urging in the two path around the turn,
then failed to gain on the clear leader through the lane while holding place. CHOWMEIN chased three wide, but was denied reaching place. MIDWAY
MIRACLE was urged along in the four path whilst midpack around the turn, drifted inwardly while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, and lacked a rally.
SILVESTRE brushed an outer rival at the start while breaking forwardly, but quickly failed to sustain forward position in the opening stages, took the turn in
the five path while off of the pace, and was no menace. INVASIVE trailed in the four path and moved up entering the lane. KICK ROCKS KID pursued from
midpack along the inside, and faded. DOM GERVASIO failed to factor two wide. BOOYAH was outrun three wide. SHACKLESFLY chased along the inside
for a quarter mild, but faltered around the turn.

Footnotes
GAM'S MISSION trailed along the inside, sat reserved in the two path around the far turn, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, rallied while tucking
to the four path in upper stretch, sustained a bid in the final furlong, and forged an advantage late. BUBBLE ROCK set a clear pace, remained in hand as a
pair of foes closed in around the far turn, shook away from them under confident handling in upper stretch, came under a drive leaving the furlong grounds
as an outer GAM'S MISSION loomed a danger, and was bested by that foe in the late stages. LADY HIDEAWAY settled off of the pace along the inside,
tipped to the three path entering the lane, pursued between horses while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, but was outkicked approaching the furlong
grounds, sustained stride thereafter, and gained show late. FREEDOM SPEAKS tracked from the three path, ranged up around the far turn, gained place
nearing the lane, but only managed to chase the leader through upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, changed over at the three sixteenths pole, but
got outkicked at the furlong grounds, tired, and lost show in the closing stages. HENRIETTA TOPHAM laid off of the pace two wide, was urged along around
the far turn, but got outkicked by an outer rival while spinning into the lane in the four path, and lacked a rally. BREEZE RIDER bobbled slightly while
breaking on top, stalked the clear leader from the two path, inched closer along with an outer rival around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL WATERS set the pace in the two path, held sway in the three path in upper stretch, then lasted between horses while hanging on his left lead.
MINNESOTA READY lacked speed three to two wide, rallied through the lane, offered an inside bid in the closing stages, but narrowly missed. UNDER
OATH stalked three wide, moved closer to press the leader from the three path around the turn, chased that clear foe in the four path in upper stretch,
sustained a grinding bid in the final furlong, but was kept at bay. DIVINE LEADER raced forwardly two wide and between horses, chased while failing to
sustain position around the turn, fanned to the four path in upper stretch, and kept on evenly. FITZPATRICK raced far back two wide, and failed to factor.
FLINT RIDGE pursued from midpack in the four path, and faded in the five path in upper stretch. EMBRACE trailed and made little impact. REMUDA took a
bump from an outer rival soon after the start, stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane, and weakened. LET MY PEOPLE GO was antsy in the
starting gate, and got outrun along the inside. TOP OF THE CHARTS bumped an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, and
faded.

Footnotes
SAUDI CROWN stalked three wide, ranged up outside of the leader and from the three path around the turn, chased that foe in upper stretch, but quickly
kicked past him at the furlong grounds, and drew off with good energy. WILD THINKER raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain
that position entering the turn, regrouped and gained in the three path turning for home, ran on through the final furlong while no match for the eventual
winner, and gained place in the closing stages. BRITERDAYZAHEAD set the pace in the two path, was put to a drive with a clear margin from an outer
chaser at the three sixteenths pole, but offered little resistance to that one's challenge at the furlong grounds, and weakened. BRIGADE COMMANDER
pursued from midpack in the two path around the turn, and gained fourth at the wire. MALIBU SPRINGS broke inwardly, rushed forward along the rail to
gain forward position down the backstretch, chased under moderate urging around the turn, and tired. MAGIC TAP tracked in the three to four paths around
the turn, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and gave way. DELIBERATION broke slowly before shying from an inner rival at the start, lagged well
behind the rest into the turn, took the bend in the three to four paths, and rallied willingly through the lane. ZED laid off of the pace in the four to five paths,
and tired. PAPA ALDEN never got involved two wide. ARNO was fractious loading, and got outrun.

Footnotes
GASLIGHT DANCER bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked in midpack along the inside, inched closer in the two path around the turn, took aim
outside of the leaders from the five path in upper stretch, bid approaching midstretch, led at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. TWO OF A KIND saved
ground off of the pace, shifted to the four path entering the lane, fanned out to the seven path in midstretch, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead to
gain place entering the final sixteenth. CHIRINGO leaned out and bumped a foe at the start, rated far back along the inside, tipped two wide entering the
lane, and rallied inside of rivals in the final furlong to reach show at the wire. CRISPY CAT (GB) tracked along the inside, bid inside of rivals approaching
midstretch, but took a bump from an outer rival at the furlong grounds while getting outkicked by outer rivals, then drifted out while lacking a re-bid.
PRIVATE CREED bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid far back in the two to three wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, then sustained a
willing rally after shifting further out in the final furlong. NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) stalked two wide, bid in the four path and between horses coming to
midstretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and gave way. FADETHENOISE broke a step slow before taking contact from an inner rival at the
start, lagged behind along the inside around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. BUSHIDO acted up briefly moments before
the off, the broke sharply, quickly cleared, shifted to the three path entering the lane, met bids on both sides coming to midstretch, but shifted in and bumped
a rival at the furlong grounds, and subsequently faltered. GOLDEN NUGGET took a bump from an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path,
tucked down and saved ground while coaxed along around the turn, and failed to factor. STORM DADDY bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in the
three path and between horses around the turn, and weakened. DAMON'S MOUND laid off of the pace two wide, and tired. OLAZABAL leaned out at the
start, tracked in the three to four paths, and weakened.

Footnotes
KEY OF LIFE set the pace in the two path, drew away from a pair of outer chasers once let out a notch at the five sixteenths pole, kicked away entering the
lane, maintained a clear margin through midstretch as an outer rival slowly closed in, dug in to resist that rival's bid entering the final sixteenth, and held
firm. INTERPOLATE bumped an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace, took the turn in the five path, launched a gain turning for home, rallied in
pursuit of the clear leader through midstretch, sustained her grinding charge to bid leaving the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay. STONEWALL STAR took
simultaneous bumped from rivals on both sides a few strides after the start, stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the turn in hopes of
bidding around the bend, but failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, and faded through the lane. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS bumped an outer
rival in the opening stages, laid off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. OPUS FORTY TWO stalked two wide, pursued in the four path around
the turn, and weakened turning for home. SHOPLIFTER raced at the rear in the two to three paths around the turn, and never got involved. FUN AND
FEISTY trailed while taking the turn in the five to six paths, and was outrun.

SUPER CAT LADY set the pace along the inside, showed the way in hand around the turn, repelled an outer bidder while changing leads at the three
sixteenths pole, but resented the rider's use of the crop passing the furlong grounds, flagged her tail while shown a right handed stick through the late
stages, and got caught nearing the finish. KNOWING GLANCE checked slightly when unable to rush inside of foes approaching the eleven sixteenths pole,
shifted out and stalked three wide entering the turn, ranged up to bid turning for home, but was repelled at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. BEL
ARIA tracked four wide, and chased through the lane. SOLID TUNE stalked along the inside, and faded. MA CHERIE saved ground off of the pace, shifted
out in upper stretch, but lacked a rally between horses. FABRICATE popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, then broke slow, laid off of the pace
two wide, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. LILLY CHROME showed little.
