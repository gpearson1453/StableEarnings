Footnotes
TOMARIE hustled to a clear lead, repelled a foe on the final turn then drew away through the stretch while drifting out. WONDER CITY moved closer
outside before half a mile and continued willingly while no match. MISS LOYALTY dropped back early, split rivals rallying into the lane and had a mild gain.
BILLIEANNE chased wide, offered a menacing move after half a mile then faltered. COMPLETE lagged far behind and was never in contention. NOT A
TRACE flashed speed then stopped abruptly and was being eased late.

MISS PEPPINA tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid on the turn, dueled with LOVE ON FIRE turning for home, battled heads apart with that rival
through a long stretch drive and prevailed determinedly at the end. LOVE ON FIRE stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled outside a
rival into the stretch, battled heads apart, put a head in front at the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to the finish. HIGHTIME VALENTINE raced off the
rail, off the pace, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly for third. BOSS CARA raced off the pace inside, chased the leaders on
the turn and finished evenly in the lane. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES trailed the field, came wide for the drive and failed to threaten. MOONCHILD set the
pace racing a bit off the inside, briefly dueled between rivals on the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole and gave way.

ROB THE RICH settled off the pace three wide, bid on the turn, engaged the pacesetter and was up following a long drive in a determined effort. BRING ME
A CHECK dueled along the inside throughout and battled to the finish. GET SET settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch then went
evenly late. PRESS MY BETS raced between rivals just off the pace, swung wide into the stretch and lacked a solid rally. A C EXPRESSWAY dropped well
behind inside then passed rivals without menacing. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE dueled outside to the stretch then proved empty in the final furlong.
THISCATCANJUMP was squeezed back early and bobbled slightly, chased wide and gave way.

Footnotes
MR THRIFTY settled off the pace, advanced inside, wore down the pacesetter and was up in the late stages. SPEIGHTSTER RED broke out at the start,
stalked outside, took over on the final turn, moved well clear but nailed nearing the wire. JONNY QUIST settled off the leaders inside then continued well
narrowing the gap. SCREEN SAVER dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. THERISASTORMBREWIN prompted the pace outside to the
final turn and weakened. PRIVATE NETWORK lacked speed, moved very wide on the final turn and was no threat. SCOOP DAWG raced wide off the
leaders and was never in contention. SAMURAI SAINT dropped far behind and was never a factor. JUMP FOR ALEX trailed early and was always outrun.
COLONEL JUAN was well placed behind the dueling leaders for half a mile and stopped. HENRYTHETHIRD broke slowest and raced far behind
throughout. ARTISTIC REASON led early inside and was finished before half a mile.

Footnotes
TALK TO THE JUDGE set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, kicked clear, responded, drifted in some in front of FOGGY NIGHT in deep stretch
and held on well for the win. FOGGY NIGHT was off slowly, steadied in the chute, raced off the pace inside, made a five wide run on the turn, rallied, closed
inside in the final furlong, then altered course behind TALK TO THE JUDGE in deep stretch, angled out and was gaining at the finish. PRECIOUS AVARY
raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch run, altered course off the inside at the sixteenth marker and continued to rally.
GOLD MEDAL ANNA raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, steadied when lacking room at the quarter pole, then rallied on the rail.
BROADWAYCHARLYROSE stalked between rivals, was in a bit tight at the half mile marker, then chased on the turn and weakened. FLIGHT trailed the
field, moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane and passed tired ones. BET OF THE CENTURY stalked four wide early, chased three wide on the
turn and faded. MARION GRACE stalked close up three wide, then chased and faded. RIVERVIEW tracked close up on the inside, then chased and gave
way on the turn. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, the race was declared official.

BLUNT FORCE set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, moved off the rail, responded when asked, drew off and was kept to the task. SIZZLING
ROMA broke out bumping a rival at the start, raced off the pace inside, made a four wide bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside and dug in for second.
RISQUE'S JEWEL raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. PENANCE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the
turn, angled out and gained mildly outside. GAVICHI chased close up three wide, between rivals on the turn and weakened. CALL THE PO PO was bumped
and steadied at the start, outrun early and passed tired ones. SOUTHERN CENTS chased four wide, then three wide on the turn and faded. LEVIOSA
chased two wide, then inside on the turn and gave way.
