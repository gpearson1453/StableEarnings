Footnotes
ROCK ON COWBOY grabbed command early, set a pressured pace off the inside, was under a hustling ride battling inside foes into the lane, edged away
slightly past the three sixteenths, braced for an outside challenge from MIND ON MY MONEY leaving the furlong grounds, lost the lead soon past the
sixteenth pole, battled back under solid handling and got the bob at the wire. MIND ON MY MONEY rated back off rivals around the first turn, settled off the
contested pace while in the clear, edge closer four wide leaving the far turn, circled five to six wide into the lane, closed in under right handed asks, gained a
slim advantage outside ROCK ON COWBOY inside the sixteenth marker, dueled nose to nose and just missed in a game effort. BAND BOSS , four wide
early, tracked outside a rival, shifted out some, around the final turn, bid four wide between runners nearing the stretch but couldn't quite go with the top pair
through final furlong. SOCIAL AFLEET , in close at the break, settled off the pace, raced between foes into the far turn, shifted out with pursuit into the lane
and churned on. MY BOOK , three wide pressing outside the winner, was under urging battling between rivals into the lane then faded. FLIT N FLOT TIME
saved ground off the early pace, moved up some nearing the half, angled out around the final turn, chased into the lane then gave way. SOURNOIS
dropped in soon after the start and secured the rail, tracked under rating, came under a ride leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on approaching the
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ARMS APRIORITY drifted in at the break, corrected and was hustled up to the inside rivals and put a head in front after a furlong, set a rated pace towards
the rail, kicked away after being set down soon into the stretch, kept on under steady handling through the final furlong and held sway. ASHLEY'S GIRL ,
wide and off the early pace, circled five to six wide advancing into the lane, continued progress outside rivals heading to mid stretch, lugged in and switched
over to her left lead nearing mid stretch but kept on well to gain. KATIE'S C , off the pace and removed from the rail, angled out and brushed with
DECORATED LADY when working between foes near the three sixteenths, chased the top pair from there but flattened out in the final sixteenth. HOT
PATOOTIE forced the early pace three wide between rivals, remained between runners pursuing into the lane, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then
gave way. THIRSTYPROSPECT saved ground with pursuit, failed to kick on under asking past the five sixteenths and retreated. LOYAL TO THE CHIEF
had speed and contested the early pace outside the winner, gave chase to the inside of rivals nearing the lane, failed to go on and dropped back.
DECORATED LADY , four deep prompting the early pace, chased wide around the turn, steadied when brushed and put in tight by KATIE'S C soon into the
lane then gave way. PER RULING DATED 7/26/23 RECIEVED FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION (RULING # 25403), ARMS APRIORITY
WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
TALK TO TOKEY , keen to go three deep into the first turn, moved clear heading to the backstretch, dropped in a bit and set the pace, held firm when
confronted by three foes to his outside entering the far turn, emerged in a tussle with BELLO CREEDO past the three eighths, spurted away from that one
when roused and drifting three wide into the lane, was corrected with right handed asks, powered away in mid stretch, switched over to his left lead a
sixteenth later then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept alert. FORGED IN STEEL , three wide into the first turn, settled back off the early pace,
rolled up to challenge four deep into the far turn, could not quite initially quicken with the dueling leaders past the three eighths, kept on grinding though and
came back on to be clear for the place. WHEELS TURNING , fidgety in the gate, broke in the air, lagged well back, gathered some momentum off the rail
mid way on the final turn, circled six wide into the stretch and churned on. BELLO CREEDO vied between runners into and around the first turn, was
wrangled back off the winner nearing the three quarter pole, came back to bid two wide between rivals into the far turn, sparred outside the winner to about
the quarter pole, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. TUCKER THE GRUMP had speed inside rivals, rated back then angled out to stalk, moved up and
bid three wide between horses into the far turn, could not go with the leading duo past the three eighths, chased to mid stretch then faded. UNBRIDLED
PULPIT saved ground, made some progress leaving the three eighths, lacked a punch into the lane and weakened. MOSH PIT , between rivals, gave way.
WILDCARD GOLD saved ground into the backstretch and failed to respond.

MS. CAJUN QUEEN rated forwardly and saved ground off the duel leaving the far turn, eased out and bid three deep approaching the stretch, kicked clear
after being roused soon into the lane, was kept alert with a right handed ask near the furlong grounds, switched over to her left lead with about a sixteenth to
go then held firm under a steady hand ride. ABSOLUTELY settled off the pace, advanced while saving ground leaving the three eighths, came out for the
drive, moved up between rivals in mid stretch and kept on gamely to earn the place. PLANTS AND BIRDS rated off the inside early on, took closer order to
the inside of a foe mid way on the final turn, shifted out four wide for the drive, gained outside runners in mid stretch then hung a bit late while out kicked for
second. RIPTIDE ROSE disputed the pace outside a rival, held a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, raced between foes soon after, failed to go on leaving
mid stretch and faded. PSEUDOSCIENCE drafted back off the pace while saving ground, was under asking in upper stretch, eased out and had some
belated interest. CALIFORNIA CALI broke outward, stalked outside, came four wide under urging into the stretch and weakened. AVENDORE lagged back
off the pace, came wide for the drive and failed to menace. SWIZZLECITY , wide and off the early pace, edged up four wide nearing the half mile marker,
chased around the final turn then retreated through the lane. MISS G G set a pressured pace towards the inside, dueled from the far turn to the quarter pole
and weakened. SARATOGA PASODOBLE , fractious in the gate, reared at the start and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of
SARATOGA PASODOBLE. No action was deemed necessary.

BAYOU JAM rated back from between rivals leaving the gate, settled well back off the early pace, commenced a wide run leaving the far turn, circled four
wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit past the three sixteenths then leveled off nicely when put to left handed encouragement, surged past a pair of foes
leaving the sixteenth marker and drew clear. OAK HILL LG , five wide into the first turn, edged up four wide into the far turn, bid three wide outside leader
mid way on the final turn, forced the issue into the stretch, saw the leader kick clear in mid stretch, came back on between rivals with a sixteenth to go and
kept on willingly to gain the place. G VICTORY took over early and set the pace towards the inside, took pressure around the final turn, spurted back clear
under a drive in mid stretch, wandered outward and weakened late. JAZZY JUSTIN , a bit keyed up and pulling behind rivals while saving ground into the
backstretch, eased back off a runner near the half mile marker, shifted out to pursue and kept grinding through the lane. CRIMSON STORM prompted the
early pace outside the leader, chased into the clear near the three eighths and gave way. NATE'S REVENGE lagged far back, was four wide under a ride
nearing the quarter pole, angled wider for the drive and had a mild response. SERMONONTHEMOUNT saved ground and came up empty. MISCHIEF'S
MACHINE , three wide stalking the early pace, offered a mild two wide bid into the far turn, was under a hearty ride trying to keep pace past the three
eighths and weakened. MUFFIN NUTS rated behind rivals near the five eighths, lacked a kick under asking leaving the far turn and gave way.

MATH MAN rated along between rivals, steadily advanced between foes into then leaving the far turn, bid four wide outside ITELLYOUTHEFACTS
approaching the stretch, wrested command soon after and pulled away through the final furlong while kept to a drive. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS got a into a
duel outside rival soon after the break, carried that battle to the three eighths, shook clear then was engaged with a quarter to go, saw the winner get away
in mid stretch but dug in nicely to hold down the place. VALIANT DEFENDER , six wide and well off the early pace, gained six wide outside rivals nearing
the quarter pole, loomed in upper stretch but flattened out late. GENERAL EISENHOWER had speed inside and got involved in a pace scrum into the first
turn, dueled through the backstretch and into the far turn, ceded the lead three furlongs out, kept on willingly to upper stretch then gave way. DA GOLD
ROOM saved ground, angled four wide making some headway past the five sixteenths but failed to seriously kick on through the drive. CARRIES MAN
stalked the dueling leaders three wide, was under pressure past the three eighths and lacked a solid stretch run. BAQUERO'S BIND saved ground and
weakened. HOPE FOR CHANGE , three to four wide, gave way. TED STRIKER lost ground four wide, was under a hustling ride into the far turn and
weakened. XIETELEHUAS , four wide early, dropped in and retreated.

Footnotes
DANCE LIL DARLING settled off the rail, moved up and bid four deep around the far turn, emerged widest in a three way battle approaching the stretch,
wandered outward a bit then was soon corrected with a right handed ask in upper stretch, edged clear near mid stretch, kept on under right handed
encouragement inside the sixteenth marker then held sway. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE stalked about three wide, edged up and bid three wide between foes
nearing the three furlong marker, battled between runners into the stretch, saw the winner get away some in mid stretch but gamely dug back in and cut into
the margin inside that one in the final yards. WORLD OF HURT , off the pace while removed from the rail, circled four wide into the stretch and closed
steadily. DIXIE FARMER steadied off the leader's heels into the first turn, was a touch rank then settled, moved up and bid two wide between horses leaving
the far turn, dueled inside a pair of runners from the three eighths to upper stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way. R T'S GEM saved ground,
angled out near the five sixteenths and faded. WHO DAT GINGER drew clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was engaged by a trio leaving the far turn,
gave little resistance and faltered. ENTITLEMENT saved ground, faltered nearing the lane and was eased.

Footnotes
SING THE NOTES broke inward, was corrected and settled off the embattled duo past the five eighths, picked up steam five then four wide leaving the far
turn, continued wide progress into the lane, kept on grinding under left handed asks inside the sixteenth marker, gained a slim advantage in deep stretch
then prevailed between runners. SHOTGUN ANNIE drafted well back early on, was under a ride four wide mid turn, leveled off inside the three sixteenths,
shifted out wider in the final furlong and closed in to nab the place. ZONG WAVE flashed speed then was rated back off the leaders in the opening furlong,
moved up four then three wide departing the far turn, advanced with the winner into the stretch, worked between rivals and kept on gamely to the line.
SABERFIGHT had speed outside four rivals then emerged in a duel outside DREAMED I AM FAST heading to half mile marker, took over around the turn
then cleared in hand approaching the quarter pole, drifted in when put to pressure soon into the lane, clung to the lead past mid stretch, was joined by foes
nearing the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. DREAMED I AM FAST had speed between runners then dueled to the inside of SABERFIGHT,
failed to match strides with that one nearing the lane, came off the inside with pursuit past mid stretch and kept on with effort to the wire. GRACE'S
SOLDIER forced the early pace between rivals and gave way. BEAT THE DOUBLE flashed speed, chased three wide past the half mile marker, failed to
keep pace soon after and retreated. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY was sent up to the inside of runners early on, vied briefly, faltered around the turn and was
eased in the lane.
