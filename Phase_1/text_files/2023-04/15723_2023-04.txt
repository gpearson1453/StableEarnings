Footnotes
PERFETTO was well placed, early, rallied at the quarter pole, split horse in the stretch and drew clear late under strong handling. ROYAL DRAGOON was
unhurried early, rallied in the stretch five wide and closed fast to be second best. CLAW set the pace until mid stretch and weakened late. DEBDURITE
raced close up throughout and lacked a late bid. KING OF THE RING raced inside and was no threat. GOOD IDEA raced on the inside and was no menace.
ENJOY BASEBALL trailed early and was no factor. PAT DADDY contended for three quarters then gave way in the stretch. HARD N'SWEET was well
placed on the inside and tired on the far turn.
