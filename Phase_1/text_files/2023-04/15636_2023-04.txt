Footnotes
STARSHIP SUNRISE tracked in the three path, was driven around the two path rounding the turn, swung out to the five path into the lane, rallied outside of
foes and was up in the closing stages. BEAUTY OF THE SEA prompted the pace in the four path, ranged up and was cued right handed rounding the turn,
remained in the four path entering the stretch, ran on to take the lead just past the eighth pole, but was overtaken by the outer eventual winner late to finish
with place. ROYAL BLOOD brushed with an inner foe at the start and raced off the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the
turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, drifted out under left handed urging thru the lane, and finished evenly for show. OLYMPIC ARTIST
pressed in the three path, was under rousing between foes rounding the turn, but faded from the three path in the stretch. MOONLIGHT VISION rated in the
five path, was ridden in the six path entering the stretch, but was no factor. MINXY set the pace in the two path, received right handed cues into the lane, but
yielded in the final furlong. DAN'S CANDI GIRL stalked in the three path, tipped inside early around the turn and remained inside of rivals into the stretch,
but was blocked thru the stretch and unable to threaten. GREEK MOJO brushed with an outer foe at the start, chased in the four path early but never
menaced. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT THE STRETCH RUNS OF DAN'S CANDI GIRL AND MINXY.

Footnotes
RESERVENOTATTAINED led in the two path early, lost the lead to an inner foe into the turn, was driven along and floated out to the seven path into the
lane, dug in under steady urging into the final furlong, rebroke, and got back up in the final strides to win. BARONE CESCO tracked in the three path, moved
up in the five path around the turn but drifted out to the nine path entering the stretch, ran on under right handed urging for place, and missed getting up for
the win. CORDUROY ROAD vied for the lead along the inside, took a narrow advantage from the rail around the turn, extended that advantage slightly while
being cued from the three path into the lane, but evened out in the final sixteenth and was caught by a pair of outer foes in the closing stages to finish with
show. HANDSOME PRINCE stalked in the two path, was roused midway around the turn and under right handed urging entering the stretch, but was one
paced. INCITATUS pressed in the three path early but backed up around the turn. TENURE dwelt at the start and trailed throughout from the two to five
paths. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT THE START OF TENURE, NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TENURE

Footnotes
COOLER KING stalked the pace three wide, could not gain in upper stretch, kept on outside and was up and clear late. CHAPLIN was reluctant to load,
dueled inside of JETAROS, was bumped by that foe in upper stretch, drifted out in midstretch bumped JETAROS, dug in to fend off that foe but was unable
to resist the winner late. JETAROS dueled two wide, came in and bumped in upper stretch, was bumped in midstretch and outfinished between foes late.
AJAAYB lacked speed while racing three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. LITTLE SKIPPY chased the pace two wide and lacked
the needed rally. MAPTITUDE played no factor while racing two wide. BIG BALLOONS saved ground and failed to menace. THE COMPAS MAN (IRE)
raced off the pace inside, swung five wide in upper stretch and never threatened. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF JETAROS AGAINST CHAPLIN
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

angled out to the center passing the eighth pole, and rallied to get up in the closing stages. NEOPHYTE chased in the five path, was driven around the turn
and in the seven path entering the stretch, ran on to take a short lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. GOLDEN SODA
raced off the pace in the three path, was under a light hand ride along the inside around the turn, tipped out to the five path into the lane, was stymied in
upper stretch, found an opening between foes in the three path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. BANKER'S HOURS stalked along the rail,
tipped out under coaxing around the turn and was in the six path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on but was out-finished late. FORTY FLASH was
hustled along in range around the four path, under a ride around the turn and floated out to the center into the stretch, but was one paced. STRONG AGAIN

narrow lead passing the quarter pole and was cued from the four path into the lane, but yielded. BRIT'S CANDYMAN dueled for the lead in the two path but
gaveway at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
ALLEY OOP JOHNNY set a pressured pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane, edged ahead of INDY LYON leaving the sixteenth pole,
came out under left-handed urging and lightly bumped that foe in deep stretch, was steadied to straighten out soon after and dug in inside of the runner-up
to prevail. VLADISLAV raced in range three wide, rallied outside and just missed. INDY LYON dueled outside of the winner to the sixteenth pole, could not
quite match strides leaving that marker then steadied when that foe drifted out and made light contact in deep stretch. XY TIME bobbled at the start, saved
ground in range and had a mild rally. VAN DUSEN (GB) failed to menace while racing two and three wide. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH lagged inside, angled
out in upper stretch, rallied belatedly and was in tight late. NERVES OF STEEL stalked the pace inside and faded in the lane. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND REVIEWED OBJECTIONS FROM THE CONNECTIONS OF INDY LYON AGAINST THE WINNER AND TOOK NO
ACTION AFTER RULING THE INTERFERENCE DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE.

PEOPLE FORCE stalked in the four path, bid in the three path around the far turn, took over the lead and opened up from the four path into the stretch, and
was much the best. ARTICO bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated along the inside, was coaxed from the rail around the far turn, tipped out to the five
path into the lane, drifted in against left handed cues, but kept on for place. NIKKI NOOTS was unhurried in the three path, cued right handed rounding the
far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and got up for show under right handed urging. COACH ABERNATHY got pinched at the start, raced in
midpack around the five path, ranged up around the far turn and took aim entering the lane, but flattened. PLUMA ROJA raced wellback around the four
path, was under rousing around the far turn and in the five path entering the stretch, but was no factor. HELLO JACK tracked in the four path but faded
around the three path in the stretch. NOVA FOLHA broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace under a hold around the three path, was coaxed in the
two path midway around the far turn, but gaveway into the lane.

Footnotes
XY SPEED settled off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed between foes and was up in deep stretch. CAPTURE THE
TIME tracked the pace in the clear in the three path, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging in upper stretch and ran on outside of the winner to gain the
place late. SILARDI pressed the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and yielded near the sixteenth pole. NERVE set the
pace along the rail and weakened in the final furlong. DISCREET TUNE chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the
needed rally. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF failed to menace while racing two and three wide. OVERTAXED was outrun while racing three wide. AERONAUT trailed
inside.

Footnotes
TEPPER traveled up close in the three path around the first turn, tipped out to the five path and bumped an outer foe into the backstretch, bid into the far
turn and took command while shifting to the three path midway around the far turn, was cued right handed from the two path into the lane, and drew clear in
the final sixteenth. STRAIGHT TIME tracked in the four path around the first turn but was bumped out to the six path by an inner foe into the backstretch,
ranged up in the four path around the far turn and bid at the top of the stretch, ran on to sustain that bid in upper stretch, but was repelled in the final furlong
to place. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP rated in the three path, was roused in the four path early around the far turn and ridden from the five path into the lane, and
kept on for show. IMPETUOUS SOUL raced from behind in the three path, advanced under a drive around the far turn and swung out to the six path into the
stretch, but finished evenly. PARADISE DRIVE chased in the four path, steadied passing the five-eighths point, was under rousing in the five path around
the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, but flattened. CANTILLATE steadied along the inside rounding the first turn and travelled off the
pace around the two path, but never factored. FLORIDA STAR prompted the pace in the four path but gaveway around the far turn. TICO G stalked along
the inside but was done after a half. SHEA ON THE LAM set the pace in the two path but backed up around the far turn. NO CHANGES WERE MADE
AFTER AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF STRAIGHT TIME AGAINST THE WINNER, TEPPER, ALLEDGING INTERFERCE TURNING
INTO THE BACKSTRETCH.
