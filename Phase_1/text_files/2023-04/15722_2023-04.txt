Footnotes
LIBERTY LIBERTY brushed with TONY'S BABE early then dueled inside that rival, fought two wide into the stretch, then drew clear in the late stages.
TONY'S BABE brushed with LIBERTY LIBERTY early then dueled outside that rival, battled three to four wide into the stretch, became a bit rank near the
sixteenth pole and was outkicked by the winner. WETHERLY chased the top pair from inside to two wide around the bend, lacked the needed response in
the drive and held the show. FACE OF GRACE chased in range off the rail into the turn, lost ground on the inside around the bend and failed to rally. FOR
MY BROTHER tracked the leaders from off the rail, moved to the two path on the turn then eased back out leaving the bend and weakened.
