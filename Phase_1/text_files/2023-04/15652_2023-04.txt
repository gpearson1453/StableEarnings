EXCLUSIVE ROSE accelerated to the lead two deep at the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on.
KELSEY'S ANGEL gave chase, raced in the three and four paths on the turn, dug in to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner. SULTRY
SALLY H chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two and three paths then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. ESTILO AMOROSO

COASTAL MISSION took over nearing the three quarter pole, moved to the rail and was firmly rated, kept the advantage at the rail on the turn, drifted
leaving the turn though, won handily. FREEDOM RIDER exchanged contact with LATE IN THE GAME leaving the gate, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the turn and proved no match in the lane. The latter exchanged contact with Freedom Rider leaving the gate then saved
ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted leaving the turn and flattened stride. FORTY STRIPES rounded the
opening turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. CANDY INVASION
raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened stride in the five path of the far turn. STEAL THE CASH
rated close to the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
CHROME HEIR settled in the three path early on, progressed from the half mile pole and took the lead three wide approaching the five sixteenths, widened
at the rail on the far turn and was taken in hand through the lane. ONLY GET'N BETTER raced well back inside, bid leaving the half mile pole, rounded the
far turn in the five path and came along for second. BIG REDWHITEBLUE took the lead at the rail nearing the seven eighths pole and rated the pace, was
met toward the three eighths, dueled from that point but dropped back between horses at the five sixteenths, raced in the three path of the far turn and
flattened in the lane. ENANO saved ground well off the early pace, eased out on the second turn and gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. ADARA saved ground off the pace, closed toward contention at the rail on the second turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LIGHT WORK raced well off the early pace about the three
path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. TIZNOW TIME drifted at the seven eighths pole then
stalked, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths but weakened approaching the far turn. SHADE TREE CORNER rated close to the early pace then
faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
MIZZEN stalked three wide on the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dueled to the lead
mid-stretch and inched clear nearing the wire. TOUT ENSEMBLE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved off the rail on the
far turn then dug in at the rail through the lane to take second the final yards. KOBE'S GIRL moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
HIGHWAY QUEEN raced well back off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn and could only close
the gap in the lane. SALAMINA settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch then flattened stride while losing ground on the far turn.
LADY LICIOUS rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. CAPTIVATING

Footnotes
NO DENYING DENIS was bumped leaving the gate and saved ground well off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
turn about the five path, was carried out into the lane, lugged in leaving the turn but took over late yards and held on well. LUCKY BLONDE saved ground,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, dueled through the stretch to take second late yards but was outfinished for the
win. KEEP ON SPURRIN ducked in and made contact with No Denying Denis leaving the gate then settled in the three path, bid past the seven sixteenths
pole, took the lead three wide approaching the quarter, raced clear midway on the turn but was met mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth.
LAUGHINTOTHEBANK saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, angled
out toward the head of the lane, was blocked at the heels of No Denying Denis mid-stretch, but came back to finish evenly. IHEARTRAINACOMN stalked
from the two and three paths, challenged and took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole but was met approaching the quarter, raced close through the far
turn and ran evenly in the lane. FRENCHIES GOLD bobbled at the break, rounded the first turn about the four path then gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. NEW AGE BAD GIRL raced well back off the rail
on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. NEAREST N DEAREST was
not a factor. MAKINLIMMARGARITAS rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
DENALI D'ORO closed to the lead while tapering inward, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled close from that point, rounded the far turn at the
rial and weakened. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Keep On Spurring for alleged interference mid-stretch, lodged
by the rider of Iheartrainacomn.

Footnotes
CHINA CAT stumbled leaving the gate and saved ground well back, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, raced off the rail
on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to take the nod in the final strides. STYLISH PAINT stalked the early pace, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dueled for the nod nearing mid-stretch and drew briefly clear, was allowed to relax in late
yards and was nipped under the wire. TURN TO ME SUCREE moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was met toward mid-stretch and relented later yards. ONEPRETTYTHING rounded the opening turn
about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. SO RED THE
ROSE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened in the lane. DON'T
MAKE ME BEG rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase into the backstretch but showed little response. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT saved
ground well off the pace and showed little response. DUSTWHIRL WONDER was not a factor.
