Footnotes
RED HOT CAT Stalked four wide from the outset, travelled well within himself into the bend three wide, loomed large at the eighth pole, surged through
stretch, got up in final strides. BLUE CHIP BETTY Hustled from the blocks but was outsprinted by LIL MISS MISCHIEF to the lead, settled on the rail into
the turn, rallied along the rail through the lane, made the lead around the sixteenth pole but was caught in the late stages. LIL' MISS MISCHIEF Broke on
top and made the lead easily, led clearly to just inside the eighth pole while also shifting to the two path, outfinished down the stretch. CURRENTLY KRAZY
Moved well off the pace while widest of all, circled in the four path on the turn, came with a willingly and belated run through the stretch. LOST THE
MINISTER Was outrun by all early and could only progress beyond tiring foes. CANT DO THE DANSE Missed the break a touch, moved up quickly to stalk
three wide, never improved. MIDNIGHT DRAMA Stalked along the rail from the break, idled when called upon in the same path at the quarter pole and
never progressed. SWITCH BACK Stalked two wide in a throng of horses, got in tight into the turn and checked out of a spot at the quarter pole, recovered
by swinging to the eight path for the stretch run, finished evenly.

Footnotes
KIND BUT SHE LIES Enforced position two wide into the first turn, cleared to rail into the backside, led through the backstretch and around the turn,
maintained advantage into the stretch while shifting to the two path, re-engaged at the sixteenth, held on. LOVELY LOLA Pinched slightly at the start, forced
to settle in the rear, swung three wide in the move to the backstretch, commenced three wide at the five-sixteenths pole with steady progress, dove to the
rail at the three-sixteenths, surged inside of rival, repelled late. LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN Moved three wide into the first turn, pressed two wide into the
backstretch, in the three path into the lane, evenly home. YOU NEVER CALL Traveled four wide into the first turn, settled three wide while stalking the top
duo, remained in touch to the eighth pole while forced to the four path, faded late. ARCTIC FIRE Hustled from the inside draw to hold the rail but was
ultimately cleared and forced to stalk in behind the top trio, stayed in touch to the three eighths before dropping back, drifted to the four path around the turn,
had nothing left late. TOSSAPENNYDOWN Settled in the rear between, maintained position until being called upon at the three-sixteenths in the three path,
never menaced. AWESOME GALAXY Traveled off the pace on the rail and never improved position.

Footnotes
DR. TROUTMAN Hard sent to the lead from the outside draw, moved three wide into the first turn, went one path inward to duel on the outside, stayed in
toe with rival all the way to the end of the stretch, lifted in final strides to get up in time. SHARK HARBOR Hustled from inner draw, held the rail throughout,
dueled inside through the backstretch, kept in fight to the line but could not muster enough. TIZ TENACIOUS Stalked two wide throughout, loomed in the
three path on the turn, tried through the lane, third best. EMPEROR'S CHOICE Brushed slightly outside at the start, between top flight runners into the first
turn, took hold to stalk right in behind on the inside paths, idled when running picked up on the turn, came home evenly and on the wrong lead down the
stretch. ORATORY GLORY Settled on the rail into the first turn, tracked inside of rivals, swung to the four path for the stretch, finished with mild interest.
OUTLAW BY NATURE Forced into the four path on the first turn, dove to the rail up the backstretch and held path throughout, came under a ride at the
three-eighths, progressed on the turn, finished evenly. BULLY RIDE Moved in the three path in the second flight, moved out a path for the stretch, was no
menace. TRACK BOUND Tracked off the pace two deep throughout, dropped back at the quarter pole, not asked home.

MINISTERSDON'TLIE Tucked in a pocket when cleared off by ROYAL TAP, bided time while confidently handled in behind dueling leaders, waited till seam
opened along the rail at the eighth pole, took off down the lane and ridden out. ROYAL TAP Dueled outside of rival from the break, stayed in battle through
the turn, shifted to the three path into the lane, no match for eventual winner, just bested the rest. NORTH DAWN Cleared to lead, joined in duel by an
outside rival, stayed in fray to the eighth when shifting out a path, vied for minors down the lane. ALEX'S GIRL Bobbled at the break, sat off the dueling
leaders, circled boldly three wide, wrong lead stretch, flattened late. WICKED BLUE Broke slightly outwards, lagged far behind, commenced at the quarter
pole, three wide lane, mildly late. HULA KING Settled on the rail in the second flight, between rivals turn, outrun late. ROCKY JACK Moved four wide into
the first turn, shifted to the rail on the turn, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SPEEDING STYLE Stalked in the two path from the break, maintained position until moving to the lead at the five-sixteenths, opened up on the field at the
three-sixteenths, drew off to a convincing win. TWO GUNS Stalked three wide, swung four wide third turn, flew late, second best. BIG CITY BANE Tracked
two wide between rivals opening stages, idled on the far turn, shifted to the six path for the stretch run, finished up with a belated run. TEXAS LONG BOW
Stalked four wide and widest early, moved two wide first time by the stands, forced three wide on the last turn, finished up evenly. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY
Tracked in the third flight along the rail, maintained inner paths throughout, ridden at the three-eighths pole but failed to improve. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM Led
from the outset, maintained until being overtaken by the quarter pole, empty late. PEACE OF EKATI Detached in the early stages, switched out and ridden
at the three-eighths pole, fanned to the four path on the last turn, flattened out down the stretch. POLITICAL RIOT Tracked the widest of all throughout in
about the five path, asked to pick up at the seven-sixteenths, never a menace.
