Footnotes
FIRE EXTINGUISHER settled off the pace in behind the leaders racing in about the three path early, edged a bit closer still in behind runners two to three
wide on the far turn, angled five wide turning into upper stretch, struck the lead soon after and forged clear under steady but moderate urging. BIG SKIPPER
was caught outside runners five to six wide on the first turn, was carried nine deep by a drifting rival leaving that bend, continued to attend outside and just
off the leaders going four to five deep on the far turn and in contention, could not kick on with the winner but held the place. GHOST STRATEGY was
forwardly-positioned but caught four to five wide between runners into the first turn, steadied slightly and was taken back passing the three-quarter pole as
an inside rival drifted out, tucked back in three to four wide racing mid-pack, angled six deep in upper stretch and kicked on willingly but needed more. MR
OKLAHOMA CITY angled in early while reserved at the rear, steadily advanced on the far turn moving out seven wide for the drive, ran on mildly late.
SMART CALL raced just off the leaders two wide early, moved forward to take the lead coming to the five-eighths, was pressured up the backstretch and
overtaken early on the far turn, continued to weaken in the stretch. PARABELLUM raced three to four wide between runners into the first turn, had the lead
setting the pace but bore out to the eight path leaving that bend, was overtaken but regained momentum while shifting in to press up the backstretch, retook
the lead three furlong from home, weakened in the stretch. MAJOR GRIFFIN saved ground, failed to menace. DEL MOON settled last but one shifting in to
save ground on the rail early, moved out a path up the backstretch then back to the rail coming to the stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LUCKY MCCOY broke on top but settled in to stalk the pace from just off the leaders outside, went five wide into the turn emerging seven wide from that
bend and making a bid, took command by the three-sixteenths, edged clear and held safe. PONZA pressed the pace from inside rivals, contended in the
two path on the turn, drifted out four deep leaving that bend, exchanged a light brush with a foe in upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner but kept on to
hold the place. HERO TIME was forwardly-positioned between runners three wide into the turn, moved out five wide by the top of the stretch, exchanged
minor brushing in upper stretch, was outkicked and missed second. FORT NECESSITY forced the pace, went four to six wide on the turn, lacked the
needed late kick. TRUE DOMINUS switched off the inside racing three wide into the turn and well back of the leaders, swung seven wide for the stretch and
improved position. HOLCOMBE broke a half-step slowly, raced at the back going four to five wide on the turn, improved position in the lane. MAJESTIC
LOVER broke a bit awkwardly, moved forward under mild encouragement, was within range of the leaders six wide on the turn floating eight wide into upper
stretch, failed to rally. LATENT SHADOW had forward position between runners, was shuffled back entering the turn, failed to rally. FOREVER INDIAN
lacked early speed, came into upper stretch nine wide, failed to menace. KENNY T broke a half-step slowly, raced inside, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WESTONS WILDCAT got away well but settled in to stalk the leading pair while switching outside those two heading up the backstretch, edged closer
outside four wide on the turn, was in command at the top of the stretch and drew off when roused. REVIVAL chased the leaders, saved ground on the turn,
advanced inside rivals in upper stretch to gain and secure the place but was no match for the winner. TIME MACHINE pressed the leader from outside,
contended three wide coming to the top of the stretch, could not kick on but captured show honors. BAYRON was urged forward between runners to the
lead, set a pressured pace racing in the two path, weakened in the stretch. EUROMANTIC chased off the pace in the two to three path through the turn,
failed to menace. VERRAZANO FIRST raced off the inside early, went in the three to four path on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. HOLD
TIGHT was outpaced trailing the field, saved ground on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
BRING IT ON BABY stalked the early pace, advanced three wide into the turn taking the lead past the three-eighths, was clear in mid-stretch and held sway
while being kept to the task. SURE SHOT SHELLY settled mid-pack, went three wide on the turn, followed the eventual winner moving between rivals in
upper stretch, closed the gap but needed more. MAMASHAVNAHOTFLASH was ridden along strongly three furlongs out going four wide on the turn, lacked
the needed late kick but held show honors. SMART OKIE settled at the back, went three then four wide on the turn, came out a bit further in upper stretch,
ran on with mild late interest but just missed show. SIGICRICKET raced two wide on the turn and asked for more at the quarter pole, ran on evenly. HEADY
MOVES got away alertly, was overtaken and content to press from outside two wide, weakened. BECAUSE broke a half step slowly, saved ground on the
turn, failed to threaten. GOSPEL MOLLY lacked early speed, raced off the inside in about the three to four path through the turn at the rear, made no bid.
HEATIN UP was urged forward from the break, set the pace inside facing pressure, gave way.

Footnotes
ABSAROKA was strongly urged from the break to move clear and set the pace, raced on or just off the rail, was all out in the stretch and held from a late
challenger. JACKS SPRING BREAK settled at the back, raced mostly five wide, was gaining steadily in the stretch while drifting in late but missed.
NOMOREMRNICEGUY shifted in early, advanced inside up the backstretch, was within striking distance leaving the far turn, fought for show honors while
making no late headway on the winner. LIMBO'S PROMISE stalked three wide just off the leader, ran evenly and was outfinished for third. KWIK settled off
the pace, went three to four wide on the turns, improved position in the stretch. POKER PLAY switched out on the first turn, raced off the pace three to four
wide, needed more. JOHN ALLEN passed tired rivals. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY was in tight after the break, raced toward the back near the rail, failed to rally
in the lane. EXCITING pursued the three to four wide, came up empty and faded. LEGIONARY switched outside rivals early on the first turn, raced mostly
two to four wide in a forward position early, steadily dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CAT TALE SKY chased three wide with some early encouragement, kept on to take command outside the furlong grounds, kicked clear and held. SECRET
PASS bumped lightly with a rival at the start, tracked in behind near the inside, angled four wide turning for home, rallied to get up for second. OKIE HOPE
had the early lead setting a pressured pace inside, kept on in the stretch, held show honors. GREEN LIGHT GIRL broke outwardly a bit, settled well off the
pace, rallied near inside through the stretch moving in and out for room but was too late and missed third. PASSION FOR SAND broke just a half-step
slowly and was forced out a hair, made a rapid sweeping outside move six deep on the turn to reach contention but could not sustain the effort and flattened
out in the stretch. NAUGHTY NOELLE lacked early speed, angled nine wide turning into the stretch and gained late. MY GOLDEN PRIZE exchanged a
bump and was in a bit tight at the start, settled mid-pack near the inside, shifted six wide coming to the midpoint of the turn while advancing mildly, ran on
evenly. PASCALA was mildly coaxed from the break to press the pace, took a narrow lead about the half, tussled outside then between foes and weakened
thereafter. BOTTLES AN BIBLES chased four wide, came up empty. BIKER BABE was within range five wide, dropped back and faded. SAY WHAT YOU
WILL was never a threat racing near the inside.

Footnotes
OUR CORNERSTONE vied outside four wide into the turn, took a narrow lead past the three-eighths, lost the lead but fought on gamely in the stretch and
got the nod. WRANGLERED moved forward to set the pace from off the rail, was soon joined by outside foes, vied inside those just off the fence, fought on
gamely through the stretch but just missed. MEGA BOND vied between runners from the half going three wide on the turn, fought on gamely, just missed.
RONALD DALE switched out racing off the pace and the inside part of the track, swung six deep coming to the top of the stretch, gained willingly but too
late. J B'S LEGACY was coaxed along early but lacking sufficient early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, ran on with mild late interest. EURO
SUPRISE chased in behind the leading trio three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. SPECTACTICAL chased briefly, dropped back inside, failed to
rally. CATALE STORM tracked up close inside, went in the two path on the turn, came out more for the stretch run and steadily weakened. CHARING
CROSS was a bit slow to gather and lacking early speed, moved off the inside coming to the stretch and was never near enough to threaten.

chased from between runners in the second flight going four wide into the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch, kept on in the lane to capture the place.
AZUSA STREET raced well back early, swung nine wide, closed for show. RUN DOTTIE RUN chased from inside the second flight but off the rail, went
three deep on the turn drawing closer to the lead while floating five wide out of that bend and in contention, lacked the needed late kick. FLASHY GAIL
advanced two wide to within striking range in behind the leaders late on the turn, was between rivals in upper stretch but needed more late. PREACH IT
GIRL rated off the leaders in behind three to five wide, improved position in the lane. NITRO NINA advanced along the rail, flattened out. MISS CARMEN
CIBO was close up outside six wide through the turn but weakened in the stretch. RUNNIN BOOTS was caught seven wide on the turn advancing on the
leaders, failed to rally. HELLO IN THERE was a bit fractious in the gate with the rider falling off and out of the back side of the gate, was urged forward from

Footnotes
DISTORTED FLASH stalked the leaders, advanced three to four wide on the turn, struck the lead near the furlong grounds, was clear in late stretch and just
held while being kept to the task. AQUILA MOON raced off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, was gaining late but just missed. ADRIA pressed two
to three wide into the turn, took a narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in upper stretch and outkicked but kept on well enough to save show
honors. TIFFANY TWIST switched off the inside early, appeared to be getting out a bit on the turn racing several paths removed from the rail, altered in a bit
at the top of the stretch in behind several runners, found room between late and rallied but just missed show. DICEY hopped just slightly at the start, came
six wide to the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. RAGAN'S JET moved clear under urging to set the pace, soon faced outside pressure leaving
the backstretch and racing on or just off the rail, gave way in the lane. STAR OF THE NORTH showed brief foot to chase, dropped back in behind the
leaders, faded thereafter, was not persevered with late and walked off.

Footnotes
LATE NITE RADIO was outsprinted early, caught four wide on the turn, shifted in a bit leaving that bend, advanced inside rivals in upper stretch, moved out
in mid-stretch, took aim and rallied past late to prevail going away. MEGA SHACK moved to lead soon after the start, set the tempo two to three wide, was
engaged by an outside rival midway on the turn, dueled with that one, began to edge away past the furlong marker but was outkicked and caught while
second best. PEPPERMINT CANDY was urged forward, advanced into the turn going three to four wide on that bend and engaging the leader at the
five-sixteenths, dueled to mid-stretch and was outkicked. MAJESTIC LIAISON raced mid-pack early, went about four wide into the turn, swung out leaving
that bend, was eight wide in upper stretch and kept on for the minor award. MONEY EXPRESS stalked off the leaders four to five wide, needed more.
CAPTAIN DOZER raced off the rail in behind the leaders in the second flight, moved out seven wide turning into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick.
CURIOUS IRISH raced on or just off the rail and was never a threat. GOSPEL BONANZA was fractious behind the gate and hard to load, steadied slightly
after the break when in tight, raced toward the back off the inside and was never near enough to threaten. LANGMEAD got away well, chased inside, came
up empty. LITTLE MAD MAX was hard to load, chased briefly three to four wide, dropped back and faded. OKLAHOMA MOON hopped slightly at the start,
was unable to threaten.
