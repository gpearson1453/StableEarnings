Footnotes
TURNSANDCONDITIONS dropped back under coaxing, angled out late on the backstretch, went three then four wide around the turn, rallied six wide into
the stretch, closed fast to engulf the other three foes just inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging to prove much the best. CHARGER
chased the pace on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, pursued the leader in the three to four path around the turn, made a brief bid in upper
stretch but proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE was away well and showed the way early, lost the lead
before the nine-sixteenths, dropped back late on the backstretch, shifted from the rail to the three path on the turn, pursued the leader into upper stretch and
weakened. MAJOR SPIN was reluctant to load then broke a half-step slow, moved up while hustled to get the lead on the outside before the
nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path while roused for more on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch under a drive, lost the advantage to the winner just
inside the three-sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
MY FRIENDS BEER five paths off the inside in aim of the front down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to take command three
furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole,
dug in and held clear to prevail. MOUNT TRAVERS six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to just secure the place honors over a rival on the wire.
HAMMERIN AAMER coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up
a mild kick to miss for the place honors. PIT BOSS chased three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CORKMAN coaxed from the start, chased five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, angled three wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. DARK STORM chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SILIPO leapt up and broke through the gate prior to the start and was
reloaded, showed the way in hand four then three wide before tucking to the two path into the turn coming under threat to the outside, yielded the front near
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

Footnotes
GOIN' GOOD was hustled from the gate, allowed the leader to pass coming to the five-eighths then tracked that foe on the outside, issued a challenge in
the two path on the turn, took the advantage into upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up under a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole and
proved best under a strong hand-ride in the final sixteenth. MAC THE PEE H DEE moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
vied inside while challenged by the winner on the turn, lost the advantage to that opponent into upper stretch, fought under a drive into the final furlong and
was outfinished while just able to get the place. POPPY FLOWER veered out at the start, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn then
driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. SPUN GLASS settled
off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and also finished willingly but just
missed the show. HIT THE WOAH was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and
lacked the needed kick.

Footnotes
MAJORITY PARTNER forwardly placed from the start, knocked heads while six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch early on before
advancing to take sole command nearing the half mile pole, tucked four wide through the turn and shook away, continued four wide into upper stretch, held
clear under a drive kept to task. OUSTER came out with seven and a half furlongs to run forcing IN THE UNION to steady off his heels, chased two to three
wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a drive and
offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. LUNI SIMA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, dug in and kept on angling out slightly as OUSTER drifted out safely in front and was
along best of the rest. SHIPSATIONAL five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. DUST DEVIL got bumped between foes and bobbled at the start, chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, spun two to three wide for home and tired. THREE JOKERS broke in at the start bumping
DUST DEVIL in concert with IN THE UNION, dueled from the two path briefly with MAJORITY PARTNER down the backstretch, got headed nearing the half
mile pole and chased inside through the turn and in the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. IN THE UNION broke out at the start bumping DUST
DEVIL in tandem with the aforementioned foe, got steadied off the heels of OUSTER as that rival tipped out directly in front with seven and a half furlongs to
run, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

in the two path before the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AWESOME FORCE brushed with a rival leaving the chute,
moved in while in hand, pulled under restraint into the first turn, went around most of that bend in the two path then dropped to the inside, settled along the

Footnotes
WHITTINGTON PARK dropped off the pace, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably down the backstretch, moved from three to five wide
under urging on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the embattled due in front into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth
and got up late under strong urging. WILD BANKER went three to four wide on the first turn, tracked the leading duo on the outside, made a bid late on the
backstretch, took the lead in the three path early on the far turn, dropped to the two path under pressure near the five-sixteenths, responded well when
asked for his best in upper stretch, fended off SIX PERCENT determinedly into the final sixteenth but was denied by the winner late while clear for the place.
SIX PERCENT went four to five wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the four path with three
furlongs to run, dropped to the three path near the five-sixteenths, battled outside the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished
while well clear for the show. FULL MOON FEVER angled in at the rear early, disliked the kickback nearing the first turn, traveled around that bend in the
two path, settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. SUNDAESWITHSANDY had his
saddle adjusted behind the gate, was sent hard from the gate, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, set a joint pace on the inside of a foe,
vied inside while urged along on the far turn and tired. DATESFREEDOM showed speed on the inside of two opponents, was taken back off the pace
midway through the first turn, tugged hard on the bit under stout restraint early on the backstretch then settled more kindly, saved ground under urging on
the far turn and came up empty. MICROSECOND was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, set a joint
pace on the outside, came up empty in the two path early on the turn, moved to the three path later on that bend, ducked out seven wide under a
left-handed crop at the quarter-pole and faltered.
