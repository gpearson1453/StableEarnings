Footnotes
DON BERNARDO , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep, closed determinedly outside horses and was up approaching the
finish. MISTER RIPSTER rushed up along the inner rail down the backstretch, hugged the rail around the turn, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch,
drifted and bobbled near the sixteenth pole. NOT AS LUCKY AS US , along the inner rail around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and rallied.
ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied mildly. DOC ROCK
prompted the pace outside MISTER RIPSTER around the turn, his rider had a difficult time drawing his whip turning for home and weakened in the drive.
SHIP MASTER lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and failed to be a factor. RECKLESS AFFAIR , wide around the turn, was outrun.
APPENDAGE , between horses down the backstretch, chased the pace to mid turn then gave way. EXPECT LUCKY was a brief factor between horses
down the backstretch. ASK HIM OAKEY , caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ALL THREES pulled his way to the lead early on, set a rated pace towards the rail while handling outside pressure from EVERETT'S SONG, responded
when asked in upper stretch and spurted away, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong and had enough to last. EVERETT'S SONG
prompted the pace outside the winner, was shoved along leaving the far turn, saw the winner get away soon into the lane, stayed on under stout
encouragement and had his comeback fall just short. BE BETTER tracked towards the inside, swung out four to five wide for a clear run entering the lane,
straightened away and made a grinding run to gain. IT'S SIZZLING TIME rated off the pace while saving ground, edged up nearing mid stretch, eased out
then flattened out late. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , away alertly, was rated back soon after and allowed to leaders to go on, lost ground four wide outside
foes mid turn, failed to kick on under asking into the lane and faded. WALK AWAY JOE , off the pace and removed from the rail, was under a ride around
the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and came up empty. ONE TEN broke a step slow, settled off the pace, angled wide and lacked a rally.
GUILLAUME , four then three wide early while stalking the pace, raced between runners mid turn, failed to kick on nearing the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INDIAN LAKE rushed up along the inner rail to take command approaching the stretch, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and eagerly pulled away while under
encouragement. JOHN THE BEAR showed speed, was kept well off the inner rail down the backstretch and on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted
out late and held the place. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , outside horses around the turn while in a striking position, was fanned six wide turning for home and
flattened out. PYRON lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and in the stretch and passed tired rivals. CYNERGY'S STAR , a forward factor inside
horses in the two around the turn, weakened. CASANOVA KITTEN raced along the inner rail throughout and was no factor. TOP BOSS advanced four wide
leaving the turn then weakened in the drive. MAYA PRINCE , outrun, was eased.

NIMITZ CLASS broke alertly and vied between foes into the first turn, secured the inside and dueled under rating with NOSTALGIC RUN through the
backstretch run, wrested command five eighths out, cleared a furlong later, drew out to big lead while still under rating past the five sixteenths, entered the
lane two wide, was put to strong encouragement soon after, wandered outward under a drive inside the sixteenth marker and held sway. AMERICAN
D'ORO settled inside and well off the contested early pace, came off the inside and sharply moved three wide between runners near the five sixteenths,
sustained his run and steadily bridged the gap. FOREWARNED , far back early on and outside a rival, came four wide for the drive, progressed between
runners near mid stretch and churned on to gain the show. VANCE SCHOLARS , sent from the gate to contend into the first turn, rated back off the leaders
near the seven eighths ands stalked, came off the rail and was put to a hustling ride leaving the half mile marker, circled four wide with pursuit into the lane,
failed to kick on and faded through the final furlong. AIN'T DA BEER COLD , four wide early, stalked the dueling leaders while outside VANCE SCHOLARS,
was pushed along leaving the far turn, dropped in past the five sixteenths and weakened. NOSTALGIC RUN , three deep into the first turn, sparred outside
the winner and held a slim early advantage, was headed near the five eighths, stayed on to give willing chase to the quarter pole then weakened.

five eighths, tracked a contested pace past the three eighths, shifted out in upper stretch, brushed with ALBERTANO when working between runners and
under left handed asks in mid stretch, sustained under steady hand encouragement, took command soon past the sixteenth pole and eagerly drew out.
MILITARY HOP prompted the pace outside VELVET GHOST, moved to near even terms mid turn, dueled into the lane, spurted clear soon after, widened
past near the three sixteenths, could not fend off the winner leaving the sixteenth marker, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. SICILIA MIKE drafted
well back early, edged up well wide and outside rivals past the three eighths, circled six wide into the lane and leveled off to a good stride to gain through
the final sixteenth. ALBERTANO tracked the leaders three wide, brushed with the winner near mid stretch, switched over to his left lead with about a
sixteenth to go and hung late. VELVET GHOST grabbed command early and cleared, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure into the turn, dueled
around the turn and into the lane then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. HAGLER edged up between rivals early on, chased between around the
turn, swung out in mid stretch and churned on. CURLINGTON , four to five wide, made a mild move past the three eighths, chased into the stretch and
faded. EL HERMANO , bumped and in tight at the break, lagged far back, was urged off the rail mid turn, swung well wide and failed to generate a serious
run. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , jostled and pinched back at the break, saved ground edging up into the turn, chased into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
GOODGIRL BADHABITS bore out leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, raced slightly off the rail around the turn and steadily pulled away
through the stretch under mild coaxing. MAJOR HOULIHAN , closed up early, failed to keep pace around the turn while saving ground, remained along the
rail through the stretch and rallied. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD drifted out leaving the starting gate, was three deep chasing the winner around the turn and
weakened. GOLDIENESS , a forward factor early, raced in the two path on the turn and gave way entering the stretch. MISS FUSSY PANTS , three wide
around the turn, gave way late. SIX THE HARD WAY , outrun, was eased.

Footnotes
MISTY MAUVE settled in the clear while not far back, gathered some momentum when coaxed along leaving the half, dropped in mid turn, swung back out
for the drive, closed in under strong handling and engaged the dueling leaders from the outside, took over in mid stretch then edged through the final
sixteenth while kept to task. SILVER CURRENCY tracked outside a rival, edged up and joined MIT MAZEL from her outside leaving the far turn, dueled
under some rating around the turn, battled under a ride into the lane, kept on between foes in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was clear for the place.
MIT MAZEL was hard sent between rivals leaving the chute, spurted clear under asking then secured the inside, was joined by SILVER CURRENCY after a
half, sparred with that one around the turn and into the lane, stayed on to the inside of rivals in mid stretch then weakened through the final sixteenth.
DECIDING VOTE stumbled at the break and dropped far off the early pace, came three wide for the drive, shifted in some and had belated action. YOUENS
, three wide and off the pace, made a mild run around the turn, shifted out and faded. DOUBLE FIREBALL showed speed towards the rail then rated back
off MIT MAZEL, stalked along the rail, came out around the turn to pursue, failed to kick on nearing the stretch and weakened.

deep near the quarter pole, spun five wide into the lane, wrested command inside the three sixteenths, responded to sharp rousing and eagerly drew clear.

straightened away and came back on with good energy in the final sixteenth to nab the place. KARAN'S NOTION prompted the pace outside the leader,
moved to apply more pressure past the five sixteenths, held a slim lead four wide and between rivals entering the stretch, ceded the lead heading towards

three sixteenths then weakened. SYNTHESIS checked between runners soon after the start, checked again when in tight nearing the turn, pursued four

Footnotes
FOWL NATION disputed the pace outside BUY HJER PAY HERE, put that one away entering the stretch, remained on his left lead through the lane and
prevailed under urging. SIR SMOAK , unhurried for five furlongs, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied nicely. HE'S ON FIRE
hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, was well placed into the lane and flattened out. SMART AND FAST ,
three wide mid way on the turn, was taken to the five path at the head of the stretch and lacked a rally. OROCOVIX lacked speed, raced between horses
most of the trip and failed to rally. TROPHY ROOM , three wide chasing the pace for a half mile, gave way and was eased. BUY HERE PAY HERE disputed
the pace while along the inner rail, failed to keep up leaving the turn, drifted to the two path entering the stretch, faltered and was eased.
