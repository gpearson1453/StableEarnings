SPEEDY MOBILE forwardly placed from the start, responded with a rapid move three wide to make the lead entering the far turn, set the balance of the
pace and drew off under mild left handed urging. BEAT THE DEALER trailed into the far turn, closed determinedly three wide through the stretch and
finished second best. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE chased the early pace two wide, was in tight between rivals midway on the far turn, steadied and angled
outward, came on again into the stretch then was outfinished. TURNING PAGES away alertly, set the pace along the inside, drifted out a bit on the far turn,
had speed into the stretch then weakened. MURRY SPUR close up near the inside, angled out on the far turn, entered the stretch five wide then weakened
late. TIDE RISING was no factor. THE RIDER OF YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SPEEDY MOBILE
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
THE COACHMAN sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened at will through the stretch to win as much the best under a hand
ride. JOE BRRRR unhurried early, closed willingly four wide through the stretch and got up for second. JOYFUL CANDY dropped inside leaving the chute,
saved ground into the stretch then found his best stride late three wide. JOCKO ROAD passed tiring rivals. UPTOWN GUY pressured the winner two wide
into the stretch then weakened late. KAPHAVATA vied for the lead three wide into the stretch and gave way in the final stages. PERFECT PICTURE had
good early speed four wide and was through after a half. DUDLEY settled mid pack, advanced along the rail into the stretch then came up empty. WHISKEY
SUNRISE was no threat. FANELLI was no factor. COAL TOWN ROAD had speed into the turn then wilted. THE WILD FLYER suffered a broken reign on
the turn and and lost contact with his field.

prevailed. CRAFTY CONQUEST pressured the winner two wide, checked behind that one nearing the wire and finished second best. GEHRIG close up
early, dropped back on the turn then came on again along the rail through the stretch. BLAME IT ON EDDIE unhurried early, altered course to the seven
path at the top of the stretch and closed a gap late. ARTIE MY BOY well placed, failed to respond. UNYIELDING was no factor. ATTUCK away alertly, was
a sharp threat three wide through the turn then weakened. CALL PAPA trailed. THE RIDER OF CRAFTY CONQUEST LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

HIP HIP HOORAY with the second flight along the inside, rallied two wide into the stretch, made the lead, drifted in when put to a right handed whip at the
furlong maker then finished full of run under left handed urging while drifting out to win as much the best. UOTTALIKEIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after
the start, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, checked inside the winner as that one drifted in at the furlong marker, altered course to the five path
and finished clear for second. CHIEF RANDEL never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. MO DONT NO allowed to settle, offered a mild bid
along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. TO WIN close up early, swung wide and lost ground. IT'S YOUR CALL was no factor.

deep stretch and held on for second. CONSIDER ME was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted out in front of the winner
near the furlong marker to the six path then was outfinished. SUPER BROTHER offered a mild bid three wide on the turn then failed to sustain that bid.
HUNTERTOWN was bumped at the start, trailed early and passed tiring rivals through the stretch. PRIVATE CONNIE bore in at the start bumping his inside
rival, had sped along inside into the turn then faded. ARCHARCH CAT chased the pace two wide then along the inside and was through after a half.
SWELTER was no factor. BOURBON TALKING also bore in at the start bumping HUNTERTOWN, was forwardly placed, in tight between rivals entering the
turn causing his rider to steady and faltered.
