GOLD PILOT taken well in hand to trail early, dropped to the rail to begin a sustained rally from the three-eights pole, split horses in upper stretch and
finished gamely to prevail at the wire. KOKOKOMO reserved off the pacesetters, commenced an early drive into the turn, circled the field, drifted out in the
lane while under strong urging and came up just short. BIZZY LEGS sped to the lead into the first turn up the fence, set a well rated pace and opened a
clear advantage at the head of the lane but was no match for the top two. TIZ LIFE stalked the pace from three wide to the quarter pole in striking position
and lacked a late response when put to a drive. FLASH OF MISCHIEF pressed the pace from between horses to the top of the stretch and was injured
when making a move for the lead and was vanned off.

FORT HOOD was under a steady drive to duel for the lead while two wide, then inched away on the turn to kick clear in the upper stretch and prevail under
a strong hand drive. NIGHTWIND chased the pace while two wide, then came out four wide to duel for the place position with an inner rival down the lane
and was closing strong to be up just in time. PLAIN TAP WATER chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then closed well down the lane while dueling
for the place prize and just missed it in the end. ATTILA THE DUN raced closed behind the field while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn then
bid mildly in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. JUST HANGIN RIDGE dueled for the lead from the inside into the turn, was hard used and tired in
the stretch. SLIM JIMMY raced behind the field along the inside, then gradually faded and was no rally.

MADAMOUSSEPOUSSE dueled from between horses on the early pace, took command turning for home and drew off in convincing fashion as a clear
winner. GLORY O stalked the pace to the turn, loomed up at the quarter pole and finished willingly as second best. LIBBIES BABY raced up the rail inside
the leaders, backed out of the pace duel at the three-eights pole and finished evenly to gain the show. MASTER SOM rushed up from between rivals to take
the lead, dueled with the winner in the turn and gave way down the lane. BALI DOVE (FR) reserved off the pace near the rear of the field and failed to
respond when called upon. TRICKY CARLA broke well, dropped to the rear of the field and never threatened. JUDY'S CUSTARD broke inward brushing her
rival leaving the gate, showed brief speed and steadily faded to the rear.

Footnotes
DIAMOND GRAND broke alertly to take command leaving the gate, set a well measured pace, cleared turning for home and drew off down the lane as
much best. BOSSADUSU stalked the pace from four wide through the turn, failed to gain ground on the winner but finished willingly to the wire in a good
runner-up effort. VA VOOM tracked the pace into the turn, moved up the fence to mount a challenge and failed to gain ground late. BOBBIE O reserved off
the early pace, responded when asked with a steady mild rally. EMMYLOU SQUALL pressed the pacesetter to the quarter pole and weakened down the
stretch. MISCHIEF ANGEL raced mid-pack, went evenly and never was a threat. PURRFECT MOON raced near the rear of the field throughout as a
non-factor. PERFECT MESA showed brief speed to be in early contention and gave way.

Footnotes
SENSEOFEXCELLENCE vied for the lead from the two path, gained command entering the turn, then drew clear in the early stretch and was kept to task till
the end. CADEAU DE PAIX chased the pace while four wide into the turn, then rallied gamely in the upper stretch to close fastest down the lane for the
place prize. RING ME DARLING raced between rivals then bid while two wide on the turn to rally in the late stretch and was best for show in the end.
RUMPUS vied for the lead from the inside then settled back on the turn, came out four wide in the early stretch to rally and was closing well in the end.
BLUEBERRY EYES settled along the inside into the turn then menaced in the early stretch to close willingly in the final furlong. SWEET SLEW settled while
four wide, then bid on the turn to rally in late stretch but it was too little too late. TELLING THYME raced while three deep in the second group of rivals, then
rallied on turn into the stretch but came up empty in the end. MAINLINE was moving up while five wide to press the pace from the three path throughout the
turn, was hard used and gave way in the lane. SWEET ADELINE was in a hard drive to bid for the lead while three wide, then pressed the pace throughout
the turn from the two path, was used up and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAZI moved up the fence to duel for the early lead leaving the chute, battled through the turn on the lead, edged away in the lane to persevere in a
determined drive. TEXAS TIDELANDS pressed the pace from three wide through the turn to seriously threaten turning for home, could not gain on the
winner, was passed by rival in the upper stretch and came on again for the place. ITS MY MONEY TOO reserved off the early leaders, circled four wide in
the turn to loom boldly at the top of the lane, closed to be second mid-stretch and hung late to give up the place. ITS A GEE THING tracked the pacesetters
to the turn, ranged up behind a wall of horses at the quarter pole and finished willingly to be best of the rest. INDY LOVER raced in the second flight on the
outside and went evenly. GANGSTER RAP showed brief speed to be well positioned for the first quarter, dropped back in the field and passed tiring rivals
down the stretch. JIBE broke alertly to take the lead, dueled for three-eighths and steadily faded. WILD PROSPECT trailed the field early, made a brief bid
in the turn up the rail and flattened out. CHEROKEE SUMMER was never a factor.

Footnotes
SOUL SACRIFICE pressed the pace from the inside, then dueled with the pace setter throughout the turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch to kick clear of
that rival and held on well till the end. STAR SAILOR saved ground down the backstretch while racing along the inside, then bid on the turn, rallied in the
upper stretch and was closing strong to be up for the place prize. TREASURE COAST was under an easy stride to stalk the pace from the three path down
the backstretch and throughout the turn, then rallied at the top of the lane to close well and was out finished for place in the end. BIG STORY was under a
steady drive to chase the pace from the inside down the first half and into the turn then made a mild bid in the stretch but came up empty in the end.
CALIPARI settled along the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, then angled out seven wide in the early stretch to rally but it was too little too late.
AMERICAN SMOOTH chased the pace while three wide, made a mild bid on the from the four path then continued to close evenly throughout the stretch.
JERSEY JIM lead the way down the backstretch while two wide, then dueled with an inner rival to keep the lead throughout the turn, was used up and gave
way in the end. CALARI BLUECAT chased the pace while two wide, was in hard drive throughout the turn, was used up then flattened out in the stretch.
BRAZIL NUT was unhurried early then bid mildly from the three path on the turn and was no menace. GOLD DECLARATION was out run and no factor.

Footnotes
MISSINGYOUCRAZY sped to the lead into the first turn, set a well measured, comfortable pace down the backstretch, opened her advantage into the turn
and drew off as much best. GOLD MEMORIES broke a step slow, settled into stride, steadily advanced on the outside to the turn, rallied four wide and
finished well to be a clear second best. LA VALEDORA tracked the pace from the fence down the backside, mounted a bid in the turn, could not gain on the
leader, was outkicked for the place but finished willingly as the best of the rest. BLOOD ORANGE reserved off the lead for the run to the turn, circled wide
and made a steady late gain through the stretch. MEMORABLE FLIGHT pressed the winner to the quarter pole and gave way down the lane.
BLINGONMERCURY was prominently placed in striking position and failed to rally finishing evenly. PHARME'S PHINALE stalked the pace for a half mile
and came up empty. S S TURBINIA was never a factor. RUBY SOHO was no threat and virtually eased to the wire.
