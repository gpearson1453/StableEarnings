COULD BE A COUGAR set the pace from the inside and shook clear on the turn, then drew off in the drive to prove much the best under right handed crop
urging. SO STEADY was outrun early, came four wide into the lane with run, angled in leaving the furlong marker and rallied well to gain the place award.
INDY'S GOLDEN GIRL tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out, held show award. OUT OF AMMO was rated
early, shifted out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had no kick. RUSTY MY BROTHER was off a step slow, had a four wide run on the turn
and came five wide into the lane and had no rally. WEST ABBOTT was well placed on the inside, steadied leaving the seven sixteenths and then weakened.
UPTOWN SERAPHINA tracked the pace in between rivals and weakened.

HOT FUDGE WARRIOR set the pace on the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole, dug in gamely and dueled the length of the stretch and prevailed
under a drive. CANDY ARCADE stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide move on the turn to go on even terms with the winner by the quarter
pole, then dueled with that rival to the wire and just missed, lost bob. SWEET MESA was reserved early, made a inside run on the turn and had a mild late
gain to best the rest. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, rated three to four wide, then raced wide on the turn and had
no rally. DESI'S REWARD chased the early pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and weakened. MY LADY'S AUNT MA prompted the early
pace two wide and stopped.

MIDNIGHT ACT tracked the early pace on the inside, shifted out and was three wide by the half mile marker, then made a three wide move on the far turn,
continued that bid and edged clear late to prove best un der a drive. TATE was rated along four wide, made a four wide move to the outside of the winner on
the far turn, but was outfinished in the final furlong, held place award. TRENDING UP was settled early, advanced four wide on the far turn, came five wide
into the lane, angled out in the lane and closed well on the far outside. DR. STEVE set a fast pace on the inside while clear, then rated the second quarter,
then drew clear again on the far turn, got out by the quarter pole and came six wide into the lane and faded. P JS SILVER DUKE was void of early speed
and passed the tiring rivals. HERE'S WALDO stalked the early pace three wide and tired. COOL COMEDIAN was settled early and stopped.

Footnotes
QUARTERFLASH was taken back early to trail on the inside, came three wide into the lane and angled out to the far outside, then closed with a rush to get
up in time under a drive. PHANCY PHILLY chased the early pace, advanced four wide on the turn and then closed well to gain a short lead leaving the
sixteenth marker but was denied late to just miss. SCHNUER WILL stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bud by the quarter pole, then kept
on grinding to the wire but was outfinished late. ORGANIZED CHAOS set the early pace and was clear then faded the final sixteenth. HELLO GRACIE was
allowed to settle early, made a inside move on the turn but flattened out late. I CAME TO DANCE tracked the pace in between rivals and then weakened on
the turn. ARROGANTE was reserved early five wide and was not a threat. COSMOLOGICAL was well placed early on the inside and weakened.

DIGGERS DIAMOND was well rated along the inside, eased out mid way on the turn and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, then drew out in the
furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. PAL CAL tracked the early pace, made a three wide bid to gain command leaving the quarter pole, but
could not go with the winner while being clearly second best. PECOS BILL was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide, came four wide into
the lane and had no rally, bested rest. COAST TO COAST set the early pace and drew off on the backstretch, then was headed on the far turn and gave
way.
