wire. LYRICAL veered in early, bumping with the horse to her inside in the process, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, continued around the
turn in the three path and kept on late. ARETE'S CHALICE was bumped by the horse to her inside early, raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and gained ground in the final furlong. DIXIELAND DANCER trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, came around
the turn in the four path, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out from there. JLO CAN DANCE bumped with the horse to her inside at the start,
raced off the pace early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE led the way on the outside racing up the backstretch,
