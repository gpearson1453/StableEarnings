Footnotes
NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) settled inside, gained two then three wide through the far turn, reeled in the leader and took over in the final sixteenth while
drifting out, then held over BIRTH OF COOL in the closing moments. BIRTH OF COOL reared in the gate, broke a bit slow, raced on the inside near the
back early, gained while steered out on the far turn, rallied widest in the lane, got floated out by NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) and could not get by.
MASTERMIND reserved early and moved inside, took closer order up the backstretch, rallied on the far turn and swept by the top pop at the quarter pole,
kicked clear from inner rivals, led into deep stretch but could not offer any resistance to the top pair late. FIREMAN DAN broke a step slow on the outside,
trailed on the inside early, saved ground at the back to the stretch, moved out and commence a rally between rivals and earned a minor award. BROTHER
REID traveled two wide in the second flight early, angled out around the far turn and came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NEW YORK
DREAMS (GB) stalked the pace from inside to the stretch and flattened in the lane. AMERICAN CAT stalked two wide outside a rival early on, gained
ground leaving the backstretch, put in a mild bid two wide on the second bend but failed to sustain the challenge and weakened in the lane. ZOOKEEPER
sped clear and crossed over quickly, opened up on the field early, remained well clear into the far turn, was reeled in at the quarter pole and overtaken
shortly after crossing that marker, then weakened down the stretch.

Footnotes
STEALTHESPOTLIGHT dueled for the lead from inside before inching ahead into the turn, continued to show the way two wide into the stretch, cleared
FIAMINA in upper stretch and drew away late. FIAMINA dueled early then pressed STEALTHESPOTLIGHT into and around the turn, fought three wide into
the lane, could not kick on with the winner into the furlong grounds but stayed on well to secure the place. BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY broke slow and took a
bump from CONQUEST CELSIUS at the start, chased four deep into the turn, steered down to the rail around the bend, took aim in upper stretch but
faltered in the final sixteenth. CONQUEST CELSIUS stumbled badly and bumped outer rival leaving the gate, moved out to chase the top pair from outside,
spun four wide into the drive and weakened. CAT ON THE RUN was off slow and broke inward before being corrected, trailed five wide into the turn,
steered inward to race two wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PARIS SECRET (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, moved into range along the fence in the middle stages, tipped out while ridden along
through the far turn, took aim at the leaders three wide into the stretch, took over outside the eighth pole, put away inner rivals past the eighth pole and held
PLEASANT WAVE at bay. PLEASANT WAVE was keen when reserved from inside early, moved off the rail and took closer order up the backstretch,
angled out into the stretch, rallied from outside but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. BROADWAY GIRLS dueled for the lead inside ANCIENT
PEACE first time through the stretch before clearing around the clubhouse turn, got pressured by that rival again on the backstretch, held a short lead while
dueling into the lane, bumped at the top of the stretch, relinquished the lead outside the eighth pole and faltered in the furlong grounds but managed to hold
the show. ANCIENT PEACE dueled while pulling outside BROADWAY GIRLS early, took a stalking position two wide on the clubhouse turn, tugged forward
again to apply pressure on the backstretch, fought two wide into the lane and bumped at the three-sixteenths pole, drifted in a bit in the furlong grounds
while flattening and was edged for the show. UNA PALABRA settled outside a rival early, moved out and traveled three deep in the middle stages, moved
back into the two path for the far turn, raced near the inside into the stretch and had little left for the drive. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE
INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT BROADWAY GIRLS AND ANCIENT PEACE BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO
THE BUMPING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

urging to win going away. RECALCITRANT vied three deep early then dueled outside SELDOVIA around the turn, put away inner rival entering the stretch,
was soon challenged by FLY A FANTASY outside the eighth pole and was no match for the winner in the furlong grounds. SELDOVIA dueled for command
into and around the turn, failed to keep up entering the stretch and weakened down the lane while a clear third. COCKTAIL CUTIE hit the gate, got bumped
then veered in at the start, trailed two wide through the turn, moved to the rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals. DANCE ELLA DANCE broke out and
bumped rival, chased three wide into the turn, four wide into the lane and weakened. GRACEFUL SCARLETT hopped and broke in a bit at the start, chased
four wide through the turn and also weakened.

the wire. HOLIDAY AROUSAL dueled two wide into the first turn then pressed LIL RICHARDS BELLO from outside, kept the pressure through the far turn,
lost touch into the stretch but remained close through stretch run but had to settle for second best. ENJOY IT STRAIT was forwardly placed three deep on
the first turn, chased two wide into the second bend, angled out and came six wide into the stretch, bumped with inner rival at the top of the lane and kept on
to whittle gap on the leaders and earn the show honors. MINISTER SHANE raced up close four deep around the first turn, chased three wide into the far
turn, moved out and exited that bend five wide, bumped ENJOY IT STRAIT at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. MR. T'S THIRSTY stalked the pace

speed then chased the top pair up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, got crowded between rivals at the quarter pole. NOTFORLACKOFEFFORT
dueled from outside then pressed the leader early, dropped back on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
EL POTENTE controlled the pace under pressure from outer rival early, cleared near the three-eighths pole, showed the way along the inside into the drive
and inched away in the stretch run. CLUB ASPEN stalked from inside through both turns, tipped out a bit into the stretch, chased through the final furlong
but could not get to the winner. ONCOMING settled off the pace then tugged and had to be corrected into the first turn, began to tug again around the bend
and backstretch, got boxed in early on the far turn and brushed outer rival at the five-sixteenths marker, went three to four wide leaving the bend and kept
on to earn the show honors. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT unhurried in the early going and moved inside, coaxed along while tipping two wide on the far turn,
angled out and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. FLINT STROLL tracked outside a rival then three wide on the clubhouse turn, raced four
deep into the second bend, angled in then back out at the top of the stretch and could not threaten. HALFBARBERBINGIE chased from inside then two wide
on the clubhouse turn, went three deep into the far turn, got brushed by inner rival then came four to five wide into the lane and weakened. POST FACTO
rated two to three around both turns and weakened when called upon. ROSENQUIST pressed the pace from outside to the far turn, could not keep up
around that bend and weakened in the drive. BENDER trailed from inside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR took control early and cleared from inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, coaxed along with a quarter mile left to run, urged
right-handed at the eight pole and padded the lead in the final sixteenth. BELLAMORE tracked two wide early, moved to the inside briefly on the far turn
before angling to the three path, chased within range of ADARE MANOR entering the final furlong but was no match in the late stages. BIG SWITCH was
closest in pursuit in the two path early, continued to stalk the leader up the backstretch, asked left-handed two wide at the quarter pole but flattened in the
furlong grounds. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH trailed two wide early, raced outside a rival three to four wide on the far turn and could not make an impact.
KIRSTENBOSCH bobbled leaving the gate then chased along the rail under coaxing into the first turn, traveled two then three wide around the second bend
and failed to menace.

SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth
under left-handed encouragement and lasted over the runner-up. GREENBOW bumped leaving the gate, raced along the inside at the back early, tipped out
a bit to exit the bend two wide, given his cue in upper stretch, flew in the late stages but ran out of time. TIGERHON (FR) bumped leaving the gate, stalked
the leading trio two wide into the turn, angled four wide exiting the bend, could not find the needed response in the furlong grounds but managed to save the
show. NAISMITH raced off the pace two to three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and missed the show. MISCHIEVOUS PATH raced three deep
at the back early, trailed three wide into the drive and summoned a mild response to improve placings. REALLY BIG NEWS stumbled leaving the gate, sat
off the pace early on, went two then three wide around the bend, steered out in the drive and lacked a rally. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) got crowded between
rivals early, raced two wide at the back into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and failed to menace. BOOK SMART vied three deep up the backstretch,
continued to battle three wide through the turn, could not kick on with the winner at the top of the lane and weakened through the final furlong. THE
BULLION BOMBER (IRE) vied for the lead between rivals, fought two wide through the turn, then weakened in the drive. VIRAT settled off the pace and
steered down to the inside, saved ground through the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
DANZING CAT broke inward to bother rivals, stalked from inside into and around the turn, launched a rail bid in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong to go
and remained strong under a drive to the wire. BOLD CHOICE forwardly placed outside the pacesetter early, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took over
briefly in upper stretch before being overtaken by DANZING CAT and chased that rival to the wire. SMILING AMY set the pace up the backstretch, showed
the way tow wide into the turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. RYDER'S CANDY bumped
leaving the gate, tracked three to four wide around the bend and failed to rally. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY tossed his head and came away slow, trailed
two then three wide on the turn, lugged out from the left-hand in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. C HER BEAUTY bothered by outer rival and bumped
leaving the gate, chased along the inside off the pace around the bend, tipped out in the drive and failed to menace. WHIMSICAL HEIR stalked between
rivals then began to pull up the backstretch, had to steady at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two to three wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
CARMEN MIRANDA was closest in pursuit early, moved to the inside for the turn, inherited the lead when LUCKY FOR YOU ducked out across the dirt and
remained clear through the stretch under a drive to the wire. ULTIMATE HY stalked the pace early then tossed her head briefly, raced along the rail through
the turn, tipped out into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner but bested the rest. LUCKY FOR YOU brushed leaving the gate then sped
clear, led in the two path through the turn, ducked out across the dirt, kept on through the lane and held the show. SHOCKING GREY unhurried early on,
saved ground through the turn and finished evenly for a minor award. SPEED LANE broke a step slow, raced two wide then moved inside on the turn,
steered out in the lane and got put in tight in upper stretch, then finished with a mild rally to improve. RED DIAMOND broke a step slow, trailed two to three
wide early, came out across the dirt, altered out at the eighth pole and improved position. NU PI LAMBDA tracked two wide, angled out across the dirt and
lacked a bid. NOT NOW stalked in the two path, drifted out across the dirt and lacked any response in the drive. MA FRANCE (IRE) steadied into the turn,
traveled two wide then came out across the dirt and went five wide into the stretch, got put in tight in upper stretch and could not rally after. LADY JAE broke
well then moved into a stalking position, went three deep into the turn, got forced extremely wide when the pacesetter ducked out over the dirt, then
flattened in the stretch run. DENIM IN GOLD hopped slightly leaving the gate, raced three wide into the turn, drifted across the dirt and failed to menace.
CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) was off slow in the beginning, chased three to four wide on the turn, came out crossing the dirt and could not make an
impact. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED LUCKY FOR YOU FROM THIRD TO TENTH FOR DUCKING OUT AND
INTERFERING WITH LADY JAE CROSSING THE DIRT, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
