Footnotes
OVERBEARING stalked the pacesetter from the outset, then rated back entering the turn, then made a two wide bid midway on the turn, continued that bid
off the turn and slowly wore down JACK VAN BERG late to get up under a drive. JACK VAN BERG pulled while being hard held early while showing the
way on the inside, was given a little rein on the turn and shook clear, then remained clear off the turn and by the furlong marker, but proved to be not
enough, while being clearly second best. NOT VERY GENTLE was reserved early, angled out in the stretch to show some late interest to best the rest.
RENEGADE BOB chased the pace three to two wide and weakened. IRISH TUFF chased the pace on the inside and then was empty.

Footnotes
HIP HOP EMMY broke in at the start, dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn, shook clear by the furlong marker and was drifting out in
the furlong grounds while widening the margin, driving. LOTTA ROSES dueled for the lead outside of the winner, then made a bid on the turn but could not
shake the winner, then proved to be no match late, second best. EVIE JEAN was settled early, made a four wide move on the far turn but failed to gain on
the top two, bested rest. PRETTY IN PRADO chased the pace and was two to three wide on the turn and weakened. PRADA'S MIRACLE chased the pace
on the inside and weakened. HURRYUPANDBYE was bumped hard at the start, then was through after a half mile and was eased, walked off.

SNOOTY set the pace on the inside while clear, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best, driving. FOGGY KITTEN chased the early pace four
wide, angled in entering the turn, made a two wide bid on the turn, but could not sustain that bid, second best. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL chased the pace on
the inside and lacked the needed bid, bested rest. AUNT STELLA was off slowly, settled in the back, four wide by the quarter pole and then angled out and
had no rally on the outside. FROST WARRIOR tracked the early pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and was empty.

SLAVA UKRAINI set a slow early pace while clear on the inside, then drew off leaving the turn to prove much the best, driving. ELECTRIC CHARGE
tracked the winner three wide early and then chased that rival to the wire while no match but clearly second best. CALICO JOE was four wide into the first
turn, chased the pace four wide, then shifted in on the turn and was two wide by the quarter pole and bested the rest. FABRICATOR was five wide into the
first turn, settled five wide, three wide on the turn and had no rally. HIGHLY UNLIKELY chased the pace on the inside and weakened. BLACK RUSSIAN
broke in at the start, then checked on the first turn down on the inside and tired. MARCHING ORDERS was climbing early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FEEDING FRENZY was settled back early, advanced on the turn and came wide seven wide into the lane, angled out and closed full of run on the outside
and won going away, driving. BLOOMING GARDEN stalked the early pace and made a inside bid leaving the turn, gained a short lead leaving the furlong
marker but could not hold off the winner late, second best, good effort. FLASHY RICHIE was sandwiched at the start, settled back early, advanced three
wide on the turn, angled out five wide leaving the turn and was along for the show award. DEORA STORE chased the early pace and made a three wide bid
in the lane but flattened out. SPEEDY G set the pace while three wide, then was two wide on the turn and weakened the final furlong. ZARMAE was
reserved early and lacked a rally. SON OF GRACE was settled early, wide on the turn and came wide into the lane and was not a threat. WILDWOOD'S
WARRIOR broke in and bumped a rival, then showed no speed and failed to menace. POWERFUL MAN tracked the pace four wide and tired. TEA AFTER
BALLET was settled early and tired.
