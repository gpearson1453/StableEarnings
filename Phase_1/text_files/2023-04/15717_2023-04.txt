Footnotes
STARSHIP AURORA settled off the early pace while racing four wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide midway around the far turn,
could not quite match strides with RUGELACH in upper stretch but closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. RUGELACH raced in range three
wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, took the lead two wide between foes near the five-sixteenths pole, edged away from the winner in upper
stretch, led to deep stretch and just missed. NAA DUDETTE broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide, made good progress four wide around the
far turn and flattened out a bit in the lane. BOTH SIDES raced in range three wide, gained three wide around the far turn but faded in the lane.
GOMOMISCHIEF bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the drive. KITTENZEN bumped at the start, raced two and three
wide and never threatened. PLANET FROLIC saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and made little impact. LUMINANT was outrun
while racing two wide. TAP AND CHU had her head turned at the start, saved ground and was never in contention. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE set the pace
three wide around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn and retreated through the lane. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM led early inside and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
SOUPER LEGACY set the pace in the four path, was roused early into the far turn, opened up slightly while floating out to the five path in upper stretch,
maintained a clear advantage under steady urging into the final furlong, ducked out in deep stretch, but held safe. TIMMY M. rated in the four path, tipped
out and was cued from the six path midway around the far turn, was in the eight path at the top of the lane, and ran on down the center for place. PREFECT
prompted the pace in the five path, bid under a ride around the far turn, evened out from the six path in upper stretch, but held show. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE)
stalked in the six path, was coaxed approaching the quarter and in the seven path entering the stretch, but was one paced. SUMMER SHANDEE travelled
off the pace in the two path but never threatened. PLEASECALLMEBACK always trailed around the three to five paths.

Footnotes
PRACTIKO vied between foes early, drew clear two wide around the turn, drifted out late and held clear. MAPTITUDE stalked the pace three wide, had aim
outside of the winner in upper stretch but could not gain on that foe while holding clear of the rest. OMNI KING was off a bit slow, saved ground off the pace,
swung five wide leaving the quarter pole and was along for the show. PAY ZONE vied inside of the winner for three furlongs and faded inside. LAST SHIFT
broke slowly, bobbled a few strides later, rushed up between foes, chased two and three wide around the turn, shifted further out in upper stretch and came
up empty. IMMENSE FAITH failed to menace while racing four wide. JACKSON'S WEBB was outrun inside. REDJACK played no factor while racing five
wide and having the rider lose the whip in midstretch.

Footnotes
VELOCE stalked around the four path, ranged up around the far turn, bid passing the quarter pole and took a narrow lead from the five path into the lane,
stayed on while drifting through the final furlong, and held sway. TELEPHONE TALKER prompted the pace in the three path, bid early around the far turn
and briefly led passing the quarter, was overtaken by the outer eventual winner while in the four path at the top of the stretch, but ran on to hold place. EL
SOCIO was out in the five path rounding the first turn and rated around the four path down the backside, tipped back out to the five path under coaxing early
around the far turn, was under left handed urging from the six path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. DR. SHANE got sent to lead into the first turn and
set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was challenged by a pair of outer foes and under rousing early around the far turn, lost the lead nearing
the quarter pole, and yielded in upper stretch. HEAT OF THE NIGHT was held up off the pace between foes around the three path, was ridden in the five
path entering the stretch, but was no factor. MOON OVER MONTANA trailed around the two to three paths early and never threatened around the seven
path in the stretch. GHOSTINYOU tracked in the two path but backed up around the far turn.

AMSTRONG stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. LOOKIN FOR ROSES came in and
bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide between foes and ran on to gain the place. FOR THE CHIEF came out and bumped at the start, tracked
the pace three and four wide and was outfinished for the place. RIGEL set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths marker, continued
on the left lead in the lane and weakened. WE STORM raced off the pace two and three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and never threatened.
I'LLSMILEAGAIN saved ground in range, tipped out near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. BELLY OF JELLY was pinched
back at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
REBELDE rated in the two path, moved up along the inside early around the turn, bid inside of the leader from the two path at the top of the lane, took the
lead passing the eighth pole and inched clear. HERE COMES BULLET raced prominently in the four path, took command while under a nudge early around
the turn, was driven around the three path into the stretch, but was caught by the inner eventual winner passing the eighth pole to finish with place.
TEXTPECTATION got bumped on both sides and pinched at the start, trailed in the four path, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and passed tired
rivals to get up for show. CASTAGNO chased from out in the seven path, ranged up in the six path around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. ROYAL
KITTEN broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace in the three path but yielded between foes around the turn. HROTHGAR broke in and bumped an
inner foe, raced off the pace in the five path early, advanced between foes into the turn, but was steadied between foes midway around the turn, and did not
threaten from the four path down the lane. LONG BEACH KID stalked in the six path but was empty entering the stretch.

HONESTO stalked in the five path bid from the three path around the far turn, sustained that bid into the stretch and was under right handed
encouragement passing the eighth pole, and inched past an inner foe in the closing stages to win. WORLDS ON HIGH raced prominently in the four path,
took the lead from the two path early around the far turn but was quickly challenged by an outer foe, was driven into the stretch, dug in gamely along the
inside and held on to the lead into the final furlong, but yielded in final strides to place. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR trailed around the four path, circled a pair
of inner foes while under a ride in the five path around the far turn, and kept on for show. HASHTAG NO WONDER tracked in the three path, tipped out
around the far turn and was in the five path entering the stretch, but weakened. PONTI PRIDE set the pace in the two path but gaveway along the rail
rounding the far turn.

SWIRVIN set the pace inside, was roused when challenged by a pair of outer foes early around the turn, rebroke passing the quarter pole and opened
slightly from the two path in upper stretch, and held sway. QUINCY CAFE trailed in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, got bumped by
an inner foe out to the eight path into the lane, and kept on down the center for place. GREAT NAVIGATOR broke in at the start, tracked in the two path,
was ridden around the turn, floated out to the seven path and bumped an outer foe into the stretch, and evened out for show. FATHER DELAY stalked in
the three path, bid in the four path around the turn, but faded from the six path in the stretch. CAJUN HOPE prompted the pace in the three path, but

EVIE DOES IT settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide between foes rounding the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch,
closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. NEOGEM raced off the pace four wide, angled six wide near the quarter pole and rallied
widest to gain the place. MYSTIC SUNRISE raced two wide in midpack early, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached even terms in upper stretch,
shifted in a bit and brushed LOVE MAMI LOVE in midstretch, led near the eighth pole but was no match for the winner from the sixteenth marker. NO
WASABI FOR ME settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and had a mild rally. LOVE MAMI LOVE raced in range
three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, battled to midstretch, was brushed near the eighth pole and weakened through the final furlong. LUCKY
IN LOVE failed to menace while racing four and five wide. PRINCIPIA led early, chased two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn an came up
empty in the lane. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) played no factor while racing three wide. MO RISSA steadied early, was intent on the lead two wide around
the first turn, cleared off down the backstretch, led in the two path to the five-sixteenths marker and faltered. HITS DIFFERENT had only brief speed inside.
