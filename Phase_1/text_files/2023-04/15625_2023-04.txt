Footnotes
LIGHT AND PATH set the pace along the rail and held firm under a drive. HARLAN'S LEGACY settled off the early pace while racing two wide, went three
wide around the far turn and rallied for the place. STARSHIP DYNASTY prompted the winner two wide and was one-paced while trying to lug in through the
stretch. RUN FOR COVER saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. READY SHE IS failed to menace while racing two wide. WITCHING HOUR was
outrun inside. D CITY GIRL played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
TIZ BIZNESS stalked along the inside, tipped out under rousing midway around the turn and took aim from the five path at the top of the lane, bid passing
the eighth pole, took the lead, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. UPSTREET pressed in the four path, took over the lead from the three path midway
around the turn and was cued right handed into the stretch, kept on but was caught by the outer eventual winner just past the eighth pole to finish with
place. EXTRA INDY tracked in the four path, was under a ride in the five path rounding the turn and fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and was up
for show. FINAL EPISODE chased in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn and under left handed urging while floating out to the six path
into the stretch, but flattened. TWIRLING GRACE brushed with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path and was no factor around the four path in the
stretch. ALICE HARPER brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, was ridden between foes around the turn, had to steady
around the five sixteenths pole, and never threatened. VALIANT MISS set the pace in the two path but gaveway along the inside turning into the lane.
OBJECTIONS LODGED BY THE RIDERS OF ALICE HARPER, AND FINAL EPISODE ALLEDGING INTERFERENCE ROUNDING THE TURN WERE
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
HARUKI broke in and bumped an inner foe, trailed in the three path and was cued from the four path into the turn, was under a ride while angling out turning
into the lane, rallied down the center and got up on the wire to win. FREE SMOKE tracked in the four path, was coaxed from the three path midway around
the turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on under steady urging for place. GRIMES prompted the leading duo in the five path, fanned
out to the nine path into the lane, and kept on for show. MR. RHODIUM vied for the lead in the two path, headed an inner foe rounding the turn, was floated
out to the six path into the lane, and stayed on but was out-finished in the final sixteenth. ROCKINGHAM JOE stalked in the three path, was roused in the
two path around the turn and into the lane, got bumped twice by an inward tipping outer rival, and was outrun late. GET KHOZY got bumped by an outer foe
at the start but recovered well to lead along the inside into the turn, was headed and under rousing rounding the turn, floated out to the five path into the
lane, tipped inwards under right handed cues and bumped an inner foe twice inside the final furlong while fading. CADDY MAN chased along the inside but
was no menace.

OMO TEN GIRL set the pace in the three path, was coaxed approaching the quarter pole and floated out to the five path into the lane, dug in under left
handed encouragement and held gamely. AVATAL HERO prompted the pace in the four path, bid rounding the turn and was floated out to the six path into
the stretch, and kept on for place. INQUIETA rated in the five path, was cued right handed midway around the turn and was driven from the seven path into
the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong for show. BULLOCK stalked in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, tipped out to the seven path
into the stretch, gradually drifted out against right handed urging thru the stretch, and was one paced. LADY PETAL tracked along the inside early but never
threatened. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY chased in the six path but never menaced.

POIEMA set the pace in the two path and held sway under a drive. ROSIE'S HALO stalked the winner from the rail, angled out and bumped GREATITIUDE
near the sixteenth, switched back to the left lead in the process and made a mild gain once finally clear. GREATITUDE pressed the winner in the three path,
was bumped near the sixteenth pole and churned on for the show. HAZARDOUS HUMOR failed to menace while racing three wide. PEACHY WEACHY
chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. BROADWAY FORCE was in range while racing four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and
came up empty. SEA ART trailed in the two path, swung six wide turning for home and continued to trail.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN GERRY got bumped by an inner foe into the first turn and had to check from the three path midway around that turn, tracked in the three path
down the backside, tipped inside and was roused midway around the far turn, remained inside into the lane, tipped out to the four path passing the eighth
pole, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the final strides. RIO MOON set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside early around the far turn,
opened slightly around the two path in upper stretch, and stayed on under steady urging but was caught in the final strides to place. ROUGH AND ROWDY
rated around the three path, was ridden between foes in the two path rounding the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, altered course
inside of a tiring foe passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. TIO TONY bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed around the four path, was cued
right handed from the three path rounding the far turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch, and improved between foes. ENSIGN SKIP bumped with
an inner foe at the start, stalked around the five path, was under right handed urging in the four path rounding the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the
lane, but flattened. MEXICOFFEE prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed from the three path midway around the far turn, was back out in the four
path at the top of the stretch, and yielded in the final furlong. SING DIXIE chased around the five path but was no factor around the seven path in the
stretch. DONTONIO raced off the pace in the five path and never threatened from out in the nine path down the lane. MO TOWN BLUES was in tight along
the inside and bumped an outer foe into the first turn, continued to race in tight quarters and moved up from the rail to press the outer pacesetter into the
backstretch, but gaveway approaching the far turn.
