SHE HAS CLASS settled off the duel while racing in the two path, tipped three wide late on the turn, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and
forged ahead under a drive. CHEROKEE dueled outside of SUN AZTECA while racing two wide, edged ahead of that foe while racing a bit greenly in the
stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final sixteenth. MIST raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied for the show. SUN AZTECA dueled at
the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. BRISEIDA hit the starting gate, raced in the two path and never threatened. FLORINDIA
veered out at the start and was outrun outside.

while challenging from the rail rounding the turn, remained inside thru the stretch, and kept on but could not get by to finish with place. RHYMES LIKE
DIMES rated in the four path, was under a heavy drive into the lane, and was one paced for show. PERFECT CUT prompted the pace in the four path but

Footnotes
BLACK ICE stalked around the five path, bid under a nudge in the four path early around the turn, took over and opened up around the three path into the
lane, and was driven clear. QUICKSTYLE chased in the two path and was ridden hard into the turn, received a left handed cue midway around the turn and
was urged inside of rivals into the stretch, finished evenly, and was up for place late. TROTTING GEAR set the pace in the three path, lost the lead and was
put under rousing from the two path midway around the turn, was in the three path entering the lane, and gradually faded to show. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER
raced up close along the inside of foes in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, but flattened from out in the six path down the stretch. WOLF
RAYET chased in the six path but was tired going into the lane. LADY BOURBON trailed in the three path early and did not factor while shifting outward in
the stretch. SHOW ME LOVE was wellback in the four path and never threatened. RIA FORMOSA raced off the pace out in the seven path and was no
menace.

BOSTON PRINCESS saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed steadily outside and was up late. FRENCH FRANC
(FR) raced off the pace two and three wide, rallied inside of foes and just missed. THATAINT TOOSHABBY broke a bit awkwardly, raced three wide in
midpack for a half, bid three wide into the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, quickly cleared and led until deep stretch. STARRY HOPE was off
slowly, raced off the pace two and three wide, swung widest nearing the eighth pole, continued on the left lead and surged late. BRAVO ZULU set the pace
off the rail and gave way nearing the quarter pole. SPECTACULAR GAL saved ground in range and faded through the lane. MORNING COLORS chased
the pace four wide, steadied to avoid a wandering waterfowl late on the first turn, went five wide around the far turn and retreated. DANGER chased the
pace between foes and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
AVE FENIX chased in the five path, tucked in to the two path going into the turn, swung back out to the six path and was under right handed urging into the
stretch, and rallied to draw past an inner foe late for the win. BREAKING BULLET was prompted along around the four path, bid midway around the turn,
took the lead just past the quarter pole and opened from the three path into the lane, and stayed on, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. WILDCAT
STAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced prominently in the three path, took a narrow advantage between foes while still in the three path rounding
the turn, was headed nearing the quarter pole, and evened out in the stretch to show. SALLIE SEVILLE stalked in the five path, but lost ground rounding the
turn and did not factor. AMOR VICTORIOUS set the pace from the two path into the turn, lost the lead while ridden along the inside around the turn, and
yielded into the stretch. SHE'S RED HOT was wellback in the four path and never threatened. GONE OASIS bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in
the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
ALTERNATE ROCK set the pace inside, was cued right handed midway round the far turn, challenged by an outer foe while tipping out to the three path
into the lane, dug in gamely to hold off that outer challenger, and was inching away late. DONTLOOKBACKATALL raced up close while under a hold in the
three path, ranged up under confident handling around the far turn, bid from the four path into the stretch, and kept on but was repelled by the winning
pacesetter to place. LADY AZTECA trailed in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and
ran on down the center for show. FAST KIMMIE rated in the two to three paths, was under coaxing early around the far turn, angled out to the seven path
into the lane, and stayed on. SCOTTISH SYMPHONY was bumped by an inner foe into the first turn, tracked in the three path, was ridden around the far
turn and in the five path entering the stretch, but evened out. IMPETUOUS MOLLY bumped an outer foe into the first turn, stalked in the two path but was
empty into the stretch. JELLICLE KATZ raced in midpack around the four path but was done after a half.

Footnotes
COPPERMASTER lacked speed while hustled along early, advanced along the rail around the turn, cut the corner into the lane, seized command near the
three-sixteenths pole and readily drew off under a drive. LUSCIOUS DANCER settled off the early pace while racing four wide, bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner while drawing well clear of the rest. BIG BALLOONS stalked the pace in the clear in the three path
and came up empty in the lane. PAPA DEL CIELO set the pace in the two path and tired in the stretch. ADIOS YOUR HONOR gave distant chase two wide
and lacked a closing bid. CATCHHIMANDFREEHIM played no factor while racing two wide. CAUTELOSO was outrun while racing three wide. MR JOKE
lost contact and was eased.
