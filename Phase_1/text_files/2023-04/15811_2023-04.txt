WEST COAST ANDY stalked the pace, rallied five wide entering the stretch, dueled for the lead and inched away late to prove best. ROCKSIE
HARTBRAKER vied two across, came out in the late stretch, yielded late and held for place. MISCHIEF MAME broke out, vied inside past the sixteenth pole
and was unable to sustain her bid. LEGAL MISCHIEF showed good early speed inside, fell back, shifted out on the turn, angled out again near the eighth
pole and lacked the needed late response. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW fell back early to trail the field, offered a mild bid to narrow the gap and was not a
threat. Hand timed.

Footnotes
ALBERTA SUN pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely. REIGN OF FIRE broke out, was unhurried
early, saved ground and finished well inside. OUTSIDE THE LAW stalked the pace, went widest in the drive and lacked the needed late reponse. RAGING
LADY failed to threaten in an even effort. BAKERSFIELD BABE stalked to the turn and flattened out. J T'S LA NENA set the pace to the turn and gave way.
