JOVIAL away alertly, set the pace racing off the inside, shook free on the turn, responded when roused and pulled away under urging. STRAWBERRY
CONE chased three wide early on, chased the winner on the turn, rallied and was clearly second best. WEGOTTAGUY chased close up early on the rail,
raced two wide on the turn, weakened and held third. WHERESTHEPASSION chased between rivals early on, raced inside on the turn and had no rally.
TRIPLE AMERICANO raced off the pace inside and did not factor. HEATED BATTLE raced two wide off the pace and was outrun.

Footnotes
WHAT'S TO BLAME lacked speed, bid four wide on the final turn and quickly pulled away while kept to his task. WAGON BOSS alternated for the
advantage three wide and continued willingly while unable to match the winner. EXCURSION saved ground off the pace, loomed a threat into the stretch
and flattened out. PETULANT DELIGHT earned a narrow lead inside, dueled to the stretch and gave way. ACKER dropped back early, chased outside and
lacked a rally. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind then caught a stopping opponent late. AWESUMMER dueled between rivals to the top of the stretch
and stopped.

RANDOM LUCK set the pace on the inside, dueled with VANISHING FAITH into the stretch, responded, regained the lead at the eighth pole and drew clear
under urging. NANA'S BOOPA chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, rallied outside and was along for the place spot.
VERDANDI chased close up while two wide early, raced between rivals on the turn, angled out in the stretch run, rallied mildly outside and earned the show
spot. VANISHING FAITH stalked outside, made a three wide bid on the turn, put a head in front at the quarter pole, dueled outside of the winner to
midstretch, then weakened. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. COLETTE'S SPIRIT was
off slowly, raced off the pace, two wide on the turn and did not factor. QUEEN LUCKY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, inside on the turn and did not
factor.

GOOD CULTURE pressed the pace racing close up outside of the pacesetter, continued in that position on the backside, bid on the far turn, dueled with
MOON DOG, took over, drew clear in the stretch and then held well under urging. MOON DOG set the pace racing near the inside and being pressed along
by a rival, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive, battled on but second best. TYCOON raced close up while two wide, then
between rivals, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. DOCTOR DOOM raced close up early on
the inside, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a rally. LARGE raced three wide on the clubhouse turn, stalked three wide, chased and gave way. PER
RULING #24008PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, MOON DOG WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A

AHSAD pursued the loose leader inside, angled out in the stretch, rallied then pulled away in the final sixteenth. ILOVECHARLYBROWN chased off the
pace inside and rallied to gain the place late. EMPIRE'S SCORE hustled to a clear advantage to the final sixteenth and weakened. HIBACHI dropped back
after the initial quarter mile, rallied wide with a mild bid. LOAD UP MOE raced very wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. DISTRACTANDATTACK
prompted the pace outside and faltered after half a mile. STRUM AND PLUCK lacked speed outside and was never a factor. DON'T RECALL dropped back
at the start and was never in contention. FEARLESS FLY lagged well behind inside and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HUSHION dueled three wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, took over at the quarter pole, dug in gamely between rivals in the final furlong, dueled to the
wire and narrowly prevailed. HE'S INCREDIBLE stumbled at the start, quickly recovered, dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dropped back a bit,
battled back on the rail in midstretch, dueled to the wire and just missed. JUMP SHOT raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up midway on the turn, came
five wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final furlong and dug in outside rivals to the finish. LAZARETTO was pinched back at the break,
chased close up on the inside, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BIG BROWN SHOES dueled between rivals for command, dueled on the
turn and faded.

Footnotes
ROAN MOUNTAIN settled off the pace, split rivals advancing on the final turn, bid inside through the stretch and moved clear late. KOBE B forced the pace
outside, led before half a mile, led to midstretch and weakened. IRISH HONOR was put to urging into the far turn, steadied briefly at the top of the stretch
then closed well. MR. DODA raced wide throughout, moved very wide into the stretch rallying. HOOPLA dueled inside, moved out on the final turn and
continued willingly to the finish. BRETT'S WORLD dropped back early outside and lacked a rally. CANDY FOR CARMEL lacked speed, was asked for run
before half a mile but had no response.
