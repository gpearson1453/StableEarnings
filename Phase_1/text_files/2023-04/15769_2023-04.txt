Footnotes
KEY TO THE CASTLE moved to the inside and settled off the pace, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, closed steadily at the rail rounding
the far turn, eased out entering the stretch, ran down ODINA nearing the sixteenth pole and drew away later yards. The latter drew off to a long early lead,
came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail through the far turn but was caught flattening stride toward mid-stretch. BANK CARD
exchanged contact with TRACE ESTATE leaving the gate, settled off the rail on the first turn and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
on the far turn and held on for third. The latter exchanged contact with Bank Card leaving the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole
and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SUNSET QUEEN was jostled early, rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and
showed little response through the backstretch. NINETY PROOF was bumped early, rounded the opening turn in the three path and never factored. ONLY
ROMANCE came in and made contact with Sunset Queen shortly after the start, raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response.

Footnotes
CHURCH KEY took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on. VILLAREGGIA raced off the pace in the three and four paths on the opening turn, started a bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished well to take second late, while gaining on the winner. LOVE RAN
RED settled off the rail, bid at the seven sixteenths pole and raced close through the far turn, but flattened later yards. STORMI CAT LADY saved ground,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then angled out into the lane and finished evenly. I B NASTY saved early
ground racing well back, gave chase from the three eighths pole, eased outward on the far turn and showed little in the lane. DECISIVE CAUSE rounded
the first turn in the four and five paths, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near
the rail and weakened in the lane. RAVIOLI MAMA saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.
