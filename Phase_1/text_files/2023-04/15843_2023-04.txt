Footnotes
COMMISSIONER DAN prompted the pace setter two wide while between horses around the turn, sustained a duel with his inner counterpart entering the
final furlong, forged an advantage nearing the final sixteenth, and edged away. BLUE EYED SOUL (IRE) set the pace inside of a pressing pair while a path
off of the rail, led in hand entering the lane, but was roused with right handed shoulder taps when an outer counterpart sustained the battle approaching the
final furlong, got headed approaching the final sixteenth, saw his rider lose his crop while flipping it up at the sixteenth pole, but was already bested.
GEWURZTRAMINER chased while in range of the top pair from the four path, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch, and held show from an
inner bidder. KORE KINETIC broke a step slow, failed to respond to a hustling drive before climbing behind rivals leaving the chute, lacked speed in the two
path, altered course to the four path turning for home, stayed on to bid for show inside of a rival in the late stages, but missed. IMPERIAL THUNDER failed
to factor from the three path. DUNPHY tracked along the inside, but was green to change leads until the furlong grounds, but weakened thereafter.
EXPRESS CRUISER was slow early, raced far back while extremely wide around the turn, and made little impact. SADDLE UP got antsy in the starting
gate, chased from midpack along the inside, and steadily weakened around the turn. BOY POR UNO was slow into stride, and got outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
CHARGING set the pace along the inside, led from a trio of pressers turning for home, drew away entering the lane, widened under driving pressure in
midstretch, and was put to wraps in the closing stages. SAY IT LOUD took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked two wide, stayed on to bid
for place inside of foes leaving the sixteenth pole, sparred through the late stages, and prevailed. BEER RUN pressed two wide, got floated three wide and
between horses turning for home, sparred for place among foes through the final furlong, but was outfinished. LIQUID ADDICTION (IRE) stalked three wide,
floated four wide turning for home, bid for place in midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but flattened out. ALIBI IKE was shuffled back before steadying
at the nine sixteenths pole, saved ground off of the pace, then moved up two wide and between horses leaving midstretch. EV'S SHERMAN was taken in
hand behind foes in the early stages, shied to alter course outside of a troubled rival at the nine sixteenths pole, and failed to factor from the three path.
MONET NEVER (IRE) laid close to the pace along the inside, checked upon the leaders heels approaching the turn, settled to stalk soon after, bid two wide
and between horses turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and weakened between horses through the final furlong.
DEVILS RED failed to sustain forward inside position at the nine sixteenths pole as outer rivals shifted down, chased from midpack along the inside around
the turn, and faded. MCGOLDEN took a bump from an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three to four paths around the turn, and failed to factor.
LITTLE MAN CAN bumped an outer rival at the start, then was floated outwardly at the nine sixteenths pole, tucked from the four to two paths while far back
entering the turn, and made little impact. ONE FOR MY BROTHER broke a step slow, but was shut off by an outer rival tucking inwardly early on causing
him to trail, laid at the rear along the inside, steadied into the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CATNIP broke out while off slow, tracked three wide, tipped four wide turning for home, offered a good kick to drive past the leaders at the furlong pole,
drew clear soon after, dug in to resist an outer rival's challenge at the sixteenth pole, and held firm. EXACT ESTIMATE broke slowly, settled off of the pace
in the two path, took the far turn in the three to four paths, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the new leader at the sixteenth
pole, but was kept at bay. POLICY OPTION trailed in the three path, shifted out to the four path in midstretch, and offered a belated kick. REWARD NIGHT
tracked two wide, rated back before saving ground off of the pace around the far turn, encountered traffic in the four path in upper stretch, then stayed on
between horses. JUULSTONE was warm loading, stalked three wide but yielded to the leaders in upper stretch, and chased while hanging on his left lead.
ARABIAN PRINCE set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, but gave way after being headed at the furlong grounds.
RALLY SQUIRREL vied two wide, but was outkicked by bidders at the furlong grounds, and tired. GAMER stalked from the pocket, but was blocked
throughout the stretch run while being shuffled to last.

Footnotes
BRIGHTWORK vied along the inside of BARBTOURAGE, took a bump from that foe at the five sixteenths pole, yet sustained stride to continue the battle in
upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. BARBTOURAGE dueled for the lead with an inner vying rival into the turn,
bumped that foe while keeping her in tight at the five sixteenths pole, sparred as the battle carried on in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace leaving the
furlong grounds, and held place. CRIMSON ADVOCATE chased from the five path and between horses, failed to sustain position at the five sixteenths pole,
tucked to the two path nearing the lane, delayed a lead change until called upon to do so at the three sixteenths pole, gained slowly while asked to shift
outside of the top two vie a strong right hand rein at the furlong grounds, brushed an outer rival in the process, and stayed on well. TITANIA'S DREAM was
last away, quickly recovered to eye-catchingly gain inside of foes entering the turn, achieved a tracking position from three three path and between horses at
the five sixteenths pole, took aim outside of the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, but failed to sustain progress soon after, took a brush from an inner
rival at the furlong grounds, and faded. ARGAN came out at the start, chased in the four path around the turn, and gave way. JUST AN OPINION broke in
midpack, chased the leaders leaving the chute while failing to sustain forward position, faded while tucking to the four path around the turn, then gained
stride in upper stretch, and rallied between horses at the furlong grounds. BOOTSY'S MERLOT was bit a crowded between horses at the start, then saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. UNMATCHED laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. WHATTA WORLD steadied between horses leaving
the chute, trailed in the four path around the turn, and moved up. STAIRSTEP TOHEAVEN broke slowly, yet gained from off of the pace in the six path
around the turn, fanned to the eight path nearing the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, and tired on her left lead. LITTLE MUSIC tracked in the six
path, and weakened. BANDIT QUEEN lacked speed three wide, steadied at the three furlong pole, and was outrun.

OUR SHOT set the pace along the inside, drew off entering the lane, and held sway safely from a chasing rival through the final furlong. BOUND FOR
NOWHERE pursued from midpack in the two path, tipped to the four path entering the lane, rallied to gain place at the three sixteenths pole after the leader
kicked away, and chased that foe home well through the final furlong. FRIAR LAURENCE laid off of the pace along the inside, vacated the rail in upper
stretch, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, and stayed on to gain show at the wire. DIVINE LEADER tracked along the inside, shifted to the two path
entering the lane as the leader kicked clear, but lacked a bid, got outkicked for place in upper stretch, and lost show late. PURPLE DREAM broke slowly,
saved ground at the rear, improved inside of foes in upper stretch, and failed to menace while searching for racing room. INFINITE pressed two wide,
chased around the turn, got outkicked by rivals on either side in upper stretch, and gave way. GALLANT GUY broke a step slow, raced at the rear two wide,
fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. JOHNNY UNLEASHED tracked two to three wide, spun into the lane in the five path, and
faded. NERO laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact.

Footnotes
ONE GIANT LEAP tracked three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied to drive past the leaders at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. DOG RED
stalked outside of the leader, chased three wide in upper stretch, offered a bid along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead,
but was quickly outkicked. GOLD LUCK tracked along the inside, checked at the three furlong pole, then sustained a rail chase to gain show at the furlong
grounds. SEVEN FLAT laid off of the pace in the three path, chased while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over entering the final
sixteenth, and surpassed a tired foe for a minor share. LIBERTANGO set a clear pace, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, got outkicked by outer bidders
at the furlong grounds, and weakened between horses. VASSAR'S BOY was outrun.

Footnotes
MISS YEARWOOD trailed around all turns, swung to the six path entering the lane, swept past the field at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. SHAD
NATION set the pace along the inside, but offered no resistance to the eventual winner's bid leaving the furlong grounds, yet gamely fended off the rest to
hold place. BRAVO KITTEN tracked along the inside, tipped two wide to take aim turning for home, but lacked the needed kick in upper stretch, and was
denied place through the late stages. FLATTER ME SILLY stalked two wide, was floated three wide nearing the lane, and chased between horses.
BROADWAY BOOGIE settled off of the pace three wide, tucked two wide approaching the second bend, attempted to gain in the five path around the final
turn, but lacked a bid after getting outkicked for minor placings in upper stretch. LADY ARSINOE saved ground off of the pace, chased behind the main
flight through upper stretch, but found traffic in the final furlong. LIGHT STARS (FR) tracked two wide, chased in the four path and between horses turning
for home, but yielded entering the lane, and steadied when put to tight quarters in upper stretch. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS CHANGED
