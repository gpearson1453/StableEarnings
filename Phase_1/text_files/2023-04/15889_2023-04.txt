settled off the rail and weakened. CHAN gave chase along the inside and had no rally. SIR BARNABUS was not a threat four wide. CORTE failed to mount
a bid three wide. JAMAICA MISTAICA stumbled at the break and was always back while saving ground. STEALING HEARTS gave way in the far turn.

HOT ARTIE tracked the early pace three and four wide to bid nearing the lane and moved clear under steady handling. PARLAY PETE was on the pace
outside a rival to the far turn, was joined by the winner in that bend then could not match strides in the lane. GRAND DESIGN stalked the leaders three wide
but lacked a final closing run. OLD TRAFFORD saved ground in reach of the pace, angled five wide into the lane and moved up but could not threaten late.
MORO CHARLIE stalked the pace four and five wide but lacked a closing bid. THREE BALL was five and six wide through the far turn into the lane and did
not threat. BANJO BILL was not a factor. SHIPMAN'S SONG showed some early foot inside a rival and off the rail but weakened. MY TRUE REWARD was
always back while five wide.

Footnotes
BUCK MOON prompted the pace outside MUNQAD throughout about three wide, bid into the lane and moved off under steady handling. MUNQAD made
the pace while pressed by the winner throughout and could not go with that one in the lane. SARCASTIC TONE stalked the leaders in good position three to
four wide but lacked a final closing bid. MEDICINE TAIL saved ground in good position but lacked a closing rally. CASEYS MEMORY saved ground back off
the early pace, angled out and moved up four wide into the lane while not a threat. ITS A WRAP saved ground and lacked a rally. CAVE HILL was not a
threat four and five wide. UNRESTRICTED was widest through the second turn while near the back and never threatened. FLEETRIDGE followed the pace
three wide and weakened. BELLAMYS ROAN gave way in the final turn and was eased through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MOST AMUSING moved to challenge between rivals in the first turn, edged clear in the far turn then held safe in the lane under steady handling. TALE OF
A STORM showed the most early speed to gain inside position into the first turn, continued just off the leaders but could not get to the winner late. MR.
WALSH tracked the top pair three and four wide but lacked a final closing bid. COWORKER was four wide and could not close the gap in the drive. WAR
EAGLE'S RETURN was not a threat three wide. YOUNG PHILLIP failed to mount a bid. BIG HEARTED FACTOR lacked a rally four wide. DEBONNAIRE
DUDE saved ground and was not a factor. COOL CATOMINE trailed throughout.
