JUST WATCH ME NOW rated tracking the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match
strides, weakened late and held the show. LEGIO passed tiring rival, outside. THE COOKIE MAN well placed and outside, faded three wide through the

gained a short lead into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. EL SOLITARIO mid pack, gained position on the two path through the second turn,
then faded into the stretch. J P CORNETTA tracked the pace, raced boxed through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had

clear. VELOCE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a late bid at the furlong marker, then
drifted out and held the place. TEMPUS allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch, evened and held the
show. TIZ TACT TOE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had no rally. YADI well

edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off under steady pressure. PHOBIA mid pack, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that

ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. CHAPS KNIGHT passed a tiring rival. BAD AS JOHN well

Footnotes
JAZZ TIME GIRL rated close up inside, saved ground through the turn, got through inside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady
pressure. NEXT DOT set the pace just off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then came again in the late going to close the gap on the
winner. CASHPOINT mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and had a mild late gain. SHACKLED BY LUST well placed
and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong.
MISS CLAUDETTE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn on the two path, came through on that path into the stretch and improved position.
UOME well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. SENSIBLE MARRIAGE mid
pack and off the rail, steadily lost ground. GIO'S MY DAD passed tiring rivals, inside. NEVER PERSONAL mid pack, drifted out through the turn and into the
stretch and faded. BEE BRANCH was never involved.
