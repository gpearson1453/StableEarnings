in hand the final sixteenth. QUEEN SABINE saved ground racing well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily,
rounded the far turn near the rail and cleared second inside the eighth pole. DAY DRAMA rounded the opening turn about the four path, left the turn outside
and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. GHOSTLY ANNA stalked from the
four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. TINA'S BACK settled well
off the pace and off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. QUINN ELIA rounded the first turn about the three path,
gave chase passing the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the four path on the far turn. NEEDLES COOKIE stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase

Footnotes
ROCKY DICE rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and closed to even terms at the rail toward the head of the lane, dug in determinedly
leaving the turn and inched ahead mid-stretch. PROTA tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole,
contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, ceded the advantage mid-stretch but stayed on gamely to the finish. CAPE LOOKOUT raced off the rail the
first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, remained in range of the lead at the rail on the far turn but flattened stride inside the eighth
pole. MISTER WINSTON was unprepared for the break then reared, saved ground racing well back, started his bid nearing the three eighths pole and
improved steadily. CLAW stalked from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn but
flattened in the lane. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the six
path on the far turn and showed little more. NEVER COMPROMISE raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn about the five path and weakened in the lane. LOADED SNIPER stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole but faded through the far turn. URBAN BANDIT raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
TIZ NO CLOWN pressured the pace two deep while between horses, contested even terms at the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in under
steadily handling and inched clear nearing the wire. LITTLE ROO ROO took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, contested even terms two
deep on the turn but relented in the duel through the stretch. FIBER STRONG chased through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn and dug in
through the lane to take third under the wire. WOODLINE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in leaving the turn but
was nipped from third under the wire. TEACHINTHERELEASE became a bit edgy in the gate then hopped at the break, gave chase through the
backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and flattened in the lane. SILVER FRONT was not a factor. GOLDEN ARM pressured the pace inside but
dropped back leaving the five sixteenths pole and faded at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
AVALANCHE IS COMIN took a quick lead and moved to the inside to show the way, drew off at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane.
LOKI'S LIGHTNING stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then dueled to clear second
mid-stretch. JOLENES ECLIPTICAL became anxious in the gate then saved early ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail then finished well for third. BOBBI TWO STEPS raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. SENZA FINE raced in the five path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the six path then flattened in the lane. DEE DEE SIX rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole but showed little response. MONSTER SUMMER settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but
flattened at the rail on the far turn. WAC IS FAST raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
KIMSFAVORITESTORM stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then

Footnotes
SUMMONING DENIS saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, came through the far turn at the rail, dug
in with a late burst of speed and got up the final strides. DORADO rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides. GREATANDGOOD broke awkwardly then steadied in the vicinity of the
three quarter pole, settled off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn, cleared third past the eighth
pole then flattened stride. MY BOY CLYDE rounded the first turn about the five path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the
four path on the far turn, but showed little further. MAKIN' GOLD stalked the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the three path then flattened in the lane. O'RIGSBY settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
three path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. GRUMPY'S BUDDY raced well back off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch.
MOON FALL raced in the four path the first turn and was not a factor. CANDY FOR JUBA tapered in and stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. LADY RAMBO rounded the first turn off the rail, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened in the six path on the far turn.
