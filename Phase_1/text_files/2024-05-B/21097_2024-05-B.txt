CONNECTING settled off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch, rallied clear and lasted while tiring. CODE ENFORCER dropped well back then finished
strongly inside rivals. GAMERUN raced off the leaders outside then closed well in the final furlong. BOINTHEBACK lagged far behind then narrowed gap
without menacing. FREE BIRD BORDO moved off the leaders four wide and flattened out in the stretch. MY MAN WOODY forced the pace outside, took
over before half a mile then proved empty. I'M NOT A BABY trailed far behind and was never in contention. KEEP DEM TALKING set the pace under
pressure inside then was finished after half mile.

SONADOR moved close up inside, bid to the front at the top of the stretch and drew off while kept to her task. AZTEC BAY prompted the pace outside, was
carried out into the stretch and continued willingly. THAT'STONY'SSISTER moved close up four wide, bid very wide into the stretch gaining. HIDDEN
CACHE broke slowly, rushed up in the opening quarter then proved empty in the lane. BE LIKE BETH led narrowly in the two path, drifted out badly into the
stretch and tired. DUNE JUMPER broke sluggishly then gave way losing contact with her field. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the second
finisher for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
FINE WHINING controlled the pace in hand, widened throughout, was never threatened while being geared down late. CORONA CAMPIONE broke
sluggishly, advanced wide, bid on the final turn and was no match for the winner. GORMLEY GIRL lacked speed, moved inside and passed tiring rivals.
AMALFI LADY dropped back along the rail and lacked a rally. ELEVENMONTHSLATER chased within striking range for half a mile and faltered. NO MORE
DIAMONDS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and gave way readily.

EDDIE W hustled to the front inside, repelled repeated challenges and edged clear through the stretch in a steady drive. RUSH CENTER dueled the winner
to the stretch, continued well but could not get by. RENEGADE SERENADE rated off the pace in the two path, bid on the final turn then flattened out in the
stretch. ACTION HERO faded outside on the final turn then came again with a mild bid. IT'S A PITY made a menacing bid inside into the far turn then
proved empty in the stretch.
