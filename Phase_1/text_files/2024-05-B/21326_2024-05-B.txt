LAZARUS PROJECT trailed from the gate, circled rivals four wide through the turn, surged late and got up in the final strides. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER
stumbled at the start, was always within striking distance, swung out to the seven path entering the stretch, had a mild late rally and just missed getting up in
time. FIRST CITIZEN dueled for the lead along the rail, drifted to the five path at the top of the stretch, edged clear before the furlong marker then was
outfinished. ONEMORANDTHECHECK failed to menace. MARLEY LUCK bobbled at the start, loomed boldly three wide through the turn, remained a sharp
threat until deep stretch then came up empty. COMPASS POINT dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch and weakened late.

CORA CORONA drifted out leaving the gate, was righted and angled in to the two path, set all the pace, shook clear in upper stretch after drifting to the six
path and just lasted under right handed urging. MAC'S CAILIN pressured the winner two wide, dropped back a bit while herded out to the seven path, came
on again in the final stages and just missed getting up in time. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK went evenly. VERTISALUTE checked at the start, stalked the
pace three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CANELA FINA failed to menace. COWGIRLS HUMOR veered out at the start, had good
early speed along the inside and was through after a half. VICTORIA COMMAND trailed.

PRANCIPANTS never far back, rallied four wide on the far turn to make the lead at the quarter pole then drew off under strong handling to win as much the
best. JEN'S BATTLE unhurried early, rallied through the stretch five wide and got up for second. THEODOROPOULOS prompted the pace two wide into the
stretch then was outfinished. BANK BUSTER pressed the pace three wide around the clubhouse turn, gained a narrow lead, battled into the stretch then
weakened. BIG JAVA failed to menace. MISS OVER THERE set the inside early pace along the inside, matched strides into the stretch then was used up.
SPECIAL BEACH was through after a half.

urging. BAREBACK FUN pressed the early pace two wide, dropped back a bit, came on again outside the winner and was steadily gaining ground late in
the five path. SKY went evenly. CEVICHE was no factor. KRISTIN had speed along the inside into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
MISTER MOBIL pressed the pace three then two wide into the far turn, matched stride the length of the stretch, was bumped repeatedly by the runner up
through the final stages and proved best in a game effort. THAT'S THE WAY never far back, closed four wide through the far turn to draw on even terms for
the lead at the quarter pole, lugged in through the stretch bumping the winner and just missed. MANGA MAN saved ground for six furlongs, shifted out to
the five path entering the stretch and improved position late. HIDDEN ACCESS was hustled along, dueled for the lead two wide into the far turn then
weakened. VICTORY DIVISION failed to menace. DR. ZARNETT contested the lead along the inside for six furlongs then was used up. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
