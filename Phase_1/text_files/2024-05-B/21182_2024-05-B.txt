SUMMER GOLD set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. SPIRIT OF VICTORY raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead and ran on to be clearly second best. MISS ATHLETIC bumped at the start, raced off the pace four and five wide and was along
for the show in the final strides. MRS. CASH MAN chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. NEW BABY raced off the pace three wide, drifted
out under steady left-handed urging in the lane and bumped GIRVACEOUS into AIR FORCE BABE into MAS VINO leaving the sixteenth pole. REVOLU
chased the winner two and three wide and tired in the drive. GIRVACEOUS chased the pace three wide, faded in upper stretch, was soundly bumped
between foes leaving the sixteenth pole and dropped further back. AIR FORCE BABE raced off the pace three wide, was bumped between foes leaving the
sixteenth pole and was not urged from there. BULLET ON TARGET was outrun inside. MAS VINO bumped with MISS ATHLETIC at the start, raced off the
pace five wide, was bumped hard leaving the sixteenth pole, fell, quickly regained her feet and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
IN THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NEW BABY FROM FIFTH AND PLACED HER LAST FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.

the eighth pole, and drew clear in the final furlong. SILVRETTA (GB) laid up close in the three path, was cued to bid approaching the quarter, got outrun by
the outer eventual winner down the stretch, but kept on for place. STARRY HOPE laid off the pace inside, came under a ride in the two path going into the
far turn, floated out to the six path entering the lane, and finished evenly to get up for show. IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked in the four path, came under right handed encouragement while four wide midway around the far turn, but flattened in the stretch.
SWOONATRA set the pace inside, was cued in the two path midway around the far turn, but faded down the lane. LADY FIREFOOT bumped with an outer
foe and had to check at the start, trailed in the five path and made no impact. ORNELA (CHI) tracked inside but backed up around the far turn. GOOD

Footnotes
QUEEN DEYMAR saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole, rallied between foes, took over leaving the eighth pole and kicked
clear. BULLET VALENTINA set the early pace in the two path, settled back when a foe became intent on the lead down the backstretch, re-bid two wide
around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. R AWESOME SAUCE raced off the
pace three and four wide, bid outside of the top two in upper stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. FUNTASTICA hesitated at the start then hit the
gate to away several lengths behind the field, rushed up six wide around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around
the far turn, yielded in upper stretch but kept on for a minor share. CHRIS'S MOTOWN GAL failed to menace while racing four and five wide. PUCKERED
raced off the pace two wide, steadied early on the backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. SHINKA steadied early, saved
ground and was never in contention. CHILLING FACTOR chased the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. ANONYMOUS SOURCE was outrun
inside. AMERICAN PEACHES had only brief speed inside. GO MIKA pressed the pace three wide and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
PROVERB stalked in the three path, was coaxed along around the turn, bid passing the quarter, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and drew
past the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE set the pace inside, was roused midway around the turn, tipped out to the four
path entering the stretch, and dug in, but yielded to the outer eventual winner in the final sixteenth to place. LIGHTNING TONES trailed inside, came under
a drive while tipping out to the three path early around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. RARE JEWEL rated
in the four path, ranged up under coaxing around the turn, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, and evened out. DOUBLE PLAY KING chased
in the three path, came under right handed encouragement in the four path rounding the turn, but was one paced from the three path down the lane. ROD
TWO ROD bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the two path but backed up around the turn. BUFF HELLO bumped with an outer foe at the
start, prompted the pace in the two path but weakened around the turn, was pulled up on the gallop out and vanned off.

SHANKAR stalked in the five path, ranged up to bid in the three path midway around the far turn, swept to the lead at the top of the lane, tipped inside, and
drew clear. SPETTRO set the pace in the two path, was cued early around the far turn, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, but held place. FLATTER ME
laid in midpack in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for
show. MUFRIH chased in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, but flattened on his left lead in the stretch. EUPHORIA STAR rated
in the two path, came under right handed encouragement midway around the far turn, but failed to bid. EYES OF CHAMPION pressed in the four path but
backed up in the three path around the far turn. ENDLESS SUNSET raced in the back of the pack from the five path and never factored. SAMARITANO
raced off the pace inside early, floated out to the four path rounding the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but did not threaten.

SAUCY SIX saved ground well back, made some progress three wide around the far turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, surged outside and was up
late. MOBAY PRINCESS raced in range three wide, bid three deep rounding the far turn, took the lead approaching the quarter pole, drew clear in upper
stretch, drifted out late and led until the final strides. ROGERS PARK broke outwardly, raced off the pace four wide, advanced three wide around the far
turn, had aim in upper stretch but was one-paced through the stretch. BET STORMY raced in range three wide around the first turn, angled in down the
backstretch, remained up close at the rail around most of the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole, angled four wide in upper stretch and ran on for a
share. TELL ME SOME LIES raced off the pace three wide and had a mild rally. LUNA LOVE broke slowly, raced off the pace two and three wide, was
forced seven wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. VANISHING WISH set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the quarter pole.
DANNEEL saved ground in midpack, steadied leaving the three-eighths pole and was never a threat. LAST GLORY chased the pace two wide and faded
inside around the far turn. DID I DAZZLE YOU stalked the pace two wide in the clear, checked near the quarter pole and was eased from there.
