Footnotes
BACALL unhurried in the early going, dropped to the rail saving ground on the first turn, made a six wide rally in the final turn to engage the leader in
mid-stretch, battled with the runner-up down the lane and wore that one down late to pull clear in the final fifty yards. WOKE UP A DIVA reserved off the
pace for the run down the backside, ralied with the winner on the far turn, battled through the lane and was out-finished late in the lane while clearly second
best. WICKED KITTEN carried wide through the first turn to be in the eight path entering the backstretch, mounted a strong middle move to take command
nearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally, flattening out in the stretch run. SIRDAR broke a step slow while seemingly off balance, reserved off
the pace and went evenly passing tired rivals in the lane. PRETTY COAST sped off to a clear lead for a half mile and came up empty when chalenged into
the fianl turn. BEST WORST IDEA raced seven wide into the first turn while rank, made an early bid to challenge for the lead on the far trun and tired at the
top of the stretch. PER RULING 2024-00547 FROM HISA, PRETTY COAST HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO UNPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE
WHIP STRIKES.

Footnotes
IN THE DANCE stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, rallied to take command turning for home, drifted out through the lane whlie determinedly
repelling all challenges. TRAFFIC MASTER reserved off the pace for the first five-eighths, closed to striking distance while saving ground on the far turn,
angled out fro the drive, grindingly made up ground down the lane and found best stride late to surge near the wire and just miss. RUNANDSCORE set a
pressured pace down the backside, responded under an early drive on the bend to battle to upper stretch and was out-finished through the stretch. AWARD
NOMINATED caught wide through the first turn, settled in hand to track the leaders down the backside and failed to mount a threatening rally. ESTILO
MAGICO pressed the pace from between horses to midway on the final bend and weakened coming home. ENERGY EFFICIENT was not a threat.

ARROGATES DREAM well rated on a clear lead throughout, responded when called upon turning for home willingly and held safe the closers in a well
managed ride. TRES FRANCAIS stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, made a three wide bid at the head of the lane and could not narrow the
winner's lead while hold the late closer off to keep the place. GULF COAST GIRL slow earl to be the trailer for the first half mile, circled six wide on the final
turn and closed well with a belated rally in the lane. LUCKY IN LOVE tracked the pace from between rivals down the backstretch and mounted a mild bid
coming home under a long drive. MISCHIEFNESS went evenly failing to mount a rally. TOOSHAY well placed saving ground in striking position and faded.
COACH CALEY (IRE) prompted the pace for three-quarters and gave way in the stretch. AMOR SALVAJE chased the leaders from six wide down the
backstretch and failed to menace. THENDARA'S LOST was not a threat.

Footnotes
MALIBU BEAUTY set a well rated pace on a measured lead to upper stretch, pulled awy when called upon and finished gamely to just hold on late. I'M THE
BOSS OF ME raced wide in the first turn, stalked the pace through the turn, rallied in upper stretch, could not gain on the winner until late in the drive when
surging to just miss in the fianl strides. GONE AND FORGOTTEN unhurried early to trail, circled five wide turning for home and made a steady gain through
the stretch. CATS INTHE TIMBER well placed to be in striking distance and made a grinding bid down the lane. WARRIOR'S RANSOM failed to menace.
MAVILUS pressed the pace and failed to respond when called upon giving way in the stretch.

Footnotes
BEASTIE GIRL unhurried early while well in hand down the backside, saved ground on the final bend under patient handling awaiting racing room, rallied up
the fence when the rail opened turning for home and closed with a late rush to be clear in the final yards. BOARDWALK FRIES pressed the pace to the far
turn, took command nearing the quarter pole, finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner in a good try. LOOKIN AT KISSES reserved off the pace
to the far turn, made a steady advance coming for home and was along for the show. TURBO MILLIE tracked the leaders to be well placed in contention
into the final turn, made a mild bid turning for home and finsihed evenly unable to close the gap. STYLISH ANNA set a pressured pace to the three-eighths
pole and weakened. LA SANTA CLARA went evenly without impact. AMORICA stalked the pace from the fence down the backside and faded.
INSOUCIANT chased early and was through after a half mile.

SIR WELLINGTON tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied three wide to take command turning for home and cleared off convincingly in the lane. SHAFT'S
BULLET broke a step slow, continued on to be slow early as a distant trailer, gained ground to the pack through the turn and finished well with a belated
rally down the stretch. SPIKEZONE set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and was outkicked coming home. JACKMAN well placed to be in contention
down the backside, lost ground on the turn and re-rallied with mild late interest. THREES OVER DEUCES stalked the pace from the fence on the turn,
tipped out four wide for the stretch run and lacked a closing response. BROTHER CONWAY flashed brief speed to duel on the pace and gradually gave
way.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE IMAGE set a well rated pace on a clear lead to the top of the stretch, responded when called upon and dug-in determinedly to hold off the closers
in deep stretch. GO TAKE CHARGE reluctant to load pre-race, reserved off the pace four wide down the backstretch, was held up off heels when
commencing a rally into the turn, gathered up to rally five wide on the bend and finished willingly to just miss in a good effort. MY SANCTUARY rated in
mid-pack down the backstretch along the fence, saved ground to midway on the final turn, angled out three wide for the drive and finished well to miss in a
blanket finish. RETURN FIRE stalked the pace from three wide through the far turn to loom at the top of the lane and was outkicked down the stretch.
BOTTOMLESS REFILL well off the pace for the first half mile, gained ground while commencing a rally into the final turn, swung eight wide at the head of
the stretch and made a late rally. GENERAL J R unhurried early when taken in hand to drop to the rear of the field and showed late interest while failing to
menace. FORTINBRAS tracked the leaders from three wide while well placed to the far turn and failed to mount a closing rally. HOT ON YOUR HEELS
showed speed for a half to duel on the lead and faded. UWASNREDDI raced in contention for a half and came up empty. GOLDEN AL was not a threat.
MOONSHINE RUNNER raced along the fence in mid-pack and gave way into the far turn.

Footnotes
CONSPIRACY FACT tracked the pace from the three path, loomed a threat nearing the quarter pole, from an outside position took aim on the leader,
dueled with that rival through the final eight, and prevailed under an all out drive. PAPPY'S REVENGE pressed the pace around the first turn, stayed glued
to VISUAL ARTIST flank down the back stretch, took control around the second bend, clear lead leaving the quarter pole, engaged nearing the furlong
marker, fought on gamely inside CONSPIRACY FACT through the wire. EARL OF DASSEL pressed for position from the start, tracked the leaders from just
off the pace, urged on along the inside, finished willingly late, no threat to the top pair. AWESOME FLAY hopped at the start, raced off the pace and along
the rail, saved ground into far turn, angled off in upper stretch, put in a bid nearing the furlong marker, and finished evenly under the wire. KEEN LOOKIN
slow into stride at the start, chased three wide around the first, tracked the pace from off the rail entering the far turn, under a drive was out kicked through
the stretch. VISUAL ARTIST set the pace along the inside, under a drive leaving the three eighths pole, retreated through the stretch.
