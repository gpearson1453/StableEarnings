LITHICA set the pace well off the rail, held sway three wide through the turn, then turned back a bid in the stretch and drove clear inside the furlong marker.
LADY LOVES MONEY vied for the early lead on the inside, moved up in the stretch to bid inside the leader, then was no match for that one, while clearly
best of the rest. HAZARD PAY tracked the pace, moved up through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and evened out. MIMA PRINCESS ran

SNIP THE ROSES allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, lugged in, dueled and
exchanged bumps with MAGNUS EFFECT, then shook clear of that one and held under left hand urging. MAGNUS EFFECT set the pace well off the rail,
drifted out through the second turn and into the stretch, dueled with the winner, exchanging bumps with that one, then weakened late and held the place.
BLUE SOLDIER well placed, looped up four and five wide, being carried out by the leader, came widest into the stretch, was carried in slightly, being forced
to steady on heels, angled in further and was unable to gain. ROUND ROBIN hard to rated inside, came through and flattened in the lane. LEFT ON
BOYLSTON ran evenly for three quarter and faded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

TESHIMA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the tasl4. SWEET NOLA rated
back early, stalked the pace bearing out, held position on the two path through the second turn, raced boxed into the stretch, then had a mild gain when
clear. RIA FORMOSA unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed for the place. PATH TO
VICTORY mid pack, looped to position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded. APPLECROSS (IRE) was never
involved.

Footnotes
CARINA NEBULA set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, turned back a challenge, drifting out into the stretch, then drifted out further
and lasted under steady pressure. DIANTHUS well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, was carried five wide
into the stretch, made a steady gain, but lacked the needed late kick. LITTLE MISS MUNNY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled
widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. TWO LUCYS stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn,
bid four wide between rivals into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. MOST DIVINE was no factor.

MIDNIGHT DAJOEY tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off under mild
urging. R CHELLO well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then was no match for the
winner and held the place. ATROCIOUS unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady
gain, was blocked, waited, got through between rivals and edged up for the show. I'M THE CABANA BOY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through
the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up for a share. EMMA AT THE GATE stalked the pace on the outside rating, held position on the two path
through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and flattened out. CHASTE ONE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, was blocked and steadied on heels, then was unable to gain. EXCLUSIVE ENTRY set the pace inside and faded the final furlong.
