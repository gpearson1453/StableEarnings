raced in the three path, went to the rail in early stretch but offered no late bid. LORD ANTE stalked the pace in the four path and faded in the stretch. SLINK

was bumped at the start, stalked the early pace in the four path, bid at the half-mile pole, was steadied at the eighth pole and had no bid. HOLIDAY CITY
was bumped hard on both sides and squeezed back at the start, raced four wide, then had no late bid. PUNK saved ground to no avail.
