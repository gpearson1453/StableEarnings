YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN bumped a rival at the start, was coaxed to the lead and clear, set the pace from just off the rail, held sway under steady
handling. SKY ECHO got away well then settled off the leader, tracked from inside, made a mild bid at the top of the stretch but evened out thereafter.
SNOWBIRD stalked then pressed the eventual winner four then three wide, asked to keep up late on the far turn, won the battle for show but was no match
for the top pair. SCANDALOUS settled off the leaders outside stalking three then four wide, needed more. GOSPEL GORGEOUS was bumped at the start,
reserved at the rear initially inside into the first turn then switching out well off the inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
EURA NORTHERN SKY forced the pace from outside, was mostly three wide through the turn with the lead, met challengers from outside nearing the
sixteenth pole, dug in and held from that pair to prevail. SODDY DAISY settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, bid between foes near the sixteenth
pole, missed. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY got away slowly, lacked early speed, advanced five wide late on the turn, bid nearing the sixteenth pole drawing just
about even but appeared to hang in the closing stages. HEY ROXY contended through the opening three-sixteenths, continued to chase from inside
through the turn regaining closeness to the leader and eventual winner but evened out and faded late. EXCETERA broke just a step slowly, failed to
threaten racing off the inside of the track. COZZOLANI chased from inside early, dropped back, swung out past the quarter, failed to rally.

BROWN TOWN stalked three to four wide, bid past the quarter pole, dueled the length of the stretch before inching away late to prevail. RUNHAPPY
D'ORO got away alertly, set the pace from off the rail, was challenged turning for home, dueled inside that rival, lost the crop inside the final sixteenth and
was outfinished. RACE DAY REBAL was well-placed stalking three to two wide through the early going, moved out four wide late on the far turn, lacked the
needed late kick. GOSPEL MUSKETEER stalked near the inside mid-pack and went evenly. HAMAZING WISDOM failed to threaten while racing off the
inside. I WISH I COULD broke a step slowly, was quite rank heading to the first turn fighting the rider, was close early chasing inside, came up empty.

BRICKTOWN BROWN moved forward inside to force the pace, moved clear, held sway while being kept to the task. HUNTER QUICK stalked the leading
pair into the turn, came into upper stretch four wide looming a threat but could make no headway late. EURO TRACKING had the early lead then was
prompted by an inside foe, pressed that one, gave way in the stretch. HEADEDTOTHESTARS broke a step slowly, settled outside off the pace, swung five
wide, failed to rally. DANCING DEVIL tracked near the inside, lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
CONNORS OUTLAW quickly moved clear, set the pace from well off the rail, extended the advantage then was geared down in late stretch. OUR
CORNERSTONE settled well back shifting in, entered the turn along the rail but soon moved out off the fence to avoid a rival, moved between foes in upper
stretch and chased the winner home but was second best. JOLLY JUMPER stalked from outside four wide, came out six deep at the top of the stretch, ran
on evenly. HE SAID WAIT chased from between runners early, steadied past the seven-sixteenths when in tight, shifted in nearer the rail, ran on. FLY TO
THE BANK bobbled ever so slightly at the start then quickly moved forward chasing inside, was guided out past the seven-sixteenths racing two to three
deep, came up empty. ROWDY RASCAL settled at the back outside, was mostly four to six wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
PAPA BILL attended from between runners then pressed the leader from inside but off the fence entering the turn, took over near the quarter pole, was
challenged in mid-stretch, put away that one and just held from a closing rival late. RANCHO A GO GO settled off the pace, swung seven wide turning for
home then lugged out a bit under left-handed urging while avoiding a standing puddle of water at that juncture, came back in a bit soon after, was gaining
late but missed. QUALITY BLASTOFF broke a step slowly, was urged forward inside, came out past the seven-sixteenths, advanced under urging from
between foes past the three-eighths, swung five wide to the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit at that juncture drawing alongside the eventual winner looming
a threat, could not sustain the effort and flattened out late. LANGMEAD was forwardly-positioned between runners early, could not keep pace with the two
leaders into the turn, shifted nearer the rail past the quarter pole, kept on in the stretch. CLEARWATER SUNSET bumped a rival then steadied at the start,
raced wide advancing upon foes into the turn, moved out from five to seven deep on that bend, went evenly in the stretch. HAY SCOOBY DOO was
bumped at the start but showed brief speed pressing from inside early, dropped back, came off the rail on the turn, failed to rally. COME BET attended from
outside, took a narrow lead about the seven-sixteenths racing four wide, faltered at the top of the stretch. SMACKZILLA was urged from the break but
outsprinted, soon dropped back and was outrun.

PAULA M dueled inside a foe but off the rail, edged away late and held from a fast-closing rival. MARQUEE LADY chased mid-division near but off the
inside, moved out leaving the backstretch going four then six wide on the turn, moved in a bit in the stretch, was gaining steadily late weaving in and out
rallying around rivals. MICHAEL'S DREAMS forced the pace, dueled outside till late stretch then yielded. SUPRISING CODE broke inwardly, was
forwardly-positioned chasing inside, saved ground on the turn, ran on evenly. NATALIE'S GOLD chased into the turn three to four deep, ran on evenly. C W
CHARM broke outwardly, raced well back of the leaders early, shifted in on the turn, improved position inside. IMPUDENT was bumped lightly a few times in
the early going, saved ground through the turn, came out at the top of the stretch. CHEEKY KISS chased two to three wide, dropped back and faded. AUTO
BE A STAR exchanged bumps in the early going, checked past the five- and one-half and lost the irons, switched out soon after racing wide, regained
footing and fanned seven deep, was not a threat. KAMIKAZE broke outwardly bothering a rival, chased outside four to five wide into the turn, retreated.
ESTOY LOCA was fractious in the gate, bothered at the start and outrun. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF AUTO BE A STAR AGAINST
MARQUEE LADY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
FLAT HANBY tracked from inside, moved out three wide passing the five-sixteenths, bid at the three-sixteenths, put a head in front by mid-stretch, dueled
with an inside rival and just got the nod. BIG MUCKITY soon led, set the pace but was pressured by an inside foe, put that one away but was then joined by
outside rivals and headed, dueled the length of the stretch and dug in gamely but missed the nod. DOCTOR TINK settled off the pace, advanced four then
five wide on the turn, bid near the furlong grounds drawing just about even, lugged out a bit inside the sixteenth pole and was outkicked.
BLUESKIESANDANGELS settled off the pace and well off the inside, fanned a bid wider coming into upper stretch six deep, kicked on with mild late
interest. PROMISE CODE moved forward inside to press the pace, weakened. SWORD OF GOLD stalked from outside three to four wide on the turn,
floated out six to seven wide for the stretch, ran on. MAJESTIC LOVER shifted in late up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out in the drive,
failed to rally. IN BOND WE TRUST failed to threaten racing off the inside.

Footnotes
MONEY EXPRESS quickly moved clear setting the pace from well off the inside in the three to four path, was challenged and headed by mid-stretch, dug in
late and was resurgent to get the nod. SEARCHIN SAFARI stalked from off the inside part of the course four deep into the turn, moved closer four to five
wide, bid in mid-stretch, took a narrow lead that lasted till the wire and was just outfinished. WESTCOAST BREEZE shifted in, was mid-division into the turn,
edged closer two to three wide, rallied inside runners in the stretch steadily gaining but just missed. ISAIDWHATISAID shifted in, raced two wide through the
turn, kept on late to improve. NOISE COMPLAINT stalked from between runners racing five to seven wide throughout, kept on. FORTY STRANGERS
stalked from outside six to eight wide and needed more. PRINCE OF EARL was outpaced early racing wide, came into the stretch six deep and ran on with
mild late interest. LUCKY MCCOY settled off the pace, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. MAJESTIC
CRAKEN broke a step slowly, switched out off the inside heading up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn advancing between foes, lacked a late
effort. DOCS DUTY broke in the air, was outpaced early, swung out for the drive, was not a threat. DEROY was mid-pack inside saving ground through the
turn, weakened.
