POQUITO ROSE well placed between, angled in and tracked the leader through the turn, angled out to bid between rivals into the stretch, then made a
steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. WILD LOOKER rated back in the early going, angled three wide
through the turn to gain position, bid on that path into the stretch, then edged up for the place late. SONG OF INDY well placed and outside, gained a
striking position three wide through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SO MOXIE mid pack, moved up
three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and flattened out. UNICORN SALLY void of speed, looped through the turn, came widest into the

Footnotes
NO TAPPIN OUT never far back, gained a striking position four wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, edged ahead at the
furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. A THOUSAND PLANS sprinted to a clear lead quickly, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,
then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest. CLOUD IN THE WIND rated back early, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and flattened the final furlong. DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT tracked the pace early, lost some
ground inside through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and held a share. BON DIA well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the
turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and had no rally. BAHITI stalked the pace outside and faded through the turn.

KHOZANDO mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. ROUND
OF APPLAUSE tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside, angled out quickly in the stretch, then closed well late to
gain the place. ORAZIO well placed, vied for the lead down the backstretch, inherited a clear lead through the second turn, then weakened late and held the
show. SPETTACOLI (ARG) led in the early going and rated back down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and flattened
the final furlong. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT unhurried, gained position four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and flattened the final
furlong. GIANT PAYDAY ran evenly. C THE KING allowed to settle, gained position four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and had
no raly. BOURBON THUNDER vied for the early lead outside, gained a short lead down the backstretch then faded. J P CORNETTA was no factor. LEAVE
