Blanchard, Recaldo;
Footnotes
SCRIMPER chased the lead into the turn, closed willingly two wide under right handed urging to make the lead past the quarter pole then widened the
balance of the trip to win as much the best while being ridden out. CAVALETTO allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the six path and finished clear
for second. A PRAYER FOR KIDS passed a tiring rival. KINDERHOOK sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace past the quarter pole
then tired. NO MAS CERVEZA was unprepared at the start as he dropped his head and trailed throughout.

FIRST SONG bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, made the lead entering the turn, drifted to the six path entering the
stretch, set the balance of the pace under strong pressure and proved best under right handed urging. SHOW SLIDING HOME stalked the early pace three
wide, loomed boldly outside the winner into the stretch and finished second best. STONE COLD CAT never far back, swung wide and closed a gap late in
the middle of the racetrack. VENTURE ON was in tight and bumped leaving the chute, allowed to settle then found his best stride late inside rivals. DR.
ZARNETT bumped at the start, was well placed and failed to offer the needed response. WHAT A RUSH hopped at the start, was in tight and bumped soon
thereafter then failed to reach contention. TIGER TRAIL bumped at the start and was no factor. POWERFUL PHIL sped to the lead before a quarter, set the
pace along the inside down the backstretch, kept on when headed by the winner remained a sharp threat into the stretch and stopped abruptly late.

Footnotes
OVERLOAD reluctant to load, chased the early pace two wide, dropped inside on the turn, slipped through to make the lead at the top of the stretch and
drew off under right handed urging. VICTORY DIVISION never far back, had a mild late rally five wide and finished clear for second. SAMMY AND SHORTY
allowed to settle, swung wide and closed a gap late six wide. MARVIN'S EXPRESS unhurried early, finished with good courage inside rivals. NEBULOSA
away alertly, set the pace in the two path to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. MISTER MOBIL hopped at the start and was no threat. SHANGHAI
PRINCE chased the early pace two then three wide and gave way late. OHIO EAGLE was no factor.
