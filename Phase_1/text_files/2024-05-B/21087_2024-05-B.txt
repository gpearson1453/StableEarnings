Footnotes
CALABRIAN QUEEN vied for the early lead between rivals and finished well to draw clear under strong handling. MISS CHARGE IT vied for the early lead
near the rail and held the place position late. DARE ME chased the pace along the inside, angled out into the upper stretch to take aim and flattened out.
CLASSY EDGE urged three deep from the outside of foes and faded through the drive. TENSAS CLEAR broke awkwardly, lost his irons at the start,
regained his irons midway through the stretch run and lost all chance.

EMILYHASHERTURN prompt the early leader from the outside down the backstretch, had a clear lead into the stretch, collared near the sixteenth pole,
came on again in a determined run under all out pressure. QUEEN OF THE MOON settled off the early pace, shifted in early to race along the inside around
the first turn down the backstretch, steadied near the three eighths pole, angled out near the quarter pole, raced from the outside in the stretch drive, looked
to take charge near the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort. MEGANS MILLIONS stalked the pace three deep from the outside of foes, dug in
between through the stretch drive and kept on gamely to the wire. COUNTRY BELLE dropped back early, raced two to three wide and had no response.
LITTLE E set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded.

KNOCKALITTLELOUDER set his own uncontested early pace and held well through the drive to prove best under steady pressure. HELAIRE was allowed
to settle early, angled to the inside down the backstretch, continued an inside run past the three eighths pole, eased out through the upper stretch and
slowly closed in on the winner racing four deep. PEPPER JACK tracked the pace near the inside and weakened off the top pair. SENATOR CON forwardly
placed early on and tired readily. RIPITTOTHERIGHT dropped back early, lost ground and never menaced.

CLASSIC WARRIOR dropped back to race mid pack early, raced near the inside around the far turn, continued a rail bid in the drive and surged up under
strong handling. NATIVE REQUITE stalked the pace, was near the inside past the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire while racing two to three
wide in the stretch. POPPY T dueled for the early lead near the rail and gave way grudgingly late racing four deep. BELLAMY BROTHER void of early
speed, swung wide through the lane and had not enough. FRENETIC DAY was bumped at the start, raced three wide around the far turn, five deep into the
upper stretch and weakened. LOST MY BAG broke out, bumped at the start, dueled two deep from the outside of foe and faded. STONECOAT lost ground
to race far back and never threatened.
