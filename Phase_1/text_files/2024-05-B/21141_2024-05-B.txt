Footnotes
SHANGRILAMA (IRE) broke in and bumped rival, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid two wide approaching the quarter pole, inched ahead
outside the eighth pole, cleared midstretch and held well over the runner-up. SHE'S GOT A WAY stalked two wide then three wide into the stretch, finished
determinedly but could not reach the winner while proving second best. YOLO CALLS took control and showed the way up the backstretch, tested by outer
rival approaching the quarter pole, relinquished the lead nearing the furlong marker and churned on to save the show. BIG MAMA SUE broke awkwardly
then got bumped back at the start, moved into range quickly, chased along the rail through the turn, moved out a bit in the lane and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
DARK MARCUS bobbled slightly and brushed with inner rival in the beginning, unhurried at the back, passed a pair of rivals from outside into the far turn,
gained rapidly three to four wide around the bend, swept by the leader entering the lane, drew off in the stretch run under asking and was kept busy to the
wire. TOPPERS WAGER stalked three deep, remained three wide outside a rival on the far turn, could not summon the needed rally but kept on to edge
SPOT D' ORO for the place honors. SPOT D' ORO vied from inside into the first turn then cleared around the bend, showed the way unchallenged to the
quarter pole, confronted by the winner leaving the far turn, offered no resistance at the top of the stretch, churned on through the final furlong and lost the
place. SUNDAY SUN showed speed and fought outside a rival into the first turn, took a stalking position in the two path around the bend, chased a bit off
the rail through the far turn and weakened down the lane. MUCHO SUERTE brushed with outer rival at the start, stalked between rivals or in the two path,
dropped back outside a rival on the far turn and came up empty in the lane. T ONE D FLOUR FREE stalked the pace along the rail, dropped back on the far
turn and tired in the drive.

AWESOME RHYTHM stalked the pace inside rivals, hugged the rail through the turn, came off the fence in upper stretch and drove clear. KIMMER lacked
early speed, moved inward trailing the field, went inside a rival entering the turn, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the final furlong and finished well
for second. PAULLIAC (IRE) stalked between rivals up the backstretch, took the turn two wide, moved out in the lane and finished evenly late. MAN
OVERBOARD took a bump from inside crossing the dirt, stalked the pacesetter outside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, roused in the two path around the
turn, chased within striking distance into the final furlong and flattened in the late stages. BARSABAS drifted out and brushed MAN OVERBOARD crossing
the dirt, settled off the pace, chased outside a rival at the back on the turn, steered out in upper stretch and could not threaten. I'M A LUCKY MAN sped
clear and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged past the eighth pole and folded in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
JANE AUSTEN stalked the leader into the clubhouse turn, went up to apply pressure from outside around the bend, kept the heat on IN THEORY through
the far turn and into the stretch, dueled while getting floated out a bit before taking a bump past the sixteenth pole, then dug in late to edge the runner-up. IN
THEORY cleared quickly and crossed over to the inside, set the pace under pressure from JANE AUSTEN, maintained a short lead into the stretch, drifted
out while dueling in the lane, bumped the winner past the sixteenth pole and was bested late. SAKURA BLOSSOM stalked the pace from the rail position,
saved ground to the stretch and lacked a response when called upon. PINK WHITNEY chased in the three path through both turns, drifted out from left
handed encouragement in upper stretch and could not rally. THE STEWARDS CONUCTED AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED
THAT IN THEORY DRIFTED OUT AND INITIATED CONTACT WITH JANE AUSTEN BUT SINCE JANE AUSTEN FINISHED AHEAD OF IN THEORY, NO
CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

held well under a drive to the wire. IDAHO ONCE chased off the rail then between rivals, angled in leaving the backstretch, tipped off the fence at the
quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane, finished willingly from outside but could not get to the winner. DEVIL MOON raced up close inside the leader
early then switched to the outside, bid two wide at the three-eighths pole, fought between rivals while taking over on the turn, lost command entering the
stretch, fought on to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. MACKINNON trailed in the early going, asked right handed on the turn in the two path, moved out
in upper stretch and failed to threaten. VINNY THE COIN took control early, crossed over once in the clear, challenged by rivals on the turn, steadied a bit at
the quarter pole and weakened down the lane.

KEYCHAIN GIRL pressed from outside, took over early on the turn, disposed of inner rival midway around the bend, showed the way still off the rail into the
lane, held a comfortable lead into the final sixteenth, grew weary late but was able to hold safely. YVETT'S SURPRISE got crowded between foes early,
trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail into the turn, made progress while angling out around the bend, spun four wide into the lane, rallied in tandem
with ZZYZX and edged that rival for second. ZZYZX raced up close early from outside then chased off the rail, lost ground four then three wide on the turn,
put in a late run and got outkicked for second. WARREN'S WILD RIDE chased out of range two wide into the turn, moved to the rail and cut the corner into
the stretch, asked down the lane but could not rally. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) settled off the pace outside a rival, dropped back to last on the turn then
angled to the inside, cornered nicely into the stretch but was never a factor. SWEET MILLIE showed early speed then began to drift out and was corrected
quickly, went up to take control with KEYCHAIN GIRL to the outside, lost command at the three-eighths pole, could not kick on with the winner approaching
the five-sixteenths marker, exited the bend two wide and faded.

STRIKINGLY stalked along the rail then two wide into the stretch behind the leader, challenged from outside at the eighth pole, took over in midstretch,
cleared briefly with a sixteenth remaining and lasted over the late run from the runner-up. KETONIA (FR) raced near the back early, took the turn two then
three wide, angled out at the top of the lane, drifted in midstretch, closed in and drew alongside the winner late but could not get by. PRECIPICE broke a
step slow, settled along the inside, coaxed early on the turn, had to pause from the five-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, moved out in the lane, finished
willingly but got outkicked by the top pair. JAI HO established the front quickly, showed the way from inside through the turn, challenged by STRIKINGLY in
upper stretch, relinquished the lead shortly after and weakened in deep stretch. RESPECT THE CROWN settled outside a rival, chased between foes at the
five-sixteenths marker, tipped out in upper stretch and could not rally. QUEEN BERKELEY trailed along the inside into the turn, moved out to the two path
around the bend and lacked further response. ANNIE FOX forwardly placed inside the pacesetter then switch to the outside, chased two wide on the turn,
three wide into the lane and weakened. QUEEN GIRVIN tracked the pace three deep, continued off the rail around the bend, spun four wide into the lane
and had little left for the stretch run.
