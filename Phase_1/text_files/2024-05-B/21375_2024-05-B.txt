Footnotes
UNGLUED broke well then tossed head up and dropped back to last, lacked speed and continued in the rear, gained ground along the rail late on the turn,
moved into contention, tipped to the two path in the upper stretch, responded when given cue, roused forward under a drive and drew clear. MY FOUR
POINT OH tracked the top pair in the opening quarter, was ridden along three wide late on the turn, sustained bid into the lane, raced four deep in the final
sixteenth and failed to be a match for the winner late. BETH'SWICKEDSMACK raced behind the early pacesetter, moved up to engage SUPINE DUCHESS
at the quarter pole, ran on two to three paths wide into the lane and stayed on to clear the rest. SUPINE DUCHESS sped to the lead soon after the start and
set the clear pace, took on the challenge of rival at the quarter pole, held a slim lead into the lane then came up empty near mid-stretch. ASHLEIGH' BACK
raced off the early pace, came three to four wide into the stretch and neve threatened. LUCYS STROLL chased the top pair in the opening quarter,
retreated around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

MY GOLDEN DAY was allowed to settle after opening stages and rated just off the early leaders, let out four wide late on the turn, quickly advanced to
challenge for the lead, vied along the outside through the lane, battled on with KASA deep stretch, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away.
KASA pressed the pace in the early going, remained up close three wide around the turn, hustled along turning for home, vied with rivals for the lead, fought
on gamely with MY GOLDEN DAY then failed to match late. PEGGY RULES raced up close along the rail, tugged along but lacked a clear path late leaving
the backstretch, tipped out turning for home, urged three paths wide past mid-stretch and got a head up for show. FLAT OUT ROSE was forwardly placed in
a compact field, made a move between foes leaving the backstretch, vied with SAMIRA around the turn, could not match strides with the outside duo past
the eighth pole but ran on and got outnodded for show. SAMIRA set a pressured pace from the onset, dueled with FLAT OUT ROSE around the turn, fought
back into the final furlong then gave way.

C R INSTA GATOR led the way by a narrow margin around the first turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, held firm over close running rival
around the far turn, roused for more turning for home, responded, widened advantage then held late under an all out drive. WARRIOR'S RUN was well
reserved and raced in the back, picked up the pace along the rail late on the turn, tipped three paths wide entering the head of the lane, responded gamely
under firm handling and was getting to the winner late. MAHOMES stalked three wide under slight restraint through early stages, moved up into striking
distance around the final turn, lost some ground on the leader turning for home, stayed on gamely and regained in final stages. WELLER ROGUE raced off
the early pace, hustled along three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND pressed the pace around the first turn and up the
backstretch then weakened around the far turn.

IMPRESSOR raced off the pace in initial stages then moved up into contention near the half, got bumped two times when rival was forced out late on the
backstretch, stayed on gamely, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, took the lead a furlong out and finished going away. KINFOLK tracked the
pace four wide in the early going, dueled outside of SCOTT CITY around the turn, battled on for command to the eighth pole then failed to be a late match
for the winner. BIYOMBO was away in good order and raced near the lead then raced just off SCOTT CITY, was forced to alter out a path when
aforementioned rival angled in while not clear late on the backstretch, bumped with BARBERSHOP and steadied, weakened, saved ground on the turn,
tipped two wide for the drive and got up for show. EIGHT STRAIGHT raced outside off the early pace, was ridden two to three wide around the turn, kept on
two wide in the stretch and needed more for impact. SCOTT CITY angled to the inside while not clear forcing BIYOMBO out and causing a chain reaction of
bumping, dueled around the turn then gave way. BARBERSHOP sat up close and was bumped into and forced to steady when SCOTT CITY angled to the
inside forcing BIYOMBO into path, weakened and failed to move back into close contention. EZ FITZ saved ground and had no response. SCOTT CITY
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND PLACED SIXTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE LATE ON THE BACKSTRETCH

Footnotes
WILDATLANTICSTORM sprinted out to the lead the start, cleared and angled inside, led the way then took on the challenge of WARREN L entering the
turn, vied for the lead past the quarter pole, shook free and widened advantage entering the lane, continued to find more under pressure, drifted wider under
right handed pressure and held firmly. WARREN L raced just off the leader in opening stages then edged up to challenge WILDATLANTICSTORM late on
the backstretch, vied for the lead around the turn, could not match strides with the eventual winner at the head of the lane but stayed on gamely to the end.
BIG LUKE tracked the early pace, roused along the rail around the turn, cut the corner and advanced up the inside to race in strong contention in the final
furlong then yielded late. FINISH UP raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. ROCKIN THE DAD
BOD raced in range in the opening quarter, failed to progress under a ride around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten.
SUCCESSION raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
STYLISH STYLE was nicely rated up the backstretch settled just off the early leaders, let out a notch entering the turn, loomed boldly three wide at the
quarter pole, vied outside of WON HAPPY MAMA down the lane, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away late. WON HAPPY MAMA sped to the
lead at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, held firm over close running pursuers around the turn, took on the challenge of STYLISH STYLE in
the upper stretch, fought back gamely along the inside and got denied in final stages. THAT'S OUR VISION settled off the pace in early stages, saved
ground and came under a ride along the rail mid-way around the turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, gained closer contention then tipped two to
three wide and got up late for show. BEAUTIFLY TROUBL'D bobbled slightly at the start and quickly advanced into close contention, hustled along three
wide in striking range around the turn, weakened off the embattled duo in the upper stretch and got edged late for show. DREAMIN IT UP chased the
pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled along two wide in close range around the turn then gave way. JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS chased near midpack on
the inside in the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn , tipped two to three wide for the drive and had no late response. INCA STROLL ducked in
sharply at the start and trailed. TH STEWARDS POSTED AAN INQUIRY AT THE START WHICH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
CHARMONTE settled in hand tracking four paths wide in the early going, hustled up three wide to engage rivals entering the turn, took over the lead at the
head of the lane, widened advantage under right handed pressure and remained clear. DEVIOUS DIVA rated just off the early pace, edged closer still in
hand racing between foes near the half mile marker, launched a four bid late on the turn, sustained bid into the lane, could not reach the clear leader but
finished clearly second best. FLATHEAD FINALE settled along the outside in the opening quarter, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch and got up for a share. SWEET AND EZ raced up close from the onset, vied for the lead around the turn, fought back in upper
stretch then weakened and got edged late for show. SUPRISING CODE briefly held the lead in initial stages then raced up close, vied along the inside
around the turn then tired in the drive. HAZARDTOYOURHEALTH raced in range in the opening quarter then steadily retreated. MEDICINE SHOW showed
response in the opening quarter then quickly dropped back mid-way around the turn.
