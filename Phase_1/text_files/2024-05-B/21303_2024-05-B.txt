Footnotes
UNSPOKEN TRUTH took over the lead soon after the start, widened to a commanding advantage still unasked around the turn, came two wide into the
upper stretch, tapped once right handed, angled to the inside, tapped once more in the final furlong then finished in hand. MY KINDA TROUBLE lacked
speed and trailed in the back, hustled up around the turn, found a kick at the head of the lane, gained ground three wide and finished clearly second best.
PROMISED OATH chased the clear leader around the turn, ran on two paths wide through the lane and captured show in final strides. MORA
HOPPERTUNITY broke on top then quickly conceded position to UNSPOKEN TRUTH, chased after clear pacesetter around the turn, saved ground
entering the lane and got edged late for show.

Footnotes
DOUGHTY pressed the pace through early stages, moved up to engage MUSTANGMAGNA for the lead mid-way around the turn, vied for command into
the upper stretch, shook free approaching the eighth pole, widened advantage and kept clear. MY MAYBELENNE tracked in contention three to four wide,
loomed up three paths wide to race in striking distance at the quarter pole, given cue leaving the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner past
upper stretch but dug back in late and captured place. IRISH TAP was forwardly placed racing just off the top pair in the backstretch, sat patiently around
the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, roused forward to race in striking position, could not kick on with the winner but ran on and got nipped for place on the
wire. MILLIGANMIKEANDME saved ground while rated off the early pace, shifted out late on the turn, came three to four wide into the lane and needed
more for impact. MUSTANGMAGNA set a pressured pace in early stages, took on the challenge of DOUGHTY mid-way around the turn, vied into the upper
stretch then gave way. CANARY NATION was briefly restless in the gate, lacked speed, raced in the back and never got going.

Footnotes
GOLD STRATEGY stalked the clear pacesetter around the first turn, picked up the pace mid-way up the backstretch, closed in on the leader late on the far
turn, took command at the head of the lane, drew off under a drive then finished in hand. FULL MOON BEACH rated off the clear leader up the backstretch,
was ridden along two paths wide into the upper stretch, was no match for pulling away winner but ran on and nipped foe to take place. MOR FOXY secured
inside position around the first turn, stalked the clear pacesetter and saved ground, was ridden along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide mid-stretch,
kept under a drive, dug in late and got nipped for place. ALMA'S PRINCESS settled off the early pace along the inside, shifted out three to four wide leaving
the far turn, ranged up into contention for a runner up spot and got outnodded for show. GATA RUNZ hustled up from the gate, cleared the lead and
crossed over to the inside, quickly widened to a commanding lead around the first turn, continued well clear up the backstretch, hustled up late on the far
turn, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane, steadily weakened and just missed the runner up spots. SAENGER STAR lacked speed and trailed
in the back, lost contact with the field and jogged in.

Footnotes
ZATARA was allowed to settle in early stages along the outside, was ridden along three to four wide around the far turn, came five paths wide into the upper
stretch, rallied gamely along the outside and edged away. I GOT A GUY tracked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two
wide and given cue turning for home, responded, edged up near the lead deep stretch then got outkicked by the winner. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT held a slim
lead around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the final turn, continued on top a furlong out then got collared and weakened
approaching the final sixteenth. DAKOTA INVADER tracked the early pace, was ridden up close three wide late on the far turn, ran on into the lane then
evened out late. DOUBLECHECK pressed the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued in close range at the quarter pole then tired in
the drive. MISTER LESTER fanned four wide into the first turn, settled through early stages not too far back, had no response when called upon entering the
far turn and retreated. BIG TAP lacked speed and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
SMART N INTUITIVE tracked the early pace, was ridden two wide around the turn, tipped three wide near the eighth pole, responded gamely and kicked
clear. SECRET BLARNEY raced in early contention then lost a couple spots after opening stages, hustled up along the rail late on the turn, shifted two wide
at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. TAP THE BRAKES raced in range through the early going, was ridden along three
wide approaching the quarter pole, ran on into the lane and stayed on for a share. TAKE ME UP BRADY set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around
the turn, continued on top a furlong from home then got collared and weakened late. TOSKA'S RULER was forwardly placed stalking the leader, made a bid
for command late on the turn, came two wide into upper stretch and flattened out. BIG PINES SANDY raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane
and failed to threaten. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced in the back, swung four to five wide into the drive and never menaced. CHINLEE chased along the
inside off the early pace and steadily faded.

JUSTASTROLLIN sped to the lead soon after the start and set the early pace, held firm around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, repelled
inside bid near the furlong marker, roused for more, responded, widened advantage and finished clear. LITTLEMORE TA KELA raced in range entering the
turn, hustled along four paths wide entering he head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. CINCO DE MO raced off the early pace,
swung five wide into the upper stretch and gained show. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP was forwardly placed along the inside, cut the corner and raced in striking
distance of the leader, could not reach rival then steadily weakened. TAP ON BY raced up close along the outside, hustled up in close range at the quarter
pole, ran in three wide to mid-stretch then faded. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced off the pace, came two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. STROLLIN
NORMAN B saved ground to no avail.

DEER RUN hooked up with LETS ROCK N STROLL soon after the start, matched strides racing outside of rival up the backstretch, continued to duel
around the turn, battled on gamely past the furlong marker then shook free and finished clear. EVANDER was allowed to settle off the clear top trio, picked
up the pace around the turn, came four paths wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and finished clearly second best. LETS ROCK N STROLL
vied for the lead inside of DEER RUN soon after the start, continued to match strides around the turn, fought on gamely to mid-stretch then gave way.
BOBULINSKI stumbled and came away slowly at the start, raced in the back, came under a ride entering the turn, kept under a drive three to four wide
down the lane and improved position without threatening the top trio. GLOME raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and had no respoonse.
CAN'T BE CAUGHT raced off the pace, saved ground and failed to move into contention. MONEY AIN'T ENOUGH tracked the embattled duo into the turn,
made a rail bid approaching the quarter pole, could not reach the top pair, ran on into upper stretch then emptied out.
