SMART LAD away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and held the closers safely at bay late. SETTECENTO settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide entering the first turn, began to
advance two out from the rail upon entering the backside, continued a three wide bid entering the final turn, and finished determinedly to prove second best.
PURSUE broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the lane to get up for a share. SET TO SHINE tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while
saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but came up empty in the lane. STAR ENTRY away well, and saved ground through
the first turn to gain a stalking trip entering the backstretch, struggled to hold his position in the run to the final turn, and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT away alertly and vied for the lead while racing out from the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of
SLOOP JOHN B in the run down the backside and into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and held off a late bid by TIME TICKER to
prevail. TIME TICKER tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly through the final turn while
continuing to save ground, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. DESIRED OUTCOME stalked the leaders into the
backstretch at the back of a compact field, launched his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up for
a share. SLOOP JOHN B broke sharply and dueled for the lead three wide into the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT in
the run down the backside and through the final turn, but was outfinished in the stretch drive. LOGICAL AL tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PRINCE CAIRO away
well and tracked the contested early pace while racing two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
but failed to respond when called upon.

RICHARDS COMMAND away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival leaving the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive
to garner a share. CARLA'S HONOR settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of
RICHARDS COMMAND in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, got the better of her pace rival leaving the turn, and held off
a late bid by ZETAMARIE to prevail. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, mounted a
two wide bid entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while finishing evenly. ZETAMARIE broke sharply and stalked the contested early
pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed best of all one
out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. STAR FINALITY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to
maintain her position in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. BAKZONE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, saved ground
through the final turn, but failed to menace.

DAPHNE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in run down the backstretch and into the final turn,
and finished willingly to hold off a late surge by SHAMRA to prevail. SHAMRA stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished full of run while drifting four wide in deep stretch to get up for the place while
gaining late. SOLARITY hopped at the start to get away poorly, settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in deep stretch to get up for a share. SUPER CARO away well and
was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and
finished evenly five wide in the drive. HOAX broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. INDYETTA was unprepared at the start, and hopped at the start to get away last, trailed
the field throughout, and was never able to overcome her early trouble. Following the running of this race, the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of
the race. After review it was deemed that all horses received a fair start, and no change was made to the original order of finish

MISS THE HYPE away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the
rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to get up in time. LASTING LIGHT raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, put away his pace rival midway through the final turn, and
just failed to last. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the
inside entering the final turn, and closed fastest of all three wide in the drive to garner a share. ICE BREAKER broke sharply and tracked the early leaders
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. ROSE OF
TEXAS was fractious prior to the start, and unprepared as she was still in the hands of the assistant starter as the gates opened to get away poorly, rushed
up three wide entering the backside to force the issue from the outside of LASTING LIGHT, continued to press the leader into the final turn, but faded in the
late going. AMANDA away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide into the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. TEXAS HUMOR settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and was never a serious factor. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an
inquiry into the start of the race, in particular to ROSE OF TEXAS. After review the stewards deemed that this horse DID NOT receive a fair start, was
declared a non-starter and ordered a full refund on this horse. ROSE OF TEXAS raced for purse money only.

PARKER POINT away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, repelled a challenge from READY HERO leaving the turn, and edged clear in the lane. RACING RIVER was pinched between rivals and raced
rank when taken in hand in the early going, settled well off the leader while racing four wide into the backstretch, mounted a five wide bid entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for the place. READY HERO tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while being hung
four wide, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the
drive to just miss the place. FAMILY BIZ tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside
entering the final turn, but finished evenly one out from the rail in the drive. HOLY EMPEROR away well and tracked the early pace while racing between
rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly two wide in the drive. YOU DON'T OWN ME settled
well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a serious impact. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled well
