Footnotes
COOKE CREEK broke a bit outwardly at the start, set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied mild pressure, dug in to duel with that bidding rival
nearing the lane, gamely clung to an advantage into midstretch and shook free with a sixteenth to go. WINSTON WOLF pressed outside of the eventual
winner and from the three path, bid and vied turning for home, dueled through upper stretch, but was turned away in the final furlong and proved second
best. HE'S GOT SWAGGER saved ground off of the pace, shifted out to the five path while edging show from an outer rival in midstretch and chased the
top pair home. OUR DREAM RYE'D broke a step slow while subtly getting floated out, stalked the top pair from the four path, chased them into the lane and
yielded floating to the six path in midstretch. HARLEEZY bobbled at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and made little impact.

Footnotes
SILVER HEIST stalked the top pair from the three to two path, tipped outside of them and to the six path entering the lane, got floated wider running on in
upper stretch, sustained grinding progress to bid whlie shifting inwardly in the final furlong, brushed the leader sparking a duel at the sixteenth pole, sparred
while continuing to drift through the late stages and prevailed via a narrow head-bob. ASMODEUS led narrowly from an outer prompter while taking the turn
in the two path, shfited out to the four path entering the lane before shaking free in upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong grounds as an outer rival
threatened, took light contact from that one at the sixteenth pole, dueled through the late stages and missed in a tight photo. DOUBLE BARREL prompted
outside of the leader and from the three path, got floated to the five path entering the lane, yielded while drifting out to the eight path in upper stretch, lost
place in midstretch and kept on. JR'S GIFT trailed in the four path and failed to factor. GLUCKSTADT tracked along the inside, shfited out to the three to
four path around the turn, but drifted inwardly in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DAISY DUKE bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung out to the seven path entering upper stretch, rallied widest to
bid at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. MOOCHIE GIRL pursued from midpack in the four to three path into the turn, shifted out to the five path entering
the lane, rallied to bid along with an outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole but got outkicked. MEUCCI'S REVENGE was bumped by an outer rival and
bobbled at the start, stalked three wide before moving forward to press the leader into the turn, bid turning for home and forged an advantage entering the
lane, inched clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer pair of bidders with a sixteenth to go. GRACE ON GRACE chased forwardly two wide and
between horses, then along the inside around the turn, tipped back to the two path entering the lane, shifted inwardly to chase along the rail into the final
furlong and lacked a bid. THE FEISTY ONE broke a step slow, lacked speed in the five to four path into the turn, then moved up belatedly. KISS CAM broke
a touch outwardly, stalked four to three wide into the turn, but yielded between horses while delaying changing leads in upper stretch, then faded.
CALCETINES broke slowly, trailed in the two to three path, surpassed an inner faltering foe turning for home and made little impact. HAVEN'T A RED CENT
rushed between horses to show the way along the inside approaching the turn, but was headed by an outer prompter entering the lane and stopped.
MADEMM COCO chased forwardly along the inside, but steadied hard into the turn and readily faltered.

TAXED tracked in the four to three path, tipped to the five path entering the lane before straightening to the four path to take aim between horses, bid
leaving upper stretch and kicked clear. BRAGANZA bumped an outer rival at the start, tugged leaving the chute, advanced to press outside of the leading
pair with five furlongs to go, prompted in the four path around the turn, drifted out to the seven path while vying entering upper stretch, but was outkicked by
an inner bidder in midstretch and proved second best. CONDENSATION dueled for the lead two wide, then between horses into and around the turn, but
yielded to an outer pair while flopping by to her left lead at the furlong grounds. UNIFYING dueled for the lead with an outer rival, then inside of a pair of foes
around the turn, got headed entering the lane and tired. NAPA CANDY trailed in the four path and made little impact. BE LIKE WATER was bumped by an
inner rival and put to tight quarters among foes at the start, tracked along the inside, chased around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR GENERAL showed the way along the inside, remained well in hand around the far turn, kicked clear when set down entering the lane and held
well. KUPUNA pressed outside of the leader, stalked down the backstretch, pursued in the three path around the far turn, chased as the leader shook clear
entering the lane, kept on through the final furlong but was fended off and pulled away from the rest. UNCLE JAKE was off a bit awkwardly before bumping
an inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside while tugging in the bit around the first turn, shifted outside of the top pair entering the backstretch,
pursued from the four path around teh far turn, chased between horses turning for home, took contact from his outer counterpart in upper stretch and held
show. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY broke a beat slow and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, saved ground chasing around the
far turn and yielded. ARCHIE THE GIZA pursued from midpack two wide, then in the five path around the far turn, bid for show turning for home, but leaned
in and brushed a rival in upper stretch and tired. GENTLE SOUL broke a step slow, got pinched between horses and steadied back at the start, raced at the
rear two wide and made little impact. AH JEEZ was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
STOWAWAY bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses, took aim four wide entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the
furlong grounds and gradually edged ahead. SHOPPER'S REVENGE showed the way in the two path, led well in hand as an outer rival prompted around
the turn, repelled that foe's challenge entering upper stretch, dug in meeting a different rival's bid in midstretch, sparred gamely but was bested. GLEN AIRY
laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed into the turn, shfited four wide in upper stretch, ran on and edged show late. BRIGADE COMMANDER laid close
up along the inside, tracked before chasing around the turn, forged show in midstretch but lost that position to an outer rival late. HAVILDAR was bumped
between horses at the start, stalked in the three path, moved to press the leader into the turn, bid entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch
and weakened between horses. CALRISSIAN bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, entered the lane in the five path
and faded hanging on his left lead, was taken off the track via the equine ambulance.

with gradual progress to edge place at the sixteenth pole, then was gaining on the leader late but ran out of ground. UNSUNG MELODY tracked two wide,
moved between horses turning for home, chased inside of rivals while staying on, offered a late show bid and narrowly prevailed. LEELOO stalked in the
four path, vied for place through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole and lost show to an inner bidder at the wire. HAPPY
AM I stalked in the three path and between horses, vied for place with an outer rival while chasing the leader through midstretch, but yielded between foes
late. POSITANO SUNSET broke a step slow, trailed in the three to four path, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to menace. ROYAL
SPA broke slowly, raced at the rear in the two path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. B G WARRIOR vied along the inside

in the three path and failed to factor. MIDWAY LIGHTS brushed with an outer rival a the start and made little impact from the three path. STONE COLD
