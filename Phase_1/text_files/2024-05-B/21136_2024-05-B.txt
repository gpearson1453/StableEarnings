LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT stalked the early pace two wide, made a bid between rivals nearing the quarter pole to vie for command, then shook clear
leaving the turn and held well to prove best under a drive. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN was well rated early behind the speed, raced towards the inside on the
turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and finished well but could not get to the winner. CHAPA stumbled at the break, then moved up on the outside and
made a three wide move on the turn to vie for command on the outside, came four wide off the turn but flattened out. WEST ABBOTT showed good early
speed to set the early pace while clear, but was headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened.

DYNAMITE KARMA set the pace on gthe inside and was well handled, drew out leaving the turn and then was kept clear to prove best under a drive.
HERE'S WALDO stalked the pacde three wide and ran on well to the wire but could not get to the winner while being clearly second best. PRATT was
settled early, two wide on the far turn, came three wide off the turn and had a mild kick to gain the show award. LAKE NAKURU was settled early three
wide, came four wide off the turn and had no kick. FORECLOSURE was bumped at the start, then moved to the outside to chase the early pace, then
moved in on the far turn to be two wide and weakened. PURPLE SHIRT was void of early speed and raced wide on the backstretch and never factored.
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY chased the pace on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
MAGIC SPIN shifted out leaving the half mile marker and was bumped slightly, then made a three to four wide move on the turn, took over leaving the three
sixteenths and was clear by the furlong marker, then remained clear to the wire to prove best. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT was well placed early on the
inside, then was in the pocket behind the speed duel, then was boxed by the quarter pole, angled out for racing room by the three sixteenths and then
finished well but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. GENGHIS was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and was along for
the show award. MOBEER set the early pace in the two path, then dueled for the lead on the turn on the inside and weakened in the final furlong. MEMORY
BOUQUET tracked the early pace three wide, then made a bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
SHELTRFROMTHESTORM tracked the pace two to three wide, came three wide into the lane under crop urging, then was slowly gaining and got up in time
to finish on even terms for the win. BRADY set the pace in the two path while clear, then dug in gamely in the drive and held on late to finish on even terms
for the win. WE'RE EVEN chased the pace three to four wide, angled in leaving the turn and loomed boldly off the turn but flattened out. HE AROSE was
reserved early on the inside, two wide on the far turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no rally. HE'S FANCY FREE was settled back while wide
and was not a threat. RUNAWAYTOTHEMOON was four wide into the first turn, then settled two wide on the first turn, dropped to the inside on the far turn
and tried.

under a drive. CELTIC REVIVAL set the early pace on the inside, came two wide off the turn while still clear, then was still clear nearing the sixteenth

marker and ran on but on the left lead and needed more. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN stalked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn but had no
kick. OUT OF AMMO was settled back early on the inside, shifted out and advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane but had no late rally.
