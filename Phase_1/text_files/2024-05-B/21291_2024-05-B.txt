GYPSY GUN dueled with ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR from the outset and was fully extended to prevail narrowly in a prolonged drive. ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR
dueled for the lead with GYPSY GUN throughout from along the outside and just missed in a determined effort. FED GRANT was unhurried early, came
three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MOKKI saved ground chasing the dueling leaders but lacked a rally when asked. SIMONSITO was
prominently place to the stretch while racing two-wide and weakened. GATO NEGRO was forwardly placed to near the stretch while three-wide and tired.
