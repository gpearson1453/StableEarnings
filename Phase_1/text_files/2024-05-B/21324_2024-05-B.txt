SIDEWINDER SLICK set a pressured pace, inched away entering the stretch and held well. NOT TO FANCY advanced outside, rallied five wide entering
the turn, challenged for the lead, fell back, continued willingly to the wire and couldn't gain ground. STACKERS pressed the pace to the turn, fell back,
finished evenly and held safely for show. I'M A DREAMER TOO bumped at the start, was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid.
DANJERUS STORM raced close to the pace towards the outside, rallied four wide between horses into the turn to challenge, fell back and gave way. WALL
STREET LOGIC broke out and bumped at the start, was steadied on the backstretch and lacked a stretch response. ATTILA'S BOY broke out and bumped
on both sides at the start, rushed to contention and stopped into the turn.
