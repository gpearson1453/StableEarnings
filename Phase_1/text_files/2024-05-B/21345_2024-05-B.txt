RAICHU lacked speed, saved ground throughout, bid into the lane and drew off under urging. BREEZY DANCE stalked the pace outside, edged to the front
at the top of the stretch and weakened. ABUNDANT LIFE dropped back early inside, swung wide in the stretch with some late energy. ELL GRAY moved
clear inside, was collared on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS lacked speed chasing wide and was never a factor.
SWEETEST MOMENT broke slowly, trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. FIRST JOKE saved ground off the pace under urging and gave way.
SHELBY SHORTSTOP flashed speed in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

PRINCE COLTON set a measured pace, widened into the stretch and drew away under moderate coaxing. IKE'S GAMBLE pressed the winner early, faded
on the final turn but proved easily second best. TRICOLOUR trailed far behind, was steered wide rallying on final turn and closed well. TRUE
CONNECTION lacked speed, advanced after half mile then flattened out. OMAHA EIGHT reserved close up three wide for half a mile and gave way.
MAKEMYDAYCHARLIE very reluctant loading, broke slowly and never in contention. ALLEGRINI broke out at the start, chased wide and no factor.
HUMBLE JOE saved ground close up for half a mile and stopped.

BAAFEED broke slowly, advanced inside then edged ahead in the final furlong in a tight finish. FAST BOB chased wide throughout and closed strongly too
late. PARDSY bid three wide on the turn, moved briefly clear and continued gamely to the finish. WORD ON A WING broke slowly, moved up inside, swung
wide into the stretch and finished willingly. BRINDISI chased off the pace in the two path, bid inside in the stretch and lacked a bid. FRIAR TUCK sprinted
clear in the opening quarter, was collared midway on the turn then faltered. QUICK RETURN trailed early, moved wide and was never in contention. SAL N
LOUIE dropped back between rivals and gave way readily.

MAKABIM far back early, split rivals advancing in the stretch and drew away eagerly under a mild drive. SENSIBLE JIM settled off the pace inside, moved
closer on the final turn and was second best. AWESOME LAUNCH bid to the front three wide before half a mile then weakened late. TRUE DAKOTAN
dropped back inside then closed well outside in the stretch. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM prompted the pace inside, steadied into the far turn and faded.
SWIFT TAP prompted the pace between rivals then weakened in the stretch. SAMARONTI trailed early, swung eight wide into the stretch. WE BE THERE
bid closer outside on the final turn then flattened out. ICY STORM dropped far back and was always outrun. ZIP IT SCOTTY set a pressured pace inside,
was taken up near the three eighths pole and stopped. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident on the final turn with no change in order of finish.
