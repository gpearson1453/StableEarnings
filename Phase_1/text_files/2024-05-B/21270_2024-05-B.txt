Footnotes
SUNGLASSES (GB) was prominent away from the start, assumed command along the first turn and set a decent pace into the backstretch run, drifted to
the five or six path nearing the second turn, recovered and led the way into the far turn, came in a bit at the quarter marker and crowded MAGIC CHROME
at that station, straightened into the stretch and extended the lead at the furlong pole, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from
the runner-up in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. MASTERY KAT unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, improved
position at the half-mile pole and saved all of the ground into the far turn, swung widest into upper stretch, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, pressured
the winner in the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. MAGIC CHROME broke alertly, set the early pace then ceded the
lead to SUNGLASSES heading into the first turn, stalked that runner through decent fractions into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far
turn, came out a bit nearing the quarter marker then checked off of heels at that station, maintained an inside path into the stretch, re-bid in the final
sixteenth and got up for third. GIANT KID was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the pace three wide into the first turn, was well placed through
the backstretch run, chased two wide nearing the quarter pole, advanced into the stretch and chased SUNGLASSES heading to the furlong marker, was
outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for third. CANDY ON TOP took back in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn, was well
positioned through the backstretch run and maintained a ground saving path into the far turn, tipped three wide into upper stretch, needed more in the drive
and finished evenly. KEEPYOURPRANCEON broke in at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, settled just off of the early pace and went three to four
wide along the first turn, tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn, could not keep pace in the
stretch drive and weakened in the final furlong. SELSAE was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled three wide into
the first turn, maintained an outside path while unhurried through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the far turn and lacked a response in the
stretch drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE QUARTER POLE INVOLVING SUNGLASSES AND MAGIC
CHROME. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SUNGLASSES CAME IN SLIGHTLY AT THE QUARTER POLE, WHILE
MAGIC CHROME CAME OUT A BIT AT THAT STATION AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THE
INCIDENT.

Footnotes
OUTER SUNSET broke sharply and was up with the early leaders in the initial stages without being asked then settled into a three wide stalking position
heading into the turn, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole, bid three wide for the lead at the top of the stretch, separated from the field under strong
handling and intermittent right handed urging and won clear while drifting in during the late stages. SUPER ELLIE was outrun from the break and allowed to
settle at the rear of the field early on, was still last with a quarter mile to go then went five wide into the stretch, unleased a bold rally and got up for the
place. CEE'S THE IMAGE broke well but did not have the speed to contest the early pace, settled mid-pack, improved a bit before turn, built up some
momentum through the turn but had to wait for clear run, got a seam to run through passing the three-sixteenths marker, finished well under strong handling
but was not quite good enough. LISA'S ANGEL broke well but opted to sit just off the flank of HAPPY CHAPPY for the first half mile, went into a drive to
challenge that one for the lead at the quarter pole but found it difficult to get past, finally got the better of that rival inside the last furlong but had nothing left
to fend off late bids. RIVER MARKET broke well and was allowed to settle three to four wide down the backstretch, moved in a path for the run through the
turn, came under heavy pressure approaching the quarter pole and did not have the needed response in the stretch. HAPPY CHAPPY hustled from the gate
and gained the rail and a share of the early lead, set a pressured pace with LISA'S ANGEL contesting the pace to the outside, fought back gamely when
that foe moved to challenge at the quarter pole, held on well to mid-stretch then tired.

SAREEHA (IRE) away in good order, ceded the early lead and stalked two wide into the first turn, attended to the modest pace through the backstretch run,
pressed KITTEN'S KID into the far turn then took command into upper stretch, was kept to task past the furlong marker, kept the oncoming runner-up at bay
into the final sixteenth and held safely for the win at the finish. J AND M EXPRESS allowed to settle while never far back in the early stages, was guided
three wide into the first turn, was well placed while widest nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground three wide approaching the quarter marker, made a
sustained rally into the stretch, pressured the winner in the final sixteenth but could not get by the determined winner and held safely in the end for second.
TURIAF unhurried in the early going, saved ground along the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run, went two wide along the far turn,
swung widest for the stretch drive, closed willingly in the late stages and won the nod for third on the wire. A CROWN FOR KITTEN settled just off of the
early pace and saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside path through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and advanced
at the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the drive, was outkicked in the late stages and just missed for the show honors. KITTEN'S KID sent leaving the start,
assumed command into the first turn and set modest fractions into the backstretch run, came under pressure into the second turn, was overtaken by
SAREEHA into upper stretch and chased the winner to the furlong pole, could not find a response into the final sixteenth and gave way. GEA allowed to
settle while not far back in the early stages, saved ground into the far turn and could not muster the needed late response. TIZ MY PRINCESS forwardly
placed in the early stages, tracked the pace two wide into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run, went two wide into the far turn and lost
position at the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch, was able to mildly re-rally in the final sixteenth but needed more.

Footnotes
WORK TO LIVE settled comfortably well behind he runaway leader, bided time towards the inside to the far turn, split horses at the top of the stretch then
ran on well under strong handling and intermittent urging, pulling away at the end. DERRYGOOLIN came away in good order the raced in the middle of the
main pack through the early stages, pulled closer down the backstretch, launched an extended bid from the seven-sixteenths pole, took advantage of a bid
opening along the rail into the stretch then rallied willingly but was unable to catch the winner. SKY MAKER was not asked for speed from the break and
raced near the rear of the field while holding the inside position, advanced closer down the backstretch then set up for a run on the far turn but was boxed in
to the stretch, swung out from the rail to the five path after passing the three-sixteenths pole then put in a strong late run to grab the third spot. SMILING
LADY was headstrong from the break and sprinted to a big early lead with the rider doing his best to try and temper the pace, was still in front passing the
quarter pole with the leading margin diminished, was roused at the top of the stretch but was overtaken before the furlong marker and outfinished. KIKI
KRAZY tracked in second position well behind the runaway leader, launched a bid for the lead with three furlongs to run, came under heavy pressure after
passing the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. SHEZARUNAWAY lacked early speed, raced at the rear of the field and was always outrun.

Footnotes
TURA LURA assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn while a bit off of the rail, set decent fractions while prompted through
the backstretch run, shook free into the far turn, was set down into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead into the lane, kept to task into the final sixteenth
and maintained a clear lead to the wire to hold sway. REV REE settled in mid-pack, was guided two wide into the first turn and was never far back through
the backstretch run, slipped to the inside approaching the three-eighths pole, advanced at the quarter marker and chased TURA LURA into the stretch, ran
in pursuit of the winner into the final sixteenth but could not make headway into deep stretch and was second best. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS rated just off
of the early pace, saved ground into the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn, could not find the
needed response in the stretch drive but kept on in the late stages to secure third. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) allowed to settle away from the start, saved
ground into the first turn, was steered two to three wide into the far turn, swung widest for the stretch drive and found her best stride late. SHANGHAI MIST
broke in a bit at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, took back off of the early pace, was guided three wide into the first turn, unhurried through the
backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide for the stretch drive and offered a mild late rally. ALL HALLOWS was
prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace two to three wide into the first turn, prompted the decent pace through the backstretch run, chased
TURA LURA into the far turn, was outkicked at mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. NORTHERN ROSE was squeezed at the start and was
away slowly from the gate, lagged in the early running, maintained an inside path into the far turn, was able to improve position in the stretch drive but did
not factor. HAPPY IS settled in the second flight, saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, was guided two
wide into the far turn and failed to threaten in the stretch. LITTLE LILIANA was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the leading pair three wide into
the first turn, was well positioned while tracking the decent pace through the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the far turn, lost position nearing
the furlong marker and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
MR BIG BUCKS was allowed to settle from the break, tracked well behind and four wide down the backstretch, went into a drive from the seven-sixteenths
marker, circled the field four wide and sustained a steady grinding finish to be along in time. BOLD ENCOUNTER tracked behind HOT CAKE letting that foe
dictate fast early fractions, moved to challenge for the lead a the quarter pole, assumed command at the top of the stretch, finished well under steady
handling but was passed by the winner in the final yards. DRIVE BY raced close up to the half-mile marker then did not go on when the leading pair
quickened away going into the turn, came under a drive with three furlongs to run, kept to task down the stretch and earned the third spot. DRUM BUNNY
was last away from the gate but rushed into contention before the turn, came under a ride from the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the turn,
loomed a threat in upper stretch but flattened out. RIVER OF AMBITION broke with the pack then dropped off the pace early down the backstretch, lost
more ground on the turn then re-rallied under pressure found his best stride much too late but was able to improve position near the wire. HOT CAKE broke
well and sped clear setting fast fractions, came under a drive at the quarter pole when confronted by BOLD ENCOUNTER, gave way at the top of the
stretch and faded in the late stages. ZEN STATE came away from the gate a little awkwardly, rushed up into contention by the turn, went into a drive with
three furlongs to run but did not go on and finished one-paced the rest of the way.

Footnotes
BIRTH OF COOL broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked from the inside heading into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and
saved all of the ground into the second turn, waited patiently at the quarter pole then tipped three wide into upper stretch, rallied and vied for the lead at the
furlong marker, took a narrow lead past mid-stretch and battled the stubborn NO SECRET into the final sixteenth, bested the runner-up in deep stretch and
edged away in the final strides to prevail. NO SECRET sent leaving the start, assumed early command and dictated terms into the first turn, set a moderate
pace while prompted through the backstretch run, was pressed into the second turn by SEA DOG then shook free of that rival approaching the top of the
stretch, was confronted by BIRTH OF COOL nearing the furlong marker, lost the lead to that rival past mid-stretch and battled into the final sixteenth, was
bested in deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. COUSIN RICHIE allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, raced two wide
along the first turn, was taken to the outside entering the backstretch run and tracked three deep nearing the half-mile, loomed four to five wide approaching
the quarter pole, swung widest for the drive and chased to mid-stretch, could not make headway on the leading pair in the final sixteenth and held clearly for
third. TALBOT BAY allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and saved all of the
ground into the far turn, rallied into the stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in the late stages. UNION WAVE lunged at
the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages and saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail heading to the half-mile marker,
improved position three wide along the far turn, came in tight into upper stretch, navigated through traffic in the drive but could not muster the needed late
response. ROBIE was forwardly placed leaving the start, rated just off of the early pace and raced three wide into the first turn, was carried four wide along
the first turn and tracked the pace from an outside position into the backstretch run, was well placed while three deep nearing the half-mile, mounted a three
to four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, battled into the stretch and lost position at the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired.
CARDIFF CRACK was forwardly placed leaving the start, settled just off of the early pace and tracked between rivals heading into the first turn, was a bit
rank while racing in tight along the first turn and carried out ROBIE nearing the six furlong pole, was headstrong while tracking the pace between foes into
the backstretch run, checked while in tight quarters approaching the far turn, raced in traffic along the second turn and was shuffled back nearing the top of
the stretch, lost ground into the lane and gave way in the final sixteenth. SEA DOG hard sent leaving the start, was prominent in the early running and
stalked the pace two wide into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, pressed NO SECRET into the far turn and vied for the
lead between rivals at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FANTASTIC DREAM was content to track behind the pacesetter for the first half-mile, launched a bid passing the seven-sixteenths marker, went into steady
drive, pulled even with the pacesetter with a three wide bid near the quarter pole, took command passing the furlong pole and was pulling away in the end.
FAYRUZ TRIBUTE took up after getting hit by BOOK EM TAMO a few strides from the gate when that one came over sharply, then went three wide into the
first turn, bided time down the backstretch then made a three-wide forward move on the far turn, swung out five wide into the stretch, kept to task and
finished well under steady handling to gain the place. BIG DIFFERENCE went four wide into the first turn while racing at the back of the pack through the
early stages, was still in last as the field compacted on the far turn, saved some ground through that last turn, tried to rally in upper stretch but was blocked
by a wall of horses, altered course to the inside when a hole opened up and surged thorough but was too late. MACLEAN'S RHYME settled between horses
mid-pack through the first turn, was used early to make a move from the half-mile marker to get into contention, pulled even with the pacesetting BOOK EM
TAMO at the head of the stretch, vied into upper stretch but had no response when surrounded and was passed in mid-stretch. LORD OF LIGHT went four
wide through the clubhouse turn, made some mild forward progress down the backstretch still racing three to four wide, bid five to six wide into the stretch
under a drive, was kept to task but was unable to improve. GOTCHA LOOKIN bobbled slightly after the break, then was not asked for speed early, settled
mid-pack inside, saved ground through the far turn, loomed a threat in mid-stretch but was outfinished. BOOK EM TAMO was off a beat slow but then was
pushed on to get forward position, won the race to the first turn, then was allowed to set a reasonable pace under a light hold, opened up on the field after
passing the half mile pole, set down at the quarter pole when challenged but could not match strides down the stretch and finished evenly. UPRIGHT raced
close up for a half-mile, began to lose ground on the turn, faded and hand nothing to offer late.
