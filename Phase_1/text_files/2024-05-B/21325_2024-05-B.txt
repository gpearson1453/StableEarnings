Footnotes
MS MCWHINNEY bobbled leaving the gate, sat off the pace on the inside, eased off the rail a bit on the turn, swung out into the lane, rallied widest and
bested CRITICISM in the final fifty yards. CRITICISM tracked four then three deep on the backstretch, ridden along three wide on the turn, got floated out
into the lane, rallied to the front midstretch but got outkicked by the winner in the late stages. BALTIC FIRE raced in range outside a rival then between
runners, angled out into the lane, bid between at the eighth pole and got outkicked by the top pair. DASHINGLY raced up close outside the top pair, vied for
the lead three wide past the five-sixteenths pole, took over in upper stretch, was overtaken midstretch, drifted in the final sixteenth and weakened late.
LOVE ALIVE broke out and was quickly corrected, stalked from inside to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane but lacked room off heels, continued along
the fence but could not rally through a tight spot. UFFDA set the pace inside a rival up the backstretch, vied inside a pair of foes past the five-sixteenths
pole, lost command entering the lane, stayed on through the furlong grounds, took a bump near the sixteenth pole and weakened. CABOODLE pressed
from outside, vied between around the turn, led into the stretch, lost command outside the eighth pole, lost her path and bumped in the final sixteenth and
weakened. SHE'S NO ANGEL settled outside rivals then moved into the two path, got carried wide into the lane and weakened. VIBEZ threw her head and
reared at the start spotting the field several lengths, went outside a pair of rivals on the turn and could not make an impact. GOD'S FAVOR was off slow,
bobbled then brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, raced two wide towards the rear and never got involved. ROSES N' CHROME brushed GOD'S
FAVOR in the beginning then dropped back and moved inside, got put in tight by that rival at the three-eighths pole, trailed into the lane and proved no
menace. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF VIBEZ AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS
CONSIDERED A STARTER. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN DASHINGLY AND CABOODLE.
FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH DASHINGLY DID SHIFT IN AND CAUSSE CABOODLE TO STEADY, THE
INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
C'MON MAN broke a step slow from outside, chased three to four wide on the turn, got bumped by WORTH LOOKING at the top of the lane, rallied under
few taps of right handed urging and steady handling to overhaul the winner late. ATOMIC DROP showed the way under pressure early then cleared leaving
the backstretch, saved ground through the turn then led a bit off the rail into the stretch, continued unchallenged into deep stretch but could not fend off the
winner late. EL DIABLO ROJO broke a bit slow on the inside, stalked the speed along the inside, chased two wide into the drive and finished evenly through
the final furlong. WORTH LOOKING pressed the pace from outside, chased the pacesetter two wide into the turn, exited the bend in three path, came out
and bumped the winner at the top of the lane and weakened. SLEW'S JOY lost his path and climbed early chasing off the rail, rounded the bend two then
three wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
VIRAT stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, bid two wide midway around the bend, headed the leader at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and
held off the runner-up. THORNE HOUSE broke a bit awkwardly, tracked outside a rival, drew closer on the turn, moved out a bit in the lane, put in a late run
but was not enough. TIGERHON (FR) brushed the gate to break out a bit, traveled three deep at the back, spun five wide into the lane and closed to get up
for third. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) came away well and showed the way briefly before ceding command, stalked from inside to the stretch and failed to
produce a bid in the furlong grounds. JACK SIXPACK tracked along the inside, tipped two wide around the turn and needed to find more in the stretch run.
FATHER DELAY unhurried at the back, ran up on heels into the turn and had to take up, trailed along the fence into the lane and ran into mild traffic late.
NEWS AT TEN (GB) chased briefly then went up to take control and cleared the field, challenged from outside midway around the bend, lost command
entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. GYPSY TEARS chased outside a rival then between foes at the back, rounded the bend two then
three wide and failed to menace. FORGIVING SPIRIT tossed head, bobbled and lost path leaving the gate, chased three deep off the pace, came four wide
into the lane and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH came away alertly then pressed GAVEA from outside, give his cue early on the far turn, kicked clear at the five-sixteenths pole,
asked left handed at the top of the lane, switch to the right hand with a furlong left to run and remained clear under urging. SMART MO chased keenly in
hand around the first turn, continued on the inside stalking the pace into the far turn, tipped out around the bend, took aim off the rail entering the lane, could
not make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. GAVEA coaxed to the front from inside, set the pace under pressure
to the far turn, lost command past the three furlong marker, yielded to the winner midway around the bend, weakened in the lane but managed to save third.
I DON'T GET IT tucked inside at the rear, made progress two to three wide on the far turn and could not threaten. LOW EXPECTATIONS chased three wide
around the clubhouse turn, rounded the far turn in the four path before getting floated five wide into the lane and lacked a response when called upon.
GHAZAALY gave chase from the four path through the first turn, trailed three then two wide on the far turn before angling out approaching the stretch and
could not make an impact. DON'T SWEAR DAVE raced between rivals before taking a brief hold shortly after the start, chased two then three wide around
the first turn, stayed off the rail through the second bend, spun four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
PRINCESS MIDNIGHT traveled in mid-pack outside a rival early on, crept closer in the two path on the turn, bid between rivals in upper stretch and put a
nose in front at the eighth pole, fought with NOT A SINNER (GB) in the furlong grounds and gamely prevailed. NOT A SINNER (GB) stalked two wide, went
between into the turn, took aim entering the stretch, launched a bid outside AUTOMAX (IRE), dueled with PRINCESS MIDNIGHT in the final furlong and
lacked the needed punch to go by. GLAMORA (IRE) settled inside, shifted to the two path on the turn, ran into traffic in upper stretch, gained a clear path
past the eighth pole and finished well for third while gaining on the top pair. LOVIN' ON THE RUN sat off the pace outside a rival, angled out and came four
wide into the lane, moved out further in the lane, kept on determinedly and got edged for third. SOPHISTICATE off slow in the beginning, trailed two wide
into the turn, eased out and came four wide into the lane, angled out wider in the drive and improved position. UPCHARGE off slow to begin, climbed
crossing over the dirt, chased along the rail towards the back, tipped three wide around the turn and improved position down the lane. DISPOSITION
stalked three deep, came four wide into the lane, bid in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. AUTOMAX (IRE) vied three deep up the backstretch
then fought outside a rival into the turn, kept the pressure on around the bend and into the lane, put a nose in front briefly in upper stretch, overtaken shortly
and folded. JUSTIFYMYDREAMS (NZ) vied between rivals early then moved to the rail once clear of inner rival leaving the backstretch, maintained a short
lead through the turn, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and gave way. WICKED DESIRE tracked along the rail, got shuffled all the way back to last
around the turn, shifted to the two path to pass the culprit who caused her the trouble and could not threaten after. CARSON JEN showed good early speed
and fought for the lead inside a pair of rivals, could not keep up entering the turn, dropped back around the bend, had nothing left for the stretch, eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
L'ENFANT DIT broke a step slow, chased well off the rail into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend while making some progress, tipped back
out into the lane, bid between foes in upper stretch, brushed while dueling with THALES midstretch, battled to the wire and won the bob at the wire.
THALES climbed chasing off the rail early, lost ground drifting out on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied to offer a challenge with a furlong
remaining, brushed with L'ENFANT DIT midstretch, fought outside that rival through deep stretch and lost the bob on the line. THE BIG CHEESEOLA
showed early speed four deep between rivals then chased leaving the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane, challenged in upper stretch, led briefly
past the eighth pole but faltered late. CRYPTO CRAZE raced up close between runners then chased two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide
into the lane, bid between at the eighth pole but flattened out in deep stretch. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK vied for the lead four deep then between leaving the
backstretch, held a short lead dueling on the inside through the turn, resisted to midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. CAROL'S COMIC stumbled
badly in the beginning, raced three wide near the back into the turn, angled down the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and flattened late. GOOD N
THIRSTY fought five deep early for command, battled three deep leaving the backstretch, dueled from outside around the turn, stayed on to the eight pole
then weakened. DADSTAR pressed from inside, checked entering the turn, drew closer again on the bend, raced in range under right handed urging with a
furlong left to run but weakened in deep stretch. GOSTOSO raced on the inside off the pace, chased two wide into the lane and was never a factor. D D S
EXPRESS chased three wide into the turn, got floated out around the bend and weakened. LEADING THE PACE was off slow and lost his path at the start,
trailed two wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and could not make an impact. THE RIDER OF THALES LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
L'ENFANT DIT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT.
FOLLOWING A REVIEW THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WAS MINOR CONTACT BETWEEN THE RUNNERS AND THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

Footnotes
PROMISSIO bumped leaving the gate, tracked three deep, took aim four wide into the stretch, bid outside four deep outside the eighth pole, dug in and
bested BELMONT BILL late. BELMONT BILL set the tone from inside, met bids from a pair of rivals on the far turn, resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded
grudgingly late. JEWELED SHILLELAGH got bumped by inner rival at the start, stalked three deep around the first turn, chased outside a rival on the
backstretch, bid three deep on the second bend, fought between rivals in the final furlong and finished a game third. NASHOBA'S JOY broke a step slow,
reserved early and moved inside, continued near the back two wide into the lane, steered out in upper stretch and came with a late rally but missed the
show. MONGOLIAN ALTAI content to sit well off the pace from inside, chased between at the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch and showed late
effort. CARIBBEAN KING tracked in the two path then between rivals, roused in the two path entering the lane, lacked room from upper stretch to the
sixteenth pole, tipped out and kept trying to the wire. HOT LEGS ROMOLO was closest in pursuit of the pacesetter in the early going, bid between rivals on
the far turn, battled on still between foes in the drive, got put in tight late and yielded. PIONEER PRINCE rated along the inside, waited for room on the far
turn, got stuck along the fence through the lane and never found room. SMOOTH SALUTE got bumped from outside at the start, raced towards the rear in
the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, moved out further in the drive and needed to find more late. DERECHO DANDY settled inside, went outside
a rival into the far turn, chased three deep at the quarter pole and lacked a response. SIR PISTOLERO bumped with outer rival then stumbled and shifted
in, settled in mid-pack along the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, ran into traffic outside the eighth pole and weakened. MIGHTY KAI off slow to begin,
tucked inside at the back, trailed two wide into the lane and never got involved.

Footnotes
EAGLES FLIGHT bumped with inner rival and drifted in leaving the gate, settled along the inside, shifted to the two path for the turn, advanced while tipping
three wide around the bend, challenged SANTARENA at the top of the lane, put a head in front midstretch and drove clear. SANTARENA brushed the gate,
chased four then three deep early, bid three deep into the turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, put away inner rivals leaving the turn but was soon
confronted by EAGLES FLIGHT at the top of the stretch, clung to a short lead at the eighth pole, lost command midstretch, stayed on to the sixteenth pole
then yielded late while clearly second best. SULLY chased five then four deep in the early, remained wide through the turn and bested the rest. VISCERAL
broke out and bumped rival, stalked in hand on the inside, coaxed along the rail on the turn, had to pause behind rivals from the quarter pole to the top of
the lane, tipped to a clear path and kept trying to the line. TOUR PLAYER chased three deep then between rivals, bid between foes into the turn, fought to
the quarter pole and faded down the lane. CORSO'S PICK sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, pressured by a pair of rivals into the turn,
overtaken by SANTARENA past the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the stretch and gave way. ATITLAN bumped with EAGLES FLIGHT then
got floated in by that rival leaving the gate, dropped back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. FIGHT WITH HONOR chased off
the rail then lost ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back two to three wide on the turn and had little left for the stretch run. LE MANS stumbled and
bumped with inner rival at the start, lost his path shortly after, raced outside a rival at the back then trailed two wide on the turn, was not persevered with
entering the lane, eased down the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
ANISETTE (GB) traveled in mid-pack in the two path, moved into range past the quarter pole, took aim three wide leaving the turn, bid four deep in upper
stretch, dueled outside OLIVIA MARALDA (IRE) in the final sixteenth and dug in to best the runner-up. OLIVIA MARALDA (IRE) stalked along the inside,
drew closer late on the backstretch, continued along the rail through the far turn and brushed with LINDA'S GIFT at the quarter pole, bid between rivals
outside the eighth pole, dueled inside ANISETTE (GB) in deep stretch and finished gamely in defeat. FOREVER AFTER ALL sat off the pace in the two
path, came three wide into the lane, finished well and gained the show honors while closing the gap on the top pair. NADETTE (FR) got bumped and
crowded shortly after the start, dropped back and moved inside, trailed to the quarter pole, angled four wide outside a rival into the stretch and summoned a
mild rally for a minor award. LINDA'S GIFT stalked the lone leader in the two path, moved into range past the half-mile pole, brushed with inner rival at the
quarter pole, took aim two wide into the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch and faltered. RUBY NELL took control early and showed the way along the
inside into the clubhouse, opened up a comfortable lead while racing keenly in hand, held a diminished advantage entering the far turn, continued clear into
the stretch, challenged by outer rivals in upper stretch and clung to a narrow lead at the eighth pole, lost command shortly after and yielded in the late
stages. JUSTIQUE bumped with inner rival early, settled inside near the back, roused on the far turn, angled out into the lane and could not rally.
UNCORKED (AUS) reserved and taken to the inside, moved a bit off the rail in the drive, could not summon the needed kick and got crowded a bit between
foes late.

Footnotes
MR FISK tracked a bit off the rail around the first turn, drew closer and stalked behind the leader in the middle stages, followed REINCARNATE through the
far turn, tipped out and challenged outside the eighth pole and edged away under right handed encouragement, then unsaddled on the clubhouse turn and
was transported off the track via equine ambulance. REINCARNATE raced up close inside SUBSANADOR (ARG) before getting bumped and put in tight
along the rail by that rival, went up to take control crossing the finish line for the first time, led clear around the clubhouse turn, took pressure from
SUBSANADOR (ARG) up the backstretch, put that rival away at the quarter pole, challenged by MR FISK in upper stretch, could not match that rival late
and stayed on to secure second. JUDGE MILLER chased three wide around the clubhouse turn, crept closer up the backstretch from outside, took aim
three deep entering the lane, drifted to the inside and flattened out. SUBSANADOR (ARG) stepped to the front quickly, shifted in and bumped
REINCARNATE early, lost command first time by the finish line, gave chase in the two path around the first turn, moved up to apply pressure in the middle
stages, could not kick on with the leader with a quarter mile remaining and weakened in the drive. MIXTO shifted in early then settled in the two path
towards the rear, driven four wide into the lane, drifted in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ARROWTHEGREAT tracked four then three wide
off the pace, drew closer on the backstretch, fell back again three wide on the far turn, drifted in at the top of the lane, eased in the final furlong and walked
off. OVIATT CLASS got crowded between rivals shortly after the start, moved inside racing at the back, ridden along on the far turn, tipped out in upper
stretch, eased in the furlong grounds and walked off.
