continued to save ground around the far bend and chased on to the finish. GAV N BRODY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up
the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and kept on from there. CANNON'S ROAR dueled between horses around the first turn and up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and weakened late. SHARP TONES raced in the three path early, pressed the pace on the outside up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and weakened late. MISSION MAN saved ground off the pace through the opening half mile,
continued to save ground around the far turn and never threatened. SACRED RIDER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path and made no bid. GRAHMALAMADINGDONG raced in the three path

Footnotes
WEGOTTAGUY chased EL de CHIREL from the two path into the turn, was between runners when collard nearing the quarter pole, looked doomed in
upper stretch, rebid five wide in deep stretch to claim the victory. RATE CONFIRMATION broke a step slow, under vigorous scrubbing along the inside
around the bend, shifted out in upper stretch, and found his best strides very late. VILLEGAS SWING tracked the early pace into the turn, three wide pursuit
around the bend, forged a narrow lead while racing on his left lead, fought on when switching leads, out kicked late. EL DE CHIREL quick from the gate, set
a pressured pace along the inside, under constant pressure from outside rivals, faded through the stretch.
