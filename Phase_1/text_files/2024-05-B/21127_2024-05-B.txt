MOB BOSS dueled inside of BEHIND THE CURTAIN, drove clear and was kept to task. PUMP THE BRAKES stalked inside, lodged a bid but was no match
for the winner. COOLCROSS settled four to five wide leaving the backstretch, and offered a mild rally for show. BEHIND THE CURTAIN dueled from the
four path outside of MOB BOSS, and was unable to sustain the rally needed, then was bested for show. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR sat in range from
outside, and lacked a kick. DON'T STOP DREAMIN raced wide and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
NORTHERN JEWEL sat just off the leader from along the rail, held his ground through the turn, gained the lead then opened up under mild encouragement,
and geared down late. DERZKII vied three wide for the early lead, was overtaken leaving the opening turn, kicked on through stretch but was no match for
the winner. KEEN FLATTER sat in range while four to five wide, lost ground leaving the final turn, and held safely for show. PARKING PERMIT trailed early
and closed gradually under urging. H K RAPPER stalked three wide, and faded gradually inside. ROCKTILLYOUDROP offered little.

Footnotes
FLASHFORDANI unhurried early, roused at the head of the lane, shifted out to the three path and won driving. DRINKING AGAIN stalked the pace inside,
closed under steady handling through the stretch and got by just in time for place. BRATTON settled inside early, moved up alongside SMART PLAY to
contest the lead, overtook the lead and gave way in the final stages. SMART PLAY quickly went to the front, dueled outside of BRATTON in the final turn,
rallied three to four wide through stretch and weakened. RAILWAY chased outside and improved position late. FOUR O SIX CREED trailed early, loaded a
bid inside and faded. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) raced five wide leaving the backstretch, and failed to threaten.

MILITARY SASS broke outward into the gate, moved up quickly to contest the lead, moved clear through the turn then opened up when given her cue.
CINNAMON SAINT chased outside, and passed tiring late. PARZANNI chased four wide at the head of the lane, shifted inside into the stretch, and missed.
BURNING UP set the early pace while three to four wide, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, chased the leader into the stretch but was no match, and
gave way. LOVEMOR no menace. MOMMA'S WILD CHILD flashed early speed inside, and was outrun. COOL MOOD dwelt at the start, did not finish and
was walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving COOL MOOD. After review the Stewards
made no change, COOL MOOD was deemed to have had a fair start.
