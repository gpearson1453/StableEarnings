ESPIRIDION quickly advanced up the inside to take over a slim lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued to lead the way
still unasked around the turn, given cue two wide turning for home, responded willingly under a drive and finished going away. HARD SPIRITS was
forwardly placed in early stages, came under a ride three wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid through the lane and finished second best. GARBO
SPEAKS pressed the pace through the early going, hustled along two wide late on the turn and stayed on for a share. SWEET STROLL raced off the early
pace, saved ground around the turn and had no response when called upon. KID BIZ raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the head of the
lane and never threatened.

battled with BATTALION BOUND in upper stretch, took a slim lead a furlong out then kicked clear. ROCKSTAR RED was allowed to settle in the back
through the early going, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, responded under right handed encouragement and produced a solid finish.
BATTALION BOUND vied for the early lead inside a duo, battled on in striking distance around the turn, fought back when IM AN OAK moved up to
challenge in upper stretch, could not move on with rival past the furlong marker and gave way. RUDIANO vied three deep up the backstretch, drifted in a
path causing CAPTIVE AUDIENCE to be taken up sharply entering the turn, battled on for the lead then came up empty in the lane. CAPTIVE AUDIENCE
vied between foes in the opening quarter, got in tight quarters when outside dueling partner RUDIANO drifted in a path entering the turn, was taken up
sharply, quickly dropped back and never recovered. AFTER INQUIRY RUDIANO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED LAST FOR

Footnotes
LIBERTY'S HAULER hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide and given cue top of the lane, steadily
advanced and drove clear in the final sixteenth. KINFOLK got bumped back and forth repeatedly and steadied at the start, lost all momentum and quickly
dropped back, trailed through early stages, picked up the pace entering the turn, sustained a game bid through the lane and captured place. WICKED
PRINCE sped to the lead at the start, set the pace by a comfortable margin up the backstretch, held clear around the turn, led the way past mid-stretch then
got collared leaving the sixteenth pole. BORDINOS took a solid bump at the start, raced in range four deep in the opening quarter, let out a notch and crept
closer to the leader late on the turn, failed to sustain bid past the eighth pole and gave way. SINGING GROOM raced off the early pace, saved ground
around the turn and lacked a needed rally. CONSTITUTION DAY broke out and bumped repeatedly with KINFOLK at the start, chased the leader up the
backstretch, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

AUTOPILOT settled off the early pace although never far off the frontend, was ridden along two wide around the turn, given cue four wide turning entering
the top of the lane, responded gamely when called upon and finished going away. LODE OF BLARNEY led the way in opening stages then took on the
challenge of GOOD SCOUT, vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free late on the turn, continued to lead the way in the final furlong then failed to be a
match when the winner kicked by. RUSSIAN TO WIN slightly hopped off at the start and came away last, steadily picked up the pace through the
backstretch, moved up three wide still in hand to race in striking distance at the quarter pole, continued in aim a furlong out, failed to be a macth when the
winner kicked by then got nipped for place. SAILOR CHOW tracked the pace near the inside, waited patiently around the turn, tipped out and hustled along
two to three wide in upper stretch but had no kick. GOOD SCOUT vied for the lead inside of LODE OF BLARNEY through the backstretch, could not match

Footnotes
FIREBAUGH vied outside of CONFETTI BETTY up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free nearing the eighth pole, felt PEGGY RULES edging up
closer in final stages, dug in gamely under strong handling and held clear. PEGGY RULES tracked the top pair up the backstretch, was ridden along three
wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane, found more in reserve deep stretch, edged up in striking distance but could not get by the winner. SABRIA
raced in range on the inside, rode the rail around the turn, tipped two wide and given cue two wide entering upper stretch, was no match for the clear top
pair but sustained a steady bid and gained a share. CONFETTI BETTY vied outside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, continued to match strides
around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner past upper stretch and gave way. BUG A BOO lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five
wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. RISKY WHISKY raced in range up the backstretch, hustles up around the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PEACE DOG broke in and bumped with rival at the start, was nicely rated through early stages, crept up closer leaving the turn, swung four paths wide into
upper stretch, roused forward while shifting in and drew clear. GOLDEN LUNA sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, repelled the
bid from GO OTTO GO at the quarter pole, stayed game in response leading the way past the furlong marker then got overtaken late. GO OTTO GO
stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up to engage GOLDEN LUNA for the lead near the quarter pole, could not move on with rival leaving the
turn, but sustained a steady bid and held show. BIG SWEDE got bumped back between foes at the start, recovered quickly and advanced to race in range,
saved ground around the turn, hustled up along the inside in the lane and narrowly missed show. TOUCHDOWN OKLAHOMA was well placed sitting in
range of the early leaders, ridden along three wide around the turn, came under left handed urging in the three path in upper stretch but responded evenly.
PALACE GUARD swerved inward and bumped with rival at the start, raced in the back and failed to move into contention.

responded gamely under a drive, took command a furlong out and finished going away. BIZ B QUICK was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back and
saved ground, shifted out at the head of the lane, responded under pressure and got up for second best. BEAUTIFLY TROUBL'D vied three wide up the
backstretch, continued to battle around the turn, dug in between rivals in upper stretch, could not move on with the winner past the eighth pole and
weakened to show. ELLLL E dueled inside of rivals up the backstretch, could not match strides late on the turn and steadily weakened.

GRAND DESIGN was forwardly placed three deep in early stages, moved up to engage MYSTERY MAN for the lead still racing in hand late on the turn,
hustled along into the lane, vied for the lead then took control past mid-stretch and held late under a driving finish. TWO DOT tracked the pace up the
backstretch, moved through the turn turn three wide, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and steadily edged up closer to the wire. DISCREET
INVASION was reserved racing well off the early pace, saved ground and cut the corner entering the stretch run, tipped two wide for the drive and gained to
the wire. MYSTERY MAN set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with the eventual winner to the eighth pole then failed to match strides
and gave way. SHUT UP MAN was unruly at the start causing the rider to temporarily lose iron, was headstrong and rushed up into contention, remained in
range in upper stretch then came up tired. TOUGH COMPANY pressed the pace two wide up the backstretch and weakened around the turn. WAITIN' ON
A WOMAN failed to move into contention.
