Footnotes
BUGLER pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the four path around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. SEA TO SUCCESS
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and gained ground late. CREW DRAGON bumped
with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming
around the turn and improved position to the wire. LAKE BEE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to chase the leader up the rail
through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. TACTICAL ATTACK led the way on the inside early,
dueled from the two path around the bend and gave way in the final furlong. COPANELLO BAY trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the
turn in the two path and made no bid. DEFLATER raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HAUNTED HAZE was bumped by the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to lead the way on the outside up the backstretch, opened up while racing in
the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane, under wraps at the wire. KA POW raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the
three path and chased the winner home in the stretch, no match for that rival. RIDIN SOLO raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the bend from the two path and never threateend. BENZ LAKE THUNDER raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter,
continued around the turn in the four path and showed no kick. ZENYARTY BONES tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the two path and faded in the lane. STRAITFROMTHEDUECE chased the leader on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the
bend and tired in the stretch.
