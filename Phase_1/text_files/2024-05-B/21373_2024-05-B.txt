Footnotes
MASTER OF DISGUISE showed the way from the inside into the turn and held sway down the lane to prevail while in a strong drive. DARK RUM tucked
along the rail to save ground in the early furlongs, then came out three wide leaving the bend and was improving down the lane and was up for the place
prize in the end. ALL JACKED UP chased the pace while three wide, was in a long drive leaving the turn to duel for the place position in the early stretch
then was out finished for the place prize in the end. POWER FOR THE HOUR chased the pace from the inside, was in hard drive throughout the turn, then
flattened out in the late stretch. ONE LAST THING chased the leader between rivals, then steadied at entering the turn and faded in the remaining furlongs.
BOSTON ROSCOE was reluctant to load, settled towards the back and was no menace. YOU TIME trailed at the back and was no factor.

Footnotes
RACE AROUND pursued the pace between rivals, rallied leaving the bend while three wide then edge clear in the late stretch to prevail in the end. TOO
INTIMIDATING sparred with an outer foe into the turn, then gain command in the upper stretch while in a strong drive, then was passed up by RACE
AROUND from the outside and was best for second place. XANDER S broke inwardly and bumped foe, then chased the pace while four wide, was in a
steady drive throughout turn, rallied in the late stretch and was up for the show prize in the end. UPTOWN TWOUNDERPAR was allowed to settle along the
rail towards the back, then rallied mildly leaving the bend but it was not enough in the end. WILLIE'S POSSE chased the pace from the inside into the turn,
then flattened out in the stretch. CONNOR TALKSTRASH dueled with an inner foe while in a hard drive into the turn, was used up then weakened in the late
stretch. LADY KATILLAC was hindered by a drifting rival shortly after the start and was no threat. SHAKINTHEMONARCHY chased the pace while three
wide and between rivals, then dropped back heading into the turn and had no final bid. SNOWMAGEDDON was startled at the start, then drifted outwardly
and was no factor.

Footnotes
YO SOY ROY raced in hand early, continued to saved ground well behind the field down the backstretch, dug in gamely leaving the far turn while four wide
to draw clear in the late stretch and succeed in the end. CHASING COYOTES tracked the pace while two wide, then inched up on the far turn to take over
the lead at the quarter marker, was in all out rally then was out finished by YO SOY ROY in the final yards and was second best. SILENT BLING was
fractious at the start, then chased the pace from the inside, bid while two wide on the far turn to menace in the upper stretch and held the show position in
the end. EXPECT GLORY chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn, came out five wide and came up empty in the
home stretch. TIGER MAN MCKOOL was away well to set the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was urging eagerly in attempt to maintain the
lead on the far turn, was over taken by an outer rival then gave way in the home stretch. MOVEN VAN tracked the pace from the inside while in steady drive
then lacked rallying in the home stretch. DADA BOOM RIDGE failed to rally.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL MOON remained well rated along the inside closely behind the leaders, then fanned out six wide leaving the far turn and swept by the field to
gain command in the late stretch and held on while in a strong drive to prevail in the end. MYSTERY MO stalked the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, then bid on the far turn while three wide and between rivals, rallied gamely in the stretch and was able to get up for the place prize in the end. R
DOC set the pace while two wide into the backstretch, was pressured by eager foes heading into the second half, inched up to clear the far turn, was in a
long drive at the top of the stretch then was surpassed by NAUTICAL MOON and gave way in the end missing the place prize. DRIVEHAPPY saved ground
in the early stages while two wide, then moved up from the four path heading into the far turn, rallied then continued down the lane while in a mild drive to no
avail in the end. WITT'S TAQUITO bumped inner foe at the start, then stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, rallied on the far turn between
rivals and into the home stretch but it was not enough to make a difference in the end. GOLD MONEY was bumped the start, was forwardly placed along
the inside to press the leader down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn, could not retain bid and flattened out in the home stretch. COLOSI
was out run and no rally.

final sixteenth and held the place prize in the end. VOODOO MISTRESS stalked the pace from the inside, then urged steadily on the turn, lacked the
winning bid and held onto the show position in the end. IMMA GOING TO WIN veered outwardly at the start, then pressed the pace while two wide, could
not overpower the pace setter while in strong drive on the turn and gave way in the lane. GOLD MEMORIES raced while four wide towards the back of the
pack, then menaced leaving the turn and into the stretch but it was not enough in the end. SOLECITA moved up along the inside while in steady drive,
gained third position on the turn then lacked rallying in the stretch and gave way in the end. COPPER KAN was allowed to settle two to three wide towards
the back of the pack, then rallied on the turn and into the stretch and was no threat. TAPITSGOTAPISTOL broke outwardly and brushed foe, was unhurried
early, then bid while six to seven wide leaving the bend and was no threat. STARTECA was brushed at the start, then stalked the pace while three wide at
moderate pace and lacked rallying in the stretch. SPACE PIRATE bid while four wide early, then settled back at the back and made no impact in the end.
SHE'S EXTRA hopped at the start, then chased the pace while two wide into the turn and did not spark in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE HEAVENLY broke outwardly and bumped rival, then laid off the pace along the inside down the backstretch, remained nicely rated on the far turn,
then dug in gamely to spar with the pace setter in the late stretch and was up in the final yards to prevail in the end. WICKED SONG led the way from the
inside to set the pace down the backstretch, cleared the far turn, then was confronted by BLUE HEAVENLY in the upper stretch to duel in the final yards
and just missed victory in the end. GRACIE'S KITTEN saved ground in the early stages while racing at the back of the field, then rallied from the four path
on the far turn, gained third position in the upper stretch but did not have enough to catch the dueling leaders in the end. HIGH TONE WOMAN stalked the
pace while three wide and outside of rival down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn then gave way in the stretch. MOLA MIA broke inwardly
and bumped foe, then stalked the pace while two wide, rallied mildly leaving the far turn before giving way in the end. RIVER'S END broke outwardly and
bumped rival, then pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was overpowered by incoming rivals on the far turn and flattened out in the
stretch. KAUSE I'M DEVINE broke outwardly and bumped foe and was no menace. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER was bumped on both sides at the start and
failed to rally.
