Footnotes
NICE ENCOUNTER stalked the decent early pace while four deep nearing the half-mile marker, advanced position approaching the turn and pressed the
pace two wide heading to the quarter pole, took command into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, felt pressure from STYLISH DRESS
inside of the final sixteenth and kept to task in deep stretch. STYLISH DRESS prominent away from the start, vied for the early lead then ceded the front to
FLY SOUTH, raced close up to the decent pace and saved ground into the turn, was well placed at the quarter marker and advanced into upper stretch,
roused at mid-stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final sixteenth but was gaining in the late stages and was clear of the rest for place honors. JIM'S
JET rated off of the decent early pace while never far back, tracked two to three wide into the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter pole, continued his
advance into the stretch, could not sustain his bid into the final sixteenth and just held for third at the wire. TAMARANDO COAST bobbled a bit leaving the
start but was away in good order, ceded the early lead and tracked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn, angled
four wide into upper stretch, needed more in the late stages, offered a mild late rally and just missed for third. PARTY TIME GAL settled off of the decent
early pace, was guided two to three wide along the turn, swung widest for the stretch drive and offered a mild late response. FLY SOUTH showed good
early speed and assumed command away from the start, set a decent pace to the half-mile marker, was pressed by NICE ENCOUNTER approaching the
quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. MAMARANDO took back off of the decent early pace, raced two wide and
between rivals into the turn, could not find a response in the stretch drive and did not threaten. VALERIE was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start
and broke slowly, allowed to settle, was guided three to four wide into the turn and did not factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
DRIVER'S ED broke sharply and separated from the rest early with the jockey desperate to temper the pace, managed to do so but then was let loose when
taken on by MY DOMINATOR heading into the turn, dueled with that foe to the wire turning back every challenge in a very game effort. MY DOMINATOR
broke well but steadied slightly when QUALITY CAT came over at the break, tracked four wide early then moved to challenge two wide for the lead at the
seven-sixteenths pole, hooked up in a duel with DRIVER'S ED and traded punches with that foe to the finish, was never able to get in front of that stubborn
rival and came up a bit short in the end in a good effort. QUALITY CAT broke inward while behind hustled from the gate but ceded the lead to DRIVER'S
ED, tracked close up to the turn, drifted three to four wide along the bend and carried out HE'S INIT TO WINIT nearing the quarter pole, straightened into
the lane, was gaining to the wire under steady handling and held clearly for third. HE'S INIT TO WINIT broke well and was not far behind in the early stages,
made a middle move two wide through the turn, was carried four to five wide approaching the quarter, recovered into the lane, battled with QUALITY CAT
for third into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the show honors. WESTERN CAPE was outrun from the break, settled well behind the rest, picked
up the pace briefly when HAY JUAN tried to go past, dueled briefly with that one into the stretch then won that battle but was no threat to the rest. HAY
JUAN hit the right side of the gate hard, then was very slow into stride dropping behind the field, got into a good rhythm after a furlong then looked to pass
WESTERN CAPE, dueled briefly to the stretch then had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
SMILINGATTHEMOON was forwardly placed away from the gate, tracked three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and stalked
the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, bid three wide into the far turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled RIDIN'THESTORMOUT
heading to the furlong pole, shook free into the final sixteenth, dug in while under pressure in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the wire. SILVER FLIRT
allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and maintained an inside path heading into
the far turn, saved all of the ground to the quarter pole and loomed into upper stretch, continued that rally into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner
in deep stretch and held well in the end for second. VALENTINE CRASHER settled while not far back in the early running, saved ground into the first turn,
inched closer along the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace nearing the half-mile, was guided three wide into the far turn and advanced at the
quarter pole, was a bit green into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for second at the
finish, while just earning the nod for third. CLASSY settled off of the early pace while never far back, saved ground into the first turn, was well placed into the
backstretch run and tracked the decent pace approaching the half-mile, chased two wide and between rivals heading into the second turn, swung four wide
for the drive and continued her steady bid nearing the furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for
third. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT assumed command away from the start, ceded the early lead to BREVILLE and stalked that runner two wide into the first turn,
advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the decent pace nearing the half-mile, took command into the far turn and held a narrow lead at the quarter
marker, met the bid of SMILINGATTHEMOON into upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep
stretch. ADJUST THE HEAT unhurried in the early stages, was guided two wide into the first turn and was content to trail along the backstretch run, raced
two wide into the far turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, shifted to the rail in upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, needed more
in the final sixteenth and offered a mild rally in deep stretch. VIOLET THUNDER settled just off of the early pace, was guided four wide into the first turn,
advanced along the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the half-mile, mounted a four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, swung widest for the
stretch drive and lost ground at the furlong pole, could not find the needed late response and finished evenly. BREVILLE rushed up leaving the start,
assumed command into the first turn and set the early pace, was engaged into the backstretch run by RIDIN'THESTORMOUT and set a prompted pace
nearing the half-mile, was overtaken into the second turn, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
SAHARA SUE tracked between horses down the backstretch, steadied approaching the five furlong pole, bided time while boxed in through the first part of
the turn, angled out five wide into the stretch and produced a strong rally under steady handling to win clear. BLUE EYED JO was hustled from the break
and took command early, was well handled through the turn, responded when roused at the quarter pole, turned back a host of challengers and held off all
but the winner. LOCHMARA tracked five wide through the initial furlong, launched a sustained bid through the turn still wide, came four wide into the stretch
and finished well to gain third. DESERT RUMBLE was last away and trailed early through not too far off the pace, went five wide into the stretch, offered a
mild rally in the stretch but needed more. HARBOR DEAREST raced inside in mid-pack for the early running, got boxed in through the whole of the turn, had
clear run by mid-stretch but did not have the needed response despite strong handling and finished evenly. STANDFORGRIT broke well and tracked three
wide to the turn pulling very hard on the rider, took the same path through the turn and loomed between horses three wide into the stretch was outfinished
and flattened out. TOM'S PIC was allowed to settle at the start then rushed up to put some pressure on BLUE EYED JO for the run down the backstretch,
bid two wide between horses from the quarter pole but was outkicked from mid-stretch and dropped out of it in the late stages.

Footnotes
ANDIAMO RAGAZZA was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the solid early pace four deep nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into
the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter pole, loomed into upper stretch and took command at the furlong marker, kicked clear into the final
sixteenth and was ridden out in deep stretch for an impressive debut win. ISABEL LUDLOW settled off of the quick early pace, was guided three wide into
the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, shifted to the inside into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, angled out into the final
sixteenth and finished well into deep stretch, could not impact the winner in the final stages and was up in time to secure second. CLARE'S BABY showed
good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a quick tempo heading into the turn, was well handled along the bend and set moderate
fractions nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure into upper stretch and was overtaken nearing the furlong pole, could not match strides with the
winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for place honors, while holding clearly for the show. CLARINA raced close up to the solid early pace,
came under a snug hold nearing the half-mile marker and stalked the pace into the turn, chased two wide to the quarter pole and was outkicked into the
stretch, drifted out under firm left handed urging past mid-stretch and impeded LIGHTS OF LONDON, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave
way. LIGHTS OF LONDON hesitated at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and gained ground
nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly while in pursuit heading to the furlong pole, steadied and altered course past mid-stretch when bothered by
CLARINA and did not offer a final response. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE lunged at the break and was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground into
the turn and did not factor. ANDRAMADA chased the solid early pace from between rivals, became rank and hard to place then was given rein and vied for
the lead approaching the turn, bolted to the outside fence at the three-eighths, trailed into the stretch and did not make a late impact. THERE WAS BOTH A
RIDER OBJECTION AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY BASED ON THE INCIDENT AT MID-STRETCH INVOLVING CLARINA AND LIGHTS OF LONDON. IN
A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT CLARINA DRIFTED OUT PAST THE EIGHTH POLE, IMPEDED LIGHTS OF
LONDON, AND COST THAT RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. CLARINA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED
FIFTH.

Footnotes
GALWAY SHAWL hustled away from the start, showed good speed and assumed early command, was well handled into the turn and set a pressured pace
nearing the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, held a clear lead into the final sixteenth, was all out in deep
stretch and dug in in the final strides to prevail. LEEDSTHESKY rated off of the solid early pace, was content to trail approaching the half-mile pole, raced
three to four wide nearing the quarter marker and improved position approaching the top of the stretch, was roused five to six wide into the lane and was full
of run heading to the furlong grounds, rallied while widest into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and just
held for second at the finish. STREET TIGER broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the solid pace approaching the half-mile pole, chased three
wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, drifted four to five wide into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed into the final
sixteenth, vied between rivals in deep stretch and just missed for second in a good effort. RICKELLE took back off of the solid early pace, saved ground into
the turn, angled three wide nearing mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and offered a mild late response. KISSES WITH ROSES sent leaving
the start, went up and pressed the solid early pace from between rivals, shifted to the rail entering the turn and chased the moderate pace nearing the
quarter marker, lost position into the lane and tired in the final furlong. DADDY'S HONEY hustled away from the start, stalked the solid early pace three wide
nearing the half-mile marker, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace two wide approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked at mid-stretch and gave
way in the late stages. DARLIN CLEMENTINE allowed to settle leaving the start, tracked the solid early pace while not far back, lost position into the turn,
went two to three wide nearing the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HONOS MAN rated nicely mid-pack always traveling well, responded with a strong sustained run when put into a drive going into the final turn, found clear
running up the rail, gained the lead in deep stretch and held off a resurgent DRUIDIC near the wire to prevail. DRUIDIC broke well and set out to get forward
position, was allowed to dictate the fractions through the first turn then was getting some mild pressure from CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN and HEAT AND
REHEAT to the six furlong pole, picked up the pace heading into the last turn then rebuffed a challenge from CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN when set down in
earnest at the top of the stretch opened up a bit but drifted out, leaving the rail open for HONOS MAN, lost the lead in deep stretch, battled back to the wire
but came up in a very game effort. BIG SPIN settled behind the leading group, content to race well behind the pace, was still last going into the final turn but
responded when put into a three-wide drive with three furlongs to run, put in a bold run down the stretch, found his best stride a little too late but gained
third. BOLD DAUGHTER hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried and dropped far behind before the first turn while saving ground,
started a sustained run with about a half-mile to go then had to steady slightly approaching the quarter pole, re-bid with a nice finish up the rail, improved
position but was too late to make an impact. HEAT N REHEAT got caught four wide through the first turn, then three wide through the second turn while
pressing the early pace, continued three wide on the last turn and did not have the needed late kick in the stretch, finishing even-paced. CONTRARY
CHIEFTAIN broke well and raced up on the pace just to the outside of DRUIDIC for over a mile, matched strides when the pace quickened with three
furlongs to run, made a challenge to that foe passing the quarter pole but could not get by and weakened in deep stretch. ECOLOGIST was content to track
just behind the leading trio while saving ground for the first mile, was unable to keep up with the pace quickened with three furlongs to go and was outrun
the rest of the way.

Footnotes
GATO DE VEGAS unhurried away from the start, was allowed to settle in the early stages and was content to trail nearing the half-mile marker, was guided
two wide into the turn and advanced approaching the quarter pole, angled widest into upper stretch and loomed nearing the furlong marker, responded to
urging and took command into the final sixteenth, showed a good late kick and drove clear in deep stretch. STEVE'S BIG TICKET was hustled to be
forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the solid early pace and was guided two wide heading into the turn, was well placed at the quarter pole and
was asked for run into upper stretch, chased WHAT A RELIEF approaching the furlong marker, matched strides with GATO DE VEGAS past mid-stretch
and vied between rivals into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. WHAT A RELIEF hard sent leaving the
start, showed good early speed and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn and carved out quick fractions nearing the
quarter pole, maintained a clear lead into the stretch, was overtaken into the final sixteenth, could not keep pace with the top pair in deep stretch and just
held for third at the finish. CONEJO MALO broke outward at the break but corrected quickly and avoided any contact, settled off of the solid early pace and
tracked outside of runners heading to the half-mile pole, chased four to five wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, ran in pursuit four wide
into the stretch, was able to produce a mild late rally and just missed for third at the wire. ELMER JOHN hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed
up in the early stages and tracked the solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, was guided three wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker,
was well placed nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. GALLOPING MAJOR allowed to settle
in the early running, saved ground through the turn, was making a forward move along the bend then came in tight and was forced to steady hard at the
five-sixteenths marker, ran on into the stretch but could not make an impact in the late stages. MISCHIEF'S KING had to be ridden to keep up but raced in
the back half of the field to the turn, went into an early drive near the seven-sixteenths pole, could not find a response in the stretch drive and did not
threaten. DAD'S JUBILEE threw his head at the start and was away a bit slowly, rushed up and raced at the head of the second flight down the backstretch,
became hard to place while three to four wide along the turn, was shuffled back at the quarter marker and trailed into the stretch, could not muster the
needed late response and passed a tired rival in the final sixteenth. SIX HOT GRANDS broke well and was in the early mix for the initial furlong, dropped
back to a tracking position, saved ground through the turn, came under pressure near the quarter pole then had little to offer in the stretch.
