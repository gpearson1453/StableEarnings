Footnotes
MAGIC TOMAHAWK tracked three deep outside horses, took closer order to track the pacesetter into the turn, kept pace with the leader going around the
oval, was asked right handed by the furlong marker and with a strong late rally ran down the front running speedster to clear off when crossing the finish
line. WALTER ME LAD stumbled badly on the break, was then allowed to gather himself trailing down the backstretch, moved three wide between horses
midway through the turn, shifted out to the five path threatening at the top of the lane and got up for second money at the wire in a valiant effort considering
the poor start. DANCIN' DEPUTY broke sharp to seize command from the start, was unchallenged setting the fractions down the backside and through the
turn, tried to spurt away from rivals turning for home but was run down by the winner in the final seventy yards and lost holding the place share in a photo at
the finish line. SPANISH SERENADE settled on the rail in mid-pack down the backside, saved ground advancing mildly on the fence under a ride
throughout the turn, was in range inside at the top of the lane but lacked a finish running one paced to the wire for a minor role. SMART SKY was hustling in
the early going to chase the frontrunner down the back straight, could not maintain position between runners with three eighths to run, backed away through
the field around the bend and passed a weary one in deep stretch. COMMANDER AT SEA stalked three deep near the back of the pack, made an early
move circling runners four wide at the three furlong marker to loom in the four path at the quarter pole, could not sustain the run and stopped in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
CRAFTY OAKS had a slim lead while hounded outside down the backstretch, repelled the early challenger by the five sixteenths marker and battled
stubbornly on the fence down the entire stretch, would not let the outside foe get by and prevailed in a photo at the wire. VALYRIAN SKY was checked
briefly on the rail behind the pacesetter at the half, waited patiently inside around the bend behind the leader, quickly burst between foes to bid just outside
turning for home and dueled to the wire but was denied by a very game winner. CLASSY IMAGE had runners on either side tracking in mid-field down the
backstretch, was nudged on between foes keeping up to the embattled leaders at the quarter pole and finished up down the lane to hold for a non
threatening third crossing the line. ALWAYS A WAY trailed the field down the backside, continued the see the pack going around the oval and finished up
with good energy closing between runners to be on the fringes at the finish. MEKO MAKEE had to be throttled down behind a wall of runners at the half,
offered a brief turn of foot on the fence in mid-turn on the rail and had little for the drive, stalling in the final furlong. AMAZING SUCCESS prompted the pace
outside down the back straight, continued to shadow the front-running winner outside on the turn and gave way five wide in upper stretch. VALLEY
VICTORY settled on the outside of runners in mid-division three deep, was hard ridden four wide keeping up with inside rivals throughout the turn, angled
out to the six path for the drive but had little left and tired.

Footnotes
FLOWERS 'N BERRIES was away alertly to lead after the break, rated kindly in a tracking role outside by the half, was patiently handled contesting with
horses on either side up front around the turn, maintained a narrow advantage turning for home and tenaciously held off the outside foe down to the wire.
SILVER BULLET LADY tracked outside at the start, bid three wide outside putting pressure on the two other embattled leaders three furlongs to go, bobbed
heads for the lead three wide throughout the turn and ran on to the wire but was turned away by a stubborn winner. REMEMBERING RHODA co-trailed on
the inside down the back straight, saved ground keeping up with rivals on the turn, shifted out for clear running room in the four path driving down the stretch
and got up with a late surge for third money. GETTING AHEAD forced the issue on the rail at the start, briefly had her head in front running inside into the
turn, dueled on the rail with two others on her outside going around the oval, could not go on with the top two in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.
OLD SECRETS stalked three deep on the outside, put in a mild run four wide outside horses with five sixteenths left to go, angled out widest in the six path
turning for home but lacked a bid down the lane. PLUS POWER tracked inside at the beginning, had a good trip watching the embattled trio upfront around
the bend, swung out to the four path to be in range at the top of the stretch but had no finish to offer for the drive. VERY SAVVY co-trailed on the outside in
the early going, made little progress while saving ground throughout the turn and could not get into contention running inside down the lane.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN BEAST bumped a rival lightly several times heading to the turn, began to advance outside five then six wide, came out a bit further in upper
stretch, struck the lead in upper stretch, moved clear coming to the sixteenth pole then held. CLARAYOUTHEBEST was bumped lightly several times in the
early going, dropped back and shifted in a bit heading into the turn racing a few paths removed from the rail and at the back, fanned out six wide late on the
turn, shifted inside a foe in upper- to mid-stretch and kept on well late but just missed. SISTER COUSIN pressed from outside two to three wide, bid leaving
the turn, had a brief lead in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair. MY ASSISTANT was forced out a bit at the start, stalked from outside, was up
close four to five wide through the turn, carried on evenly in the stretch. I'M A BOURBON GIRL was forwardly-positioned pressing early from inside,
continued to track while saving ground through the turn and coming out a bit for the drive, failed to rally while travelling evenly in the stretch. HEKLA'S
AURA chased from between runners early, dropped back, continued near the rail, failed to rally. PROUD SPEAKER broke outwardly, stalked from between
runners about four wide, continued three to four deep on the turn dropping back, came out seven wide at the top of the stretch, was not a threat. HOBBIE
CLASS set the pace racing just off the rail and with outside pressure, weakened when headed.

Footnotes
ONANDONANDON was brushed inside to begin, recovered to contently watch the lone speed set the fractions down the backstretch, crept closer through
the turn, collared the front-runner turning for home and held safe to the wire while never switching leads to the finish line. MOONBRIGHT was loose on the
lead clearing from the outside down the back straight, continued up from on the turn but by a diminishing margin, was collared outside by the winner at the
top of the lane and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. HELLUVA HOLIDAY trailed the field outside foes along the backside, began to pick off runners
three wide three eighths from home, closed the gap around the bend, posed a threat five wide straightening out for the drive but could not match strides with
the top two in the final furlong and finished a clear third in the end. TAYLORMOON was situated outside horses in midfield down the backside, made a good
move circling around rivals at the five sixteenths marker to be in the hunt in the four path in upper stretch and finished up willingly to get a minor role in the
end. LOADED QUESTION settled outside of runners three deep near the rear in the early stages, advanced smartly on the fence midpoint on the turn, could
not find another gear late and stalled with a furlong left to run. ITS A BIRDIE broke out to start, travelled in mid-pack inside in the early stages, lost ground to
the leaders being shuffled back around the bend, had a slim chance on the rail for a small piece of the prize with a furlong to go but needed more late to be
a factor at the finish line. GOLDEN TRAIN had one rival beaten down the backside, could not quicken with others starting a rally on the turn and was not a
presence in the stretch drive. TIS A PITY sat outside horses keeping a close eye on the front two down the backside, was hard ridden between foes through
the turn but was losing position and emptied out by the furlong pole.

Footnotes
CASTLETON broke outwardly bumping a rival hard at the start, settled just off the leader stalking, went three wide into the turn, emerged four deep out of
that bend, was lightly bumped by an outside rival in upper stretch, struck the lead in mid-stretch, drifted out at that juncture while drawing clear. GUNNAWIN
settled mid-pack, moved four then five wide coming past the quarter pole, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch, bumped a rival at that point, evened out
and was only second best. GOLDEN SPRING broke inwardly bumping a rival hard at the start then quickly sped clear, set the pace inside just off the rail,
was overtaken in mid-stretch but held show. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS got away well, tracked from inside saving ground through the turn, came out a bit
nearing the sixteenth for room, missed show. NOW YOU SEE ME broke a step slowly, switched out off the rail, swung six deep for the drive, was
one-paced. SILVER LASSO was bumped and squeezed back at the start, raced outside at the back going two wide on the turn, was not a threat. CLASSIC
GLORY was sandwiched at the start, raced inside at the back and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DESTINY RO was unhurried settling near the back of the pack in the beginning, continued to patiently gallop along seeing the field at the three furlong
marker, had to wait when coming up on a tiring runner at the quarter pole, shifted out from the rail to the four path to have clear running room at the furlong
pole and closed with a rush in the final few strides to edge away for the win. DREAMS AND SCHEMES brushed the outside rival at the start, tracked three
wide in the first turn, chased the pacesetter down the backstretch, came under a ride midway on the far turn, fought on determinedly three wide in upper
stretch, briefly held the lead at the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner nearing the wire. FOXY DIVA trailed outside in the early parts of the race,
started to rally three wide throughout the final turn, was bumped being fanned out to the seven path widest of runners straightening out for home and closed
belatedly to get the show award at the finish. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY was brushed inside to begin, took command leading the field on the rail through the
first turn, set a comfortable pace unopposed down the backstretch, continued up front around the far turn, inside the furlong marker was clinging to lead with
rivals closing in on the outside, could not find more and faded late, saving for a minor role in the end. I HAVE AN IDEA was four wide part of the foursome
chasing the leader in the first turn, travelled outside in the third flight down the back straight, swung out six wide bumping outside rival at the top of the lane
and finished up mildly between horse in the stretch. QUEEN GYPSY was in the two path between rivals part of the quartet tracking the leader running into
the first turn, settled inside in the third flight stalking the leader down the backside, was asked for more around the far turn, mildly responded but was one
paced five wide in the stretch drive. WELL ACTUALLY had a tracking position on the rail into the first turn, kept tabs on the front two nestled on the fence
down the backstretch, edged closer inside midway on the final turn, was in the mix in the two path in upper stretch, could not find another gear late and
wilted in the final seventy yards.

Footnotes
SINCLAIRITY tracked outside in the second flight at the half, pounced just outside mid-point on the turn, quickly going by for the lead, opened up turning for
home and cruised in for a dominant victory. UNHEARD was content to watch the loose leader set the fast pace down the backstretch, chased the winner in
vain from the five sixteenths pole to the finish and gamely stayed on to easily best the rest at the wire. KID GIZMO travelled outside horses three deep along
the backside, began to lengthen stride three wide outside rivals midway on the turn, angled out with run in the six oath for the drive and finished up with
intent to be a solid third crossing the line. ZIBIBBO stalked four wide outside runners down the backside, began to reach for more ground smartly bursting
between horses at the three eighths marker, was in the mix for a share in the four path at the top of the lane and finished up evenly for a minor role in the
end. BLAMELESS GHOST stalked on the rail near the rear in the early going, was roused with three eighths remaining, make little impact around the turn
and ran on willingly inside on the rail to the finish line. YOUSANGTOME was in the third flight with rivals on either side down the backstretch, was asked to
keep up with the leading three at the three furlong marker, could not accelerate on the turn and faded between horses in the three path in upper stretch.
NOYZEE GIRL had a sluggish start to begin, bobbled leaving the chute as well to trail by many down the backside, could not get interested at the back
around the bend and showed good late energy, figuring things out down the lane to pass some tired runners to the wire. RED MOOD hopped on the break,
having only another poor starter beaten down the back straight, was roused three wide outside foes but could not get involved on the turn and was not a
factor in the four path through the stretch. FULCRA stalked on the rail in the third flight at the half, was urged for more but was going in the wrong direction
around the turn, had little to give in the lane and galloped across the finish line. TENTOMIDNIGHT was very eager early on setting a torrid pace spreading
out the field down the backside, was collared outside by the winner midturn, offered no response and emptied out between runner at the furlong pole.
