Footnotes
SEEKING SAWYER tracked the pair just off the inside, made a three wide move near the quarter pole and finished strongly to draw off under steady
handling. VIOLENT RIVER dropped back early, moved up through the far turn, swung wide into the upper stretch and finished well to rally for the place
position. BRIARTOWN chased the early leader near the rail and weakened. MALAKI EMPIRE broke through the gate pre-race, quick to begin from the
outside to set the pace and faded through the drive. COLT'S BRIM void of early speed, saved ground and lacked a bid.

SHE'S STORMING set a pressured early pace near the rail and kept on gamely to the wire. LAYLA'S SONG stalked the pace near the rail, angled out
nearing the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. MY MY was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, moved up from the inside
past the quarter pole but never was a serious threat. FRENCH FRANC (FR) dropped back early, raced four wide around the far turn and had no late rally.

be well clear under steady pressure. ASPEN CLUB pressed the early pace from the inside, kept on but was no match for the winner. MEN OF KYLE forced
a pressured pace from the outside of rival and weakened a bit through the drive. HAPPY BOY ROCKET raced five wide around the first turn, raced near the
