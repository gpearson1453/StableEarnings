Footnotes
MILA'S WISH set the pace in the two path, was roused while tipping inside into the turn, kicked away from the two path in upper stretch, drifted out while
shortening stride in the final sixteenth, but held on. LOU stalked in the three path, was coaxed along the bid midway around the turn, floated out to the five
path at the top of the stretch, and ran on, but had to alter out late, and just missed to finish with place. GANGSTER was prompted along from up close along
the inside, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and was one paced for show. ZIZKA raced off the pace inside but made no impact from the two path
down the stretch. BIG BOY JAK got fractious in the gate, then bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path but never threatened. EL
DOLLAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, then always trailed from the four to six paths. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF LOU AGAINST
THE RIDER OF MILA'S WISH FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
INTO YOU set a a rated pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. MUNTALIQ rated two wide between foes, had aim outside of the winner in upper
stretch but could only gain mildly between foes while switching leads several times in the stretch. STING MUSIC tracked the pace three and four wide,
rallied outside and just missed second. RAPSCALLION prompted the winner in three path and was outkicked in the lane. THINGSRGETTINHARRY
checked soon after the start, saved ground in midpack, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. MACASSAR was outrun inside. DUAL
POWER hit the starting gate, saved ground and never threatened. HOLLYWOOD HERO played no factor while racing two and three wide.

GEPARD led from the five path before merging into the two path entering the turn, waited confidently rounding the turn was cued into the stretch, and drew
clear. EXECUTIVE SEARCH bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two path, angled out midway around the turn, swung from the five path
into the stretch, and rallied between foes for place. NEOPHYTE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path, ranged up in the three path
midway around the turn, was driven from the four path into the lane, and chased on for show. ZYRAMID broke well to prompt the early pace from the three
path, was cued from the rail midway around the turn, angled out to the five path turning into the stretch, but hung on his left lead. ALEXIS S trailed in the five
path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, but flattened. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND rated in the three path, but had to check between foes
midway around the turn, and could not make an impact.

DOVE IN CHARGE raced in range three wide, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear. GRAYTANA set the pace along the rail, led past the
eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. NO ACTION pressed the pace two wide, weakened in the drive but held well enough to preserve the show.
GREEK MOJO saved ground off the pace and improved position in the lane. VELOCISSIMA bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and passed
tiring rivals. EILAT failed to menace while racing three wide. TRUE MARTINI chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. HEAVEN IN MIND hit the
starting gate, raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. STRATEGY QUEEN was bumped at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
LUNA WARRIOR set the pace inside, drifted out throughout the stretch run and held on. RAKA RAKA CRUZ stalked the pace three wide, was herded out
throughout the stretch and narrowed the gap. GRAND BEY raced off the pace four wide, angled seven wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. DON'T
ANSWER hesitated at the start, trailed in the three path, swung eight wide in upper stretch and finished well. SERGEANT SINATRA saved ground off the
pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and was no threat. MODERN LANE raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch, lacked a clear
path, angled back in and rallied belatedly. SUENO PROFUNDO (ARG) failed to menace while racing four wide. WEEKEND CONCERTO pressed the pace
two wide and retreated after three furlongs. SOUPER SUNSHINE was reluctant to load, was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace two wide, steadied
near the quarter pole and had no response. BOURBON WARRIOR was fractious in the starting gate, chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the
lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RAKA RAKA CRUZ, LUNA WARRIOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN FAITH rated in the four path, was ridden around the far turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, and rallied to be up in the closing
stages. THOUSAND SPRINGS chased in the four path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and ran on to get up
for place. EVERY FOUR YEARS set the pace inside, waited around the far turn, was cued in the three path at the top of the lane, but was caught by an
outer pair late to show. MILCHIN laid in range in the two path, was coaxed along the inside into the far turn, angled out to the four path at the top of the lane,
but flattened in the final furlong. UNSPOKEN REQUEST laid in midpack along the inside, fanned out to the nine path under a drive turning into the lane, and
made no impact. ZHU DADDY raced off the pace in the two path, tipped outwards down the stretch, but did not factor. WILD CHARM lost his left iron early
into the first turn, regained the iron while trailing in the two path passing the half, but couldn't get involved. INTRANSIGENT tracked in the three path, but
faded on his left lead along the inside in the stretch. FIRST COAST STORM stalked in the four path but weakened in the stretch.
