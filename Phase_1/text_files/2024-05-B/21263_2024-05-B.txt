Footnotes
MAZOKU prompt Summer of Mischief near the rail, challenged near the five sixteenths pole for the lead and finished with good energy to edge away under
steady handling. PROTOMAGIC tracked the top pair three deep from the outside of rivals and finished willing to rally up for the place position in a good
effort. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF was sent along at the start, crossed over from the outside to race just off the inside, was challenged by Mazoku from the rail
near the five sixteenths pole and weakened a bit through the drive. CONDIMENT GIRL dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced three deep around
the far turn, tipped out five wide into the upper stretch and was even with no closing run. CALTHA settled off the early pace setters, saved ground and never
was a factor. MARKSWOMAN lost ground to race far back and never was involved. PER RULING #ECM2024-194 FROM HIWU, CONTDIMENT GIRL WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 4th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
STINGY tracked the early leader from the outside two deep, urged near the three eighths pole, engaged in a long stretch duel with Forge in Fire and just
edged up under all out pressure. FORGE IN FIRE was bumped slightly at the start, showed good early foot to set a clear pace, met bid near the three
eighths pole, dug in in two deep and missed in a game effort. VIA DELLA SPIGA rated back off the top pair under a strong hold, raced near the rail
throughout and kept on willingly to the wire. CASHMEUP dropped back to race mid pack early, hard ridden between rivals near the quarter pole and had not
enough in the drive. TIVERTON was bumped at the start, had a rail bid around the far turn through the start and closed in mildly to improve position. GOD
OF WINE raced three to four wide around both turns, loomed into the upper stretch but lacked a rally. DUAL MONARCHY void of early speed, swung seven
to eight wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. HASKELLED dropped back early, ridden four wide near the quarter pole, fanned six deep into the
upper stretch and lacked a closing bid.

QUIETLY was unhurried early, advanced through the far turn, experienced traffic near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to surge up racing six deep
under strong handling. I AM THE SAUCE dropped back to race near the back early on, made a strong five wide move through the far turn and kept on
gamely to the wire. STEPHANIESWARRIOR raced mid pack, was blocked nearing the three sixteenths past the eighth pole, angled a bit and finished
willingly to the wire. CLARET BERET raced five wide around the first turn, forwardly placed from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn and was
outkicked to the wire. EVERYTHING BUGS ME stalked the pace, loomed six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. ABOVE ALL
ELSE set a pressured early pace and faded the final sixteenth of a mile. ARGENTINIDAD void of early speed, raced from the inside into the upper stretch,
angled out and had no late rally. CELEBRITY RO stalked the pace and faltered through the drive while racing two to three wide. HAND IT OVER had an
inside run and no late response. MYSTICAL CHANT pressed the early leader from the outside and faded. WESTPHALIA raced six wide around the first turn
and lacked a bid. DIAL HOME raced in a bit tight around the first turn, stalked the top trio and tired readily.

PRIDES CROSSING stalked the pace, raced three wide around the far turn, cleared nearing the three sixteenths pole and raced well clear late under a
strong hand ride. GENETICS rated along off the early pace setters, raced two wide around the far turn, angled out to take aim but was no match for the
winner in the drive. HALSTYN ROSE chased the pace from the outside, hard ridden four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. NOT
GUILTY was off slowly, had an inside run and not enough in the drive. PENNY ROYAL broke slowly, angled in soon after the start, raced near the rail into
the upper lane and never threatened. RARE AFFAIR was off slowly, raced two deep near the five sixteenths pole, angled out and never menaced.
MOONLIT MISCHIEF pressed outside foe and gave way in the drive. SHE'S IT showed good early foot and was empty near the quarter pole.

BOUND FOR NOWHERE tracked the early pace setters near the rail, angled out four wide through the stretch and finished well to edge clear under strong
handling. CLEAR THE AIR dueled for the early lead around the far turn with Bushido, dug in late and narrowly held the place positon in a game effort.
DUCALE was off step slow, raced from the inside around the far turn into the lane, angled out near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire.
WAKE SURF raced at the back of the pack in the early going, fanned wide into the upper stretch and ralllied willingly to the wire. BUSHIDO showed good
early foot to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. B D VALESKI raced mid pack early, steadied between rivals near the five sixteenths
pole, raced near the inside in the stretch run and closed in too late. KIGALI raced from the inside around the far turn, angled out raced evenly with no
closing run. COUNTERSTRIKE stalked the pace, loomed three wide around the far turn and faded through the drive. ZOOMBIE raced six wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a rally. GASLIGHT DANCER dropped back to race mid pack, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response.

handling. MOTORCADE dueled for the early lead around the far turn along the rail and missed in a game effort. TAGLIATELLE shuffled back a bit at the

near the seven sixteenths pole, angled out to race from the outside in the drive and flattened out. JAY VEE BEE unhurried early, swung seven wide into the
lane and had not enough in the drive. CITY OF CLOUDS settled early on, angled to the inside soon after the start, had an inside run and no late response.

out to race from the far outside and finished gamely to the wire. SHE CALLED dueled two deep from the outside of rivals and gave way grudgingly.
ZADORSKY dropped back early on, loomed four to five wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. WINAKACHING prompt the early pair from
the outside, raced three wide around the far turn and faded. READY FOR TROUBLE dropped back off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far
turn into the lane, angled out near the eighth pole and had no late rally. HIDDEN CLASS swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
OPPOSITE THE CROWD was off slowly, saved ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) was unhurried early under a hold, saved ground throughout, angled out near the eighth pole and finished strongly to get up under
steady pressure. CHOP CHOP rated along early, made a strong two wide bid near the five sixteenths pole, drifted deep stretch while having a narrow lead
and missed in a game effort. VERGARA tracked the early sprinter, made an inside bid near the five sixteenths pole and weakened a bit the final eighth of a
mile. HEAVENLY APPOINTED was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out and had no response. HOLY FOLEY
settled off the pace, had an inside run and never menaced. SAND AND SEA sprinted a long early lead, was empty midway into the far turn and was eased
up on.

Footnotes
MONARCH showed good early foot to cross over to set the pace, shook clear through the upper stretch and held well under strong pressure. QUEEN
CLANCY urged three deep from the outside of rivals and kept on willing to the wire. QUEEN OF PARIS dropped to race with the second flight, raced two
deep near the quarter pole, angled out and moved up to improve position. ILLUSION raced mid pack early, moved up four wide through the far turn, shifted
in through the stretch and flattened out with no closing run. CANDY LANDY stalked the pace, raced near the rail around the far turn and was even late with
no late run. COME AS YOU ARE dropped back early on, raced five deep into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. FUN LOVING raced five wide around the
far turn and had no late rally while racing from the far outside. RENDEZVOUS lost ground and failed to respond. BOUGIE NOT BASIC veered out at the
break, forwardly placed to lay up close and tired readily.
