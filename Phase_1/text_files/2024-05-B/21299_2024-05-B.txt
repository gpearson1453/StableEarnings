Footnotes
UTOPIA ROSE sprinted clear early on, raced in hand into the far turn, built a long lead through the far turn and held the margin under a steady hand ride
through the stretch run. FLAG SONG FLYIN dropped back near the back of the pack early, made a steady advance into the far turn, moved up four wide
into the upper stretch, shifted to the inside of Party Is Over through the drive and rallied for the place position. PARTY IS OVER chased the top trio early,
raced two to three wide around the far turn, shifted out a bit to race well off the inside in the lane and had no final bid in the drive. GOODBYE ROMANCE
urged along in the early stages, raced near the rail around the far turn into the upper stretch and had no response. DIGITAL CURRENCY raced near the
back of the pack early, had an inside run and lacked a bid. AZTECA STARDUST coaxed along early, raced three deep near the quarter pole and lacked a
response. BRIGHT KOHANA tracked the early leader from the inside and was done early.

HERE COMES BILLY prompt the early pace near the rail, dug in deep stretch and prevailed to just get up under strong pressure. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES
tracked the early pace from the outside of foes, made a three wide bid around the far turn through the lane and missed in a game effort. HARD SPUN
FANTASY rated along to race under a hold, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to
the wire. THAT SUN OF A GUN stalked the pace, made a three to four wide bid and was outfinished late. PLEASE BABY settled off the early going, moved
up three wide near the quarter pole and improved position having a mild late rally. EQUALJUSTICEFORALL was forced to check sharply in the early stages,
raced with the second flight, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and was even with no closing run. MORETHANICANHANDLE pressed the early
leader two deep from the outside and faded. BALLINDINE dropped back early and failed to respond. STEEL PIER raced in a bit tight near the seven eighths
pole, raced near the inside early on and tired. NO REGARD raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
FLOGE dropped back off the early pace setters, advanced four through the far turn and finished well to draw away under steady pressure. FAST MOTION
rated off the top pair from the outside, made a quick move just past the three eighths pole to take command but was no match for the winner in the drive.
TAVIN void of early speed, moved up five wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the drive and moved up to improve position. LISA'S PALACE
dropped back off the early going, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out. SOFSTER checked near the three sixteenths pole,
raced three deep and never threatened. CANDY ARCADE pressed the early between rivals and faded. CASTELLANA vied near the rail and tired readily.

Footnotes
AFY KID prompt the early leader from the outside and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. LATE CALL raced four wide around the first turn,
stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced three deep around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. RASCALLY REBEL settled off the early going
to race in hand, had an inside run, moved up late to improve a position. GONNA BE EPIC void of early speed, raced near the inside past the quarter pole,
angled out near the three sixteenths pole and closed in mildly. WEDNESDAYNIGHT LAD set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded. ACHILLES
HEEL dropped back with the second flight early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole, tipped out seven deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced
even late with no closing run. LAPINSKI UNION raced four to five wide around the turns and lacked a bid. FINANCIAL STRENGTH stalked the pace, raced
three wide around the far turn and tired. EMPIRE RIDE failed to sustain a bid.
