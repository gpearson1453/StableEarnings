Footnotes
BREAKING NEWS raced off the pace on the inside, was shuffled back going into the turn and made a rebid into the stretch, spilt horses at the top of the
stretch and took the lead in mid stretch, kept on and cleared late. RIVZONAROLL was hustled to the lead from two wide but was collared at the eighth pole
and gave way grudgingly. FIRST MASAMUNE trailed the field early then made a mild bid from two wide on the turn and tipped out to five wide in the upper
stretch for a late rally to be up for the show. MON AMI FUZZIE pressed the pace from three wide but lacked the late response. TIME HEIST raced near the
back, saved ground around the turn but was never a threat. LUCKY SHOT was restless in the starting gate and stumbled leaving, but rushed to contention
to stalk the pace from three wide but tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CYCLONE ATTACK pressed the pace from two wide then took command at the top of the stretch and drew clear. JOE THE TAILOR sprinted away to take a
pressured lead from the inside but was overtaken at the top of the stretch and fought gamely to hold the place. A P BLAZING GREEN tracked the leaders
from the inside around the turn then made a late run but was not enough. LONE RETURN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and made a late rail
gain in the stretch. TAHOE RUN raced in the middle of the pack from three wide then saved ground around the turn but failed to menace. J J'S SOLUTION
was off slow and trailed the field around the turn then made a mid track rally to improve his position late. JAKES CHANNEL settled in the middle of the pack
from off the rail and gave way in the stretch. KINGSBURRY ATTACK had no speed and showed little.

then made a two wide late rally to be second best. ADIVA rushed up the rail in the early stages to be off the pace but was outfinished in the stretch. LUCY'S
LOOKIN LEFT raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail then made a four wide middle move but was empty in the stretch drive. STYLE trailed the
field down the backstretch then made a four or five looming bid on the turn and passed tiring rivals. HEAVENLY HASH saved ground while racing in the
middle of the pack but lacked a late response. MAYSTART raced near the back then made a rail bid on the turn, angled out to three wide at the eighth pole
but didn't make a bid. RUNNERS HEAT broke well then stalked the pace from three wide to the turn and retreated.

TOP LOOK was hustled to engaged the leader entering the turn and matched strides from two wide to the wire and won the nod. HEART OF HANISCH
rushed to the lead and was challenged by outside rival entering the turn and battled to the wire and lost the photo. GOLD OAK raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside to the turn, tipped out to two wide on the turn and shifted out to four wide into the stretch for a late run to be up for the show. HOLY
IMAGE was off slow and trailed the field to the turn then moved up from three wide, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and made the late rally and
missed the show. FANCY HILL prompted the early pace then retreated. EVIE JEAN showed no early speed then raced two wide around the turn and shifted
in in mid stretch but was empty. HIP HOP EMMY chased the top two around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BATTLE SCARS raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved between horse on the final turn, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch
and drove past the leaders to prove much the best. EYE ON RY went to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was collared in mid stretch but was clearly
second best. WOODCOCK FLIGHT (IRE) hustled early to angle in to settle in mid pack around the first turn and down the backstretch then made a rail bid
on the final turn and into the stretch and was able to fend of the late inside closer to keep the show. DAPPER DUDE raced near the back down the
backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally then shifted back inside in late stretch and just
missed the show. C'EST MAGNIFIQUE was unhurried around the first turn and down the backstretch then launched a four wide bid on the final turn and
gave late effort to improve position. ALL CHOKED UP raced off the pace from two wide through the final turn but lacked the late response and faded.
BAKENEKO was not a factor. AQUACAT tracked the leaders from three wide down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn but was empty in
the stretch. PLAIN OR PEANUT was unsettled in the gate and was always back. STRONGER TOGETHER prompted the pace from three wide down the
backstretch then retreated.

Footnotes
MY TENNIS SHOES steadily advanced after leaving the gate then made a four wide late run to run down the leader and was up in the final jumps. LARRY'S
LUNCHBOX chased the top two from three wide around the turn then engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and took the lead after the eighth pole,
drew clear but was nailed in the final jumps. KEYSER raced in the middle of the pack then made a rail bid on the turn but flattened out. PIRATE
MARMALADE was fractious in the gate, raced near the back down the backstretch then saved ground around the turn, moved out to three wide at the
eighth pole for a late rally. SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD rushed to a clear lead through the turn then was collared at the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
GRAY MIKE trailed the field through the turn and passed tiring rivals. RAISERICHIESRANSOM raced in the middle of the pack and was not a factor.
GRAND FESTIVAL was fractious in the gate, was forwardly placed from off the rail but didn't make a bid. CHERRY ORCHARD raced wide and was not a
threat. SKY MASTER pressed the early pace from the two path then was taken up on the turn and pulled up in the stretch and was vanned off. PICK 8 -
