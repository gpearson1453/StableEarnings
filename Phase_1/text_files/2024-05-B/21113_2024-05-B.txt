Footnotes
SANT' ANTIMO took light contact between horses at the start, showed the way in the two path before moving to the inside entering the backstretch, led
around the far turn as an outer rival sustained pressure, shook free tipping back to the two path in midstretch and held sway through the late stages.
DONTKISSDAMINISTER broke a step slow, leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path around
the far turn, then sustained slow progress through the lane to attempt a late bid, but was fended off. LEGENDARY LORE laid close up along the inside
under snug restraint around the first turn, stalked while pocketed in the two path around the far turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by an outer rival while kept hemmed in by that one in the process, shifted inwardly at the furlong grounds and ran on willingly. HUNTINGTON
steadied shifting off the leader's heels entering the first turn, prompted outside of that one from the three to two path, but yielded between horses at the
furlong grounds. READY PURSUIT tracked in the four path, came under urging chasing from the three path around the far turn, but faded between horses in
upper stretch. CRIMINAL DEFENSE broke a step slow, brushed with an inner rival and was put to slightly crowded quarters, then was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
ENDURING SPIRIT led in hand along the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, yet spurted away from that one entering the lane and held sway
thereafter. CONQUERING CAT pursued inching closer in the four to three path into the turn, ranged up to attempt a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, but
was turned away by the leader entering the lane and kept on well to keep the winner honest. BOB'S CARROT chased the leader from the three path, got
outmoved by an outer rival while shifting down at the three furlong pole, tucked to the inside turning for home, then ran on to secure show while not
threatening the top pair. EMPRESS JULIA bobbled a bit and was outsprinted by outer rivals at the start, raced off of the pace along teh inside, altered out in
upper stretch and moved up. LEBOWSKI bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. PATRIOTIC JERRELL
bumped with an inner rival at the start, dropped back early to lag behind into the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
PRO OXIDANT pursued from off of the pace in the two path, advanced between horses in upper stretch, tipped to the four path closing in on the clear
leader entering the final furlong and sustained his determined charge to reel that one in with fifty yards to go. CHATTALOT dueled for the lead with an outer
rival, shook free of that one in upper stretch, but drifted out in the final sixteenth, was collared in the closing stages and lasted for place. BLUE KENTUCKY
lagged behind in the two wide, shifted out to the five to six path in upper stretch, then rallied belatedly to miss place. BACKSIDE BUZZ sparred for the lead
with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, but gave way in upper stretch. GO WEST pursued from midpack three deep into the turn, floated to
the four to five path in upper stretch and tired. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK tracked along the inside, chased turning for home and faded.

Footnotes
MOONLIT LADY set the pace a bit off of the inside, then kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. MOON SPUN was brushed by an inner
rival at the start, tracked the main group from the four path, tipped outside of them entering the lane, progressed while flopping back to, then from, her left
lead in midstretch, rallied on in the final furlong and edged place late. PAROLA SICURA was hustled to be forwardly positioned along the inside, stalked
from the two path around the turn, took aim outside of the leader entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and lost place to an
outer bidder in the final sixteenth. TWIRL AROUND tracked two wide into the turn, eased back to shift in around the bend, tipped back to the two path in
upper stretch, then chased inside of rivals and lacked a bid. FOOLISH broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the two path, steadied behind traffic when a rival
shifted across her path in upper stretch, then kept on willingly. OUR KEEPSAKE trailed along the inside, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch, shifted
out in the final furlong and ran on. EMPIRES PRINCESS saved ground off of the pace and chased through the lane. BOURBON BREEZE brushed an outer
foe at the start, lacked speed in the three path, shfited out to the six path in upper stretch and failed to factor. RHAPSODY bumped with an inner rival at the
start, stalked forwardly in the four path, but weakened between horses entering midstretch. NORMANJITO (FR) broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four
path, got floated to the seven path in upper stretch and made little impact. BOBBIE SOX was reluctant to load raced forwardly in the three path and between
horses then weakened nearing the lane. THE RIDER OF FOOLISH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST TWIRL AROUND ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER
STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
ROSIA BAY broke out and bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the pace along, took the turn in the two path before tipping outside of the leading trio
nearing the lane, rallied to bid in midstretch and drew off. MUSICAL PRAYER prompted between the top pair before backing off to stalk outside of them into
the turn, ranged up to offer a rebid at the five sixteenths pole, gained an advantage in upper stretch, but was overhauled by an outer bidder leaving the
furlong grounds, yielded yet narrowly saved place from an inner bidder at the wire. EDGE OF TOWN laid off of the pace in the three path, trailed around the
turn, tucked to the inside entering the lane, rallied tipping two wide in the final furlong, sustained progress to offer an inside bid for place approaching the
wire, but missed. THEROANRUNNER was bumped by an inner rival at the start, set the pace inside of a pair of prompters into the turn, but was bested in
upper stretch and weakened. WONDER OF YOU prompted three deep before vying two wide around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
BAYTOWN LOVELY trailed early on, advanced saving ground around the far turn, rallied along the rail to bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds,
achieved level terms, dueled through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. THE BIG CALHOUNA vied for the lead with an outer pair while a path off of the
inner rail around the turn, shook clear entering the lane, dug in to brace for an inner challenge at the furlong grounds, sparred gamely through the late
stages but narrowly missed. CRYSTAL SYMPHONY chased from the three path, then ran on to be best of the rest. CHANISA stalked in the four path,
moved forward to prompt the leading pair from the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders entering the lane in the five path, kept
on and moved up for a minor share. ALMOND FUDGE leaned into an outer rival at the start, vied with an outer rival, then between horses while taking the
bend in the three path, yielded drifting to the four path entering the lane and faded. SHE'S SPLENDID took contact from an inner rival at the start, chased in
the three path before tipping to the five path and outside of the leading trio around the turn, but floated to the six path entering the lane and tired. LITTLE
SASS pursued along the inside, came under urging before steadying entering the turn, faltered in the aftermath and was outrun through the lane.

Footnotes
CHAMPLIN stalked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of the top pair before bidding three deep entering the lane,
gained an advantage in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds and held sway. ARRO SMASH stalked two wide and between horses, took aim in
the three path around the turn, got floated four wide while getting outmoved by an inner rival nearing the lane, yet rebroke in upper stretch and kept on well
to be second best. RADICAL RIGHT broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, then along the inside around the turn, advanced in the two path
entering the lane, sustained progress entering the final furlong in the four path and edged show in the late stages. LARK'S MISCHIEF vied two wide, got
outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. SWOT ANALYSIS vied for the lead with an outer rival around the turn, got bested by a wider
bidder in upper stretch and faded. FLOKI'S FLIGHT pursued from midpack five wide, chased through the lane and lacked a bid. MIDNIGHT ESCAPE broke
a bit outwardly, raced off of the pace in the five to six path and failed to factor. LOFTY ADJUDICATOR trailed in the two path and improved in upper stretch.
ECHO AGAIN chased from midpack four wide and between horses into the turn, then drifted inwardly in upper stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT TAXES
hopped slightly and broke a step slow, chased from midpack three wide and between horses but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
ELLIPTIC stalked in the three path, pursued behind the leaders while traveling well in hand, split foes in upper stretch after the new leader kicked clear, yet
rallied to drive past that one at the sixteenth pole. YO LEVEN broke a step slow, stalked along the inside, slipped through to bid entering the lane, drew
clear in upper stretch but was bested by an outer bidder at the sixteenth marker. EVERMORE prompted three wide, got outkicked by an inner rival entering
the lane, then another nearing midstretch and was best of the rest. MOR HAPPY HOURS tracked four wide, then stayed on mildly. TANDI SUE laid off of
the pace in the three to four path and moved up. CORRI FELICE set the pace inside of a pair of foes into the turn, got headed between horses entering the
lane and faded. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN pursued two wide and failed to factor. TIZ SWEET EMOTION saved ground off of the pace to no avail.
GREYHOUND STATION prompted two wide and between horses, then weakened turning for home. WHERE IS SHE broke slowly, trailed in the four to
three path and got outrun.
