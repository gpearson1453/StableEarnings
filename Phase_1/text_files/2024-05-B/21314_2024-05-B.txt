Footnotes
LADY GREGORY was prominent away from the start, tracked the moderate early pace three deep and was well placed into the turn, maintained a three
wide path nearing the quarter marker and was roused into the stretch, ran in pursuit to the furlong marker, responded to firm urging past mid-stretch and
vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, took command in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prove best. BROOKYS GAL broke alertly then
took back off of the moderate early pace, tracked two wide into the turn, was roused four wide for the drive and rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel
in her stablemate in deep stretch and was up in time to secure the place honors. PRETTY THIRSTY was sent away from the start, assumed early command
and set a moderate pace heading to the half-mile, dictated terms from the two path heading into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker by
HONORABLE GAL, held that foe at bay into the stretch and maintained a narrow lead at the furlong pole, was overtaken by LADY GREGORY into the final
sixteenth, was outfinished for second in the final strides and held safely for third. HONORABLE GAL was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the
moderate early pace from the inside, advanced into the turn and prompted the pace from the inside approaching the quarter marker, battled into the stretch
and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, stayed on into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. SHOUT IT OUT allowed to settle away from the
start, saved ground into the turn and trailed nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
J T'S WATCH settled just off of the early pace, was guided two wide into the first turn and tracked from the outside heading into the backstretch run, was
well placed nearing the second turn and chased two to three wide approaching the quarter pole, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and advanced
at the furlong marker, responded to urging past mid-stretch and vied for the lead into the final sixteenth, bested the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and
held in a drive to prevail at the finish. BRONZE WARRIOR showed good speed away from the start and assumed early command, showed the way into the
first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, set modest fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, led while in hand nearing the quarter pole
then was set down into upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, grudgingly gave way to the winner in the final sixteenth and was clear of the
rest for second. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY settled just off of the early pace, saved ground into the first turn and tracked the modest pace into the backstretch
run, chased just off of the rail heading into the far turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, offered a mild late
rally and got up in the final strides to secure the show honors. CHIEF JACKSON hustled leaving the start, was prominent in the early going and attended to
the pace heading into the first turn, prompted BRONZE WARRIOR through modest fractions along the backstretch run, chased two wide into the far turn,
was outkicked into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third in the final strides. WALKING BOSS unhurried in the early
running, saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn, was able to mount a mild late response but could not threaten the
leaders in the late stages.

Footnotes
OUTRAGEOUS broke well then pressed CHARLOTTE'S DELIGHT from four wide down the backstretch, went under a drive from the three furlong marker
then pulled even with that rival at the top of the stretch, opened up under steady handling and left handed urging and won clear. ICY MISCHIEF broke well
and opted to sit in a tracking position inside, followed the leading pair through the turn then was put into a drive from the five-sixteenths marker, tipped out
three wide into the stretch, continued chasing the leaders, kept to task and was able to gain the place. CHARLOTTES DELIGHT broke best and made the
lead with several in close pursuit but had some trouble keeping a straight course down the backstretch with the rider taking a bit of a hold, attempted to
sprint away from the field on the turn and discouraged all but OUTRAGEOUS, battled that foe briefly to the top of the lane but could not match strides, tired
in deep stretch and was passed for second in the late stages. SUSIE CRU broke a step slow then was scrubbed on by the rider to show more speed to no
avail, then found a good stride passing the five furlong marker and advanced to regain contact with the main body of the pack, continued three wide through
the turn still under a drive and finished evenly. CONNECT THE DROPS broke well and pulled up close to the early leaders, bided time through the turn
while boxed in, got clear run turning for home but did not have the needed response and finished one-paced down the stretch. PRINCESS LUC broke slowly
then was very slow to get into stride, responded to strong handling to display a quarter mile burst of speed from the half into the turn, then struggled to
sustain the bid and had little to offer in the stretch. JUNIORS KITTY broke well but quickly dropped far behind, went into a drive and saved ground to no
avail on the turn then was not a factor in the stretch. BID ON THE RIGHT broke well and was in the early pace mix, checked slightly approaching the five
furlong pole when CHARLOTTE'S DELIGHT took the path, continued to press on the turn then struggled to keep up from the three furlong marker and
quickly dropped out of it.

Footnotes
SUPERNAL was prominent away from the start, tracked the solid early pace from the outside and was well placed approaching the turn, stalked
RAMATHORN two wide nearing the quarter pole, was roused three wide into the stretch and took command nearing the furlong marker, drove clear into the
final sixteenth and drew away under hand urging in deep stretch. ROLLIN DICE was prominent away from the start, tracked the solid early pace from the
inside and saved ground heading into the turn, was well placed into the bend and chased from the rail approaching the quarter pole, angled out in upper
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, was able to make a mild gain into the final sixteenth but could not impact the winner in deep stretch and was
second best. RAMATHORN was hustled away from the start, showed good early speed and set a quick pace while clear nearing the half-mile marker,
controlled the pace into the turn and set solid fractions approaching the quarter pole, was confronted into upper stretch by SUPERNAL and was overtaken
nearing the furlong marker, chased the winner into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and held for third at the finish. RUNNIN UTE was a bit keen
away from the start, was given his head and chased the solid early pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, raced three to four wide into the
turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit four wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, could not muster the
needed late response and flattened out in the final sixteenth. GATO DE VEGAS unhurried in the early stages, improved position two wide along the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch and made a mild late rally. REGAL REDWOOD settled in the second flight leaving the start, was guided two wide along the
turn and advanced at the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not find more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. IT AINT OVER
took back off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch, offered a mild
late rally but could not threaten the leaders in the final sixteenth. ALPINE SERMON broke a bit slowly, lacked early speed and trailed in the early stages,
was guided to the two path along the turn and trailed to the quarter marker, could not muster a response in the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
LAW ABIDING was forwardly placed early but went three to four wide through the first turn, pulled up to a stalking position just behind the pacesetters, bided
time waiting for room through the far turn while always traveling well, split horses at the quarter pole, was on the wrong lead entering the stretch but pulled
clear, straightened passing the furlong marker and held off a fast closing SUPERMAZEL to prevail. SUPERMAZEL lacked early speed, kept to the inside
content to rate well off the pace but not far behind the leading group, was last of a compact field going into the far turn then altered course to the three path
to launch a bid on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, finished well down the middle of the course under a strong hand ride but came up short.
PROOF OF JAZZ broke well and was intent on contesting the early lead, took advantage of an open rail to take the lead past the seven-eights marker, held
sway to the far turn while being shadowed by HIGHLAND GHOST through solid fractions, got the better of that rival before the turn for home but had to deal
with a challenge by LAW ABIDING from the quarter pole, hung in to mid-stretch then weakened. MOTHER'S PRAYER unhurried from the break, had to
check slightly into the first turn, gradually advanced on the leaders down the backstretch then was set down with about three furlongs to run, got an inside
run into the stretch but flattened out and was unable to improve in the late stages. HIGHLAND GHOST stumbled exiting the starting gate but recovered
quickly, vied for the lead going into the first turn, very eager but the rider maintaining a tight hold, left the rail open for PROOF OF JAZZ to slip through and
take the lead, then pressed that one through solid fractions to the far turn, drifted out some on that last bend allowing the eventual winner clear run into the
stretch, then could not find the needed response to contend in the late stages. STONE'S RIVER broke well, was up with the early leaders going into the
clubhouse turn, floated three to four wide on that turn then tracked wide down the backstretch, tipped five wide for the stretch run but came up empty and
was not persevered when far behind.

HOLLYWOOD RUMOR was prominent away from the start, took back to track the moderate early pace and was well placed approaching the turn, gained
ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, continued her advance into the stretch and chased HARBOR'S ROSE to the furlong pole, rallied into the final
sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and surged clear in the final strides. HARBOR DEAREST was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the
moderate early pace from between rivals and was well placed heading to the turn, chased HARBOR'S ROSE two wide nearing the quarter marker, was
outkicked into the stretch, stayed on while chasing between runners into the final sixteenth and won the nod for second in a blanket finish for the place
honors. HARBOR'S ROSE showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a moderate pace while well rated heading to the
half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn and quickened nearing the quarter pole, extended the lead into the stretch and held foes at bay past the
furlong marker, was all out into the final sixteenth, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch and just missed for second on the wire, while just holding for
third. RHONDA'S COOKIN took back off of the moderate early pace, tracked from the outside heading into the turn, gained ground four wide approaching
the quarter marker, spun four to five wide into the lane and continued her bid at mid-stretch, sustained her rally into the final sixteenth and just missed for
third at the finish. DADDYS NINA took back off of the moderate early pace, got caught in tight nearing the half-mile marker and raced on a hold approaching
the turn, was guided two wide and between rivals along the bend, slipped to the inside into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not
sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. FEISTY ELLA broke very slowly and spotted the field to begin, trailed to the
half-mile marker, was guided two wide into the turn and offered a mild rally in the stretch drive. MISTICAL SURPRISE was hustled away from the start,
raced close up to the moderate pace nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and was outrun to the quarter pole, maintained an inside path
into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, was able to make up a bit of ground into the final sixteenth but needed more in the late stages.
SMOOVE AS SILK stumbled sharply at the start and unseated the jockey, was caught following the race and walked off under her own power. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING SMOOVE AS SILK. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED SMOOVE AS SILK
CAUSED HER OWN ISSUES AT THE START AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

Footnotes
SMILE AND PROFILE good a good break from the gate and gained the early lead before the first turn, was allowed to dictate the pace and led the field
through tepid fractions, held sway down the backstretch, turned back all challengers at the quarter pole, had plenty left for the stretch run, quickened away
and won clear. GEEJAYTEE came away well and was able to get over to the three path before the first turn, was mid-pack heading to the backstretch run
then advanced steadily to the far turn, navigated traffic while two wide nearing the quarter marker, was able to get through the second turn in the two path
then responded nicely when set down for the stretch run, finished willingly, was not able to reel in the game winner but fought on to hold the second placing.
AFTER MY OWN HEART broke best then ceded the lead to SMILE AND PROFILE going on the first turn, stalked that one from the two path then went to
challenge for the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, was rebuffed by the eventual winner, battled for the place honors into the final sixteenth and
was bested for second, while holding clear for third. JULIET'S KITCHEN got away well and raced at the head of the tracking group, launched a three wide
bid for from the three-eighths pole and advanced into contention through the far turn, came into the stretch four to five wide, finished well despite racing on
the left lead to the furlong pole but was not good enough. FRESNO CHILE tracked inside while under some restraint through the early stages, pulled the
rider up to the leading pair heading into the far turn, got a good run inside through the far turn, responded when set down from the quarter pole, loomed a
threat turning for home, chased into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. HELLO BABY was crowded a bit after the start, saved ground while
racing near the rear of the field, was left with a lot of ground to make up turning for home was able to improve position in the late stages. BLUE BREEZE
was not asked for speed from the break, settled near the back of the pack while saving ground, moved closer going into the far turn, had nowhere to run
through the whole of the far turn then came into the stretch with every chance, ran on well but could overcome the slow pace. GUIDE MY STEPS was off a
step slow the broke outward and made light contact with HELLO BABY, the rushed up to get forward position for the run through the first turn, went three to
four wide the continued that path down the backstretch, racing mid-pack, launched a bid with three furlongs to run but could not improve. CLICKING lacked
early speed, was last into the clubhouse turn, floated out to the four path, then continued to race wide through that turn, continued to trail down the
backstretch, went three to four wide through the far turn and did not improve.

Footnotes
RESERVE PROOF allowed to settle while never far back in the early going, went four wide into the turn and loomed nearing the quarter pole, took a narrow
lead into upper stretch and battled ALMANERA heading to the furlong marker, shook free into the final sixteenth and drove clear in deep stretch to prevail.
EDDIE CROSSWIRE was prominent away from the start, tracked the quick early pace from between rivals nearing the half-mile marker, slipped to the rail
heading into the turn and stalked the solid pace approaching the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, re-rallied
into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and got up in the final strides for second. ALMANERA (IRE) showed good speed away
from the start, assumed early command and controlled the pace nearing the half-mile marker, dictated terms while off of the rail into the turn, was overtaken
into upper stretch and chased RESERVE PROOF to the furlong pole, battled into the final sixteenth, yielded in deep stretch and just missed for second,
while holding safely in the end for third. AMANOFMYSTATURE took back off of the solid early pace, was guided two to three wide and between rivals into
the turn, tipped four wide into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, offered a mild late bid and was outfinished for third. MY BUCKET LIST
unhurried in the early going, trailed into the turn and raced three wide nearing the quarter marker, angled out into the stretch and made a mild late rally.
WESTERN CAPE took back off of the solid early pace, improved position three to four wide along the turn, swung widest for the stretch drive and lost
ground at mid-stretch, was able to offer a mild late re-rally but could not threaten the leaders in deep stretch. ITS THIEVERY was hustled away from the
start and stalked the solid early pace from the outside, was well placed heading into the turn and chased ALMANERA three wide nearing the quarter pole,
came under a ride nearing the top of the lane, was outrun to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. BLUE SILVER was forwardly placed leaving the
start, raced close up to the solid early pace and tracked from the inside heading into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, shifted to the two path
and got caught a bit in tight approaching the top of the stretch, could not muster a response in the final furlong and gave way.
