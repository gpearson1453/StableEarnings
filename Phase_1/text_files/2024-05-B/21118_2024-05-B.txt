Footnotes
MIKE THE BOMB angled in with a brief early lead then stalked, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms at the three
eighths pole, took the nod toward the quarter and was steadily handled to extend his lead. SENSUAL CHOCOLATE stalked the early pace inside,
challenged into the backstretch and dueled at mostly even terms leaving the three eighths, but was caught toward the quarter pole, remained a factor at the
rail on the far turn then relented nearing mid-stretch. TIZAWINNER saved early ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. HERCULES N LOVE raced in the four and five paths the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little further. SUPER BUSTER rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but faded in the four path on the far turn. LIOTTA closed to the front approaching the three quarter pole and set the early pace off the rail,
came under pressure into the backstretch, was caught at the three eighths pole and gave way on the far turn. PROUD ALUMNUS was eased after three
eighths of a mile and walked off.

Footnotes
ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved in the five path on the far turn, dug in for the lead
passing the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. PRACTICAL SENSE rated just off the early pace about the three path, left
the first turn outside and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, dueled for the lead three wide approaching the eighth pole, was met past the pole but
dug in to clear second late. BON BUENO raced in the three path the first turn, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, left
the turn outside and dueled through later yards for third. AKINGISALWAYSKING rated a slim early lead toward the inside, was met leaving the nine
sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch and flattened past the eighth pole.
SCHMEAR stalked the early pace inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened in the
lane. KEANU stalked from the three path into the first turn then took the lead passing the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, contested even terms two deep into the far turn but was pinched back entering the stretch and weakened. STAVANGER was unprepared for
the break, reared at the start, lost all incentive and was eased after a half mile. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards posted this race official.

Footnotes
KRISTINACHRYSALIS rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested even terms nearest the rail on the far
turn, dug in under determined handling and just lasted. DREAM STREET ROSE settled back off the rail the first turn, bid into the backstretch and steadily
improved, rounded the turn about the four path, dug in to take second under the wire and just missed the win. SHEWONTTALKTOME rated close inside on
the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch for third.
SPARKLEINYOUREYE stalked early then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn, remained a close
factor through the stretch but relented late strides. GHOST OF ALCINA rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. CUT HIM LOOSE stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. NEW AGE BAD GIRL settled off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. SYMPTOMATIC stalked the early pace about the three path, left the first turn outside then faded in the five path on the far turn.

Footnotes
MRS. SPEAKER saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn in the four
path and dug in under steady handling to take over the final yards. INTERCEPTION settled in the five path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and closed to the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane, was steadily handled leaving the far turn but relented in later yards. TIDBIT stalked from
the three path the opening turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the lead approaching the five sixteenths, raced clear into the far turn but
was met at the rail in the vicinity of the eighth pole and flattened mid-stretch. LADY FREE WILL settled off the rail the first turn, eased out and gave chase
into the backstretch, raced in range of the lead about the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. STATELY APRIL stalked inside on the first
turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. LOVE NOTION saved ground well off the pace on the first turn
and never factored. REZOOM took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure toward the three
eighths pole but gave up the lead approaching the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. SUPER SNEAKY saved ground. NO VIOLENCE
settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. Coal's Magnolia unseated her rider behind the gate, ran loose on
the track and was a late scratch.
