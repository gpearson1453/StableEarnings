Footnotes
DOUG'S HERO contested pace inside of THUNDERGOLD, held a short advantage through the turn, and kicked clear under a strong hand ride.
THISCATSGOTSPEED was reserved off the early pacesetters, lodged rail leaving the final turn but was no match for the winner. PASSAGE trailed early
while wide through the backstretch, and closed late. CHICKS DIG CAPES chased inside, dropped back through the turn, and bid belatedly. THUNDER
GOLD pressed the pace through the backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and wilted abruptly.

Footnotes
GURRIAN squeezed leaving, angled down the rail quickly then was quickest to the turn, drew away through the stretch, and was geared down. FORCED
TO RUN broke into GURRRIAN leaving the gate, contended the pace early, was overtaken then chased through the stretch, and finished evenly.
PATRIOTIC FREEDOM sat in range while four wide, lodged a mild bid and held for show. SAWCHUK jostled leaving, raced in close quarters then was
bumped while between foes, swung six wide at the head of the stretch, and closed gradually. ALBERTA BERBON broke outward bumping outside foes, the
rider lost stirrups momentarily, was in tight then steadied, chased inside, and faded. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of ALBERTA
BERBON and SAWCHUCK alleging interference in the backstretch was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards. THOROUGHBRED RULING

PATRIOTIC FREEDOM; 3rd- SAWCHUCK; 4th- ALBERTA BERBON.

Footnotes
AL REICHERT hurried away, sat in striking position leaving the backstretch, moved up alongside BRODY'S PAL to challenge the front, dueled outside
under heavy urging, and prevailed after a long hard drive. BRODY'S PAL contested the early pace, drew clear in the far turn, responded gamely to
challenge from AL REICHERT, matched strides under heavy urging, and was outfinished. BREAKING THE BANK trailed the field early, and closed steadily
to nail down the show spot late. H K MELODY saved ground inside, waited nearing the quarter pole, and lacked the closing response needed. MOHAMAD
lacked a solid bid.

BYE BYE CHARLIE chased the pacesetters while four wide, was roused at the head of the lane, kept on gradually under handling, and edged clear.
ANNAMARIA contested the early pace inside of MIDNITE SCORE, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, was showing signs of tiring nearing the stretch, and
gave way in the late stages. STAY UP unhurried early, fanned four wide in the far turn, and lacked the kick needed. DESTIN TO BE GREAT jostled away,
trailed the field and bid belatedly. EL CORRECAMINOS stumbled leaving then was brushed, and chased to no avail. MIDNITE SCORE bumped leaving,
sent for speed, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, and tired.

Footnotes
FAST EH sped to the front at once, saved ground while showing the way, was kept under light handling through the stretch and just held under a late threat.
EXAMINER reserved off the early pacesetters, launched an all-out bid through the stretch and missed out after a determined effort. JULIUS THE GREAT
vied outside but was outsprinted, and evened out through the stretch. DUNE D'ORO rallied belatedly. CARSON'S LEGACY failed to threaten. IT WORKED
outrun throughout. BACKSTREET BOBBY fanned four wide, pulled up in the final turn, did not finish and walked off on his own accord. The Official
Veterinarian reported that IT WORKED experienced bleeding.
