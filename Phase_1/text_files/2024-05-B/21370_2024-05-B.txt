wide in the run down the backside, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive, overtook the
pacesetter in deep stretch and drew clear late. STANFORD NORTH away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the
pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch, but battled gamely to prove second best. DIVAANY away well and
stalked the leaders in the run down the backside while racing out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed evenly two out
from the rail in the drive to garner a share. STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced well behind the field in the run down
the backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive. RANCHO RED stalked the leaders in
the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when

turn, and finished willingly while drifting in slightly in deep stretch to prevail. SOLARITY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, steadied when in tight quarters at the rail in
mid stretch, but still proved clearly second best. NEIGHNEIGH away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,

LONIE MO away alertly and raced to the lead entering the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, battled from the inside of DAZ LIN FORCE entering
the final turn, and was all out to fend off a late surge by SUNBLAZE to prevail. SUNBLAZE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, steadied while lacking room leaving the turn, and closed determinedly three wide in
deep stretch to just miss. EDDIE'S GIRL broke sharply and chased the pacesetter to the first turn, before easing into a stalking trip two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to garner a share. TIARA DAWN broke outwards at the
start, and trailed the field into the first turn, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and
finished with some late interest from along the rail in the drive. DAZ LIN FORCE was off a step slow, but rushed up between rivals through the first turn to
take a tracking trip into the backstretch, continued to chase the leader two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. Following the running of
this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of SUNBLAZE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of LONIE MO, for alleged interference leaving
the final turn and again in deep stretch. After review both claims of foul were disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish

ARIKARA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run the backstretch, held a clear lead into
the final turn, and was all out to hold off a late charge by WANDALITA to prevail. WANDALITA tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two wide
entering the backstretch, launched her bid after the pacesetter three wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush two out from the rail in deep stretch
to just miss. LUCY TREASURE broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the
inside through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. NO PEOPLE away well and pressed the pace from the
outside of ARIKARA entering the first turn, was unable to match strides with that rival in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide entering the turn, and
finished evenly in the lane. MATSQUI stalked the contested early pace from along the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground throughout,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. MARYS TAPPIN SHOES unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always
well back, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was only able to pass a tiring rival late. INDYETTA was fractious prior to the start, and hopped as the
gate opened to get away slowly, rushed up four wide through the first turn to take a stalking trip into the backstretch, continued with a wide trip in the run
down the backside and through the final turn, and faded in the late stages.

KARDINAL ROSE settled off the contested early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, began to advance midway down the backside,
rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn and quickly drew clear. BORROWED EQUITY unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, appeared to encounter some difficulty midway through the turn, but finished willingly
three wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. BE SPARKY away well and stalked the leaders into the first turn while racing two out from
the rail, rallied smartly from between rivals through the final turn, and closed well to just miss the place. STOLO SPIRIT settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground throughout, but failed to make a serious late impact. SHOWMAN away alertly
and dueled for the lead from the outside of DELTA SUNRISE entering the first turn, continued to chase the pacesetter through the final turn, but faded in the
late going. DELTA SUNRISE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run to the final turn, rallied
along the rail through the turn, but tired in the stretch drive. DEANARROW was fractious prior to the start, and unprepared as the gates opened dislodging
the rider, Deanarrow walked off following the race under his own power. The stewards conducted an inquiry to the start of the race, and after review deemed
that DEANARROW did NOT receive a fair start and declared the horse a NON STARTER, and ordered a full refund on wagers including this horse.
