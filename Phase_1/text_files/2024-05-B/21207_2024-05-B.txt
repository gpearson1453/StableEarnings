BOISE hustled along early between rivals, took the lead on the bend, was headed from outside leaving the turn, moved clear midstretch, started drifting out
inside the last furlong but held sway. ORBITAL STARR moved to the inside early on, swung out some to go around the fading MY LITTLE TIPSY, took the
rail again midstretch, closed well, came up short but edged ahead for second in the waning yards. SIRCORRI broke on top, was settled back, just off the rail
on the turn, lost ground fanning widest into the stretch, took over second with a sixteenth left, battled to hold his position the final seventy yards but was
outfinished. R H SMOAKEM prominent from outside, vied for the lead leaving the bend, drifted out briefly upper stretch, was corrected but gradually yielded
after that. MY LITTLE TIPSY displayed early speed from inside, began to fade after three furlongs, was unresponsive to urging upper stretch, eased late
and walked off.

Footnotes
EIGHT MAY was sent to set the pace off the rail, lengthened command after two furlongs, floated out some entering the lane, gradually drifted out after
entering the last furlong but was clearly best. LORD ZEKE forwardly placed from inside, took over second on the bend, angled outside EIGHT MAY at the
top of the stretch, was no match for that one but was unchallenged for the place. KNUCKLE made a large leap from the gate, progressed from outside, was
three wide taking the turn, moved to the inside upper stretch, drew clear for third then could only hold his position late. PLAY THE BLUES chased from
inside and only passed some tired ones in the lane. LELAND JOHN pressed the early pace but began to fade from outside on the bend. HALF THE
BATTLE was a factor on the backstretch but yielded two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
MEDAL OF FACT broke on top and inward, was quickly clear and took the rail, showed the way in hand, was just off the inside taking the second turn, put to
urging in the stretch, steadily bore out inside the final furlong but was clearly much the best. CHARM THE LADIES moved to the inside early on, took over
second along the rail on the second bend, was no match for MEDAL OF FACT the last eighth but maintained a clear margin for the place. KEEN
RESPONSE settled just off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, advanced two wide on the second turn, angled outside LASTFORTINOFAMILY
upper stretch, gained third with a sixteenth left and was closing the gap to CHARM THE LADIES in the waning yards. LASTFORTINOFAMILY raced in
contention from outside, came into the stretch from path three and began to gradually yield the final furlong. PERFECT WAGER chased from outside and
was never a factor. LOOK AWAY altered in to stay clear of MEDAL OF FACT at the start, bumped solidly with ARGYBARGY BUCK, was steadied then
showed little in a ground-saving trip. ARGYBARGY BUCK bumped from the rear at the break, was checked behind traffic into the first bend, ran forwardly
between horses, took a bad step in close quarters into the second turn, was steadied, went to the outside, pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
TILL broke inward, soon shared the lead from inside, moved clear when allowed into the bend, was put to urging in the stretch, widened command, was
gradually drifting out through the waning yards but held sway. REDHEADEDSTRANGER crowded and forced inward through the early going, advanced
three wide on the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch, closed the gap belatedly on the leader the final sixteenth and proved easily second best. SKIP
THE FORMALITY forced inward at the break, chased from well off the rail, came into the lane four wide and passed tired ones to gain third late. IMAGE OF
CURLIN gradually angled in after the start, bunching up those inside her, as she contested the early pace, failed to keep up just off the inside on the turn
then flattened out for the drive. DANCIN' MOLLY soon trailed running widest of all, angled in entering the bend and failed to have a significant stretch
response. WW BEST OF TIMES steadily altered through the early going as she tried to keep a clear path inside IMAGE OF CURLIN, altered out midway on
the backstretch, moved to the rail into the turn, altered outside GRACEFUL SCARLETT upper stretch, angled out widest midstretch and had little to offer.
GRACEFUL SCARLETT displayed brief speed between rivals but began to quit nearing the end of three furlongs.

Footnotes
CREPE YARNS in traffic early, altered out after the first furlong, vied for the lead outside DIAMONDONICE on the bend, moved ahead under urging in the
lane then continued to open up while ridden out the final eighth. WICKED GUS forwardly placed inside, swung out on the turn, came five wide into the lane,
fought for third, then second deep stretch and edged ahead for the place. BRAHMS JR. vied for the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the turn,
came off the rail some for a clear path entering the stretch, also fought for third then second in the late going but did not have enough left in the waning
yards. SOLOMON VANDY a step slow at the start, showed no early speed, stayed off the rail taking the bend, altered out six wide midstretch and showed
late interest. SHEBA'S PAL caught in tight quarters between BRAHMS JR. and DIAMONDONICE early, retreated after a quarter mile, was two to four wide
through the turn and lacked the needed late kick. DIAMONDONICE gradually angled in as he disputed the early pace, was just off the inside on the bend,
took the rail at the top of the lane, was no match for CREPE YAMS the last furlong and began to wear down nearing the final sixteenth. CUTADAY hesitated
at the break, stayed well off the inside and failed to menace. GUN IT AND RUN IT pressed from outside on the backstretch but gave way four wide before
finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
SPICY DELIGHT gradually forced in as she vied for the early lead, brushed repeatedly with TINA'S TAPIZAR in the first five furlongs, shook free inside the
last eighth and drew off. TOO MUCH TUESDAY contested the pace from inside, was caught in tight quarters along the rail into the bend, began to retreat
some after three furlongs, was checked briefly when her path narrowed midway on the turn, altered to the outside, floated out some upper stretch, was
straightened, all out, took over second inside the final sixteenth then began to lug in under right-handed pressure. WILDWOOD TRIPLE was away slowly,
rushed up from just off the inside, swung out to path five for the stretch run, angled in for a clear path with a furlong to go and gained third late. TINA'S
TAPIZAR gradually angled in as she disputed the pace outside rivals, brushed repeatedly with SPICY DELIGHT and began to wear down two wide the final
furlong. JEMEZ FALLS was also away slowly, saved ground and proved unresponsive to urging. MISS KITTY PIE away slowly as well, was soon far back,
eased in the stretch and walked off. The rider of TOO MUCH TUESDAY lodged an objection alleging interference from SPICY DELIGHT on the turn. After
their review the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
ROAD GAME soon had the lead and the inside, under urging through the lane, dug in late and kept STOSH at bay. STOSH chased from outside, lost
ground five wide through the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. WINDIGO SPIRIT prominent just outside ROAD GAME, slowly drifted out
through the lane and was outfinished for the place. I'M YOUR VALENTINE boxed in just off the inside early, was checked behind traffic midway on the
backstretch, gained a clear path three wide into the turn, fanned outside WINDIGO SPIRIT entering the stretch and rallied belatedly between rivals.
WARNING LABEL raced in contention between horses, was four wide through the bend, altered in for a clear path after entering the final furlong and was
closing the gap in the waning yards. CAMARGO steadily faded from inside.
