Footnotes
ARTORIUS settled comfortably off the pace, drafted inside while full of run on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while just behind the leaders,
dropped back to the rail with a clear opening at the three-sixteenths pole, closed fast to make a bid into the final furlong then burst clear and proved best
under a confident hand-ride to the finish. POWER SEEKER broke in and was off a step slow, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along late on the
backstretch, went mostly four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, made a bid near the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the
place while unable to go with the winner. PERFORM tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked outside the
five-sixteenths pole, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while
able to get the show. ALTERNATE REALITY broke a step slow, moved out then advanced to prompt the pace on the outside of the leader, was asked in the
two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong, had the rider get the crop knocked out of his hand shortly
thereafter and weakened. AGGREGATION went to the front, showed the way with some company to his outside, was given his cue along the rail on the
turn, lost the advantage under the crop in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
NO SHOW SAMMY JO (GB) was taken in hand early then unhurried in the two to three path, began to advance while let out in the three path on the final
turn, rallied outside in upper stretch and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth. LADY BETH was hustled to the front, rounded the first turn in the two
path, showed the way through quick fractions, raced inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, led
into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. VINO ROUGE settled off the pace in the two path, was roused on the far turn, gained under
a drive into the final furlong, chased just behind the leader into the final sixteenth, was crowded a bit between foes shortly thereafter and outfinished while
able to get the show. STARTUP MENTALITY (IRE) saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused two then three wide on the far turn, came
four wide into the stretch and gained belatedly. MASTEROF THE TUNES showed speed on the inside of a rival, tossed her head while wrestled back off the
pace on the initial straightaway, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, came under urging in the two path on the far turn,
chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. SWEET DUTCHESS was taken in hand early then angled in, saved ground while reserved under snug
restraint, was roused near the quarter-pole then came off the rail and failed to threaten.

the backstretch, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
a furlong out and seized command just outside the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the finish to prevail. PADDINGTON coaxed from the gate, raced
three wide through the first turn before tipping four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced on the front and swung three wide for home, took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and
was collared near the sixteenth marker, ran on clear of the rest for the place honors. SEEKING UNITY established the front and showed the way in hand
along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat to the outside, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and then weakened in the
late stages. REDDINGTON got bumped after the start between foes when placed in a bit tight, raced three wide through the first turn pulling on the bit and
eager and then settled four paths off the inside down the backstretch attending the leader to the outside while applying little pressure save his presence,
tucked to the two path half a mile from home and remained patiently handled as PADDINGTON advanced outside, got let out spinning four to five wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the drive. GRANDPA'S KID coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide
down the backstretch, came under coaxing just off the inside three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. BLESS

Footnotes
MY CARA MIA MINE moved in while urged along off the pace, gained in the two path on the turn, drafted behind the leaders late on that bend, found room
into upper stretch, made a bid between horses around the three-sixteenths pole, fought on even terms for the lead into the final furlong, shook clear outside
the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. JUSTHEART had her head turned at the start then lunged and was off very slow, settled towards the back,
moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, waited while blocked from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker then
altered out for room and finished willingly for the place in a tough trip. REALTA settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, held a good
striking position behind horses in upper stretch, dropped to the rail while asked for her best near the furlong marker and willingly earned the show.
STARLIGHT DANCER came outward while away awkwardly and was off a step slow, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
finished with late energy to just miss the show. SUPERSTARSUSAN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, had the rider fall back in the saddle
briefly in the early going, moved out around the half-mile pole, angled from three to five wide on the turn, gained to make a bid late on that bend, held a slim
lead under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. OUR REWARD was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the
four path on the turn, battled between foes under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MY KINDA MISCHIEF pressed the pace while loosely between
horses, vied in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and also tired. OUTTA THE CLOUD was hustled from the gate then
angled in under urging, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch and had nothing left. LUMINATE
settled well back in the field, was carried out near the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond. LEARNING TO FLY broke
in then showed speed, set the pace under pressure from two opponents, vied along the rail on the turn, came off the inside into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LOST IN ROME was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage in
upper stretch, fought outside the runner-up into the final furlong then drew clear under steady urging. SECRET RULES went to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, battled with that foe into the final furlong and
proved no match while able to hold the place. NOLO CONTESTO dropped back while in tight between foes early then angled in under urging, went around
the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. JOKING WAY settled off the pace, chased
inside on the turn and weakened. NOTABLE BOB (CHI) settled towards the rear, dropped back while in tight between horses late on the backstretch, moved
from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF was forwardly placed on the outside, chased five wide on the turn
and came up empty. VICTORIOUS WAVE was rated between horses, came under urging leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide while still between
horses on the turn and capitulated. VALENZAN DAY bobbled slightly at the start, chased the pace, dropped back between foes in the four path on the turn
and had nothing left.
