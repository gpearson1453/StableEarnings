Footnotes
SPUNFORFUN stalked close up outside, bid two wide entering the far turn, took over soon after, drew clear under urging and was kept to the task. HOLY
BERRIES set the pace racing in the two path, dueled inside on the far turn, was no match for the winner, then chased that rival home. WINE GODDESS
steadied after the start, then raced off the pace and did not factor. TABOR TIME tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
DUDEWITHANAME showed good early speed racing two wide, dueled with EL TEKILERO on the turn, edged away in upper stretch, dug in between rivals
at the furlong marker and held well late under urging. SCALLYWAG chased the leaders from the outset, came three wide into the stretch, rallied outside,
dug in gamely outside of the winner in the final sixteenth but needed more. JOEL'S BOY raced three wide off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, came
three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. EL TEKILERO set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in to midstretch, then
weakened. LAKE CHAPALA chased inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. MITHRIDATES chased two wide, chased on the turn and had no rally.
NIGHT MONKEY was off slowly and then veered out sharply at the break, trailed the field and closed belatedly outside.

Footnotes
DEAN DELIVERS dueled between rivals for command, dueled on the turn, shook free turning for home, kicked clear and then pulled away under urging.
HOLLYWOOD JET dueled three wide for the lead, dueled heads apart on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and earned the place spot. LITTLE VIC
was reluctant loading, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up two wide on the turn and rallied mildly for third. BUMP N RUN raced off the pace inside,
steadied and dropped back nearing the turn, moved up inside entering the stretch and rallied mildly in the two path. COUNTERSPY was off slowly and
steadied, outrun early, moved up at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly between rivals. MACHEN'S RIDGE was outrun
early, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HURRICANE J dueled inside for command, dueled on the turn and faded in the final furlong.
KHOZEIRESS chased the dueling leaders, chased inside on the turn and gave way.
