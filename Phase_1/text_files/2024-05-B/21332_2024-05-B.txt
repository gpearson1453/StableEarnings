Footnotes
WA WA WEE WA sprinted away from the starting gate to press the pace from two wide then moved up to take the lead at the three furlong marker, pulled
away on the turn for a clear lead into the stretch, fended off the late closer and just lasted. FADED MEMORIES was allowed to settle around the first turn
then steadily advanced on the backstretch, moved between horses at the three furlong marker, kept on and make a late run in deep stretch to just miss. LA
VIKINA was hustled along to take the lead to the three furlong marker where she was over taken by outside rival, she kept on but was empty in the stretch.
SASSY SAGEY raced off the pace down the backstretch on the inside then dropped back. JUST PASSING THRU was unhurried around the first turn then
made a mild bid down the backstretch, raced three wide around the final turn but was never a factor.

turn and passed tired one in the stretch. SCRAPBOOK pressed the pace from three wide to the turn and dropped back. CAJUN ACES saved ground to no

marker then saved ground around the turn and maintained his position. TIZ FABULOUS hustled along to press the pace from three wide to mid turn and
weakened. GONE ELVIS saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack but was not a threat. SPECIAL MEMORY showed no early speed but made a

EUROSTORM roused to the lead to set all the pace, edged away on the turn and drew off in the stretch. BITSY PERFECTMATCH vied for the lead from the
inside to thru the turn then shifted out to three wide in upper stretch and held on for the place. BROADWAY PEARL trailed the field early then moved up
from three wide on the turn and shifted in at the eighth pole for a late run to be up for show. SHEZA SALTY GAL stalked the pace from four wide then made
a mild bid into the stretch but faltered. BETONYA broke well, then prompted the pace from three wide through the turn and weakened. MO DIXIE DIVA was
close up on the pace down the backstretch but flattened out. BAYOU BEAUTY raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then dropped back on
the turn and passed tiring rival in the stretch. RUN AWAY SAMARI was last away then rushed to contention but failed to sustain that bid.

Footnotes
CHIEF CHEETAH was forwardly placed from the two path down the backstretch then moved out to the three path at the three furlong marker and kept on to
drive past the leaders at the eighth pole to take the victory. MINT pressed the pace from two wide on the first turn then took the lead at the six furlong
marker and was engaged at the midway through the final turn and fought gamely to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. RUSSIAN TANK stalked the
pace from three or four wide then made a three wide bid at the half mile marker to take a brief narrow lead midway through the final turn, fough gamely from
between horses to the sixteenth pole and weakened. AWE SHACKLE prompted the pace from the inside down the backstretch then dropped back on the
final turn and flattened out. COLOR FAST trailed the field and was outrun. HARD LOVE rushed up the inside to be off the pace on the backstretch but was
through after a half.
