leaving the three sixteenths, slipped through to take over inside the sixteenth pole, appeared to briefly clear, kept on gamely but was edged at the wire. FUN
NOTION stalked outside a rival, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, ranged up to threaten near the sixteenth pole then was out finished between foes.
SMITTEN ENOUGH sped to the front, set the pace just off the inside, bobbled for a stride nearing the turn, took pressure leaving the three eighths, shook
clear into the lane while about three wide, kept on under asking leaving mid stretch, could not fend off threats past the sixteenth pole and faded.
ATMIDNIGHT broke slowly, lagged off the pace, swung very wide for the drive and closed steadily. BENNY HAVENS , four deep nearing the turn, raced five
wide in upper stretch and lacked a serious run. CHAT BLANC , outside a rival leaving the far turn, swung well wide in the lane but came up empty. ONE

stretch then gave way. THUNDER LAD , bumped at the break, had speed then rated back off the leaders, saved ground mid turn, eased out into the stretch
and weakened. JOHN HALL , bumped at the break, raced three wide between foes early, was shuffled back nearing the turn and failed to recover. ALWAYS

IRISH HERO hugged the inner rail throughout, went clear leaving the turn, remained along the rail and drew off under steady urging. WITHOUT PRETENCE
saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. NIELSON prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened.
KAKE'S ARROW , four deep on the turn, lacked a rally. LUCKY PRINCE raced in the three path between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and failed to menace. CAR RIDE raced in the two path entering the turn and was jostled in tight quarters mid way on the bend. SAME DAY AS L J
steadied on the heels of the winner when keen to go leaving the backstretch and weakened. RESCUE THAT GIRL , fractious in the starting gate before the
race, trailed.

Footnotes
TALENTED MAN , hard sent from the gate, disputed the pace to the inside of SHIP THE GOODS, took command while drifting out a path into the stretch,
straightened away then was headed near mid stretch, battled back under right handed asking, regained command outside DR OSERAN in deep stretch and
was edging away. DR OSERAN , a bit washy pre race, was firmly rated back off the leaders while saving ground into the turn, was afforded a seam to
advance in upper stretch, slipped through to the inside and took over in mid stretch, moved away a bit soon after but could not hold through the final yards.
MATTA , lightly brushed at the start, rated off the pace while towards the inside, moved up leaving the three sixteenths, worked outward for the final furlong
and rallied. SWILL broke outward causing a jam up, corrected and rated off the pace while about two wide, continued just off the inside into the stretch then
finished well through the final seventy yards. ROCK THE BOAT was steadied near the half, angled four wide mid turn, shifted wider for the drive but lacked
a serious finish. SHIP THE GOODS had speed and moved to a slim early advantage outside the winner, sparred with that one around the turn, came three
wide for the drive, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. MARCHED , three to four wide around the turn, failed to menace. CHILDERS drifted in at the
break bumping soundly with a rival, was shuffled back soon after, dropped off the pace, raced three wide leaving the far turn and failed to seriously recover.
BARZINI , fought restraint three wide behind foes nearing the turn, chased four wide past the quarter pole and faded. FORCE OF JUSTICE gave pursuit
between runners, angled out for the drive and weakened. MINISTER FOR MAGIC , roughed up when sandwiched at the break, saved ground around the
turn and could not get involved.

Footnotes
POINT DUME sped to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted out for the drive and dug in stubbornly to prevail. NO EASY DAYS saved ground in a
forward position around the turn, remained near the inner rail in the stretch and rallied. TAKE CHARGE TOO bumped with CAJUN DREAM leaving the
starting gate, rated between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. GOLDEN CANDY , three deep on the turn,
chased the pace and gave way. CAJUN DREAM was bumped after being rank at the break, raced near the inner rail throughout and passed tired horses.
JOHN THE BEAR bumped CAJUN DREAM when bearing out at the break, raced along the inner rail on the turn, floated out for the stretch run and lacked a
rally. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened. NORTH HIGHLAND was outrun. HELDISH was no factor. MONDAY
MORNING QB , outrun, swung to the six path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
EFF THIRTY FIVE cleared early, secured the inside to set a rated pace, responded to solid asking through the final furlong and held firm. CINDER BLOCK ,
between foes early, saved some ground edging up into the far turn, angled four wide past the five sixteenths, altered back in through the final furlong and
finished gamely to grab the place. MISSION NORTH led early then fought restraint when being rated back off the winner, settled better through the
backstretch and tracked inside, eased out into the lane, moved up with aim in mid stretch then flattened out very late. BORDER WAR steadied between
runners heading to the first turn, raced two to three wide inside rivals into the stretch but lacked a rally. COBBLESTONE BRIDGE , inside under some
rating, was lightly shuffled nearing the three eighths, steadied when lacking some room in upper stretch, regrouped and finished with a good run between
foes. POLAR BEAR PLUNGE settled off the rail, swung five wide for the drive but lacked a solid run. MR FLOWERS , three wide early, raced between foes
near the quarter pole but went evenly in the drive. NO FOOLIN MO rated off the pace, saved ground nearing the half and failed to menace. WOW WHATA
PARTY prompted the pace outside the winner, was under heavy pressure three wide into the lane, shifted in and faded. ALWAYS FUN , three to five wide,
gave way. DYNA POINT broke slowly and failed to menace. FORCEFUL saved ground without threatening.

Footnotes
SUN BEE , slow to begin, was patiently handled behind horses down the backstretch, moved to the five path leaving the far turn, closed steadily outside
rivals and was up at the wire. CHELICHNA stalked the pace between horses, split rivals to gain a short lead in the drive and just missed. RUDA lacked
speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. GALILEI , angled in early, stayed along the inner rail the first turn, moved out for the stretch, raced
between horses and failed to menace. GOLD DIGGING BROAD prompted the pace outside BITTY BOSS, gained the lead turning for home and gave way
late. NAVAL EMPIRE saved ground the first turn, stalked the pace, swung to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. SURYA , wide the fart turn, failed
to be a factor and was eased. BITTY BOSS set the pace along the inner rail, lost the advantage turning for home and faltered the final furlong.
THEGIRLFROMIRELAND , three wide both turns, weakened and was eased.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN HOTTIE edged up into the first turn to reach a tracking position, rated kindly four wide spying the embattled leaders past the five eighths, bid
three deep while well within herself leaving the far turn, sparred outside MUSICAL MISCHIEF into the lane, responded when given some nudging, took
control in mid stretch and eagerly widened in handy fashion. MUSICAL MISCHIEF , bumped at the break, quickly recovered and attended the pace three
wide under rating outside LACIE B GOOD, moved to slim lead between horses with three furlongs remaining, dueled closer to the inner rail and to the inside
of the winner to mid stretch, faded late but remained well clear of the rest. QUEEN OF MISSOULA drifted in soon after the break, straightened and settled
off the pace while removed from the inside, dropped in under pressure around the final turn, cut the corner into the stretch and finished with some interest.
JULIA SHINING , bumped at the start, regrouped and chased the leaders while off the inside, angled out under pressure around the final turn, circled four
wide into the lane but came up empty. LACIE BE GOOD , bumped at the break, recovered and took the early lead, set a pressured pace just off the inside,
was under a ride to hold position past the three eighths, chased the leaders into the stretch and weakened. WESTERN LANE came out at the break
bumping with a rival, saved ground off the pace and failed to get involved. INTREPID DREAM , five wide nearing the backstretch, stalked well off the rail
past the five eighths, drafted in a couple paths to pursue past the half, failed to kick on and weakened.

Footnotes
SHE FEELS PRETTY stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path around the far turn, secured command outside JUST BETTER in
upper stretch and drew off under a hand ride. JUST BETTER prompted the pace outside ROANAN GODDESS, gained the lead leaving the backstretch,
saved ground the far turn, finished willingly but was no match for the winner. WAVES OF MISCHIEF trailed to the far turn, circled three wide, passed tired
horses and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. ROYAL WINTOUR lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and stumbled in tight quarters inside the
winner approaching the stretch. TURF ROCKET , three wide the first turn, chased the pace outside horses and gave way entering the stretch. ROANAN
GODDESS showed speed along the inner rail, remained prominent for six furlongs then faltered. EXPATRIATE gave way on the far turn and walked off after
being pulled up in upper stretch. An objection by the rider of ROYAL WINTOUR against the winner for alleged interference near the quarter pole was not
allowed.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LAKE sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the inner rail, responded when asked soon into the lane, spurted away after a left handed ask
near mid stretch then was ridden out to the wire. YOUALMOSTHADME , bumped at the break, rushed up inside rivals soon after and stalked, eased out into
the lane, gave hard chase from there and gamely held down the place. DISCREET OPS broke outward and brushed with a rival, angled in towards the rail
and was put to a ride, advanced inside into the stretch and churned on. CAP CLASSIQUE rated off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, worked
between runners in mid stretch, angled out and finished well. LADY MOSCATO stalked behind a host of rivals, angled out four wide while making a run into
the lane, chased past mid stretch then flattened out. BELLE'S BLUE BELL , off the pace and six to seven wide, had belated action. VALUE AREA , off slow
when bumping with an outer rival, raced off the pace, swung well wide past the three sixteenths and offered a mild response. CARMELINA , four wide
between runners stalking the early pace, shifted in mid turn and faded. LAUNCH , fractious in the gate, bobbled at the start, recovered and prompted
outside the winner, was under pressure three wide in upper stretch, failed to go and weakened. MISS HARRIETT , three wide between foes near the half,
chase into the lane and weakened. CLOSING ACT lost ground five wide outside rivals, pursued to the head of the stretch and weakened. LET THEM
WATCH , brushed at the break, was outrun.

FUTURE IS NOW , between horses mid way down the backstretch, was taken to the inner rail entering the turn, eased out to the two path at the head of the
stretch, swept to command in mid stretch and drew off under steady handling. SHOSHANAH sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail
around the turn, finished gamely but was no match for the winner. HOLLYWOOD WALK stayed in the two path between horses around the turn, swung wide
in upper stretch and rallied. QUEEN OF THE MUD (IRE) raced along the inner rail most of the trip, had a mild advance to the eighth pole and needed more.
HIGH CLASS raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. LA TRAVIESA raced inside horses in
the stretch and weakened. DULCE KIARA raced outside horses throughout and failed to rally. LILLY SIMONE remained along the inner rail on the turn and
was no factor. BOSSERATI chased the pace outside SHOSHANAH and faltered in upper stretch. ALL THAT MAGIC hesitated when acting up at the start
then trailed.

Footnotes
PYRENEES , well placed just off the inside tracking the leaders, worked outward under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, shifted further out with pursuit of
the dueling leaders past the three sixteenths, closed determinedly under pressure, forged past KINGSBARNS with about fifty remaining and was edging
away at the wire. KINGSBARNS prompted the pace outside HARLOCAP, moved to apply more pressure into the far turn, dueled under a hustling ride while
about three wide into the lane, gained command while being floated out near mid stretch, briefly shook clear under a drive with about a sixteenth remaining
but could not resist the winner's charge. HARLOCAP broke a bit awkwardly, recovered and was nudged up to take command, set the pace towards the
inner rail, sparred with KINGSBARNS from the three eighths, stayed on while drifting out past the furlong grounds then faded late. RED ROUTE ONE
grazed the outer portion of his stall leaving the gate then bobbled slightly, regrouped then was rank between rivals through about the opening three furlongs,
gave hard chase of the leaders while two to three wide in upper stretch but failed to seriously kick on. BE BETTER lost ground four wide when advancing
outside rivals past the five eighths, pursued under ride while remaining four wide past the five sixteenths and faded. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) prompted the
leaders three wide, stayed in touch while under coaxing past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on entering the stretch and weakened. DOUBLE CROWN
saved ground while off the pace, gave way in upper stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
GUN SONG broke well and stalked the pace outside JEANNE MARIE, rated comfortably down the backstretch, advanced to take command in upper stretch
and drew off under intermittent urging. CORPOSO bumped with RECHARGE soon after the break, never far back while three wide around both turns, was
brushed and herded wide by CALL ANOTHER PLAY in upper stretch, remained on her left lead until well inside the sixteenth pole and gained the place.
CALL ANOTHER PLAY raced in the two path between horses for seven furlongs, angled out in upper stretch herding CORPOSO then finished gamely
inside that one. WHOCOULDASKFORMO , taken up in tight quarters entering the first turn, raced in the two path down the backstretch, swung wide leaving
the far turn then came up empty. LEMON MUFFIN , squeezed by RINGY DINGY leaving the starting gate, trailed behind horses, swung outside near the
sixteenth pole and passed tired rivals. RINGY DINGY bore out leaving the starting gate, was rank entering the first turn, remained inside horses throughout
and weakened. JEANNE MARIE , clear early, set the pace along the inner rail then weakened through the stretch. RECHARGE stumbled at the break,
bumped with CORPOSO leaving the starting gate, circled the first turn four wide and the far turn three wide and failed to threaten.

WOW WHATA SUMMER rated three wide early, angled in near the half, came back out advancing four to five wide into the stretch, forged to command
outside rivals leaving the sixteenth pole, switched over to his left lead late and prevailed. THE ADDISON POUR , unhurried early, swung five to six wide in
upper stretch, made a grinding run through the final furlong, drew alongside the winner in deep stretch then just missed. AGENT CREED rated off the
inside, moved up between rivals leaving the far turn, angled three wide, ranged up to threaten, battled between foes past mid stretch and kept on with effort.
WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) prompted the pace two wide, moved to engage the leader near the three eighths, dueled past the five sixteenths, gained a

faded. BRILLIANT ICE , three to four wide, was hustled along past the three eighths and weakened. CURLY LARRY AND MO cleared early, set the pace
towards the inside, met an outside challenge departing the far turn, sparred into the stretch, faltered then was eased through the final furlong.
