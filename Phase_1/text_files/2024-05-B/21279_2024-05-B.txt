Footnotes
GUAPONESS went clear while well within himself early on, was nicely rated setting the pace towards the inner rail, responded when put to left handed
asking in upper stretch, spurted away a bit in mid stretch, kept on under solid handling through the final sixteenth and held sway. BAIL OUT rated outside a
rival through the backstretch run, worked between foes nearing the quarter pole, shifted out to be about four wide in upper stretch, moved up in mid stretch
and kept on grinding to steadily gain. INVECTIVE , unhurried early while saving ground, eased out briefly around the final turn, was guided back in for the
drive, slipped through to the inside of rivals to advance past mid stretch then churned on. BEE MAJOR , a bit fidgety in the gate, came away in decent order,
found an inside spot early on and took to rating while not far back, took closer order past the three eighths, waited for room nearing the lane, shifted out and
continued on with interest. GOOD KNIGHT NILE , four wide under rating into the first turn, dropped in some for the backstretch run, worked outward to be
about five wide and under a ride in upper stretch but could only generate a mild response. OMAR COMIN , in closest pursuit of the winner while two wide,
edged up to have aim into the far turn, gave hard chase from the quarter pole, failed to kick on near the sixteenth marker and faded. LANGLEE AVENUE
saved ground, was ridden along leaving the far turn but lacked a rally. WE DONT NEED ROADS lagged inside and failed to kick on. BOCA GUY stalked
three wide, gained outside a rival into the far turn, was under asking four wide near the quarter pole, failed to kick on and retreated through the drive.

NOQUESTIONABOUTIT broke alertly and immediately went clear, set the pace along the inner rail and lasted. THUNDER IN PARIS saved ground around
the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch until swinging to the outside approaching the sixteenth pole then rallied nicely. PURE MAJESTIC bore in
leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly along the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch and hung between the top pair.
SHKHARA FIRE , steadied behind PURE MAJESTIC soon after the break, swung outside mid way down the backstretch, circled the turn three deep, drifted
out in upper stretch and showed a little life late. BELLE OF THE SOUTH bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the winner when three wide on the turn
and weakened. KUKU trailed.

Footnotes
CLOUDS OF WHITE was deftly maneuvered towards the inner rail in the opening furlong as a pace battle when on up front, gained along the rail into the
stretch, shifted out near the three sixteenths, closed sharply under left handed asks, surged outside GIFT OF GAB to take over with about seventy yards
remaining and eagerly drew out. GIFT OF GAB , four deep with the pace past the half, was taken to rate soon after, advanced three wide outside a foe into
the lane, moved to command a furlong out, failed to contain the winner, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. PATRIA vied two wide between foes
early, forced the pace outside PRINCESS PALMER leaving the far turn then gave hard chase into the lane, dropped back a bit past the three sixteenths,
shifted out inside the furlong grounds and came back on. PRINCESS PALMER broke outward, corrected and was sent up between foes to take a short lead,
took pressure into the turn then cleared under some rating, came under a ride soon into the lane, ceded the lead nearing mid stretch then faded late.
FORGOTTEN GIFT had speed inside foes then rated back off the leaders, gained towards the inside into the stretch, awaited room near the sixteenth pole,
angled out and kept on with interest between rivals. EXPLOSIVE EXCHANGE , four to five wide with pursuit, came up empty. WATER WITCH , bumped
and in tight at the break, rated off the pace, came four wide for the drive and had some belated interest. NICKY JOLENE broke a step slow, raced off the
pace and off the inside, circled five wide into the stretch but failed to generate the needed run. PEACE OUT , in close at the break, was outrun. REMEMBER
ME broke out a bit outward then was forced out some and bumped with a foe, chased and gave way. KAPADOKYA was sent three wide between foes early
and pressed, rated back off foes into the turn, pursued and tired. YOOOU KNOW put in a dull effort.

JOB'S NOT FINISHED broke alertly and sprinted clear soon after the break, moved to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail
and was under energetic urging in the stretch. ANY FOOLS GOLD , nicely rated along the inner rail around the turn, remained along the rail through the
stretch and finished willingly to hold the place. PEACHESSWEETNOTION chased the early pace along the inner rail, angled to the two path approaching
the stretch and flattened out. STORMY IRISH LASS , bumped, pinched back leaving the starting gate, moved up four deep on the turn, remained on her left
lead and tired. HAPPYINITIATIVE , bumped leaving the starting gate, was outrun. DIANE caused a jam up when bearing out and bumping ZOLATONE
leaving the starting gate, chased the pace three wide and gave way. ZOLATONE , bumped and forced out by DIANE leaving the starting gate, recovered to
prompt the pace outside the winner, faltered leaving the turn and was eased.

WINKED had speed inside to lead early on, rated back off of DIVINA DULCE nearing the turn, angled out then tracked well in hand, moved up three wide
under steady hand encouragement to take over in mid stretch, responded to left handed asks nearing the sixteenth marker, dug in when surrounded late
and narrowly prevailed. WISE AND ELEGANT settled off the pace while saving ground and in the clear, came under a ride mid turn, got through to the
inside of rivals leaving the three sixteenths, finished gamely and just missed. APROPOS , bumped at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace while
removed from the rail, angled six wide under asking into the lane, brushed with an inner rival leaving the three sixteenths then finished well outside rivals.
RUN AROUND SLEW , snugly rated while saving ground into the turn, continued inside foes past the five sixteenths, eased out in upper stretch, moved up
leaving mid stretch and closed the gap between runners. MY GIRL GINGER , inside most of the trip, gained inside runners past mid stretch and kept on with
effort. FAST LANI rated in mid pack and about three wide, was under pressure between foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed finish. DIVINA DULCE
sped up to the outside of the winner and took over heading to the turn, cleared while two wide, remained off the rail into the lane, ceded command in mid
stretch then weakened through the final seventy yards. NUWANDA , four to five wide, brushed with an outer foe nearing mid stretch and came up empty.
CALL ME PENNY broke inward causing a jam up, corrected and moved up to chase, raced three to four wide between runners into the stretch then tired.
COAL MINE , jostled and in tight at the break, saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ROMINSKI accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail there after and was kept to his
business in the drive. FACTOR IT IN saved ground the far turn, stayed along the rail in the stretch and rallied. CLASSIER , bumped by KARAN'S NOTION
leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path at the head of the stretch and flattened out. EXCULPATORY prompted the pace
outside the winner and weakened in the drive. DON'T WAIT UP , three wide on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way.
ALWAYSINAHURRY , outrun, was wide around the turn and drifted to the six path entering the stretch. KARAN'S NOTION came in at the start bumping
CLASSIER, raced inside horses into the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and was no factor. CYNERGY'S STAR raced along the inner rail,
faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
KRONE was lightly steadied soon after the break, regrouped and angled in, was patiently handled saving ground through the backstretch run, picked up the
pace under a ride past the five sixteenths, eased out advancing past the three sixteenths, split foes, sustained under left handed asks and just got up in the
final jumps. KAKE'S TAP DANCER , bumped at the break, showed speed the rated three wide outside the leader, moved to even terms approaching the
quarter pole, kicked away under a drive nearing mid stretch, kept on gamely despite multiple lead switches but just failed to contain the winner's charge.
MAGIC IN THE PARK , bumped at the start, settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out with run into the lane, shifted further out past the three
sixteenths and kept grinding. DEAD SEXY , bumped from both sides at the break then was pinched back, recovered and found herself far back while
unhurried, came under pressure while saving ground past the five sixteenths, eased out with run past the furlong ground and continued on with interest.
KISS ME MORE broke outward forcing out a foe, corrected and lost ground four wide early, dropped in a bit and kept on with effort. STEAM KNOT grabbed
command early then cleared, set the pace just off the inside, met an outside bid past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. LADY
OPHELIA saved ground early, eased back a bit near the half, angled out, circled four wide into the lane but came up empty. INDEPENDENCE WAY broke
slowly, lagged off the pace three wide, came five wide for the drive but lacked a rally. LOVE SAGA , forced out at the break, raced three to four wide and
gave way. MINIME failed to menace. MATTIE stalked three wide, remained in range under a ride past the five sixteenths then tired through the drive.

RUDY RUDY RUDY , four wide the first turn, stalked the dueling leaders while three wide and outside a rival into the far turn, closed in under left handed
pressure and took over near mid stretch then steadily kicked away under a strong drive. UNDER THE OVERPASS , bumped at the break, regrouped and
rated forwardly between foes, chased in the clear past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide and made a grinding run to earn the place. MINNY
SPEIGHTSTER , three wide into the first turn, disputed the pace outside SEEKER, poked a head in front after six furlong, edged clear into the lane, ceded
command in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. PURE REALIZATION prompted the pace while saving ground, was under pressure leaving the three
eighths and weakened. SEEKER broke outward and bumped with UNDER THE OVERPASS, corrected and sped to the front while off the inside, dropped in
closer to the rail through the backstretch and took pressure, dueled from the far turn, stayed willingly to the head of the lane then tired.
