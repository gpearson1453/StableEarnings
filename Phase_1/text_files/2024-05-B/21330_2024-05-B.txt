Footnotes
ALYANAABI rated between rivals on the backstretch, gained the rail into the turn, moved clear when allowed leaving the bend, floated out some entering the
lane, was challenged from inside, moved ahead inside the last furlong and began to draw off in the waning yards. EURO SUPRISE overcame a step slow
break to be well placed from inside, waited for room through the turn, came to challenge ALYANAABI in the stretch, did not have enough left but was clearly
second best. MADE TO FIT prominent just off the inside, fanned three wide for the stretch run then could only hold his position in the late going. DEVIL'S
RULE pressed from outside, was three wide on the bend, steadied briefly behind BAM BAM CAM leaving the turn, was widest into the lane and had no late
bid. BAM BAM CAM displayed early speed outside ALYANAABI, began to drift out leaving the turn and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
ICONICUS pressed from outside, was four then five wide through the turn, battled through the lane and edged ahead the last seventy yards. MR. CHIVAS a
step slow at the start, was hustled up between rivals to dispute the pace, fought gamely in the stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards.
TIZWOW vied for the lead inside rivals from the beginning, moved ahead on the bend, came into the stretch from path three, was challenged again from
outside and gradually wore down in the late going. CHARLIE'S BEACH was well placed from inside from the beginning but also did not have enough left
deep stretch. MYSTIC POWER also a step slow at the break, was settled, picked up his pace along the rail on the turn, swung out some for the drive,
gained a striking position with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. CHARTED was forwardly placed behind rivals on the backstretch, angled out for a clear
path into the bend then began to steadily give way.

LIL BIT TIPSEY rated from outside, went for the lead three wide when allowed on the turn, was roused leaving the bend then steadily lengthened command
in the lane while ridden out. PALACE MAGIC raced in the second flight between horses, vied for the lead two wide on the bend, was no match for LIL BIT
TIPSEY when set down for the drive, angled outside the latter nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew off for second. DOROTA soon had the lead,
showed the way from inside, was challenged on the turn, flattened out in the lane but lasted for third. JOLIE RULER also in the second flight early, was
three to five wide taking the bend then had no late bid. BETHY away somewhat slowly, was checked behind traffic into the turn, altered out some, went to
the rail on the bend, gradually angled out upper stretch and lacked a significant response.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S CITY boxed in behind the early speed on the backstretch, angled to the outside nearing the quarter pole, took over from path five upper stretch
then drew off while ridden out the last eighth. BIG SALLY vied for the lead in tight quarters along the rail on the backstretch, floated out some entering the
lane, was no match for GHAALEB'S CITY the final furlong but proved easily second best. CANDY LOOKER prominent just outside the early leaders, went
for the lead outside TENSE on the turn, came into the lane from path four, moved clear for third then could only hold her position late.
LOVEYOULIKECRAZY was a contender while off the inside for a half mile, took the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. SHINE DOWN fractious in the
gate, chased from outside, in path three through the turn, moved out widest upper stretch and flattened out. TENSE displayed early speed just outside BIG
SALLY, was carried out some by the latter into the lane, retreated from tight quarters between horses then steadily gave way.

Footnotes
HELEN MAE'S SONG soon moved clear of the others and took the inside, showed the way in hand, was let out some on the bend, asked upper stretch and
maintained full control under a late drive. WITCHING raced closest to HELEN MAE'S SONG from just outside, floated out some into the lane, was no match
for the latter but gradually moved clear for second. TEMPLUNA crowded briefly at the break, moved to the inside early on, drew clear for third along the rail
on the turn, came off the rail some for the stretch run and could only just hold her position in the late going. WARM BEAUTY without early speed, advanced
three wide on the bend, angled out widest at the top of the lane, lodged a mild bid and was closing in for the show in the waning yards. ONACOUNTA
moved to the inside after two furlongs, angled out three wide upper stretch, progressed to inside the last furlong then leveled off. BUMPER GIRL broke a bit
inward, raced in contention just outside WITCHING then began to fade three wide on the turn. MUD HUT chased from just off the rail, also angled out for a
clear path at the top of the lane but had little to off. BLUE NEITH hesitated at the break, was slow to find her running stride, eased through the stretch and
walked off. BEIRUT BEAUTY unruly in the gate before the start, threw her head into the next stall when the gate opened, became fractious and lost her
rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into BEIRUT BEAUTY'S start. It was determined she was ready to start with the field but acted up when the gate
opened.

Footnotes
ANGEL EXPRESS was hustled to soon gain a clear lead and the inside, asked again leaving the bend, all out in the lane and held sway. BLAME TERI
broke inward, bumping MISS DUTTON, was soon boxed in behind ANGEL EXPRESS, waited for room, gained a clear path just outside that one at the top
of the stretch, fought for second inside HAPPY WORLD as she tried to close in on ANGEL EXPRESS but could only edge ahead for the place late. HAPPY
WORLD somewhat unruly in the gate, raced in the second flight just outside ANGEL EXPRESS once the race began, floated out slightly entering the
stretch, battled BLAME TERI for the place, lacked the extra needed but was clearly best of the others. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC was an early contender
between horses, did not stay close while four then five wide through the turn and only made up minor ground the last furlong. COCKTAIL CUTIE was sent to
help prompt the pace from outside but began to yield three wide on the bend. MISS DUTTON bumped at the break, was settled inside, advanced on the turn
then leveled off. SCAPITURE chased while toward the outside, came widest into the lane and had no late bid. GREER CROSSING chased widest of all on
the backstretch and faded from between rivals on the turn.

Footnotes
MAMAS FIRE was a step slow at the break then checked as his path narrowed, was settled briefly, advanced widest, circled rivals five wide on the turn,
angled in some leaving the bend, took the advantage from path three inside the eighth pole, drew clear inside the final sixteenth and held sway. SPAN void
of speed, though hustled along, began to pick up his pace after a quarter mile, had the rail on the bend, lost considerable ground fanning out to the middle
of the track for the stretch run, made a strong move, came up short but got up for second. MOVE IN SILENCE in midpack early between horses, was three
then four wide on the turn, steadied behind GOD GUNS N GUTS leaving the quarter pole, altered out some, started to drift out gradually midstretch, held a
straight path the last sixteenth and rallied belatedly. DENNIS'S PRIDE advanced inside horses to gain a clear lead after the first furlong and a half but slowly
wore down along the rail through the stretch. GOD GUNS N GUTS raced in contention toward the outside, was four wide taking the turn, closed the gap on
the leader and moved clear for third in the stretch but leveled off in the late going. TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS chased from path three, swung out seven wide
for racing room entering the lane, angled inside when his path was taken inside the final eighth and improved position some without threatening. HE'S A
FINE MAN chased from inside, angled out to gain a clear path nearing the quarter pole, came into the lane from path six, altered in some upper stretch then
had no serious response. TRUIST forwardly placed between foes, was two wide on the bend and flattened out for the drive. RED MOSCATO raced in
midpack between rivals, retreated two wide on the turn, was checked behind HE'S A FINE MAN leaving the quarter pole, altered in and had little to offer for
the stretch run. MOCOWBELL pressed DENNIS'S PRIDE from just outside on the backstretch, took the rail into the turn then steadily gave way before
finishing a half mile.
