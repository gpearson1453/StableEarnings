Footnotes
YZZY'S BOLT broke a step slow, got put to crowded quarters by an outer rival and steadied back at the start, tracked from midpack in the three path, tipped
inwardly entering the lane to surpass outer rivals, rallied to take aim outside of the clear leader while quickly closing in at the furlong grounds, swept past
that one with a sixteenth to go and drew clear. LADY ABERDEEN broke inwardly, set a clear pace along the inside, but was collared by an outer challenger
in the final furlong, proved no match and safely held place. GRAND PRAIRIE GAL tracked along the inside, chased under urging in the two path around the
far turn, shfited to the three path entering the lane and chased while one paced. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted
to the four path entering the lane and moved up between horses. WEST COAST SONG stalked outside of the pace setter, chased from the three path
around the turn, got floated to the four path into the lane and gave way. XTRA EXTRAORDINARY saved ground at the rear to no avail. IUKA MISS raced off
of the pace in the four path, came under urging with nine sixteenths to go then faded in the three path around the turn.

Footnotes
THE THUNDERER pressed two wide and between horses, forged an advantage with five furlongs to go, vied with an outer rival while remaining a path off of
the inner rail around the far turn, clung to an advantage through upper stretch, shook free at the sixteenth pole and lasted late. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE
stalked along the inside, surpassed a tiring inner rival approaching the far turn, chased the top pair from the two to three path around that bend, took aim
outside of them and from the five path entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge in pursuit in the final furlong, edged place late but needed more to reel
in the leader. SAQEEL pressed three deep early on, dueled with an inner rival while taking the far turn in the three path, sparred through upper stretch, but
was turned away with a sixteenth to go and yielded. MANO DURA trailed along the inside, swung to the six path entering the lane and rallied belatedly.
BOOGIE BODE tracked two wide and between horses, then faded around the far turn. MAJOR FED tracked in the four path, chased the top pair around the
far turn and weakened. MOBSTER GUN led inside of a pair of prompters around the first turn, got headed at the five furlong pole and weakened with a half
mile to go.

LA MARINERA vied two wide, wrestled an advantage passing the three furlong pole, drew off in upper stretch under a drive, then was put to hand in the
final sixteenth and lasted. STRUMMIN pursued four wide and between horses approaching the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, rallied to
take aim on the clear leader in teh closing stages but ran out of ground. PURSE THIEF bumped with an outer rival before being put to crowded quarters by
an inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, checked in tight leaving the half mile pole, sustained pursuit around the turn, shifted out to
the four path entering the lane, split foes in midstretch to bid for place in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. SPIRIT
RAGS chased five wide early on, shifted in and put inner rivals to crowded quarters passing the half mile pole, pursued in the four to three path around the
turn, drifted out to the five path in upper stretch, got outkicked for minor placings by a rival on either side in the final furlong and kept on. CONCRETE
CRUISER raced off of the pace three to two wide early on, steadied hard when put in tight passing the half mile pole, dropped back into the turn, took the
bend in the two path, shifted out in the final furlong and moved up. RAG TREE broke a step slow, raced at the rear in the three path then advanced between
horses in the final furlong. PROBATIONER broke outwardly, raced forwardly in the two path then along the inside around the turn, shfited out to the three
path in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead and lacked a bid. DEEPLY HIDDEN broke a step slow before being shuffled back at the start, saved ground
at the rear to no avail. MISSED THE TURN bumped with an inner rival before shying from a different inner foe at the start, lacked speed in the three path,
altered to the four path while getting subtly shuffled into the turn, then made little impact. COMING IN HOT vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner but

Footnotes
CHARGE THE CASTLE brushed with an inner foe early on, lacked early speed along the inside, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, surged to sweep
past the leader in the final sixteenths and kicked clear. PLATINUM GHOST raced forwardly along the inside, tracked the leading trio from the two path
turning for home, tipped four wide entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, leaned inwardly while vying in midstretch, forged an advantage at the sixteenth
pole but was swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder late. RED LINE OVERDRIVE brushed with an outer foe early on, tracked in the four path, bid three deep at
the three furlong pole, led narrowly turning for home, dug in to resist an outer challenge in midstretch, but was headed by that one at the sixteenth marker
and yielded. MIDWAY MIRACLE raced at the rear two wide and between horses, flopped back to his left lead shifting out in midstretch and stayed on
willingly. NOTORIOUS SIXOHTWO showed the way in the two path before tucking to the inside into the turn, got headed by a pair of outer bidders passing
the three furlong pole, gave way entering the lane yet kept on mildly. CRAFTED stalked in the three path, bid along with an outer rival at the three furlong
pole, vied turning for home but weakened in upper stretch. BRONZE BEAST chased the main group from the four path into the turn and faded. NATORADE
broke outwardly and was off a step slow, raced at the rear three wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane and made little impact.

Footnotes
LEAD FOOT laid off of the pace along the inside, inched closer in the two to three path and between horses turning for home before swinging to the five
path entering teh lane, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and edged past. MUNYHUNGRY was forced out at the start, vied with an inner rival while
remaining in the three path, drew clear entering the lane, wandered about slightly while holding sway into midstretch, but flopped back to her left lead while
getting collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and was bested. CAJUN CRUISER pursued from midpack in the four path, tucked to the two path
leaving the three furlong pole, tipped inwardly to commit to a rail charge in upper stretch, sustained a grinding advance and edged show late. MIDNIGHT
AMBITION stalked in the two path, took aim in the three path and between horses in upper stretch, tipped inside of the drifting leader at the furlong grounds,
attempted a bid but was kept at bay and yielded show to an inner rival late. PLAIN AND SIMPLE broke a step slow, got floated out and checked at the start,
lagged behind around the turn, rallied along the inside through upper stretch, tipped to the three path at the sixteenth pole and leveled off among foes late.
GOLDEN BUCK prompted outside of the top pair and from the four path, came under urging to sustain pressure into the turn, chased turning for home and
kept on evenly between horses. GUATAPE leaned out at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, dropped back around the turn, shifted out to the
four path in upper stretch and failed to menace between rivals. ZAPTASTIC broke out severely at the start, then dropped back when corrected, advanced
from well back in the five to six path around the turn, but flattened out and tired. GONE AGAIN was floated into an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the
four to five path and failed to factor. EARLY MUNNY vied along the inside, got headed turning for home, shifted out and faltered between horses while
hanging on his left lead. SCAT DANZ was bumped by an inner rival at the start, pursued in the three path and between horses then weakened.

Footnotes
BARAYE led in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, cleared entering the lane and drew off while hanging on her left lead. PISTOL prompted
outside of the eventual winner and from the four path, but proved no match entering the lane and held place from an inner late challenger. QUALY chased
from midpack along the inside, moved out to the four path entering the lane, stayed on while shifting inwardly, attempted a late bid for place but was fended
off. LAURA'S CHARM lacked speed in the two to three path, fanned out to the seven path into upper stretch and stayed on willingly. GUNESH brushed an
outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace three wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace. LOVE APPEALS took light contact
from an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three path and lacked a bid. GOLD DEL MAR stalked along the inside and tired. SARA MIA was outrun in the
four path.

Footnotes
FLAT ON showed the way in the two path, dug in to resist an outer rival's challenge entering the lane, got headed by that one in upper stretch, fought on to
regain an advantage at the sixteenth pole and shook clear, then was taken off of the track in an equine ambulance. BETTERA tracked in the four path, bid
outside of the leader entering the lane, shifted in while wrestling an advantage in upper stretch, but failed to kick away, relinquished the front back to his
inner counterpart at the sixteenth pole and yielded. SIXWILLBERICH laid off of the pace two wide, moved up to reach show entering the lane, vied with an
inner bidder for that position in the final sixteenth and held. QUEBRANCHO lacked speed two wide, improved entering the lane, vied for show with an outer
rival in the final furlong but was kept at bay. TWIRLING TROILLET stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, chased into the turn then
weakened turning for home. NO BRAKE NEEDED chased along the inside and faded around the turn. JET STREAM broke inwardly and got rank at the
start, lagged behind the five path and was outrun.

Footnotes
PIGALLE dueled for the lead two wide, cleared in upper stretch and held late. UNDER ADVISEMENT raced forwardly along the inside, chased and yielded
position around the turn, regained stride shifting out in midstretch, floated to the six path at the sixteenth pole, rallied to edge place shortly after and was
gaining on the leader late. HARBOR SPRINGS dueled inside of the eventual winner, failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, shifted out and
sustained a chase in the final furlong, but lost place to an outer bidder late. FANCY stalked three wide, chased the top pair around the turn, floated to the
five path in upper stretch, then to the seven path in the final furlong and lacked a bid. SABRA TUFF laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted to the six
path in upper stretch, floated wider in the final furlong and failed to factor. SCARLETTA trailed in the two path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and
made little impact. FLOORED raced off of the pace two wide, then in the three path and between horses around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
THIS IS USCAR prompted the leader from the three path and between horses, bid before forging an advantage entering the lane in the four path and drew
off under a drive. NOT THIS BOY took contact from an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack three wide, shifted out to the six path entering the lane,
ran on to gain place at the furlong grounds and was second best. ALDER laid off of the pace in the two path, then stayed on mildly between horses to edge
show at the sixteenth pole. FROSTY INDULGENCE pressed the top pair from the four path while under urging around the turn, chased those rivals entering
the lane in the five path and yielded. AGOO tracked along the inside, chased into the turn, yielded turning for home, yet shifted out in upper stretch and
surpassed tired rivals. RED STATE was forced to bump an inner rival at the start, showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer presser while
entering the lane in the three path, then weakened hanging on his left lead. STORMS HOME transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the
start, trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
UNO MAS BOURBON tracked along the inside, loomed a danger behind the leaders nearing the lane, split them entering upper stretch and kicked away.
AHANDFULOFCANDY broke a step slow and checked at the start, tracked four deep, bid three wide leaving the three furlong pole, but was outkicked by an
inner rival while getting floated four wide entering the lane and kept on to be second best. ROCK N ROLL BOLT prompted two wide and between horses,
got outkicked by rivals on either side entering the lane three wide, vied for show with an inner rival in the final sixteenth and prevailed. RADICAL MISCHIEF
set the pace along the inside, offered no resistance to an outer challenge in upper stretch, gave way, vied for show in the final sixteenth and got bested.
SWEET FREEDOM pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but encountered traffic through the final furlong and lacked a bid. SURF CITY
pursued four wide and failed to menace. WARNING SIGNS lagged behind early on and never got involved. DR TIMOTHY broke outwardly, pressed three
wide, but faltered between horses entering the turn and was eased through the lane.
