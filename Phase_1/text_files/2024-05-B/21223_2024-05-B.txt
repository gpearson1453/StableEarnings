STRAWBERRY TREAT set the early pace on the inside and was well handled, drew clear leaving the turn and then drew off in the final furlong to prove
much the best under a mild drive. P JS SILVER DUKE was settled early on the outside, came five wide into the lane and rallied well for the place award
while no match to the winner. CAJUN OCCASION tracked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn but weakened, held show award. BOBBY G
was reserved early, saved ground on the far turn and lacked rally. GRAB THE GOLD pressed the pace two wide and weakened. TRIBAL NOTION stumbled
at the break, chased the pace from the inside and tired.

CAR LADY was taken back early two to three wide, made a four wide move on the far turn and took over nearing the furlong marker and drew off to prove
much the best under left handed crop urging. CRICKET WEST prompted the pace two wide and kept on to the wire to be second best and no match to the
winner. MIKEY'S JEWEL chased the early pace on the inside, eased out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane and was along for the show besting
the rest. I HAVE COURAGE broke outwardly at the start, then four wide into the first turn and chased the pace from the outside and tired. LOVE IS
STRONG chased the pace in between rivals and tired. SERENE WARRIOR set the pace on the inside and then stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BULLET BREEZE was reserved early towards the inside, eased out on the turn and advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide off the bend
and closed well to get up in time under a drive. PENTATONIC stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over leaving the quarter
pole, was clear by the furlong marker but was nailed on the wire to just miss. SYLVIA I AM was reserved early, advanced on the outside on the turn and
came six wide off the bend and rallied well. UTILITY was reluctant to load, rated on the inside and came two wide off the bend and had a mild kick but
needed more. LUCKY DOUBLE ZERO was settled early, made a four to three wide move on the tun but flattened out. BAG OF GOLD was bumped at the
break, settled back and was four to five wide on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. BELLS ARE RINGING was off slowly and trailed the field and was two
wide on the turn and was not a threat. ROLLY set the pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole and faltered in the final furlong. TACTICAL
HUMOR showed good early speed on the inside and stopped.

NEON SIGN dueled for the early lead three wide, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and drew clear leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong
marker, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under crop urging. SOUTH STREET stalked the early pace on the outside, then was ridden
along on the turn four wide and finished well to be clearly second best. GOING AT IT bobbled at the start, stalked the pace three wide and was in contention
leaving the quarter pole and faded in the drive, bested rest. FREEDOM'S START chased the pace on the inside, shifted out on the turn and came five wide
into the lane and had no rally. MO MOSCATO was away alertly to duel for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive.
