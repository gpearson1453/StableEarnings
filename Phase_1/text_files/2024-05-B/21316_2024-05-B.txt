KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN) showed the way from the inside while in steady hand ride throughout the first three quarters, then drew off in the stretch to
prove much the best. CLASSIFY stalked the leader while two wide throughout, lacked the winning bid leaving the far turn and gave way in the stretch.
BATTLE STRIKE saved ground in the early furlongs, was moving up on the far turn, came out three wide to rally in the stretch and was up for third place.
TEJAS was no threat. PROJECTION chased the pace from the inside between the two fields of rivals, then flattened out leaving the far turn. EXCAPING
THE BLUES no factor.

the final yards and prevail in the end. BLUEBONNET GIRL stalked the pace from the inside, then urged steadily on the turn, came out four wide and
finished well for the place position. BLING BABY stalked the pace while three wide, then moved up on the turn to duel with an inner foe at the quarter pole,
gained command at the eighth pole while in a gamely rally then was out finished in the end. GOD KNOWS WHY stalked the pace while two wide, then bid
while three wide on the turn to rally gamely in the stretch but it was to no avail. SCOOTER'S HONOR pressed the pace into the turn, then moved up to duel
with an outer foe heading into the stretch could not retain bid and gave way. DIVERTIDA was unhurried early then bid from the two path and between rivals
in the late stretch and came up empty. OOH LA DA STOOPS settled while two wide at the back, bid four wide on the turn and came up empty. MORO

Footnotes
NERKY ROSE saved ground in the early stages, then moved up heading into the far turn, remain well rated before bidding along the rail in the upper
stretch, gain command and held on while in a strong drive to prevail. IN FORM conserved energy in the early furlongs while racing towards the back, then
bid from the inside on far turn to rally gamely in the stretch, gained second position and was closing in on the leader in the end. YOUNG POPE tracked the
pace while two deep down the backstretch, then bid between foes leaving the half marker, attempted to bid between the top pair, was unsuccessful, settled
back on the far turn, then re rallied in the upper stretch while four wide and was best for the show prize in the end. GWYNETH'S MALIBU took over the lead
after the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch along the inside, was in a long drive while being pressured by an outer foe on the far turn, shook
clear of that foe to gain command briefly in the upper stretch then was out finished in the end. R R EMPIRE was unhurried early and no threat. FLYING J
RAGNAR tracked the pace while two wide and outside of foe, then bid while three wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but did not have enough in the
end. BAD BOY FOR LIFE stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn, then gave way in the stretch. GET
RIPPED pressed the emerging leader down the backstretch and into the far turn, could not take over the lead while in a strong bid at the quarter pole and
gave way in the stretch. BARBACOA stalked the pace from the inside into the backstretch, was over powered by rivals on both sides, then steadied back
after the half and faded in the remaining furlongs. GOOD DOCTRINE was no factor. BLAME DENNIS was out well, then bore out after the first turn, pulled
up and walked off in the end.

CREATIVE MIRACLE showed the way from the inside and held onto the lead confidently throughout to prevail gate to wire. DEFINE tracked the pace while
two wide in the early furlongs, gained second position on the far turn, did not have enough to catch the leader and held onto the place prize. JIM NED saved
ground in the back flight of rivals, then came out three wide leaving the far turn and closed willingly in the end. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE tracked the pace
from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, angled out three wide to rally mildly in the home stretch but it was to no avail in the end. MO TAP
chased the pace while four wide, then rallied on the far turn then gave way in the stretch. ABSOLUTE COURAGE chased the pace from the inside, then
came out four wide in the upper stretch to bid briefly then flattened out. CHELSEA DAGGER raced along the inside in the back flight of rivals, then rallied on
the far turn and into the stretch while coming out five wide and came up empty. GEORGIA DEPUTY was no threat. KENTUCKY ICE stalked the pace while
two wide, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, could not catch the leader and flattened out late. UPTOWN BIGBADJON settled at the back and was
no menace. MISSWISH settled along the inside early, then faded while outside of foes in the backstretch and was no threat.

Footnotes
HALAGA saved ground well behind the field down the backstretch, then dug in gamely leaving the bend to slip thru along the rail and was up in the late
stretch to prevail. AZUNIA was allowed to settle while three wide, remained well rated on the turn then closed well down the lane to be up for the place
prize. LITHE SPIRIT was allowed to settle while two wide, then rallied leaving the turn and was improving down the lane. LET FREEDOM BLING set the
pace from the inside, was pressured by an outer foe heading into the turn, cleared that rival, then was out finished in the stretch. GRAY ZONE race at a
moderate pace throughout while four wide and needed rally at the end. RUMPUS stalked the pace while three wide, then rallied on the far turn and came up
evenly in the stretch. NIGHT ORB raced while four wide mid pack, then rallied on the turn but did not spark in the stretch. PINK SOLITAIRE chased the
pace from the inside briefly, then flattened out leaving the turn. LET HER BUCK pressed the pace while two wide, then urged eagerly on the turn, could not
over take the leader and gave way in the end. FIESTA BESTA stalked the pace while two wide into the turn and lacked rally in the home stretch.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA READY was bumped on both sides, saved ground along the inside, came out four wide leaving the turn and surged down the lane and was up
at the wire to prevail. TAPE TO TAPE was away well to duel with an inner foe, disposed of that foe on the turn, was challenged by another on the outside,
dug in gamely to take command at the eighth pole then was caught at the wire by MINNESOTA READY. MISH was bumped at the start, then pursued the
pace while three wide, was urging on the turn, came out three wide to bid in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. AUGUSTA MELODY pursued the
pace while four wide, was moving up on the far turn to duel with an inner rival briefly, then gave way in the stretch. MARSALIS was impeded at the start and
was no menace. GUNFLASH was no factor. RUGGS veered outwardly and bumped foe, then dueled with an outer foe into the turn, was in tight, steadied at
the five sixteenths pole then flattened out. MAHOMEY pulled up shortly after the start and was vanned off.

stretch to prevail in the end. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL pressed the pace from the inside then settled back on the turn to save ground, re rallied in the upper
stretch but it was not enough to claim victory in the end. MY FRIEND AMY was unhurried early, then came out six wide leaving the bend and rallied mildly in
the stretch and was up for third place. RECLUSIVE was allowed to settle along the inside, then bid mildly in the late stretch just missing the show prize in
the end. ADALINE JULIA was no menace. NON VIOLENCE was off slowly and no threat. PALACEIN set the pace while two wide, was over taken at the top
of the turn, then flattened out in the stretch. MAJESTIC WAYS raced mid pack while two wide, then bid on the turn before giving way in the stretch.

E J WON THE CUP tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, angled out to the four path leaving the far turn, startled outer foe, then charged
on down the lane to edge past DIMATIC in the final yards and prevail in the end. DIMATIC broke inwardly and bumped foe then tracked the pace while three
deep down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied in the upper stretch to gain command in the late stretch then was out finished in the end. REAL
MEN VIOLIN was unhurried early, then moved up to race mid pack down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, came out four wide
to bid in the upper stretch, was brushed by an inner foe then kept on down the lane and was best for the show prize. THE DONEGAL CLAN pressed the
pace while two wide down the backstretch, then moved up to duel with the pace setter on the far turn, was bumped by said rival heading into the stretch and
gave way in the end. AWESOME ROAD was allowed to settle at the back of the pack while five wide, then rallied mildly leaving the far turn and came up
empty. LUCKY JEREMY set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, was challenged by an outer foe, then bumped said foe
at the top of the stretch and flattened out in the stretch. VICTORY FOR VETS was no threat. GENERAL LEDGER was bumped at the start, then tracked the
pace while two wide down the backstretch, was urging on the far turn then lacked rallying in the stretch. INFORMED PATRIOT trailed at the back early,
moved up to race six wide down the backstretch, bid while four wide on the far turn, then steadied at the top of the stretch and gave way in the end.
HIGGINS BOAT was no menace.

Footnotes
HEROIC MOVE was reserved behind the pack of rivals in the early stages, was advancing on the far turn while four wide, dug in gamely in the upper stretch
then tipped by the dueling pair in the final yards and was up in time to succeed. TOUCHUPONASTAR moved between rivals to set the pace down the
backstretch while two wide, was clear heading into the far turn, then was confronted by FROSTED GRACE from the outside to spar in the late stretch then
was out finished by HEROIC MOVE in the end. FROSTED GRACE stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, bid on the far turn to duel with
the pace setter in the late stretch then was out finished in the final yards. LURE HIM IN stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the
far turn at a moderate pace and lacked bidding in the home stretch. PRESIDENTIAL bid for the lead from the inside before pressing the pace down the
backstretch while in a steady hand ride, then rallied on the far turn but did not fire in the stretch. SILVER PROSPECTOR was no threat.

DANA'S BEAUTY pressed the pace while two deep into the backstretch, then inched up leaving the far turn to go head to head with LIBBAN down the lane
and was up at the wire to claim victory. LIBBAN led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch along the rail, was confronted by an outer
foe leaving the far turn to spar grudgingly down the stretch and hung at the wire. FREYDIS THE RED (FR) was unhurried early, continued to save ground
on the far turn behind the field, circled six wide and closed well for the show position in the end. GLENALL (IRE) pressed the pace while three wide down
the backstretch, then settled back on the far turn, re bid in the home stretch but it was to no avail in the end. TRYINMYHEARTOUT settled in the back field
while two wide, then rallied leaving the far turn but it was too little too late in the end. WILD EXPRESS settled in the back field along the inside, bid on the far
turn and came up empty in the end. COLORS OF THE WIND was in tight heading into the first turn, steadied, then raced from the three path down the
backstretch and into the far turn, and made no impact in the end while in a mild rally. MISS CODE WEST raced in the middle duo while two wide down the
backstretch and into the far turn then rallied mildly in the final furlong and came up empty. VIEWERS DISCRETION chased the leaders from the inside
down the backstretch and into the far turn while in a mild bid then flattened out in the stretch. PERFECT WISH raced in the middle duo along the rail and
lacked bidding in the final furlongs.
