Footnotes
B WEST disputed the pace two wide outside ICING, stayed on to battle between rivals past mid stretch, came back under stout handling and to the inside of
KADRI to take command past the sixteenth pole then held firm. KADRI tracked a contested pace three wide and in the clear, moved up four wide under a
ride into the lane, took over outside the embattled leaders nearing mid stretch, dueled outside B WEST from there but was out finished through the final
seventy yards. JESTER'S SONG , off slowly after breaking inward and bumping CLEM LABINE, regrouped then dropped in towards the rail when advancing
towards the half, rated forwardly mid turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and closed steadily. ICING broke inward, corrected and sped up to the inside
of horses to take a slim lead, was hounded by B WEST into and around the turn, dueled from the quarter pole to mid stretch then weakened in the final
sixteenth. STRUGAR lagged off the pace while saving ground early, was under a ride off the rail and inside a rival past the three eighths then failed to
generate a serious response. CLEM LABINE , soundly bumped at the break, was put to a ride soon after while removed from the inside, continued under
pressure around the turn but failed to drum up a run.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS rated forwardly and to the inside of a pair of rivals, edged up to take closer order of the dueling leaders into the lane, remained
along the inner rail past mid stretch, closed determinedly under strong handling to join KILO ROAD from her inside in deep stretch then finished on even
terms with that one at the wire. KILO ROAD , off a bit awkwardly, prompted the pace three wide outside SUSAN'S MULE, drew alongside around the turn,
sparred under rating past the five sixteenths, poked a head in front when put to firmer asking soon into the lane, kicked clear under a drive leaving mid
stretch, kept on under pressure past the sixteenth marker, dug in when confronted by GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS then finished in a dead heat at the line.
OVERLY DRAMATIC was bumped by SUSAN'S MULE leaving the gate then steadied when forced out by that rival, regrouped to rate off the rail behind
foes into the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and closed gamely. SUSAN'S MULE came out at the break bothering OVERLY DRAMATIC, drifted out
soon after when making the lead, corrected to set the pace in the two path, dueled to the inside of KILO ROAD from mid turn, stayed on past mid stretch
then faded late. BUCKIN' GREAT , between foes pursuing the leaders, shifted out past mid stretch then came up empty. DWELLING LEGACY stumbled
badly at the break, regrouped and edged up four wide nearing the half, chased three deep under a ride mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch, was
floated out a bit and weakened. GOODNIGHTGODBLESS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1ST TO UNPLACED FOR A CROP VIOLATION.

Footnotes
CHARGING AERO broke alertly, set a pressured pace along the inner rail, was under urging in the stretch and drew off. STAR SHOPPING bobbled at the
start, stalked the pace behind horses around the turn, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, remained on his left lead until late and rallied.
DUNPHY prompted the pace outside the winner, remained on his left lead in the stretch and gave way. CASH NOW , four deep entering the turn, was no
factor. VALIANT VINNY chased the pace three wide, gave way leaving the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
GOODGIRL BADHABITS quickly went clear, dropped down towards the rail and set the pace under a light hold, moved away past the five sixteenths,
responded when shoved along in upper stretch then continued as much the best while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. NIGHT CAP was taken to
rate early while saving ground, came under pressure mid turn, moved up to the inside of ROYAL WHISPER in upper stretch, gave futile chase from there
and dug in gamely to save the place. BOURBON WILDCAT , in a bit tight at the break, raced three deep near the half, shifted out to be about four wide in
upper stretch and closed steadily. ROYAL WHISPER stalked three wide, was under urging past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then
faded. FUHGEDDABOUDIT broke slowly, was taken to rate while saving ground, worked outward for the final furlong and churned on. FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO flashed speed then dropped back between foes.

PRIYANKA assumed the early lead, was off the rail entering the backstretch, moved to the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
drew away in the stretch while kept to her business. CIRCLE HOME lacked speed, was three deep the far turn, moved up a bit in upper stretch and failed to
sustain the bid. GOLDEN HEART hopped at the break, prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way in upper stretch. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS
hugged the inner rail and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
MISSY BOSS cleared into the first turn and dropped towards the inner rail, handled outside pressure through the backstretch run while nicely rated, shook
clear leaving the three eighths, widened a bit under a ride in upper stretch, switched over to her left lead near the sixteenth pole, drifted out and prevailed.
G'S FIREBALL prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, rated back off the leading pair and tracked through the backstretch, angled out a bit then
advanced three wide into the lane, moved up to take aim of MISSY BOSS in mid stretch, continued to grind, drew alongside in the final jumps and just
missed. SOMETHING SILLY saved ground within range, was under pressure pursuing into the stretch but came up empty. VOODOO PRIESTESS bobbled
at the break, shied outward from a rival into the first turn, lagged off the pace and off the inside, came wide for the drive and got past tired rivals. FLITTER ,
three wide to contention, forced the pace outside the winner into the far turn, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths then gave way between foes. SUPER
MONEY , rank at the break, dropped off the pace and fought restraint while saving ground, was under a ride leaving the far turn and failed to go on.
SEARCH broke outward and was away a step slow, regrouped and moved up off the rail into the first turn, failed to respond leaving the far turn, faltered,
was eased through the final furlong and walked off.
