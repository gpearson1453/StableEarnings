nine-sixteenths, drafted in the two path on the far turn, nudged a foe while moving into the three path at the quarter-pole, took the lead at the
three-sixteenths pole then was asked, fought with foes on both sides in the final furlong, was guided in closer to the runner-up late and held. SY B stumbled
at the start, saved ground on the first turn, moved off the rail late on that bend, was reserved at the back, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was
roused at the quarter-pole, chased behind horses while between rivals into the final furlong, gained to make a bid inside of the winner coming to the
sixteenth-pole but missed while able to get the place. VIVE VEUVE settled in the two path, moved closer with a half-mile to run, stalked three wide on the far
turn, was asked five wide into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid near the furlong marker, battled outside of two foes to the finish and missed while
clear for the show. GRAYOSH settled on the inside, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground under intermittent urging on the far turn, was
roused into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, pursued the vanguard between horses into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. SWEET

Footnotes
TRULY QUALITY coaxed from the gate, tracked the front from just off the pace just off the inside, advanced on the front near the half mile pole, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch taking over command, drew clear under a drive to prevail. HOLD THE SALSA coaxed
from the gate, raced keen and a bit rank early on under the restraint of the rider when losing the inside to a rival just prior to entering the first turn, tracked
the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
improving position to the finish. BE LIKE CLINT saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. CATCH A WAVE got clipped behind a furlong into the race by BETTER BET when tucking three to two wide into
the first turn, tracked two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SAMBURU
(GB) bobbled at the break, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened
in the late stages. ROYAL SPIRIT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under attendance from NIGHT EFFECT heads apart at
time to the outside, shook off that rival midway on the final turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
was displaced from command, then weakened to the finish. GOOD MEDICINE got bumped at the start by NIGHT EFFECT when that rival recovered
outwards from a bobble, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. BETTER BET
clipped the back of CATCH A WAVE when that foe tucked in front a furlong into the race and bobbled, tracked two to three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. NIGHT EFFECT bobbled at the break recovering outwards into GOOD
MEDICINE, attended the leader three to four wide throughout coming under brief coaxing at the three-eighths, faded and went four wide into upper stretch,
then got eased home through to the finish.

Footnotes
JACKSON'S DIXIE quickly sped clear, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while challenged on the turn, responded well when asked near the
quarter-pole, drew off while off the rail in upper stretch, came under the crop at the furlong marker and widened under strong urging. QUEENS
MASTERPIECE chased the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path early on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and proved no
match while able to hold the place. SANDY'S GARDEN broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace, shifted out some near the five-eighths pole, moved up
between horses around the nine-sixteenths pole, jostled with a foe early on the turn then was roused in the three path, moved out in upper stretch and
lacked the needed response while able to get the show. TEMPERMENTAL was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and tired. NO
CHALK broke a half-step slow then dropped back, was urged along at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, shifted back to the two path
outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BANK ON ANNA settled under some urging, chased while inside to the two
path on the turn and came up empty. BACKED BY GOLD was urged along off the pace, raced between foes into the turn, jostled with a rival early on the
turn then was squeezed back outside the three-eighths pole, moved from the two path to the four path while roused on the turn, lost action badly and
stumbled severely in the hindquarters outside the quarter-pole and was pulled up then taken off the track aboard the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
MIGHTY ATLAS coaxed from the gate, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away and drew clear to the finish getting geared
down inside the final sixteenth. WILLINTORISKITALL dueled four then three wide with DOLLY'S BANK to his inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got bumped by DOLLY'S BANK due to pressure from CLEAR CONSCIENCE coming outwards, proved
no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. CLEAR CONSCIENCE chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced inside at the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, came out and bumped DOLLY'S BANK
into WILLINTORISKITALL at the three-sixteenths and kept on to procure the show honors while never threatening the winner. DOLLY'S BANK coaxed from
the start, dueled three then two wide with WILLINTORISKITALL to his outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch clinging to command, got displaced by the top one straightened away and then was bumped by CLEAR CONSCIENCE into his main pace rival, the
rider pausing for a stride, then weakened in the very late stages. SAFALOW'S MISSION chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. VIN SANTO chased two to three
wide down the backstretch before tipping out five wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. KING FREUD coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and faltered. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the bumping between CLEAR CONSCIENCE, DOLLY'S BANK and WILLINTORISKITALL at
the three-sixteenths. After review, the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
COOL OPERATOR was hustled to the front, moved clear with six furlongs to run, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, responded well when
put to the crop in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. SECURED LANDING showed speed then chased the solo leader, went around the turn in
the three path, moved to the four path nearing the quarter-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner. ERIC FROM MIAMI was ridden along
on the outside, dropped from the five path to the three path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the crop and improved but missed the place
while clear for the show. STORMQUIST was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, moved to the five path near the quarter-pole and
came up empty. MAMA'S DREAM broke in and bumped with a foe, was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground while chasing on the turn and tired.
RETAIL MAN was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. BROWN DON'T STOP was bumped and forced in
at the start then grabbed with the left-rein while slow into stride, saved ground near the rear and was no factor. AVA'S UNCLE BILLY was ridden along off
the pace, dropped well behind late on the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, came out into the stretch and was eased but walked off.
