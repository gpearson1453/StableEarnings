Footnotes
TITLE CONTENDER tracked the pace from the two path while being nicely rated in the early furlongs, then was encouraged by a gamely rally leaving the
far bend to gain command at the top of the stretch, then drew clear while in a strong drive to prevail in the end. MIND HUNTER pursued the pace while
three and outside foes down the backstretch, then made up ground leaving the far bend to gain second position in the late stretch, could not catch the
leader and held onto the place prize in the end. PATRIOT HILLS led the way into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn
then was confronted by an outer foe in the early stretch, was used up and gave way in the final yards. ZED steadied back after the break, then raced at the
tail of the pack in the early stages, moved up to bid on the far turn while three wide then continued to rally mildly down the lane to no avail in the end.
MACHO GRANDE was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack while two wide, then rallied mildly on the far turn and was no threat. ISLAND CABANA
tucked in along the rail at the back of the pack down the backstretch, then urged on the far turn and made no impact in the end. DRINKING THING raced
mid pack along the rail down the backstretch then began to flatten out on the far turn and needed rally in the end.

Footnotes
DEVILETTA drifted inwardly at the start and bumped foe, then pressed the pace down the backstretch, was in a steady drive on the far turn while being
confronted by outer foes, dug in gamely, then shook clear in the upper stretch to prevail in the end. MAGNOLIA AVENUE tracked the pace from the inside
down the backstretch, then urged steadily on the far turn to rally in the late stretch and got up for the place prize in the end. HONOR CAT was squeezed
back at the start, then settled towards the back while two wide, was gaining ground on the far turn while three wide and in a strong drive, gained command
briefly at the quarter pole, could not retain stride and gave way in the late stretch. CONNECTABLE broke inwardly and bumped foe, bid for the lead while
two wide before setting back to track the pace down the backstretch, then moved up to vie for the lead while three wide on the far turn then flattened out in
the stretch. METHODS raced mid pack along the rail in the early furlongs, then bid while three wide on the far turn and came up flat and empty in the end.
MIDNIGHT LADY was off slowly, was unhurried early then passed tired foe in the home stretch. STRIKE THE BELL set the pace heading into the first turn
and down the backstretch, was over powered by outer foes on the far turn then gave way in the home stretch. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION, the
rider of HONOR CAT claimed foul against DEVILETTA for interference at the start of the race. After reviewing the replay, CONNECTABLE was found to be
at fault for breaking in and impeding HONOR CAT, therefore no change was made to the order of finish.

OCELOT laid off the pace while three deep down the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn to take over the lead at the quarter pole then drew off in the
stretch to prove best overall. OLE CRAZY BONE tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn then
menaced in the upper stretch, gained second position but could not catch the cleared the leader in the end. CARLEA'S DREAM saved ground along the
inside in the early furlongs, remained at the back on the far turn before coming out three wide and rallied mildly in the stretch to get up for the show prize in
the end. COTTONWOOD went shoulder to shoulder with an outer foe in the early stages, then gained command heading into the far turn, was over taken by
OCELEOT at the quarter pole then gave way in the home stretch. TAP THE DOT was unhurried early and no threat. MAZUMA tracked the pace from the
inside at an even pace throughout and lacked rallying in the home stretch. NUMBER ONE DUDE was allowed to settle while two wide towards the back,
then bid four to five wide on the far turn and made no impact in the end. SHACKS WAY sparred with an inner foe heading into the first turn and down the
backstretch, then pressed the emerging leader on the far turn, was hard used and tired in the late stretch.

BIG BERNIE broke inwardly and bumped foe, then tracked the pace down the backstretch while two wide and outside of rival, then inched on the far turn to
battle for the lead while three wide in the late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. COSMO tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
remained well rated on the far turn, shifted out four wide then closed willingly down the late stretch and hung at the wire. MALIBU S S was forwardly place
while two wide into the first turn, then went shoulder to shoulder with an inner foe down the back stretch and into the far turn, dug in gamely at the top of the
stretch to battle between rivals and just missed victory in the end. GREATHEART was brushed at the start, led the way from the inside into the first turn,
sparred lightly with an outer foe down the backstretch and into the far turn, was confronted by more outer foes to go all out down the stretch and almost
lasted to the wire. MIDNIGHT PRANKS was pinched back at the start, was allowed to settle in the back duo while two wide, then moved up to rally gamely
on the far turn while four wide in attempt to gain the lead, was used up and flattened out in the stretch. CATDADDY was impeded at the start and was no
menace.

upper stretch, gained command momentarily at the eighth pole then was out finished by an outer foe in the end and held onto the show prize. MAYBE
DOLCIE was bumped at the start, then raced along the inside in the middle of the first flight of rivals, remained at moderate pace throughout the far turn,
then closed willingly down the lane but it was too late in the end. LEOPARD BAIT tracked the leader down the backstretch from the inside, was in a long
drive leaving the far turn then gave way in the late stretch. GYPSAN was allowed to settle towards the back along the inside, angled out four to five wide to
bid in the late stretch and came up empty. MARKET PROFILE broke outwardly then bumped foe, emerged to lead the way in the first turn, was well ahead
of the field to clear the far turn, then was used up and over powered by rivals in the home stretch and tired in the end. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL made no
impact in the end. GIRLS GOT GAME was no threat. CHAINSAW CITY veered outwardly and bumped rival and was no threat. OH DOO DAH DAY was
impeded at the start and failed to rally.

Footnotes
VINO TEXAS JESS pressed the pace while three wide, inched up on the turn to edge past the dueling rivals then drew off in the late stretch to prove best in
the end. FLYING CAESAR raced mid pack while two wide, was well rated on the turn before menacing in the upper stretch then kept on down the lane for
the place prize but did not have enough to catch the cleared leader. COMES THE SUN led the way while two wide then was confronted by an outer foe to
duel on the turn, then gave way in the lane and held onto the show prize in the end. RICH MOUNTAIN raced mid pack while three wide then rallied on the
turn and came up evenly in the stretch. ALL MIGHT stalked the pace from the inside early, then faded on the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. CANDY
BINDER was away well, then pressed the pace while five wide, moved up to duel with the pace setter on the turn while in a hard drive, was used up and
stopped in the stretch. DOC HENRY RIDGE settled at the back of the pack, bid while three wide on the turn and made no impact in the end. TRADE
TRAVELER veered outwardly at the start and was no threat in the end. UBSINGINTHEBLUES pressed the pace while four wide and in a hard drive then
flattened out on turn and had no final bid. TRAVEL GURU was no menace. JAMIAN drifted out at the start and failed to rally.

Footnotes
CHANGING TIMES emerged from the pack to lead the way from the inside, cleared the turn and was kept to task down the lane to prevail in the end.
BUREAUCRATIC chased the pace while three wide, gained second position on the turn while in a strong drive but did not have enough in the end to catch
the determined leader. TOOTHMAN was reserved along the rail at the back of the pack, bid on the turn to rally in the late stretch and was up for third place
in the end. CHROME CANDY chased the pace from the inside, then urged eagerly on the turn to menace in the upper stretch and just missed the show
prize in the end. NO MO WHINING settled at the back while two wide, was in between rivals then brushed outer foe, came out to the five path leaving the
bend to rally in the stretch but it was to no avail. DARING REASON chased the pace while two wide and in hard drive then flattened out on the turn and had
no final bid. TIGER BY THE TAIL settled back while three wide, then was brushed by an inner foe, then rallied leaving the turn and came up empty in the
end. LONE TREE raced mid pack while two wide, then dropped back on the turn and was no threat. TRIPPIN OVER TEXAS dwelted at the start and was no
factor. There was an INQUIRY in regards to TRIPPIN OVER TEXAS at the start of the race. After review, he was found to have hesitated in the gate at his
own accord and finished well behind the group in the end.

shifted out three wide then edge clear in the late stretch to succeed in the end. RUBY CANTU pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then
bid on the far turn in attempt to overcome the leader, lacked the winning bid and was out finished by an outer foe in the end. ON WING led the way into the
first turn to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, was in a long drive heading into the upper stretch then faltered in the final yards. ANGEL IN
