horses, challenged for the lead on the turn, vied to mid stretch, was no match late and finished second best. BY THE GLASS pressed the pace while racing
three across, angled in on the second turn, bid off the rail and closed steadily to earn show. OLD BAY stalked the pace along the inside, bid along the rail on
the turn to challenge, came up empty late and was outfinished for third. HUMOR SENSE was never far back and failed to menace in an even effort. DON'T
TELL KELLY lacked a bid in an outside trip and failed to threaten.

head at the start to be last away, lagged in an outside trip, closed steadily and was gaining ground. RECOGNIZE ME pressed the pace three across,
challenged between horses on the turn, fell back and went evenly late. LUCKY LORRAINE was unhurried early, saved ground to the stretch and offered a
mild bid to improve position. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL pressed the pace four wide, challenged three across on the turn, fell back and gave way.

Footnotes
AU PARADIS led around the first turn, vied inside, dueled in tight quarters through the stretch, exchanged bumps and proved best in a long drive. WORK
HARD moved up to challenge along the backstretch, dueled in tight quarters through the stretch, exchanged bumps and was outfinished in a good effort.
ZEVON was never far off the pace, closed steadily and was gaining late. BOLT D'PLATA raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn,
bid willingly to threaten, fell back, went evenly late and lost position. DELETED VIDEO stumbled at the start to be off slowly, was void of early speed, put in
a steady effort and improved position. RIGHTHERE RIGHTNOW stumbled at the start, lagged early, bid inside leaving the turn and came up empty. SAISIR
LE JOUR raced mid pack in an even effort and lacked a stretch response. The rider of WORK HARD lodged an objection against the rider of AU PARADIS
for alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made.

Footnotes
GROUP HUG broke slowly, rallied around the turn, closed willingly and got up near the wire. RUN POPPY set the pace with a clear lead, drifted out late and
was caught in the final strides. ACOUSTIC AVE dropped in on the turn, bid inside, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and settled for show. FINAL
VERDICT was never far back, raced outside, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. SWIFTY DEVIL chased the pace, bid off
the rail on the turn, leveled off in the drive and fell back. DILLINGER was slow early, went six wide leaving the turn and failed to rally. DARK TIMBER was
away alertly, showed speed to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
WILLY D'S was sent to the front, set the pace while rated to the far turn, drew off and was kept to task. MALINOIS raced in hand along the rail around the
first turn, stalked the pace along the inside to the second turn, shifted out, lacked a rally and held safely for place while no match for the winner. TAKE THE
PLEDGE advanced to the second turn, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to be along for show. MIDNIGHT AWARD was slow early, saved
ground, lacked a bid and passed tiring rivals. UNCLE TRULY stalked the pace, went five wide entering the stretch, tired and gave way. STREET ROCKIN
was through early, stopped, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
STAVROS tracked the early pace from along the inside, took control around the quarter pole, drifted out under a strong right hand, well clear when geared
down late. DUKE OF DOOLY took control around the first bend, unchallenged down the back side, was collard around the quarter pole by STAVROS,
stayed on well through the stretch, no match for the winner. MAGIC HOOH slow start, raced well off the early pace down the back stretch, came under a
very vigorous ride nearing the three eighths pole, evened out through the lane. KANE trailed the field down the backside, put in a bid around the second
bend, went by a couple of late faders. SETTE STELLE slow into stride, asked for energy around the second bend, failed to respond, and faded through the
stretch. WILD ALEX chased the pace from along the inside, weakened around the far turn, and never threatened.
