Footnotes
METEOR SHOWER was reserved off the early paced, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually
drew clear. NOMI LACKEE was bumped at the start by CHEDOODLE RYLEE then was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. SQUARE FUN prompted CHEDOODLE RYLEE while saving ground, slipped through during the drive and finished well in
a steady effort. MUMBLES BROCKMAN saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out four-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole but lacked a
rally. CHEDOODLE RYLEE broke in to bump NOMI LACKEE then set the pace racing slightly off the railed, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and weakened late. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.

steady effort. BOSSYBYNATURE saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through entering tje stretch and then went evenly late. SECRET

Footnotes
MARY WALKER saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased her advantage. WARREN'S MEMORABLE was prominently placed from the start,
came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. CIELO DIAMANTE was allowed to settle, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole and
rallied late. CLAY'S OPAL INDY was reserved off the pace, rallied sis-wide the final quarter and went evenly late. CRIMINAL RECORD was forwardly
placed while racing two-wide and weakened during the drive. PARCO saved ground chasing the winner but lacked a rally when asked. METAROSE settled
in the middle of the field while racing five-wide on the turn and tired. FOGGY BOTTOM dropped back while saving ground and was not a factor. DODROPIN
was unhurried while racing three-wide and failed to menace.
