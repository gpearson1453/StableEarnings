Footnotes
SENSIBLE JIM rated off the pace, swung wide rallying into the stretch then wore down leader in the final stages. SAILOR'S RETURN earned a narrow lead
outside, shook loose on the final turn, led to the late yards but was nailed. DAD'S ON A ROLL chased off the pace inside, moved very wide into stretch and
rallied. WYNN GIANT forced the pace outside then began weakening on the final turn. ET'S MAGIC MAN raced off the leaders inside and lacked a solid
rally. OMERTA CODE lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. PREDOMINATE dropped far behind and was never in contention. RUNNIN
JOKE stalked the dueling leaders three wide for half mile and gave way. IMAGINE THIS was urged off the pace outside and weakened steadily.

throughout and made a gradual gain in the stretch. EDGE OF GLORY fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide then offered some late energy.
SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE prompted the winner outside for three quarters and weakened. COLES CONUNDRUM broke in a complete tangle, rushed to
contention then faded. WHISKEY PRIZE moved close up briefly then lacked a response. BLUEY chased wide and gave way readily.

Footnotes
KISS ME HARDY prompted the pacesetter outside, angled inside the leader then edged off while kept to her task. DIVINE ROMANCE controlled the pace
inside, moved clear before the half, drifted out in the stretch and lost the advantage. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA saved ground off he pace then rallied mildly to
gain the show. RITAAN lacked speed outside and never menaced. GRYPHON'S WINGS trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS
dropped back along the inside and was never a factor. MOTITO raced within striking range three wide then stopped abruptly.

AMBITIOUSLY PLACED angled inside in the opening quarter, bid on the final turn, angled out in the stretch, collared the pacesetter and drew off eagerly in
the final furlong. SALAGADOOLA trailed far behind, rallied wide and was up for the place in the final yards. SUMMARY JUDGMENT sprinted away to long
lead for half a mile, was collared by the winner and weakened in the stretch. UNADULTERATED chased three wide behind the loose pacesetter and lacked
a rally. HELEONORTIZ saved ground far behind and was never a factor. ABIDALE was urged off the pace, moved inside on the final turn and retreated.

VOODOO YOU DO vied outside, took over near the three eighths pole then pulled away in the stretch under moderate urging. EMILY'S ON FIRE well
placed outside, went after the winner on the turn and was easily second best. BOSSY KATE saved ground off the leaders and finished willingly to hold third.
KINDRED HEARTS dropped back early then advanced inside with some late energy. LERETHA broke alertly and chased wide then flattened out in the
stretch. SHE LOVES MUNNY chased off the leaders outside, moved very wide on the turn and stretch. MIKEY'S SONG lacked speed outside and was
always outrun. SHE'SALLATWITTER trailed to the stretch then caught a stopping rival. BE MY QUEEN hustled to a narrow advantage in the opening

CONFIRMED GENIUS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over near midstretch and drew off while geared down late. BUCKS SOME settled off
the pace outside, bid five wide into the stretch and was up for the place. CASTILLEJA was urged close up outside and continued willingly to the finish. OUR
UPTOWN GIRL saved ground, moved closer on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. MATTY BO hustled to clear lead early, was collared into the
stretch and weakened. SNAPPY RIDE trailed early racing wide and lacked a solid rally. TAKE IT TO THE MAX stumbled at the start, chased off the pace
and was no factor.
