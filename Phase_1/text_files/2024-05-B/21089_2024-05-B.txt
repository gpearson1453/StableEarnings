Footnotes
OUR ANDREW B settled inside, awaited room then rallied in the stretch and was up in the final strides. BOOM BOOM KABOOM stalked the pace outside,
led after half a mile, remained clear in midstretch but was nailed at the wire. FINANCIAL STRENGTH lacked speed then advanced outside with good late
energy. CHIPPEWA BUD chased just off the leaders, had his heels clipped near the eighth pole. DISTURBED trailed racing very wide then narrowed gap
too late. KATIE'S NOTION chased wide, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened out. ALMOND CIDER quickly moved clear, was collared on the turn,
came out in midstretch causinjg rival to clip heels. SPELLED WELL was bumped about after the start then never a factor. TOUGH WORKOUT prompted
pace early, clipped heels and fell near the eighth pole. Following a stewards inquiry, ALMOND CIDER was disqualified and placed last for causing spill in
stretch.

Footnotes
NURSE CARALYN trailed far behind, circled rivals on the turn, surged in the stretch and was just up. ECHO LAKE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock,
broke slowly, vied inside and continued well in a game try. WHISKEYSTREETBLUES advanced strongly four wide on the turn, led briefly but was
outfinished. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY moved close up outside for half a mile and gradually weakened. CATALINA NINA angled inside on the turn then
flattened out in the stretch. NORHO'S GAMBLE led narrowly in the two path then faded after half a mile. THE LAST JET prompted the pace three wide early
then stopped abruptly.

CRYPT trailed early, advanced near the inside then closed strongly catching the pacesetters and moving clear late. HIBACHI dropped well behind, trailed
before half a mile, offered a strong wide rally too late. MISCHIEVOUS JONES stalked the pace outside, rallied and finished willingly to gain the show.
JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT pursued the loose pacesetter, took over drifting wide and tired late. MEGA CHARLIE hustled to the front, drifted very wide into the
stretch and faded. DIXIE CANNONBALL flashed speed inside then gave way readily. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN moved within striking range early then stopped
abruptly.

FAST MULE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over when ready at the quarter pole and drew away with energy to spare. LULI'S DANCER
moved close up inside and offered a gradual late gain while no threat to the winner. DIXIE GROOVE settled well off the leaders inside and rallied mildly
through the stretch. SIRENETTA trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. PHANCY PHILLY hustled to a clear lead for half mile, was collared on the final
turn and faded. VANISHING FAITH reserved off the leaders, made a brief bid into the far turn then gave way.

behind then caught rivals without menacing. WE BE THERE offered brief bid outside into the far turn then faded. HURRICANE HIGHWAY lagged far behind
and was never in contention. COBBLE ROAD saved ground off the pace and gave way on the final turn.

Footnotes
EMPRESS DEONA set a measured pace inside, held a narrow lead into the lane and gamely held off late challenges. MS. BUCCHERO pressed the winner
throughout, bid on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. DREAM CHASER raced off the leaders inside and made a gradual gain in the
stretch. MAJESTIC CREED lagged far behind, chased inside and was no factor. DRIFAROS was urged just off the pace outside and was finished before
half a mile.

Footnotes
BEREN settled inside the dueling pacesetters, angled out in the stretch, offered a late surge and was up in time. TWISTED RIDE alternated for the lead
inside in a heated duel, led in midstretch and battled very gamely to the wire. SCARAMOUCHE hustled to the front in the two path, vied to the final furlong
and weakened slightly. ONE MORE SCOOP lacked speed and trailed early, swung wide in the stretch and rallied. BOURBON MUSIC prompted the pace
three wide, reached near even terms after the half then faltered late. FACTOR IT IN raced off the pace outside, moved closer on the turn then tired.
GORDIAN KNOT dropped well off the pace chasing wide and was never a factor.

LEAN ON E broke alertly and dropped back, rallied very wide and surged late to move clear. LUNA T settled off the pace inside then closed well in the final
furlong. AWESOME PAL prompted the pace outside and continued willingly to the finish. SCINTILLATING STAR saved ground close up and raced evenly
through the stretch. GIA'S FUEGO was urged just off the leaders, drifted in stretch and continued well. MORE RANSOM lacked speed, moved wide in the
stretch with some late energy. AFLEET DIVA controlled the pace to the final furlong and weakened. MS. MALEVOLENCE dropped back early and was
never in contention. BOSS CARA trailed most of the trip and caught fading rival late. SEVEN YEARS LATER offered four wide bid on the turn then stopped
in the stretch.
