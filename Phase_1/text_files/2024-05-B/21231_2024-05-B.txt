Footnotes
RUSTY'S SUNRISE raced closest to the leader while off the rail, advanced and engaged that one when straightened for home, finally wore that same foe
down late to take control then was fully extended to hold the runner up safe late. BROADWAY STAR lacked early foot, began to move far turn, rallied four
wide into the stretch, late push at the winner to rapidly close the gap late from the outside, narrowly missed. ASPEN LINK away in good order, set a
moderate set of early fractions while in hand, continued to rate into the far turn, responded when confronted by the winner in upper stretch, gave ground
grudgingly to that one until late, could not contain the runner up while preserving the show. BETSY'S ALL IN last to leave, continued to lack speed in trailing
early, called on for some run into the lane and displayed some mild late interest through some traffic to improve position. OUR GAL LAYLA within striking
distance along the inside, continued to stalk into the far turn, had little for the drive when called on for run midway on the final bend. BABY JANE settled off
the pace while racing on the outside in the first turn, backed up in the stretch. LOCO BARN SENORITA fell back to trail after the start and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
LAWLESS TIMES pressed the leader though some leisurely fractions, continued to apply pressure into and through the final turn, bid between foes in upper
stretch, gained the advantage and edged clear under steady handling. CRAFTROOM forwardly placed just outside the winner, continued in that forward
position through the second bend, challenged three wide, could not match the winner late while holding sway for the place. PORTO DEL ACE settled off the
early pace while racing toward the inside, asked along into the lane, split foes past the furlong marker, up for the show. GIANT TUDE toward the front while
four wide through the first turn, continued to race evenly paced second turn, outkicked late for the show. GRAEME'S DEAL back off the pace and the inside,
came four wide for the drive, lugged in badly in midstretch to bother SECRET GUITAR, finished up evenly after being straightened. SECRET GUITAR
settled off the pace while racing three wide most of the way, bothered by a lugging GRAEME'S DEAL a furlong out and also finished up in even fashion after
recovering. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA took control after the start, set a soft pace along the inside, offered brief resistance to her two closest pursuers in upper
stretch, gave way badly to stop the final furlong. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, GRAEME'S DEAL WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED SIXTH.

COUNTRY CHOICE lacked speed off the inside, came four wide for the drive, lugged in repeatedly past midstretch, one last push to be up in time.
FLASHIN CHIP broke in a bit, stalked the dueling leaders from the outside up the backstetch and into the turn three wide bid when straightened for home,
took over, led late, nailed final strides. QUICK ZONG dueled in the two path, continued to alternate up front into and through the turn, weakened a bit from
between horses the final furlong, saved the show. SEEKING A SOLDIER back off the pace, steered out four wide in upper stretch, displayed a modest
amount of late interest to improve a bit, no real threat. INGLIS broke alertly, dueled up front while closest to the inside, weakened through the stretch.
KNIGHT'S GOLD broke in, lacked speed, fell back to trail and was finished early. THE BOYZ REAL DEAL lacked speed while saving ground, failed to
muster a rally to trail home.

Footnotes
GAME AND GORMLEY off slow, void of any early foot for six furlongs, began a strong five wide move midway on the final turn, continued to advance
through upper stretch, drifted a bid past the furlong marker, bid, dueled deep stretch, drifted a bit move late while proving narrowly best in a determined
effort. MONOLITH in the second flight while off the inside, advanced and challenged in the second turn, dueled into the lane, put that rival away past the
furlong marker, responded when the winner came calling soon after, proved stubborn to the end while also drifting a bit. KEE JEE mid pack toward rail,
checked up behind a faltering rival second turn, displayed some belated interest to annex the show, no threat to the top pair. STRONG DIAMOND off slowly,
raced back out of the chute, moved out, early advance four wide the middle part, continued four wide while within striking distance second turn, flattened out
a bit in the drive to finish up evenly. KAH NIGH got out a bit in the first turn when dueling, continued to contest the issue up the backstraight, larger lead,
second duel inside the runner up into the lane, weakened in the late going to lose a couple of positions. LEGENDARY DRAGON went one paced off the
inside in lacking a closing response. CONTRABAND EARLY off the pace in mid pack much of the early going, failed to muster a rally. ITZCOATL finished
early. BREAKING STAR dueled up front along the inside, first to blink far turn, stopped, trailed home.

Footnotes
SONO away in good order, raced within striking distance, steered four wide late turn, outside bid soon after, slight brush, drew clear under firm handling
while drifting a bit. LIGHTNING STRUCK lacked early foot, came on the outside for the drive, displayed some good late energy to be in time for the place.
SILVER WINGS outrun early, made a steady advance into contention on the outside through the turn, took over, came out a bit to brush slightly with the
winner upper stretch, outkicked by that one late before losing the place in the final strides. COPTER forwardly placed off the inside, crept a bit closer while
between horses into the lane, went flat the final furlong in lacking a winning punch. ALLEVA void of speed for a half, passed a couple of tiring rivals after the
issue had been decided. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. moved up to be forwardly placed inside soon after the start, boxed in along the rail with a half mile
remaining, continued covered up early turn, between foes for the drive, came up empty the final furlong. MY MAN FLINTSTONE broke alertly, cleared to the
inside, set the pace four almost four furlongs, stopped when headed entering the stretch.

Footnotes
BELLO CREEDO dueled first turn, shook clear onto the backstretch, rated kindly in the run into the final turn, set down into the stretch, responded and found
more when confronted soon after, held that same foe safe late under firm handling. TOTALLY ADDICTED broke back, lacked speed while moving out,
ranged up to challenge four wide in the second turn, went after the leader into the stretch from the outside, repelled, came again late to miss. STONE
ALLIANCE in the second flight behind the two leaders early, lost some position far turn, came three wide for the drive, went evenly through the lane to prove
best of the rest while no threat to the top pair. HOLIDAY DIAMOND lacked speed inside, steered out turning for home, lacked a serious closing response.
POINT AT YOU dueled early with the winner, fell back to chase the middle half mile, gave way in the drive. XIETELEHUAS last to leave, continued
sluggishly to trail throughout.

Footnotes
GIVEMEASECOND prompted the issue up the backstretch in the three path, remained in striking position in that slot through the turn, roused for the drive,
displayed good energy through the stretch to be pulling away at the end in a promising debut. ALVARADO CAT vied up front in the two path, continued to
duel through the turn, could not match strides with the winner late, proved determined for the place. CHAD'S FLASHY WAYS with the pace from the start
inside, dueled through the turn, also proved no match for the winner late, outkicked for the second spot. PENNYS DEAL popped stall doors, went one paced
throughout while four wide through the turn in lacking a closing response. VERMILION BAY settled in mid pack, also went flat through the stretch.
CAPTIVATING STAR failed to menace while racing in the two path. RUN DADDY RUN also failed to make an impact in the two path. ALINES VALENTINE
veered out at the break, remained always back to be outrun.

Footnotes
MATZOH BALL with the early pace four wide, gained the advantage three wide midway on the turn, clear into the stretch, maintained a comfortable
advantage to the wire to win ridden out. TOP PRIORITY set or forced the pace for three furlongs, no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the
place. FLAT OUT RUNNER void of any speed for three furlongs, came four wide for the drive, found best stride too late while clear for the show late.
REGINALD AURELIUS slipped at the start to be off a step slow, advance four wide through the turn, continued with some mild interest through the lane.
PAL'S ALARM settled off the early pace while racing inside, improved position upper stretch then flattened out without posing a serious threat. LEISURELY
with the pace while three wide the opening furlong, checked out early from between horses. ZOEY'S HIPPIE vied up front while between horses early then
began to weaken in the far turn. STORMIN SUNDAY was always outrun while angling out five wide late in the turn. PER LOUISIANA RACING
COMMISSION RULING 25428, MATZOH BALL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A MEDICATION VIOLATION.
