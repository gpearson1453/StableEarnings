steadied late to avoid horse and rider. MICHIGAN LEFT raced evenly. TWO STEP JAKE brushed the gate and was impeded at the start, rushed up inside

Footnotes
NOBRAG JUSTFACT stalked the pace in the two path, bid in the five path on the far turn and was in time under a strong hand ride. SHADY MCGEE (IRE)
was unrushed early, then rallied belatedly inside at the top of the stretch and just missed. RICOCHET stalked the pace inside, bid in the three path at the
three-eighths pole and was outfinished. EPIMYTHIUM stalked the pace in the two path, bid at the three-eighths pole while in the four path and yielded late.
CAPTAIN PARTY was off awkwardly and stalked the pace inside, bid at the three-sixteenths pole, then faltered. GAMER was fractious in the gate, raced in
the five path and bid belatedly. MAJOR SPARKS raced well back, saved ground and closed in the stretch. DOG RED was bumped at the start, raced
between foes but had no bid. FEAR AND LOATHING raced in the three path through the stretch and faded. VERSATILE was clear early and gave way
inside.
