Footnotes
CELENTANO had a good set up, nestled on the fence all alone watching the embattled pair at the half, waited patiently on the fence through the turn,
swung four wide outside horses to loom boldly at the top of the stretch and drew off convincingly in the last eighth. BACKROADSBILLY had a sluggish start
to begin, made an early move inside foes at the seven sixteenths marker, shifted outwards with three eighths to go, was full of run while in hand circling foes
at the quarter pole, briefly took command in upper stretch, could not sustain the run and was no match for the winner in the late stages of the race.
IMPERIAL STAR brushed the outside of the gate on the break, stalked three wide outside runners down the backside having one foe beaten, angled to the
inside making a rail move on the turn, swung out off the tiring early engaged leaders turning for home and ran on the be a clear but distant third at the wire.
FRAC RIGHT had a slim advantage on the fence down the backside, dueled up front inside through the turn, was part of the mix clinging up top at the
quarter pole and faded on the rail saving for a minor role in the end. UNCLE'S THE BANKER tracked the leaders early on, was checked mildly entering the
turn, lost ground and position around the bend and finished up willingly in deep stretch. HE SHOOTS HE WINS pressed the pace outside down the
backstretch, continued to battle head and head outside around the bend, stayed in the hunt in the two path between runners turning for home but wilted in
the final sixteenth. INDY COWBOY was unhurried trailing the field along the backside, could not get into contention when roused throughout the turn and
was a non-factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
SMOKEN CHLOE was quite content to track the early speedster down the backside, began to reel in, measuring the frontrunner at the three furlong pole,
closed in by the quarter marker and was going away for the score in the final furlong. STORMY OCEAN hopped on the break, started to pass individuals
advancing inside midpoint on the turn, shifted out with momentum in the four path at the top of the lane and closed belatedly to be the rest. GHOSTLY
PERFECTION was situated on the fence in the third flight down the backside, was scrubbed on midway through the bend closing the gap on the leader,
shifted out with run three wide for the drive and rallied late to get up for third in a tight photo at the wire. MO TWILIGHT was loose on the lead early on,
extended the advantage by the half, continued alone up front through the turn, was still up top but by a diminishing margin turning for home and was
engulfed by runners in deep stretch just being caught at the finish for third. IRON PRINCESS stalked in the two path with runners on each side in the third
flight by the half, was urged to go on with five sixteenths from home, could not quicken with others making a move and failed to menace in the drive to the
wire. TEXENSIS broke in the air to start, improved on the outside of rivals down the backstretch, was then urged for more going three wide on the turn three
eighths from home, swung out widest in the sixth path for the drive but was empty. POWAQA was allowed to settle, trailing down the backstretch, could not
get into gear throughout the turn and passed one weary rival. SIX FOR A NINE was situated in mid-pack while in hand between horses down the back
straight, came under a ride when asked right handed with three eighths to go, offered little response and retreated by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S ROMANCE stalked near the rear on the fence under a snug hold, patiently waited for her que going comfortably down the backside, angled out
four wide at the three eighths marker swooping around rivals to bid for the lead and determinedly won the stretch duel for the win. MAKE NO MISTAKE
tracked on the rail into the first turn, had a good spot rating kindly on the rail behind the pacesetter down the backside, quickly moved to the lead on the
fence getting a rail seam at the quarter pole and stubbornly fought inside to the wire just losing the battle in the end. ERASMO'S GIRL tracked between
horses in the two path early on, settled in midfield down the back straight, was roused four wide outside horses at the quarter pole and was edging closer to
the top pair in deep stretch to be a non threatening third in the end. LADY IN RED was alone up front setting the pace, repelled the early foe down the
backside, was collared on either side at the quarter pole, could not go on with the leaders turning for home but stayed on to be a fringe player at the wire.
BAYOU BELLE had her head turned missing the break at the start, made an early move around foes four wide in the first turn, pressured the pace mildly
chasing down the backstretch, could not go on and yielded between foes by the quarter pole. EMERALD LAKE tracked three wide between runners on the
first turn, had one rival beaten down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn but lacked a rally down the lane. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was never
involved trailing throughout.

Footnotes
SEATTLE SIGNAL cleared to the lead from the outside post quite comfortably, was nursed along alone setting the pace on the turn and had more left for the
drive to keep the chasing rival at the bay late. FEDALINE tracked the pacesetter down the backside, chased the loose frontrunner who was going easily up
top around the oval and never gave up to the finish, inching closer in deep stretch but could not threaten at the wire. T'PRING broke inwards at the start,
stalked outside in mid-division along the backside, started to pick up runners circling four wide by the quarter pole and won the show battle being a distant
third at the wire. HAYEK was in a good spot watching the top two down the backside, tried to keep up with the front pair while coming under a ride around
the turn and faded in deep stretch to just save for a minor share. ORIGINAL ME travelled in mid-pack between runners down the back straight, was roused
with five sixteenths to go keeping pace around the bend, shifted inwards to the rail at the furlong marker but needed more late to pose a threat crossing the
finish line. BLONDE DYNAMO bobbled on the break to settle near the rear in the early going, could not make any progress trying to go inside on the rail
through the turn, lost its path on the fence just before straightening out for the drive and showed little under mild urging to the wire. SPEEDY JOHNY was
void of speed, trailing down the backside, made no headway running through the turn and passed a weary foe in deep stretch. GRADEVOLE was situated
on the fence in midfield, closed the gap on the leaders improving on the rail by the three eighths marker but had little left for the stretch run and stopped in
the last furlong.

Footnotes
PEACH COBBLER broke outwardly a bit bumping with a rival, settled stalking just off the leading pair four wide into the turn, floated out a bit leaving the turn
now under a drive, rallied about six to seven wide in the stretch to strike the lead seventy yards from home and drive clear. BLAZING SKY broke just a hair
slowly, was lacing significant early speed, raced inside up the backstretch. GIVE ME THE BOOTS stalked the early leader, ranged up alongside past the
quarter pole, bid at the three-sixteenths, evened out but kept on well enough despite drifting out to get the nod for show. SUMMER SNOW was coaxed clear
to set the pace inside just off the rail, was challenged turning for home, turned back the nearest rival by mid-stretch but was simply outkicked and lost the
nod for show as well. GIZMO'S B F F settled off the leaders, was caught five then six wide on the turn fanning deeper still for the drive, kept on mildly but
needed more. LOIS LEN chased from between foes mid-pack but was one-paced and made no bid. AMERICAN GAMBLE bumped with a rival at the start,
stalked mid-pack outside, went five wide on the turn, was up close coming past the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch. HARD TO CAPTURE lacked
early speed, swung nine deep, failed to threaten. DEMURELY chased from inside, faded.

Footnotes
FINAL DRAFT settled into stride near the rear, stalked while patiently handled outside runners in the third flight on the turn, began to inch closer four wide
outside foes at the quarter pole, loomed the threat widest at the top of the stretch and when set down at the furlong pole drew off comfortably late to win
going away when crossing the finish line. PAINTED GLORY was in tight surroundings when the field bunched up at the half, stalked inside in the third flight
with the eventual winner just to her outside running on the turn, rallied inside of runners at the quarter pole and finished up strongly getting up for the place
share in deep stretch. MRS. C emerged with the lead from the outside down the back straight, edged clear getting to the fence by the half, set a moderate
pace up front on the turn, opened up mildly turning for home but could not hold off the fast approaching closers in the final sixteenth. CATE'S CHARM broke
outwards on the break, pressed the pace inside early on, was throttled down on the rail at the half, angled off the fence when nudged on for more with five
sixteenths remaining to be in the hunt between horses in the three path at the top of the lane but could not offer a finish in the final furlong. ALL FOR
HONOR hopped slightly brushing the gate to trail after the start, caught up to runners three deep outside by the half, continued three wide making little
impression going around the oval, shifted inwards to the rail for the drive but could not be a factor. PRINCESSONAMISSION chased the pace outside down
the backstretch and around the bend, could not maintain position when ridden for more by mid-turn and backed away through the field between rivals in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
STANLEY HOUSE tracked between horses in the beginning, was smartly reined back watching the front two while all alone down the backside, moved
smartly to the leaders three wide at the three furlong marker, seized control outside with a quarter left to run and was kept to the task to the finish to prevail
in a tight photo from the stablemate. COOL KISS stalked near the rear in the beginning, inched closer on the rail four furlongs from home, waited behind the
contesting trio three furlongs from the prize, followed the path set by the eventual winner opting to shift out off the tiring early leaders at the quarter pole,
switched leads late while drifting through the lane and found another gear in deep stretch just missing timing the nod at the wire for the win. ON THIN ICE
hesitated at the start, trailing into the first turn, was quite content to still see the field at the half and throughout the final turn, found a seam getting clear
running room in the two path by mid-stretch, burst between rivals late and surged to be involved at the wire. LAC MACAZA tracked two wide on the outside
early on, took closer order forcing the pace into the back straight, was repelled by the half, re-engaged on the outside to poke his head in front between
runners three furlongs from home and could not find more late, stalling in the last furlong. AHA MOMENT took command from the onset, was pressed briefly
outside entering the backstretch, opened up by the half to be alone up top again, was collared outside by runners with three eighths remaining, fought on
when urged for more inside until mid-stretch and gave way in the last sixteenth. STONE AGE (IRE) stalked three wide on the outside into the first turn,
continued three deep outside having one foe beaten down the backstretch, made a brief run four wide midway on the turn but soon afterwards had little left
to give and gave way retreating by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
CANADIAN AVRO contested for the lead outside down the back straight, quickly put away the pesky early speed foe by the five sixteenths marker, opened
up at will at the top of the lane and coasted home for the dominant win. ASHUKA was pinched on the break, recouped to travel in mid-pack down the
backstretch, was roused between runners lengthening stride at the quarter pole and rallied four wide to be a distant second behind the runaway winner.
PLAY THE DOTS had a good position all by himself watching the embattled pair down the backside and into the turn, was no match for the winner while
trying to keep up turning for home and lost the fight for the place share being caught in the final few strides before the wire. RED IN FRONT stalked inside
runners in the two path down the backside close to the rear, started to put in a run picking up rivals inside on the rail through the turn, shifted out to the four
path for the stretch drive and willingly finished up for a minor role. SUGAR IT'S ELI stalked three deep near the rear outside rivals, made little progress
travelling outside three wide on the oval, was fanned out in the six path widest of runners at the top of the lane and could not offer a rally to the wire.
GLORIOUS REVENGE battled for the lead on the rail in the backstretch, could no quicken with the winner by mid-turn, had little left to give for the stretch
run and retreated inside at the sixteenth pole. HIGHLAND ROCKY broke inwards hitting the gate on the start, trailed the field at the half, could not get
interested at the rear through the turn and closed the gap but could not pick up runners in the stretch running.
