Footnotes
CIGAR VAN stalked the pace from between rivals four wide in to the turn, steadily rallied to gain ground on the pacesetters, wore them down in deep stretch
and held the closer safe at the wire. HARPES HILL tracked the leaders from five wide through the turn, rallied well in the stretch finding best stride late to be
gaining with every stride late. FAMILY CREED dueled on the lead from between horses early, continued to battle gamely from the fence to mid-stretch and
was outkicked late in the drive. SKIPPA pressed the pace to the top of the lane and weakened. HALF MAGIC was a step slow a few strides from the gate to
trail early, was hustled up to contention down the backstretch and finished evenly. ORDER UP flashed brief speed up the rail and gave way entering the
turn. HEZA SEXY ZONG was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOTTATAKEHIMTO slow early to trail into the first turn, gained position up the fence down the backside, waited patiently on the final bend while saving
ground, tipped out two wide splitting rivals turning for home and closed best of all in a blanket finish. IT'S A BIRD unhurried for the first half mile to trail the
field, closed ground on the turn rallying five wide and was gaining through the lane to come up just short in a good effort. QUARTER RAT prompted the
pace the entire trip, made a three wide bid turn for home and was outfinished in the final strides. PAYOFF CYCLE set the pace under mild pressure to the
quarter pole, responded for the drive and weakened late in the lane. INSPECTOR ED well placed tracking the pace from three wide to the head of the lane
and gave way down the stretch. CAJUN CONNECTION was eased at the quarter pole and vanned off.

MUCHO MARVIN rated off the pace, made a steady advance from five wide on the turn to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and drew clear to the wire. HIS
GIANT pressed the pace to he bend, briefly took the lead nearing the quarter pole and kept-on with good energy to regain the place. MCLEAN settled in
hand early to trail, made a bold move on the turn to take command in upper stretch and failed to sustain the rally down the lane. SUN SQUALL went evenly
without being a threat. SLITHER dueled fro the rail for a half and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALLER VITE tracked the pace from a clear pocket to midway on the turn, rallied four wide with a blitz to take command turning for home and drew clear
unchallenged in the lane. INVOLVEDNTERACTION unhurried for the first half, split rivals in upper stretch with a belated bid to gain the place. GLORIA'S
BOY slow early to be athe the rear of the field, ranged up six wide to loom in upper stretch and failed to sustain the rally down the lane. APRIORITY
ROCKET sped to the lead from the outside post, briefly opened a clear advantage on the turn and weakened coming home. COLE'S SENSATION broke a
step slow to be the early trailer and showed some late interest. I NITA WARRIOR rated in mid-apck down the backside, made a mild bid to upper stretch
and finished evenly. STYLING HOOK contende for a half and faded. MY LITTLE VISION prompted the pace to midway on the turn and came up empty.
YOCKEY DOODLEDANDY saved ground through the turn to no avail. BITSY'S STAR chased the leaders and gave way.

RACY BILLE took command into the first turn, opened a clear lead through the first turn, set a well rated, well managed pace, responded when called upon
at the top of the lane and pulled away without challenge. MO CREDO broke a step slow to trail, remained unhurried for a half, and made a steady rally to be
second best. WOOD RIVER tracked the leaders for the entire trip and rallied mildly to be along for the show. RUN ON ACES prompted the pace for
three-quarters of a mile and weakened in the stretch. JOEY'S LIGHTENING failed to meance. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN was not a threat passing tiring
rivals in the lane. I DON'T VENMO made a middle move to be well place after a half and flattened out. EL DEAL ME ACES contended early and steadily
gave way.

JET ROCKET stalked the pace to midway on the turn, tipped out three wide splitting rivals to engage the leader at the top of the lane and drew away as
much best having been geared down late in the lane. CUSTOM SUNSHINE tracked the pace from three wide to upper stretch, angledi n for the drive and
kept grinding to gain the place. CUSTOM PUNCH set the pace to the top of the stretch, had no response when challenged by the winner and weakened
through the stretch. MOLTO VINO went evenly not posing a threat. TAKE HER AWAY trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
ALEX JOON stalked the pacesetters from the fence into the far turn, waited patiently for racing room on the bend, rallied in a drive up the fence down the
stretch to prevail in final hundred yards. FORTUITY dueled on the lead for three-quarters, responded when called upon turning for home, drifted off the rail
in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner in a game effort. KENTUCKY GHOST pressed the pace the entire way, battled with
the runner-up down the stretch and was outkicked by the top pair in a good try. SEDUCTIVE U S A slow early to be the trailer, rallied up the backside to be
in contention and flattened out. EL ORIENTE (CHI) tracked the leaders from three wide to the far turn, lacked a response when called upon and faded in the
lane.

Footnotes
DEAL ME A PENNY unhurried in the early going, circled six wide turning for home and closed well down the outside to be going away in deep stretch. MY
LUCKY BREAK pressed the pace the entire way, made a bid for the lead in upper stretch while drifting out into the path of SWEET LITTLE ROSE and
kept-on down the lane unable to go with the winner. COPPER MOON set a pressured pace, responded when challenged in upper stretch and was
out-finished late in the drive. RUN NATALIE RUN tracked the pace from four wide through the turn, loomed in upper stretch and was outkicked down the
lane. SWEET LITTLE ROSE reserved off the pace to the quarter pole, rallied from three wide at the top of the lane, was taken up midway down the stertch
when
rival
drifted
into
her
path,
angled
in
upon
being
gathered
up
and
finished
with
mild
interest.
CHERRY
STAR
failed
to
menace.
NATURALBORNSENDER raced in contention for a hlaf and stopped in mid-stretch. CRYPTO BRAVE showed brief speed to be well palced for the first
quarter, dropped to the rear of the field on the turn and was not a threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON
REVIEW DISQUALIFIED MY LUCKY BREAK FROM SECOND TO FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE WITH SWEET LITTLE ROSE.
