dueled to mid stretch and finished gamely while no match for the winner. LA TACHE raced near the inner rail while stalking the pace down the backstretch
and into the far turn, eased out three wide turning for home, had aim on the lead in mid stretch then gave way. MAJOR HOULIHAN showed speed along the
inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch then gave way. MILLROSE , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the far turn, swung wide in
upper stretch and rallied mildly. FIVECOMMATWO bore in pinching back MILLROSE leaving the starting gate then lost ground on both turns. BELIEVE IN

Footnotes
SUPER NEEDY had speed outside foes then cleared leaving the five eighths, set the pace two wide into the lane, drifted in slightly near the three
sixteenths, quickly corrected, kept on under stout encouragement through the final furlong and prevailed. RIGHT QUICK edged up two wide under rating
early on and stalked, angled out around the turn, circled four wide under a ride into the lane, leveled off to his best stride inside the furlong ground but was
unable to reel in the winner. FIERCE COMPETITION was put to asking soon after the break and moved up to the inside of rivals to prompt, maintained
position under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, was in a bit close in upper stretch, regrouped to give hard chase past the furlong grounds and kept on
with effort. SOMETIMES I DO had speed to the inside of the winner then was rated back off that one near the five eighths, stalked three wide around the
turn, failed to kick on under pressure past mid stretch and weakened. RESCUE THAT GIRL , sluggish from the gate, was ridden along three to four wide
past the five sixteenths but failed to respond.

ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN saved ground chasing the pace, eased outside PSYCHEDELIC SHACK near the eighth pole, overtook that one and drove clear.
PSYCHEDELIC SHACK broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. SUE LOVES BARBADOS
lacked speed behind horses on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly outside foes. E. P. MILTON raced near the rail on the
turn, worked between horses in the stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. FREESTANDING , four wide on the turn, flattened out. BOURBON
CURRENCY raced near the inner rail and weakened. SECRETARY AT WAR , swung wide in upper stretch, was no factor. SOUTHERN LAD , four wide
leaving the backstretch, chased the pace and gave way. LOADED SNIPER trailed.

Footnotes
RAD PAISLEY cleared early, rated kindly towards the inner rail, opened up after being set down in upper stretch, kept on under strong encouragement past
mid stretch then held firm. AEQUOR settled off the pace and off the inside, eased out to advance between foes into the lane, straightened away while about
four wide and finished strong to bridge the gap. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE , sluggish from the gate, dropped far back early, angled five wide for the drive and
closed steadily. ADDY'S LADDY T N T stalked three wide, edged a bit closer mid turn, chased to mid stretch then faded. DATS MR. MO , four wide in range
near the half, dropped to the inner rail leaving the three eighths, continued inside with pursuit in upper stretch but came up empty. BALI'S SHADE angled off
the inside early and stalked two wide, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. HEADS OR TAILS lost ground five wide outside rivals,
was under a ride mid turn, shifted out six to seven wide in upper stretch then faltered through the final furlong.

Footnotes
LENAMAGNETTA set the pace, opened up turning for home and prevailed under pressure. SHARED AUTHORITY , rank and checked behind horses down
the backstretch, steadied lacking room near the three sixteenths pole and closed late. LA BEFANA lacked speed, raced inside horses throughout and
rallied. PRINCESS LUCIA trailed to the stretch, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. BANANA SPLIT lacked speed, saved
ground on the turn and passed tired horses. CHALICE chased the pace outside the winner and gave way. GANBATTE , a forward factor along the inner rail
around the turn, gave way. MUNNIS PRETTY raced outside horses and was no factor. LADY EDNA , four wide on the turn, gave way. CELTIC BOND ,
reluctant to load into the starting gate, was jostled at the start, chased the pace outside horses and faltered.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CHARM edged up three wide to be close past the half, was patiently handled mid turn, knifed her way between runners approaching the stretch
then shifted out five wide, forged clear under left handed asks in mid stretch then steadily pulled away while kept to task. SOCIETY BALL broke a step slow,
recovered and was nudged up between rivals, dropped in past the five eighths and rated close, threatened to the inside of the leader mid turn, forced the
issue into the lane then kept on with good effort to earn the place. TOUISSET was nudged clear early and set the pace removed from the inside, met an
inside bid mid turn then spurted back clear after a half, failed to contain the winner's outside surge nearing mid stretch, drifted out and gave way grudgingly.
I CAN DO IT , urged in the clear leaving the far turn, angled five wide into the lane and churned on without really threatening. SPARKLE SPRINKLE
prompted the pace four wide outside rivals, failed to kick on under asking nearing the lane then tired in mid stretch. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA dropped off the
pace while saving ground and failed to get on track.

Footnotes
HIT THE ROAD BRAT , patiently handled along the inner rail, advanced in upper stretch, swung out near the eighth pole, closed, led late and drove clear.
HOLLYWOODLAND , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was clear in mid stretch and tired late. MEXICAN SUGAR , three wide both turns,
chased the pace and failed to rally. LA FANTASMA , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four wide and passed tired horses. VIRTUAL prompted the
pace outside HOLLYWOODLAND and weakened through the stretch. DIAMOND'S CABARET , well placed in the two path between horses leaving the
backstretch and around the far turn, weakened inside horses in the drive. BISCUIT , briefly steadied in narrow quarters along the inner rail entering the first
turn, was not a factor. PINSTRIPEPIZZO raced along the inner rail on the far turn and through the stretch and weakened. SMOOCHING trailed.
