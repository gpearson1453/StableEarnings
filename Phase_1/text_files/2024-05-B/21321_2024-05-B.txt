Footnotes
JUNIPER JUICE , bumped from both sides at the break then was squeezed back, was a touch rank when between foes nearing the three quarter pole,
settled outside a rival through the backstretch, angled out gathering some steam near the five sixteenths, shifted out very wide in upper stretch, sustained a
grinding run under a drive and got up in the final strides. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL broke outward and bumped with the winner, corrected and reached a
forward position, rated kindly and in range leaving the far turn, slipped through along the rail in upper stretch, bid inside foes to clear in mid stretch, kept on
gamely but was edged in the final jumps. CHANNEL LOOP steadied around the first turn, saved ground off the pace, eased out and advanced past the
three sixteenths, exchanged bumps when working between foes in mid stretch then continued on gamely to the wire. WILMA FLINTSHIRE , off slowly then
steadied when correcting, lost ground three deep early, advanced four wide into the lane, had aim but was out kicked. AUDIBLY settled off the pace while
saving ground, continued inside while under pressure in upper stretch then offered a belated kick. T C NEIGH , bumped at the break, stalked three wide, bid
three deep near the quarter pole, battled past mid stretch then faded. DIVINE SPIRIT broke inward bumping the winner, corrected and clear, set the pace
just off the inside, took pressure around the final turn, entered the lane two wide, ceded past the three sixteenths, bumped in mid stretch and weakened.
IRISH ANGEL prompted the pace outside the leader, applied more pressure around the final turn, fought on between runners into the lane, faded then
steadied when bumped and in tight in mid stretch. CUNDI , between rivals early, dropped back around the final turn.

Footnotes
RAPIDO ROSA , quickly to contention, vied outside a rival while under rating leaving the far turn, moved clear mid turn, opened up under drive in mid
stretch, remained on her left lead and maintained a safe advantage to the wire. UP IN FLAMES rushed up between foes early, gave hard chase three wide
mid turn, remained removed from the rail in upper stretch then finished with good energy to gain the place. LIAM'S THE GREAT , a bit reluctant to load,
chased while saving ground mid turn, eased out three wide into the stretch and closed steadily. DADDY YANKEE angled off the rail into the turn, raced four
wide between runners into the stretch, straightened and finished up nicely to bridge the gap. BUOYANT disputed the pace inside the winner, failed to match
strides past the five sixteenths, stayed on to give willing chase past mid stretch then faded late. KITTY'S SON , three wide early, shifted out and circled five
wide into the lane but failed to generate a serious run. BAZAK , away alertly, shied from the rail nearing the turn, remained inside but lacked a rally. BLAME
THE RIVER , hesitated at the break, found himself far back around the turn, raced removed from the rail in upper stretch then showed a bit of late interest.
MONOCHROME was outrun.

Footnotes
BOSS IS A PAL saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased outside in upper stretch, swept to command approaching the sixteenth pole then drew
away under urging. DOCTOR JEFF chased the pace in the two path around the turn, gained the lead in mid stretch and weakened. LUCCI , caught in close
quarters leaving the starting gate, advanced three deep leaving the backstretch, drifted in near the three eighths pole placing TENAX in tight quarters, was
three wide entering the stretch and flattened out. PHANTOM SMOKE came in at the break, accelerated to the early, set the pace along the rail on the turn
and gave way. MONCRIEF , steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, swung to the four path entering the stretch and was no threat. PRINCE
PERE raced along the inner rail on the turn and was no factor. CHEERS FOR KITTEN , no factor raced along the rail on the turn. OUR HOISTED MAST ,
outrun, was lightly steadied inside the three eighths pole. TENAX unseated his rider when stumbling in tight quarters inside LUCCI inside the three eighths
pole. Following a stewards' inquiry, LUCCI was disqualified and placed eighth.

Footnotes
MAGIC MICHAEL settled in the clear and within range of a contested pace past the five eighths, edged up outside a rival around the turn to stalk, steadied
awaiting room near the quarter pole, found a seam to run through near mid stretch, spurted clear under a drive past the sixteenth marker, switched over to
his left lead late and held sway. VANCE SCHOLARS , four wide into the first turn, angled outside a rival leaving the three quarter pole, gained off the inside
past the five sixteenths, came five wide for the drive and closed gamely outside the winner. BOSS LOGIC attended the pace three wide outside TOPS THE
CHART, was under a hustling ride staying latched on past the five sixteenths, dueled then gained the advantage past the three sixteenths, was taken over
by an inner rival nearing the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. HAY CHIEF settled off the pace while saving ground, gained towards the rail
approaching the lane, worked outward for the drive but lacked the needed finish. QUALITY CHIC bobbled at the break then steadied when briefly in tight,
recovered and was guided inward, pulled his way forward and tracked, took closer order around the final turn, loomed to about mid stretch, failed to kick on
under pressure and faded. TOPS THE CHART took over early and set the pace just off the inside, was hounded past the five sixteenths, sparred into the
stretch and weakened. ALEJANDRO , off the pace, raced four wide heading to the far turn and failed to respond. CURLIN'S MALIBU , three wide, was
ridden along past the five eighths and weakened.

Footnotes
BANDOOLA chased the pace three wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, advanced inside ELELEUS to take the lead inside the eighth pole,
drifted in late and lasted. BURROUGHS CAY came in at the break, raced along the inner rail throughout and rallied gamely. ROCK BULLET , bumped and
in tight quarters at the start, raced along the inner rail throughout and closed. BASIC MILES , taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear early, set the pace
along the rail to upper stretch, drifted out a bit and tired. STATES UNITED saved ground the far turn and lacked a rally. STORM FORCE came out at the
break and failed to rally. FUNSTRUCK , four wide leaving the far turn, was no menace. ELELEUS stalked the pace, raced in the two path the far turn, swung
wide in upper stretch, led in mid stretch then gave way. ASCRIBE , in tight quarters at the start, circled the far turn four wide, floated wider in upper stretch
and was no factor. NO SURRENDER , three wide both turns, gave way. CHECKITUP , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, trailed.
