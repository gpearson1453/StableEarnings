out at the start and raced far behind throughout. LIKE A PRO broke very slowly and trailed losing contact with her field.

CONCEALED CARRY broke alertly and moved clear, widened on the final turn and remained safe driving. ROAN MOUNTAIN broke slowest, moved closer
before the half, rallied wide and was just up for the place. KINGSVILLE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and made a gradual late gain. MIDNIGHT
ACT chased off the pace wide and lacked a solid rally. ZOOMER bumped on the first turn, chased three wide and faded. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY saved
ground, raced close up briefly then gave way. LAST ROMANCE dropped far behind and weakened steadily. TRENDING UP trailed throughout, displayed
poor action and was eased in the final eighth.
