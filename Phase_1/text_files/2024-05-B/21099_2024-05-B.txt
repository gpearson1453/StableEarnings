Footnotes
MS. HILLARY vied between horses, backed up entering the turn, angled out, challenged three across, dueled to mid stretch and drew off under urging.
GOSPEL CHOSEN set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel to mid stretch, was no match late and held for place. GOSPEL SPEAR was
unhurried early, advanced around the turn, bid five wide and finished well to earn show. LAMENTABLE JARIN saved ground, lacked a stretch response and
did not threaten. FLY FENIX FLY pressed the pace three across, challenged for the lead into the turn and stopped.

towards the outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, went willingly to the wire and was outfinished in a good effort. ONE BIG HAAS was off a step
slowly, went four wide leaving the turn, came in mid stretch and leveled off. SHEZAFASHION QUEEN was hustled along inside to vie early, was steadied on
the turn and weakened. BOOZEINTHEBLENDER vied between horses early, was checked hard on the turn, dropped back, swung wide entering the stretch
and had no further response. SOCIAL SOONER was checked repeatedly and dropped back.

PONZA vied inside, inched clear mid stretch and held well. JIMMY SLICE raced close to the pace while racing outside, challenged four across on the turn,
didn't have enough late and settled for place. WASHITA VALLEY was off slowly, fell far back, rallied around the turn and closed inside to earn show in a
good effort. DAKOTA MARVIN vied between horses to the turn, fell back and gave way. PRECIOUS CARGO was never far back, saved ground, floated out
on the turn and was not urged. MEGA SHACK vied three wide around the turn then made a bid at the leader in the stretch and tired mid way, clipped heels
with JIMMY SLICE when that one drifted in, and lost his rider. Following a stewards' inquiry, JIMMY SLICE was disqualified and placed last for causing
interference in the stretch.

STOLEN KISSES raced close to the pace, got through along the rail leaving the turn, inched away and was all out at the wire. ALL AFLUTTER was never
far off the pace while racing outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire and didn't have enough
to get by the winner. MAGGIE D'CAUSE vied to the turn, fell back, closed steadily and earned show. HANGXIETY saved ground, awaited room on the turn
and closed well inside. STORMY BISONETTE pressed three across, fell back entering the turn and finished evenly. HUNNY HUSH vied to the turn,
weakened and gave way. LENA'S SHADOW stumbled and was checked at the start, fell far back and went widest in the drive.

Footnotes
RED ROSE CAFE was taken back entering the backstretch, rallied inside on the second turn, angled out, bid willingly, dueled for the lead and drew clear
late to prove best. HOORAY FOR CREDIT pressed the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled past the eighth pole and
was no match late. REBELENA was sent to the front to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, weakened late and settled for show.
MYSTICAL CODE stalked the pace to the second turn, fell back and finished evenly. GOSPEL EXPRESSION was checked hard on the first turn, raced
towards the back, went widest in the drive and closed well. MIZ RITHYM was slow early, rallied inside on the second turn and lacked a closing response.
FLAT OUT FANCY went five wide on the first turn, raced close to the pace towards the outside and had nothing left for the drive. GOLDIE'S LEGACY
pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. HOLY AMA was not a factor.

GOOD LIQUOR raced mid pack, rallied around the turn, challenged three across, dueled to mid stretch, drew clear and held off the late charge of WILD
CHEROKEE. WILD CHEROKEE pressed the pace along the rail, backed up on the turn, came again along the rail, was blocked, altered course, surged
once clear and was gaining late. UNBRIDLED KISSES vied to mid stretch, was unable to sustain her bid and held for show in a good effort. LADY RASHEN
was never far back, went five wide leaving the turn and finished well. SISSUE broke out, set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel, and
faltered near the eighth pole. ROCKINMYFEATHERBOA broke out and was steadied at the start, raced mid pack and failed to menace in an even effort.
SUGAR COATED broke in hand, raced outside and was not a threat. GOSPEL DELIGHT was not a factor. ROMINA C was off slowly and checked at the
start and passed a tiring rival while not being urged. DEM CATS LUV ME veered out at the start, raced outside, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
KICK IT AGAIN BOB broke out and bumped at the start, set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn and held safely while kept to task. MEGA BOND was
unhurried early, raced inside, closed willingly, angled out past the eighth pole, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. MARCH WEST lagged early,
rallied around the turn, bid willingly, angled in past the eighth pole and earned show while no threat to the top two. INCORRIGIBLE bumped at the start,
pressed the pace to the turn, weakened and faded from contention. TRAPPE VALLEY brushed at the start, advanced inside, bid to get within range and
came up empty. ELECTORAL got away well and failed to threaten in an outside trip. RONALD DALE bumped after the start, raced outside and had brief
speed only. FIRE EXTINGUISHER bumped after the start, showed speed to the turn and gave way.
