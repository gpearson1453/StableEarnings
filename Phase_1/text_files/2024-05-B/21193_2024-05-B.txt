Footnotes
TEQUILA TIME was hustled along to set the pace, drew off on the second turn for a long lead and was ridden out. ANOTHERFORBROOKS was never far
off the pace, rallied into the second turn, closed steadily to narrow the gap and finished second best. OHHH DADDY was slow early, rallied around the
second turn and offered a mild bid to earn show and finished best of the rest. SILVERBULLITBADGER raced close to the pace towards the outside and
failed to menace in an even effort. CYCLONE MESA stalked the pace to the second turn and flattened out. BEDROCK was not a factor. RHODIUM
RUNNER was hustled along, angled in on the first turn to get a spot along the rail, stalked inside to the second turn, tired and stopped. EL CHUMELITO was
not a factor. STYLE BENDER was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
HIT BTWEEN THE ICE pressed the pace three across, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held safely while drifting out
late. PROBATE lagged early while racing inside, bid between horses on the turn, closed inside and got up late for place. DISCREET TIGER veered out at
the start, raced in close towards the outside, bid willingly, was steadied late and outfinished for second. WEDDING GROOM pressed between horses, fell
back, stayed close and lacked the needed late response. WHERES BRAYDEN broke out and was off slowly, raced in the back, bid off the rail and finished
well. ROCKY BAR SIX set a pressured pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. SHANGHAI MIKE was pushed out at the start, had an
outside trip and failed to rally. GOOD BYE CHARLIE broke out, raced mid pack in a steady effort and did not threaten. RUNNINGINTHERAIN was not a
factor. DURANGO JESS pressed the pace along the rail, fell back into the turn and stopped. An objection by the rider of DISCREET TIGER against the rider
of HIT BETWEEN THE ICE was not allowed.

BYE set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew clear and held well. AMERICAN OUTLAW pressed the pace, moved up to challenge for the lead
on the turn, fell back, continued willingly to the wire and finished second best. PANCHO LEFT ME pressed the pace early, fell back, angled out in the upper
stretch and got up for show while no threat to the top two. KING BARON raced close to the pace towards the outside, went evenly late and was outfinished
for third. STABILITY stalked the pace, bid along the rail on the turn and came up empty. BLUEGRASS RYDER was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn
and finished well. FALSELY ACCUSED was not a factor. HOLLYWOOD TIZ raced wide early and was not a threat. BASIC showed little. DAVE'S
ENCHANTMENT raced mid pack, saved ground, stopped and was not urged in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO vied to the second turn and drew off under mild urging. DUBRONSKY raced close to the pace, rallied into the second turn to challenge for
the lead, fell back and was no match for the winner. ABRAAJ MIRAGE swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to be along for show. TONE
FEELIN stalked the pace, tired into the far turn and gave way. BRANNIGAN raced mid pack along the inside in an even effort and failed to menace.
ABSTRACT KAT improved position in a steady effort. BURNZ DA BOSS raced mid pack, rallied outside into the turn to loom a threat and stopped. PINEY
BLUFF vied for the lead, tired into the turn and stopped. ITS BIG swung wide leaving the turn, lacked a response and showed little. INDY'S SONG was not
a factor.
