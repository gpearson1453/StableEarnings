NINE OCLOCK CEASER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
repelled a challenge by DRILL BABY DRILL entering the final turn, and drew clear late as much the best. DUXONTHEPOND settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive. ISLAND LIVING
stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive
and just failed to hold the place. DRILL BABY DRILL broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing just off the rail, forced the issue
from the outside of NINE OCLOCK CEASER entering the final turn, but was outfinshed in the lane. VISENYA away well and was allowed to settle off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when
called upon.

AMERICAN TSUNAMI away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of two rivals in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, disposed of her pace rivals leaving the turn, and drew clear in the lane to prove best. EBONY EYES
tracked the dueling leaders at the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
willingly while drifting off the rail in deep stretch to get up for the place in the closing strides. LICORICE broke sharply and forced the issue three wide
entering the backstretch, continued to press the pace two out from the rail entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with AMERICAN TSUNAMI
leaving the turn, and just failed to hold the place while finishing three wide in the drive. ALOBRAH dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals entering
the backstretch, continued to force the issue from between rivals entering the final turn, struggled to maintain his position through the turn, and faded in the
stretch drive.

SOARINGFORTHESUN away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backside and through the final turn, opened up on his pace rival leaving the turn, and was all out to fend off a late bid from SUNBIRD to prevail.
SUNBIRD broke sharply and stalked the battling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final
turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss. BIG UNION hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and pressed the leader two wide in the
run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of SOARINGFORTHESUN through the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on that rival
leaving the turn, but battled gamely two wide in the drive in a solid effort. AT ATTENTION unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch,
commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing from along the inside in the drive.

ARIKARA away alertly and pressed the pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, took control midway down the backside, and opened a clear
advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. QUEEN OF ATTITUDE was off a step slow, and settled at the back of the pack
entering the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail
in the drive to get up for the place. SILK STILETTOS away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, took up the
chase three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. ARTISTIC JEWLER settled off the
contested early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, launched her bid two out from the rail entering he final turn, and finished with late interest
four wide in the drive. C C SUNRISE broke sharply and set a pressured pace from along the rail entering the first turn, dropped into a tracking trip in the run
to the final turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER stalked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position racing into the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

AIR FORCE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, opened a clear lead leaving the turn, and held VIVA LA VINO safely at bay in deep stretch to prevail. VIVA LA VINO broke sharply and tracked the
early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, and closed
determinedly to prove clearly second best while gaining ground late. MISS UNION stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. INFINITE PATIENCE tracked the leader into the first
turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, continued two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed
closing response when called upon. ABOVE AVERAGE settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
launched her bid three wide from between rivals through the final turn, but failed to sustain her bid in the lane.

Footnotes
LUCKY COWBOY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DEANARROW in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival leaving the turn, and drew clear in the lane to prove best. RICK'S
DANCER away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn,
and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. BORROWED EQUITY stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the
run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly in the drive to get up for a share. CHABI stalked the
leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and improved her position late while
unable to seriously threaten. DEANARROW away well and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide
in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the drive. STOLO SPIRIT
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. SHOWMAN was
bumped solidly from both sides in the opening strides while causing the rider to lost his irons, raced wide throughout and was pulled up by the outrider
entering the stretch and did not finish. Following the race, SHOWMAN walked off under his own power. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident
leaving the gate, but after review, made no change to the original order of finish.
