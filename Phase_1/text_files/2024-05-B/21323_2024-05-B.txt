MUTTLEY eased to the lead inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off late and was kept to the task.
WORTHTHEMONEY sent from the gate, led in the early going, vied outside the pace to the lane, then could not match strides with that one and held the
place. DUKE SKYWALKER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and passed tiring rivals.
PARTNER TOURS unhurried, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had no rally. FLIGHT CATCHER tracked the
pace, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

KAGERO mid pack and off the rail, angled in and moved up through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove
clear late. CHEERFUL TROUT rated close up and off the rail, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick. HOPE SHE COMES stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch
and flattened the final furlong. FIGHT IN THE DOG sprinted to a clear lead just off the rail, weakened the final furlong and held a share. XERCES allowed to
settle, looped two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. SUNSET VIBES mid pack, moved up two and

SOLAIR unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain while drifting in and drew off inside
the furlong marker. WILD DELIGHT rated close up and off the rail, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed
well for the place, while no threat to the winner. SERENADE A KITTEN allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled widest into
the stretch and got up for the show. TRIPLE R RATED tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
weakened and held a share. FOREVER UNCAPTURED stalked the pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong. QUEEN WIGGY stumbled at the start, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into
the stretch and had no rally. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded
the final furlong and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled three wide into the stretch, then made a
steady gain and drew off while being kept to the task. SISTER EVE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then closed well in the late going to edged up for the place. SHEZ UNTAPPABLE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide
through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. SHE'S GOT RHYTHM mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn,
fanned four wide into the stretch, drifting in slightly, steadied on the heels of a rival, then evened out. R PENELOPE sprinted to a clear lead quickly, stayed
on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and missed a share. BESS' CANDY ran evenly. PHONE EATS FIRST broke in at the
start and ran greenly. OPHELIAS DREAM stalked the pace on the inside, gained position on the two path through the turn, then had no rally. EASY SEVEN
well placed and between, faded three wide through the turn. A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SHE'S GOT
RHYTHM AGAINST THE RIDR OF DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED
