CROSLEY broke outward, stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, came in on rivals at the three-sixteenths pole, went clear and
lasted under steady handling. BELLA FRANCESCA was unrushed early and rallied late six wide for the place. SHAGGY KITTY saved ground, shifted four
wide in early stretch and bid belatedly. WERK IT WENDY dueled inside, was checked at the eighth pole when the unofficial winner came in, then gave way
in the stretch. EYE SHADOW pressed the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, took up past the three-sixteenths pole when the unofficial
winner came in and lost momentum. RAFAELLA saved ground to no avail. THE KID PATAKY dueled outside before giving way in the stretch. LONG DAYS
raced evenly outside. SHIELDMEWITHPRAYER saved ground. POISED raced in the three path while no factor. MARTZ ROSEY saved ground.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDERS OF WERK IT WENDY AND EYE SHADOW, CROSLEY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED FIFTH.
