Footnotes
DEVELOPING THE WAY broke a bit slowly, was patiently allowed to settle down the backside seeing the field, made a big sweeping move outside three to
five wide on the turn, continued the sustained run down the stretch, took over with a sixteenth to go and was drawing away when crossing the finish. BILL
NEEDLE settled on the outside in mid-division, moved in circling three wide throughout the turn, loomed three wide at the quarter pole and fought on
determinedly to the finish to capture place in deep stretch. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS was in good position tracking the early leaders inside, angled off the rail
by the half, closed in to assume command at the quarter pole with rivals on either side and gave way grudgingly a few jumps before the wire. BET N WIN
travelled between runners in mid-field down the backside, was roused trying to keep pace with the leaders with five sixteenths from home and ran on
willingly to the finish line to settle on the fringes. SNOOKERED stalked near the rear outside horses down the back straight, shifted inside to save ground
going around the bend, angled outside at the quarter pole, swung out widest in the six path for the drive and finished up mildly to the wire. MIGHTY PELE
prompted the pace inside early on, could not keep up to the frontrunner with a half remaining, had little to offer when urged with three furlongs to go and
retreated running around the turn. READY ON THE LINE had a slim advantage on the outside in the beginning, put away the early speed foe by the half,
was engulfed outside by the quarter pole and backed away on the inside through the stretch.

Footnotes
HARPER CITY broke out on the start, was calmly nestled behind the contesting foursome throughout the turn, found a seam five wide in upper stretch, did
not switch leads until very late but got up in the final few strides for the score under patient handling. WETIKO tracked four deep outside runners down the
back straight, moved four wide circling horses on the turn, bid for the lead in the four path with runners on each side with a furlong left to run and finished up
to be second best with a very game effort. HAAHEE stalked outside near the back, was urged three wide with three eighths to go closing in throughout the
turn, was in the hunt six wide straightening out for home and valiantly battled to the finish being a close third. HOLIDAY IN CHILE trailed the field from the
start, continued to see the pack around the bend, swung out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane, posed a threat outside at the furlong marker,
was slowly getting to the leaders late but could not improve position in deep stretch. IT'S ME MARIO broke sharp, pressed the issue outside in the early
going, took over the lead with five sixteenths to go, fought on dueling inside turning for home, could not find more late and yielded in the last sixteenth.
CANADIAN DADDY was pinched mildly on the start, tracked in the three path between rivals down the backstretch, could not maintain position midway
through the turn and emptied out at the top of the stretch. QURBAAN'S KINGDOM had a narrow advantage while hounded outside along the backside,
surrendered the lead running on the rail by mid-turn and stopped on the fence at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
KAVALA could see the field, unhurried down the backstretch, was full of run opting to go outside runners at the quarter pole, swung out widest closing
resolutely in the six path down the lane and edged clear for the win in the final seventy yards. CEFALO set the pace up front going in hand down the back
straight, dictated terms around the bend, was clinging onto the lead while not switching leads with an eighth left to go, was no match for the surging winner
late but did hold on to save second money. LITTLE FIRE stalked close to the back in the beginning, advanced smartly on the fence midway through the turn
and rallied on the rail in deep stretch, just missed out on capturing the place share at the wire. WINYAH BAY was near the rear three deep on the outside,
made a mild run around foes in the three path throughout the oval, was in range if good enough five wide for the drive but was one paced late to settle on
the fringes. AWILDAS TREASURE shadowed the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, chased the leader through the turn, posed a threat outside at
the top of the lane but stalled in the last sixteenth. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL had a good position all alone tracking the front duo down the backside, was urged
right handed but could gain on the leaders by the quarter pole and faltered in the four path between foes at the furlong marker. TOO MUCH VINO travelled
in mid-pack with rivals on each side down the backstretch, could not get into gear going around the bend and show little finish in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
TOMCAT BLACK was pinched on the break to co-trail on the outside, made a heads up move to gain better position tracking behind the embattled foursome
inside on the turn, shifted out to the three path turning for home extending his stride and pulled away in the final sixteenth. ALICIA'S KID settled on the
outside watching the quartet go at it with four furlongs remaining, had nowhere to go at the quarter pole stuck behind tiring runners, shifted inwards entering
the stretch, then angled out in the five path with an eighth to go but could not run down the winner who got the jump on him. COURAGEOUS COPPER had
a slim advantage in the beginning, faded up top surrendering the lead with two furlongs to go and showed grit to battle back on the rail in the final furlong to
just miss out on the place share in the end. GHOUL (BRZ) prompted the leader outside early on, seized control from the three other early speed rivals by
the quarter pole, dueled stubbornly in the stretch but faded in the last sixteenth for a minor share. KAWACATOOSE battled at the half four deep outside
horses, kept pace running four wide around the bend, had little left for the drive and failed to fire. BACHELOR PAD dueled for the lead in the three path
between foes at the half, was urged for more through the turn, could not go on with others and gave way in upper stretch. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN broke
outwards on the start, co-trailed on the inside in the beginning, made no gain seeing the field on the turn and passed a weary runner through the lane.
MUSICAL STRIDE had one foe beaten with a half mile to go, saved ground making little progression around the bend and could not be a factor on the fence
in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
NOT A LOST CAUSE had the early lead but ceded that to an inside foe content to press, took command coming to the five-sixteenths, drew clear and was
kept to the task. SHAMELESS AFFAIR brushed the gate lightly, settled in mid-division stalking from outside, went four then five wide on the turn making a
minor advance, kept on to edged past for the place while no real threat to the winner. SECRET LOAD settled outside at the rear, swung five wide turning for
home, kept on late to get up for show. AZIEL stalked up close but just off the leading pair, went three then four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
FRAC AMOUR broke outwardly, was outpaced early while urged along and guided nearer inwards, raced between foes at the rear into the turn, checked
near the quarter pole, came out a bit, failed to rally. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST saved ground on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch, failed to rally. A
STING FOR LOVE was urged from the start, took the lead after the opening furlong, set a pressured pace inside, was done at the quarter pole and empty
for the drive.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM FIFTY was away alertly taking control from the onset, was unopposed setting the pace around the turn, was getting leg weary on the fence at the
eighth pole and prevailed by the narrowest of margins at the finish line. SILENT AND SINFUL tossed her head on the break, settled in mid-field down the
backside, was scrubbed on with five sixteenths to go starting to make gains, under left handed encouragement in the four path outside runners had a good
turn of foot and found more closing with a late rush on the tiring leader in the final sixteenth but lost in a head nod. CHIPOTLE PEPPER was a little eager
behind the leader early on, shift just outside down the backstretch, chased the frontrunning winner through the turn, could not close the gap on the leader in
the stretch and just held on for third place in a three horse photo at the finish line. YOU BE THE JUDGE was antsy at the start, hit the gate on the break to
trail outside in the early going, made little impact near the back of the pack around the bend and rallied five wide outside horses in the lane to be involved for
the photo for third money at the wire. SAUCY NAME was bumped outside on the start, recovered to track the top two outside down the back straight,
continued the pattern through the turn and mildly finished up between runners in deep stretch but was one the losing end of a three way photo for the show
award. MISS WATERLOO was fractious in the gate, bumped inside foe on the break, had one rival beaten down the backstretch, could not match strides
with others lagging at the back through the turn and had little to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LANTANA LADY broke just a step slowly, settled at the rear, made a rapid inside advance on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch four deep, took
aim, edged past a sixteenth out. AMERICAN STARLET settled mid-pack, shifted in early on the turn, advanced inside foes but off the fence on the turn, took
the lead in mid-stretch but was outfinished. SACRED DANCER bumped with a foe after the start, tracked from about mid-pack inside saving ground, lacked
room along the rail in upper stretch then altered out and came out a bit further nearing the wire but needed more in the late stages. DANCING DUCHESS
chased from outside mid-pack, went five to six wide on the turn, was forced out in late stretch and brushed a foe. OL' BLONDIE settled off the pace, angled
eight deep at the top of the stretch, rallied mildly, was brushed in the very late stages. I'M INTO MISCHIEF settled off the pace, swung seven wide into
upper stretch, was forced out a bit at that juncture, ran on. MISS VYVYANNE exchanged a bump after the break, was urged forward inside, set the pace
from just off the rail, weakened. THE ARCADIAN WAY chased three to four wide, steadied when in tight in upper stretch, ran on. SPIRIT GAL (FR) chased
four to five wide through the turn then turned up empty. CAHIRA'S BLESSING chased from mid-pack off the inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
RED SAMURAI broke sharp catching a flyer on the break, cleared to the rail easily, set the pace comfortably up front through the turn, was headed outside
at the quarter pole and was resilient stubbornly repelling the challengers late. SPELLCHECK was under restraint hounding the leader down the backside,
continued to keep a close eye on the frontrunning winner on the oval, bid outside at the quarter pole but could not go by the unyielding leader down the
stretch. MIDSUMMER MO was jostled between runners on the start, trailed outside, started to rally smartly inside by the quarter pole, shifted to the four path
to be in range straightening out for home and was closing in late but ran out room. GENIUS OF LOVE tracked the front two while on the rail, kept pace with
the leaders coming under a ride with five sixteenths from the finish, tried to rally on the fence in mid- stretch but evened out in the late stages. IDYLLIC was
brushed inside to begin, travelled in mid-division outside runners in the early stages, was roused on the turn but made little advancement, swung out widest
in the six path turning for home but could not reach contention finishing up one paced to the wire. QUEST TO BE PROUD travelled near the back early on,
was uninterested trailing throughout the turn and passed a tired foe down the lane. DIAL A CLICHE was bumped outside on the start, settled on the inside in
mid-pack, was asked midway on the turn but could not gain on the leaders, swung out five wide for the drive had little to offer running to the finish line.

Footnotes
WITWATERSRAND was content to find her feet trailing down the backside, could still see the field travelling confidently on the fence in the turn, darted
between horses when finally nudged on for run at the quarter pole, quickly pounced to the lead in the four path just inside the furlong pole and cruised in
under little urging for the dominant score. SABATINI prompted the pace outside through the backstretch, reeled in the pacesetter through the turn, briefly
had the lead between rivals at the furlong marker, was no match for the winner but easily bested the rest at the finish. A LITTLE FRISKY settled in mid-pack
in this compact field, could not close the gap on the leaders when asked around the oval and finishing up with intent to stay on for a distant third in the end.
ROSA broke outwards on the break, stalked near the back outside rivals, could not get into contention running three wide outside foes through the turn and
made little presence down the lane. C C ROYAL took command from the start, set the fractions up top going around the turn, was collared outside in upper
stretch, could not find more late and faded at the sixteenth pole on the fence.

Footnotes
VERDEJO was unhurried to trail in the beginning, began to pass runners advancing on the fence three furlongs out, angled outside for clear room at the top
of the lane in the four path and closed with a rush in the final furlong to get up in time for the victory. FOOLISH GAMES maintained a slim advantage outside
down the backstretch, dueled on the outside for the top spot around the bend, began to inch away from the speed rival in upper stretch, could not hold off
the charge by the winner late but did finish up to just hold for the place share at the wire. CARA CARA broke out on the start, forced the issue up front on
the rail down the backside, poked her head in front entering the turn, battled inside until the eighth pole, was steadied on the fence then re-engaged to
almost get up for place at the finish line. MY SUNNY VALENTINE was situated on the fence in the middle of the pack, began to inch closer saving ground
around the bend, swung out three wide at the top of the lane and made a late rally for a minor role in the end. SOUPER PECAN travelled three deep outside
horses in mid-pack, kept even with the leaders through the turn, shifted outside five wide for the stretch run and finished up mildly to the wire. YA MAR
tracked the contesting duo outside in the second tier, made a brief rally three wide at the quarter pole getting into contention, loomed in the three path
turning for home, could not find another gear and stalled in the last sixteenth. SOUPER SUNDAY was brushed inside on the break, stalked in the third flight
down the back straight, put in a mild run closing the gap around the bend, was in range four wide at the top of the lane but wilted in deep stretch. FOREST B
travelled on the rail in the second flight, sat behind the battling leaders throughout the turn, shifted just off the fence in the two path in upper stretch to be in
the mix of thing, could not go on and faded in the final sixteenth. HELLO FRIENDS had one foe beaten in the early going, could see the field running around
the oval and passed tired ones in the stretch. INDIAN MUSIC was brushed inside on the start, stalked between foes in the two path mid-division, could not
keep up with others on the turn and was not involved inside of rivals down the lane. JILL stalked in mid-pack with rivals on either side in the three path down
the back straight, was roused but was going in the wrong direction through the turn and never factored in the stretch drive. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND
