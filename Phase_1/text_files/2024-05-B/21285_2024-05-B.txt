Footnotes
STOP DIGGING well placed early behind the top pair, took aim three wide entering the stretch, bid between rivals with a furlong remaining, put a head in
front outside the sixteenth pole and held off QUICK KATE to the line. QUICK KATE unhurried in the early going, raced outside a rival into the turn, angled
out past the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane, rallied in tandem with STOP DIGGING and missed. DORIE MILLER stalked along the inside,
launched a rail bid in the stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. RECALCITRANT sat off the pace, saved ground around the bend before tipped two wide
nearing the stretch, moved out a bit further in the lane and kept on for a minor award. REALLY THIRSTY dueled from outside up the backstretch, kept the
pressure on the leader around the turn, gained the advantage in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. CLUBHOUSE BRIDE dueled for the lead from
inside, inched ahead into the turn, maintained a short lead around the bend, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. BELLA
VIENNA had her path taken shortly after the start and dropped back to last, trailed while saving ground to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SMILING BEAST broke poorly and trailed the field in the early going, moved forward up the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, drew on even
terms with the top pair at the eighth pole and drove clear. SMOKEM IF U GOTTEM set the pace outside a rival to the turn, put away inner rival near the
three-eighths pole but was soon challenged by GOLDEN RIVER on the outside, dueled with that rival into the lane, resisted to the eighth pole, relinquished
the lead midstretch and stayed on to secure second. GOLDEN RIVER stalked the speed from outside, bid past the three-eighths pole three then two wide,
fought on even terms into the lane, vied between rivals at the eighth pole and faltered in the final sixteenth. KISNA forced the pace from inside to the turn,
could not keep up with the leader early on the bend, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened. FLYING BLIND tracked the speed along the
inside, angled out at the quarter pole, spun four wide into the lane and failed to menace. LEVI broke a step slow, ran up on heels at the nine-sixteenths pole,
took the turn two to three wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON broke well then allowed SAWASDEE to take the lead while switching to the outside, stalked two then three wide around the bend,
drew alongside the pacesetter leaving the bend, took over in upper stretch without being asked and drew clear in an easy win. SAWASDEE took control
early and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, roused when confronted by THE CHOSEN VRON approaching the lane,
lost command in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. MOOSE MITCHELL tracked three wide into the
turn, moved out to the four path around the bend and never produced a bid. CALIFORNIA TIGER tracked the speed outside MOOSE MITCHELL, navigated
the turn four then five wide, moved inward in upper stretch and failed to menace. THERE WAS A WIN MINUS POOL OF $3,838.12

Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT grabbed the lead quickly and moved inside, set all the pace to the top of the lane, given his cue in upper stretch and stayed clear
under urging to the wire. BARELY FUNTIONAL stalked the leader along the rail, patiently ridden while continuing to save ground behind KINGS RIVER
KNIGHT on the far turn, moved off the fence in the lane and finished willingly but could not reach the winner. OLD PAL dropped back and steered to the
inside, angled out to four path on the far turn, summoned a mild rally and got up for the show honors. COALINGA ROAD raced in range between rivals,
ridden along in the two path on the second bend, tipped out in upper stretch and got outkicked for third. CARMELITA'S MAN reserved between runners
early, asked two wide on the second bend, moved out a bit in the lane and offered a mild response to improve position. OUBABE raced up close outside the
leader into the first turn then took a stalking position in the two path, was closest in pursuit of the pacesetter to the top of the stretch and weakened in the
final furlong. NONE ABOVE THE LAW reserved along the fence out of range, continued to save ground without being asked yet on the far turn, put to right
handed urging in upper stretch and needed to find more. PASSARANDO raced three deep near the back around the clubhouse turn, continued in the three
path through the far turn, moved out at the top of the stretch, lost his path briefly at the eighth pole and failed to menace. CLOUSEAU tracked the leader
outside a pair of rivals to the lane, came out slightly in upper stretch to bother a rival and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
NEEZER DALTON tracked outside rivals in the early going, went four wide into the turn then moved into the three path, challenged outside the top pair four
wide into the stretch, inched ahead at the top of the lane and drew clear. HOT DANZING broke well and was forwardly placed from outside, chased three
wide into the turn, moved into the two path then bid three wide into the stretch, could not match the winner in the late stages and stayed on to hold second.
QUICK OMEN well placed up the backstretch, stalked from inside through the turn, chased within striking distance entering the final furlong but could not
summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. DIXIE BLAZE chased off the rail, rounded the bend two wide then moved to the fence past the quarter pole
and lacked further response. CASTAGNA away quickly from inside, showed the way up the backstretch and around the turn, challenged by a pair of rivals
entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch and faded. BETTER B WORTH IT dropped back early, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
STAY AND SCAM closest in pursuit from the two path early, pressed the pacesetter from outside on the backstretch, drew on even terms around the far
turn, kicked clear into the stretch and held well under right handed encouragement and steady handling. MOMENT'S PLEASURE stalked from the two path
then between rivals, continued two wide into the far turn, bumped with inner rival past the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the rail inside the quarter pole,
steered back out in the lane and closed the gap on the winner while gaining second. CORNELIA FORT got crowded and bumped between rivals early,
traveled in mid-pack two wide early, went two then three wide around the far turn, altered out in upper stretch and rallied to get up for third. CARMEN
MIRANDA settled next to the fence off the pace, went between rivals on the far turn, came back in some in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong
but got edged by CORNELIA FORT for the show honors. SNEAKER took control early and moved inside, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages,
headed at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the new leader leaving the far turn and weakened in the furlong grounds. ABHITA unhurried early
on and tucked inside, shifted to the two path at the quarter pole, came out and bumped rival late on the bend and spun four wide into the stretch, kept trying
through the stretch but failed to threaten. SHEZMISBEHAVING got put in tight and bumped with outer rival early, raced near the back in the two path, went
three deep into the far turn, got bumped and forced out past the quarter pole, was floated out further in upper stretch and could not rally, bled following the
race and was vanned off. MADIHA stalked three wide around both turns, drifted out in upper stretch, came back in midstretch and weakened. ROSE
DAWSON traveled outside a rival at the back in the early stages, trailed two to three wide on the far turn and failed to make an impact. TAM'S LITTLE
ANGEL stalked along the rail, bumped with outer rival past the five-sixteenths pole, continued along the fence and weakened down the lane.

IRISH WAHINE bumped leaving the gate, stalked from inside, tipped two wide under coaxing on the turn, brushed with outer rival at the three-sixteenths
pole, drew alongside the leader with a furlong remaining, kicked clear near the sixteenth pole and won going away. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE set the pace
between rivals up the backstretch, dueled outside DANZING CAT while losing command around the bend, regained command in upper stretch, lost
command to the winner midstretch and saved second. WHIMSICAL HEIR forwardly placed outside the top pair, chased in the three path through the turn,
brushed with the winner at the top of the lane, could not match that rival in the final furlong and failed to get by the runner-up for second. DANZING CAT
broke in and bumped RYDER'S CANDY, pressed the pace from inside, took a narrow lead while dueling around the bend, gave the lead back to
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE in upper stretch and faded out of contention. RYDER'S CANDY got bumped on both sides and crowded leaving the gate, trailed
early and moved inside for the turn, steered out around the bend and came four wide into the stretch, passed tired rivals but failed to threaten. SAND TO
SEA bobbled at the start, chased outside a rival well off the rail early on, rounded the bend in the four path and weakened. ALFONSIA antsy in the gate,
raced in range off the rail, left the backstretch three wide, quickly moved into the two path then shifted to the rail around the bend and came up empty in the
lane.

Footnotes
SHADY TIGER shifted out and bumped rival in the beginning, went up to duel from inside, inched ahead on the far turn, resisted through the stretch holding
a short lead over STOLEN TREASURE and gamely prevailed. TWO BY FOUR got bumped from inside shortly after the start, dropped back and was taken
inside, angled out to the three path on the far turn, steered out further in the lane, unleashed a late run and got up for second. STOLEN TREASURE went
up to duel outside SHADY TIGER, kept the pressure on through the far turn, fought through the lane and failed to find the needed late kick in deep stretch.
SIZE DOES MATTER got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, stalked along the rail inside rivals, ridden along through the far turn, stayed on the fence
in the drive and finished willingly to round out the superfecta. FINAL STORM got bumped by inner rival then took up between foes early, stalked three deep
around the clubhouse turn, chased two wide between foes on the second bend, kept on in the final furlong but needed to find more late. TAKES THREE got
pinballed leaving the gate, reserved early and tucked inside, stayed on the fence through the far turn, entered the stretch under left handed urging, moved
out and gained late between rivals approaching the wire. CURLIN'S KAOS pulled early chasing between rivals, rounded the far turn three then four deep,
took aim from outside at the eight pole but failed to summon the needed late kick. TAMARANDO STAR broke out and bumped rival, settled at the back two
wide, trailed into and around the far turn and passed tired rivals in the lane. KEEP MOVIN' ON hit the gate and broke out, raced keenly from outside first
time through the stretch, settled three deep around the first turn, hustled along approaching the half-mile pole, bid three deep into the far turn, could not
keep up with the top pair at the five-sixteenths pole and faded through the lane. STAY ON THE FENCE stalked between rivals in the early stages, dropped
back on the far turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
OUR BUCKY CHARM broke a step slow then rushed up to a forward position and pulled when taken in hand, chased three wide into the turn, applied
pressure to the leader from outside around the bend, put a head in front in upper stretch and drove clear in deep stretch. EDDIE'S LAST raced in range four
wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, took aim at the top pair from outside in upper stretch, failed to find the needed late kick in the
last sixteenth but was able to overtaken MOON ICE for second. MOON ICE showed early speed to grab the lead, led two wide into the turn, moved over to
the rail while under pressure from OUR BUCKY CHARM, fought with that rival into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, stayed on through the final
furlong and got edged for the second. LEMON SUSHI raced up close on the inside, waited behind the leader entering the drive, roused in upper stretch,
came off the rail then moved back in a bit and could not find the needed late kick. LEYAS CANDY stalked two wide into the turn, came three wide into the
lane, chased between foes in upper stretch and weakened. UNCLE JOHN traveled in mid-pack and moved inside, entered the lane in the two path and
needed to find more in the final furlong. LEFT HAND MAN chased five wide into the turn, continued wide while four deep around the bend and weakened
down the lane. CHICK'S DIG IT broke a step slow, chased in the four then three wide on the turn and could not respond to urging. RHYTHEM ON STAGE
trailed briefly then had two rivals beat into the turn, drew closer three to four wide around the bend, lost his path entering the lane, tipped to the outside and
failed to threaten. TIZZ A GOOD THING saved ground from off the pace, moved out across the dirt and was never a factor. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR raced
near the back then trailed into the turn, rounded the bend in the two path, also moved out over the dirt and failed to make an impact.
