FILTERED LIGHT stalked the early pace and made a three wide b id off the turn, then hit the front by the sixteenth marker and edged away to prove best.
KAZ MUSIC pressed the pace and made a two wide bid to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, then shook clear nearing the furlong marker but could not
hold off the winner while keeping on to be second best. DUST BUNNY was rated along early on the inside, then was two wide off the turn and angled out in
the furlong grounds for racing room and finished willingly to gain the show award but needed more. WARRIOR'S MISS set a pressured pace on the inside
and relented the lead nearing the quarter pole and faded in the lane. ARROGANTE chased the pace three to four wide and weakened in the drive.

YES IT'S ROO was settled early, advanced on the inside on the turn, moved out off the turn and finished well but needed more. GAGETOWN chased the
pace two wide on the trun, swung out five wide leaving the turn and kept on but had no kick. ROMANTIC GAMBLE chased the early pace and was four to
five wide on the turn and weakened. MONSTER MASON chased the early pace two wide, then was between rivals by the three eighths marker and

BOOK RUNNER set the early pace on the inside while clear, widened the margin off the turn and then was put to mild urging to prove much the best.
TRICOLOUR was settled early two to three wide, made a inside move on the far turn, moved out in the lane and got up for the place spot. EAST AURORA
was hard held early three wide, then was ridden along by the quarter pole, then was no match for the winner and was out-kicked for the place award.
UNCLE EDDIE was rated along two to four wide, then weakened in the lane. STATELY ORDER had outside pursuit and was four to five wide on the far turn
and had no rally. RAMSEY hit the gate at the start, then made a middle move two wide and was ridden along on the turn and tired.

the pace and was four to five wide on the turn and had no rally. ROCKIN THE PALACE was reserved early and lacked a serious rally.
