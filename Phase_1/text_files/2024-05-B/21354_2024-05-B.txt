Footnotes
PALMETTO FURY set the pace in the two path and drew off through the stretch while ridden out. SAVE US MELANIA stalked the pace three wide, bid
nearing the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner but kept on to be clearly second best. DOWN IN THE BAYOU raced off the pace four wide
and was along for the show. WEST BANK chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. SHE'S SO SEXY played no factor while racing two wide.
ALWAYS DRAMA had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
GUAIO had a slow start but laid off the pace in the four path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied past inner
foes to go clear in the final sixteenth. GAMBLIN GEORGE rated in the four path, was cued into the far turn, swung from the five path to bid at the top of the
stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught around the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. FOR THE CHIEF tracked inside, was coaxed
from the rail midway around the far turn, drifted out down the lane, but finished evenly for show. INTOLERABLE stalked in the four path, was driven in the
three path around the far turn, bid at the top of the lane, but flattened between foes in the final furlong. AFFIXED set the pace in the two path but faded
along the inside in the final furlong. RUBY'S BIG RED prompted the pace in the three path but backed up entering the far turn. R B'S RUNNER broke out at
the start, then always trailed.

Footnotes
CALYPSO CHARLIE pressed the pace two wide, took over midway around the turn and drew off under a drive. BIVOL broke inwardly and bumped SEVEN
ANNIVERSARY into MILCHIN at the start, raced off the pace four wide and rallied for the place. MR CLAUSE hopped at the start, sped forward to set the
pace along the rail, could not keep pace with the winner from the five-sixteenths pole and lost second late. SEVEN ANNIVERSARY was bumped hard
between foes at the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. MILCHIN was bumped at the start, had early speed two wide and faded.
RAGS SPECIAL had his head turned at the start and trailed inside.
