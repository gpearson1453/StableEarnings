REBA was forwardly placed from the onset, moved up to engage OLIVIA'S HOPE for the lead with three furlongs left to run, vied outside of rival into the
stretch, took a slim lead at the eighth pole then finished going away. OLIVIA'S HOPE led the way in opening stages, took on the challenge of REBA entering
the turn, vied along the inside into the lane, could not match strides past the furlong marker but ran on and secured second best. AMERICAN SUE raced in
range along the inside in opening stages then flattened out entering the turn, roused three to four wide into upper stretch, showed interest and gathered a
share. C L LEGACY raced up close in the early going, then flattened out, launched a three wide rebid entering the lane and had a mild improve. FARRAH
FOWLER was sluggish in the back, hustled along the inside into stretch run and passed tiring foes. NAUTICAL MISS hustled along in pursuit of the top pair
around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then came up empty. SONG OF PRAISE raced off the early leaders, chased two wide around the turn,
came three to four wide into the lane and gave way.

DEMIDANU moved up to engage WON HAPPY MAMA for the lead leaving the backstretch, vied outside around the turn, raced just off aforementioned foe
a furlong out, dug in gamely, moved back up to re-challenge for the lead, raced heads apart deep stretch and prevailed under an all out drive. WON HAPPY
MAMA quickly cleared on top then took on the challenge of DEMIDANU late on the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, saved ground turning for home,
briefly shook free, came back under attack from aforementioned foe, fought back gamely from the inside and got denied in final stridess. DIAL SUM IN
settled off the early pace and saved ground, hustled along three to four wide into stretch run, closed willingly and captured a share. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO
hustled along in pursuit of the early front runners, came two wide into the lane and narrowly missed a share. LAVENDER LIL raced in the back, cut the
corner entering upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. BAYLEYWICK was forwardly placed and briefly raced in striking distance, weakened off the
embattled pair mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

SKALKAHO tracked the top pair up the backstretch, loomed up three wide to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, took the lead turning for home,
continued to dig in while leading the way by a slim margin, fought on gamely and just lasted. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST tracked the top trio through early
stages, picked up the tempo three wide late on the turn, launched a bid in the three path in upper stretch, steadily edged way up closer to the wire and just
missed. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET pressed the early pace along the inside, cut the corner entering upper stretch and sustained a rail bid, raced in striking
distance a furlong out, continued to battle on gamely in striking distance but could not match with the top two in final stages. BLITZED IN BEE SIX set a
pressured pace two wide, lost the lead to the eventual winner entering upper stretch, kept on and remained in close contention into the final furlong then
weakened late. FAYES SPIRIT raced off the pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. WILY WADE got bumped at the start, raced off
the pace and never menaced.

UNDECODED stalked the leader around the first turn and through the backstretch, moved up to engage the pacesetter mid-way around the far turn, vied
past the quarter pole then took over a slim lead, took clearer command past the eighth pole and held sway. MOCHA KISS stalked inside through early
stages, waited patiently along the rail around the far turn, tipped out three wide in the upper stretch, raced in close contention but could not get to the
eventual winner. INDY AGAIN tracked two wide up the backstretch, picked up the p-ace late on the far turn, swung three to four wide into the lane, moved
up into strong contention then ran on evenly in the final sixteenth. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL raced near midpack midway up the backstretch, swung five
wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. SHE'S A BIG STAR set the pace, took on the challenge of the eventual winner mid-way around the far
turn, fought back to the eighth pole then gave waay. JERI DAWN raced in the back, swung four wide into upper stretch and never menaced.
APRETTYLULABY was not far off the pace in around the first turn, chased up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and failed to factor in the lane.
OUR CLOVER GAL saved ground off the pace, had no response and steadily retreated.

SCOTT CITY vied two wide up the backstretch, continued to match strides while holding aa slight edge late on the turn, battled on to the furlong marker,
then shook free and finished well clear. MISCHIEVOUS MAX vied inside of rival through early stages, battled on around the turn, fought back to the eighth
pole, failed to kick on with eventual winner and held place. DANCIN ROCKET tracked the top flight up the backstretch, moved up closer four wide late on
the turn, could not move on with the top pair in upper stretch but kept on for a share. IRISH COAST tracked the early pace, chased three wide in contention
around the turn, was forced to steady lacking a clear path in upper stretch, shifted out and cleared the rest. GOD'S GIFT TO US raced off the early pace,
swung two to three wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. KHOZANTHEDESTROYER raced near mid-pack in early stages, failed to respond when
called upon around the far turn and never threatened. TIME FOR ANOTHER was off a step slow then was unruly like a few strides out of the gate, raced off
the pace and failed to move into close contention. MAGIC D ORO hustled along racing off the early pace, saved ground entering upper stretch and
retreated.

PLEASINGLY set a pressured pace on the inside up the backstretch, edged ahead to a slim lead and held firm around the turn, came two to three wide into
upper stretch, roused for more, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. CHOJO pressed the pace up the backstretch, continued juts off the
leader two wide around the turn, was no match for eventual winner past upper stretch and settled for second best. HIGHWOOD tracked the top pair through
early stages, launched a three wide bid around the turn, kept on and cleared the resst. MY CAJUN LADY was not too far back early on, hustled up four wide
around the turn then weakened in the lane. CAN'T WANT THAT raced in early contention then steadily weakened. GATA RUNZ chased along the rail and
never threatened. AZTEC EMPRESS hustled along two wide early on, chased between foes around the turn and faded in the lane.

just off the pace in the opening quarter, launched a three to four wide bid late on the turn, shifted closer to the inside near mid-stretch and sustained
response to clear the rest. LADY RADLER tracked the pace up the backstretch, came under a ride near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, came in a couple paths and flattened out. DIVA TREVA was forwardly place in the opening quarter, steadily retreated mid-way around the
turn and continued to tire in the drive. PRESENT TIME vied for the lead up the backstretch, continued in striking distance around the turn, got pulled up
while injured in upper stretch and vanned off. TWO MINUTE DRILL tracked just off the early pace, given cue turning for home, slipped through along the rail

Footnotes
KOSELIO raced in range through early stages, made aa move late on the turn, spun five wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady gain along the outside
and drew clear. MONTEREY PENINSULA raced near mid-range, waited patiently along the inside around the turn, tipped out and continued to lack room in
upper stretch, steadied, then shifted in to the two path, briefly advanced to the lead then got outfinished by the winner. BLACK STORM was allowed to settle
in the early going, swung wide into the stretch, rallied along the outside and captured a share. BROADWAY PETE rated saving ground through early stages,
made a move turning for home, steadied slightly then moved through the two path near the eighth pole, gained ground then finished evenly. CHAMPION BY
DESIGN was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, moved up tow wide near the quarter pole, vied into upper stretch, held a slim lead a furlong
out then gave way. RICKEY B raced up close through the backstretch, continued in striking range three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the final
furlong then evened out late. COWBOY DON raced off the early pace, chased two wide around the turn, shifted four wide upper stretch, launched a bid but
needed more for impact. TOPPER T sped to the lead from the gate, cleared and crossed over to the inside, challenged late on the turn, fought back upper
stretch then quickly retreated leaving the eighth pole.
