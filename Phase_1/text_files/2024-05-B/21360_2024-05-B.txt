Footnotes
ITASCA chased the early pace, made the lead two wide at the seven sixteenths pole, set the balance of the pace, matched strides the length of the stretch
and proved best in a game effort. FUEGO CALIENTE stalked the early pace, went up to challenge the winner three wide after a half, kept pressure the
balance of the trip two wide and was denied. LUCKY ANDY allowed to settle, loomed boldly three wide into the far turn then leveled off. HAD RIGHT was
bumped at the start, unhurried early and found his best stride late in the six path. ORO DE MORO MORO broke inward bumping into HAD RIGHT at the
start and was always outrun. UHAVETOBEKITTENME broke in front, set the pace with a daylight lead for a half then stopped and jogged to the wire.

LA ROSA unhurried early, saved ground, got through to make the lead in upper stretch and proved best while fully extended under strong handling. HIGH
FIRE never far back, rallied four wide into the stretch, drifted in passing the furlong marker, drew on even terms for the lead and was denied. POWER
BANKER set a pressured pace along the inside then the two path into the stretch and faded late. OUT FOR FUN allowed to settle, surged to the front three
wide entering the far turn, battled into the stretch then weakened. BISCAYNE BAY pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs then gave way.

DIAL DIRECT chased the leader early, assumed command two wide past the half mile pole, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to
win as much the best while being ridden out. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE set the pace along the inside for a half, dropped back on the second turn the came on
again along the rail through the stretch and finished clear for second. KELLEHER never far back, loomed boldly three wide past the half mile pole, remained
a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened. GOOD MUSIC was no factor. ANIMO ROBERTO was outrun. PRESSLEY RIDGE chased the early pace and
was through after a half.

CANDYMONIUM unhurried early, closed rapidly four wide through the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under right handed
urging. MY SUZIE Q never far back, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch and finished second best. VINOS ANGEL close up from the start,
finished with good courage three wide. SURPRISED GEM slow early, found her best stride late outside rivals. TORREY STREET away alertly, set a
pressured pace along the inside to the top of the stretch and weakened late. NOT TODAY pressed the pace two wide for nearly six furlongs then gave way.
INSATIABLE EVA stalked the early pace two wide and was through after six furlongs. OROZIMBA was through early, lost contact with her field on the far
turn and jogged to the wire.
