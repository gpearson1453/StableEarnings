Footnotes
WARRIOR ON THE RUN pressed the pace three to two wide, then was ridden along to keep up on the far turn, came three wide off the turn and was
roused nearing the furlong marker and then slowly edged clear late to prove best. CHERISHED WISH set a pressured pace on the inside while in hand,
then shook clear leaving the quarter pole, then was sent down when straightened but could not hold off the winner late while being clearly second best.
INTRO was reserrved early, advanced four wide on the far turn and came five wide off the turn and rallied. MUMMALICIOUS was four wide into the first
turn, stalked the pace four to three wide and then came four wide off the turn but faded in the drive. ELUSIVE EMPRESS was rated along the inside but
lacked the needed winning bid. MOST UNUSUAL DAY was in between rivals entering the first turn, tracked the pace three wide and then stopped of the far
turn.

INCONTROVERTIBLE was well rated along the inside, moved out and made a three wide bid on the far turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then came four
wide off the turn and drew off by the furlong marker and then maintained that clear lead to the wire. LET'S GO MO was allowed to settle early, advanced on
the inside on the far turn and came three wide off the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. MAKE A SPLASH was reserved early, four wide
by the quarter pole and came five wide off the turn and had some mild late kick to best the rest. LADYNESS chased the pace three wide and came four
wide into the lane and had no rally. KENTUCKY REIGN prompted the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the far turn to lead briefly but weakened
in the drive. TRECHMO GIRL was taken back on the inside and failed to menace. BUCKFAST ABBEY was fractious in the gate, set the pace on the inside
and gave way on the far turn.

JAKE BRAKE ALLEY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole to draw clear leaving the turn and by the furlong marke
and then held sway late to prove best under left handed crop urging. PRETORIAN GOLD was settled early on the outside, then was four to three wide on
the turn and advancing, then tipped out by the furlong marker and closed well. HYPER INFLATION was settled early four to three wide, then moved to the
inside and leaving the quarter pole, made a inside bid but needed more. BEJUCO was reserved early, three wide by the quarter pole and came four wide off
the turn and had a mild late rally. NORTHWOODS was reserved early, came four wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND set a
