Footnotes
BAYOU BERTIE dueled up front while in the two path, shook clear of the other speed by midway on the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage through
the straight under steady handling. OCEAN JET closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, fell back off that pair into he turn, proved no match for the
winner in the drive while edging clear for the second spot. TENSAS LUCY settled in mid pack just off the inside, roused for the drive, long drive for the show
spot, proved determined for that position while not a threat to the top pair. TROUBLE WITH SUGAR also back off the early pace, came four wide for the
drive, outkicked for the show spot late. R T'S CAJUN LADY away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner for just over a quarter, first to blink far
turn, continued to weaken through the stretch to lose several positions. CUSTOMERUNHAPPY lacked early foot outside, four wide into the turn, three wide
into the lane, improved position a bit in the drive while not posing a serious threat. MOR MOR MUSIC forwardly placed just after the start, began a steady
retreat in the two path early in the turn. AVIE J in mid pack early, had little left for the final furlong. GIRL LIKES BLING brushed the gate to break back, was
never involved. WILD REECIE off slowly, lagged further and further back, jogged in.

Footnotes
LOYAL TO THE CHIEF broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, salted away the other speed when straightened for home, clear late, enough left hold the
runner up safe late. CECE WAVE lacked early speed inside, continued to save some ground turn, moved out a bit for the drive, split rivals when rallying
inside the furlong grounds, continued willingly to the end to close the gap on the winner. A P HUMOR moved out three wide to stalk the dueling leaders into
the turn, crept closer outside that pair turning into the lane, flattened out in proving no match for the winner, failed to contain the runner up to finish up best
of the rest. SABERFIGHT devoid of any early foot off the inside, commenced to rally four to five wide midway on the turn, flattened out a bit in the final
furlong to finish up mildly. WHY WAIT away well, raced on equal terms with the winner up the backstretch and into the turn, faltered in the drive. AGAMI
went one paced toward the inside in lacking a closing response. JUST A WIN in mid pack for a half, backed up through the stretch. BLESS D'SOUTH off
slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
YAKETY YAK moved up steadily to join the leaders along the inside leaving the chute, vied up the backstretch, edged clear turn, responded when
challenged upper stretch, repelled that foe inside the furlong grounds to edge clear late. HABANERO TOM broke well, chased the dueling leaders up the
backstretch in the three path, moved steadily closer through the turn, challenged the winner on the outside entering the stretch, raced on equal terms with
that one past the furlong marker, could not match strides late while comfortably holding the runner up spot. ASTROLOGY WONOWON asked for run out of
the gate, dueled outside the winner early, fell back off that one through the turn, had little for the runner up late in the bend, enough left in the run through
the stretch to preserve the show. DYNAMIC MOON fell back after the start outside, four wide through the turn, not enough late for the show. MARIACHI
MAN bothered at the break, settled in mid pack and came up empty for the drive. RED ROCK SOLUTION also raced in the main body early, weakened
through the stretch to lose a couple of positions. CATCH ME T last away, was never a factor. BOLD AND BRASH broke in, stopped before a half, far back,
jogged in.

Footnotes
CABOCHON TREASURE tracked the pace for a half along the inside, continued to save ground through upper stretch, altered course to the outside nearing
the sixteenth mile marker, came out a bit more then was righted, late surge to be up at the wire. LOVELY SASSICAIA allowed the early leader to go, chased
that one into the turn, closed the gap on that one by late in the bend, engaged that same rival from the outside approaching midstretch, took over, led late,
nailed at the wire. GATSBY'S FORTUNE broke alertly, cleared to the inside soon after, showed the way by daylight up the backstretch and through most of
the turn, briefly responded when the runner up came alongside nearing the furlong grounds, yielded, saved the show. CHAOTIC JACK back off the pace for
five furlongs, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve slightly, never a serious threat. CAJUN CYCLONE one paced while racing three wide,
came up empty when called on for the drive. KING OF CONTRABAND remained back in failing to mount a late rally. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
Z'S GUITAR outrun in the early going off the inside, began to advance on the outside into the far turn, floated out five wide when challenging entering the
stretch, kicked well clear under steady handling. TALK OF THE TOWN stalked the pace from the three path, moved to the fore while three to four wide and
inside the winner exiting the final turn, vied past the furlong marker then could not keep up with that rival, clear for the place. DOCE DE LA NOCHE allowed
to settle while racing off the pace, staged a mild rally to gain the nod for the show, no threat to the top pair. MECKES PRIORITY broke on top, five wide into
the first turn when forwardly placed, advanced, took over 2nd, no match top two final furlong, nipped late for show. HUMOR ME PLEASE lacked speed,
improved position slightly while ever a serious threat. ADMIRAL AFLEET five wide into the first turn when off the pace, lacked a rally. R T'S D'ORO void of
speed, moved out to be six wide turning for home, picked off a couple of rivals after the issue had been decided. LITTLE ROCKY was finished after a half.
SERGEANT RECKLESS broke well, took command after the start to set the pace, stopped when headed far turn.

Footnotes
GOLDENLUTE broke out a bit, was straightened to race off the pace, bit closer while in traffic and between horses late in the turn, shifted out a bit, set down
down clear three wide, rallied, kicked strongly clear late to win going away. RUMPUSINTHESKY away in good order, pressed the issue three wide into the
turn, bid, took over to show the way into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. CREME DE BALI forwardly placed while four
wide into the turn, fell back a bit late in the bend, came again to gain the show while not a serious threat to the top two. R T'S WILDCAT lacked early foot,
continued to lag in trailing past the furlong marker, rallied with some interest while too late. GHENT within striking distance toward the inside, went evenly
through the stretch in lacking a closing punch. PITALE lacked speed, floated out four wide by the winner turning for home, also failed to muster a closing
kick. KIT KAT KIDD last to leave, trailed for three furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. CALCULATED LUV lacked speed, floated
five wide into the lane, remained back. ARKANSAS ZONG set or forced the pace for three furlongs along the inside, caved in stretch.

Footnotes
NEED SOME MONEY settled behind the two early leaders off the inside, continued to stalk in the three path up the backstretch in hand, advanced and
challenged on the outside turning for home, drew clear in the final furlong under steady handling. GIRL THIRSTY lacked speed toward the inside, rallied
from between horses in upper stretch, showed good resolve to be up late for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. ELI'S GIRL closest to the early
leader off the inside, moved to join that one to duel up the backstretch, vied between rivals second turn while inside the winner, could not match that one in
the drive, caught late from the outside for the place. J Z'S FIRST went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. CASHEW broke out, checked to spot
the field some early real estate, moved out, advanced five wide into the lane, continued with some mild interest to the end. HONORARY GUEST set the
early pace inside, dueled the middle three furlongs then gave way in the drive. FINAL WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SWEET SASSICAIA allowed the pace to go early while inside, continued to patiently save ground through the turn, called on for some run into the lane,
rallied, dueled, put that rival away late to prove best. SUZY DOLL'S READY broke sharp, cleared to the inside, set all the pace, responded when the winner
came calling along the inside in midstretch, dueled with that one past the sixteenth pole then slowly could not match strides, clear for the place. CAJUN
CATALINA pressed the runner up early from along the inside, fell back a bit and moved out for the turn, chased that same rival passed the furlong marker
as the winner was advancing, went flat late, narrowly saved the show. CUSTOM DESIGN in mid pack early toward the inside, shuffled back late
backstretch, roused into the lane, finished willingly the final furlong to miss the show. CAIRO CHARM went evenly throughout in lacking a closing kick.
JAYDYN CAT broke out, remained back in failing to menace. SUMMERTIME BANDIT within striking distance early, steadily retreated. ARMY DAY was
never a threat. MISSNEVERSATISFIED bothered at the start, raced back, bore out early in the turn, wrapped up, jogged in.

Footnotes
GOGO BOBBYJO broke sharply from the outside, cleared toward the inside soon after, given a bit of a breather through the turn then held the runner up
safe through the stretch. SWEETHEART VISION in the second flight while three wide up the backstretch, crept a bit closer to the winner while remaining in
the three path turning for home, could do little more with the winner the final furlong while holding sway for the place. FIELD OF LIGHTS also in the second
group up the backstretch, continued inside, finished up best of the rest in lacking a closing punch. DYLAN'S DREAM behind the pace inside, continued to
save ground turn, went evenly through the stretch. SUNSET FLASH broke back, lacked any early foot, swung out to the six path and widest exiting the turn,
improved position with some interest down the middle of the strip. KASENS TRIBE broke out and awkwardly to spot rival several lengths, remained back for
a half, improved position with some belated interest through some traffic. QUICK BITE in the second group while racing outside, came up empty for the
stretch run. SWEET REVIVAL saved ground to no avail in remaining back. DUCK ROOST raced four wide through the turn, failed to rally. WITH A SONG
remained back in lacking a rally. ZIPPITY ZOODA RED in the second flight early between horses, steadily faded. FIRST CLASS GIRL was finished before a
half.
