Footnotes
DROP UM broke a step slow then veered in sharply towards the rail at the break, was still quick enough to grab a share of the early lead, dueled inside of
PROWLING CAT through the turn, responded when roused at the top of the stretch, and drew off under a brisk hand ride in a solid debut.
KNIGHTWITHLOUIS broke outward at the start but quickly straightened out then hustled to join the early fray, stalked the dueling leaders three wide
through the turn, moved to challenge at the top of the stretch, raced a bit greenly though the lane but finished well enough to gain the place. PROWLING
CAT broke well then was able to get over to the two path before the turn, dueled with DROP EM through the turn then was unable to keep up with that foe
past the three-sixteenths pole, finished evenly under steady handling. IT'S A FACTOR broke well then chased inside through the turn, responded to right
handed urging down the stretch, finished evenly and had to steady near the wire. BIG BAD BERT broke with the rest but dropped far behind before the turn,
continued to chase under heavy pressure but was never a factor.

Footnotes
R HEART OF GOLD was sent away from the gate, assumed early command and set moderate fractions heading into the turn, dictated terms to the quarter
marker, was kept to task into the lane and drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, felt pressure into the final sixteenth, was all out in the final strides and lasted
for the win at the finish. WINNING LOVER was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the moderate early pace outside of the leading pair, advanced
three wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, spun three to four wide into the stretch and chased R HEART OF GOLD heading to the
furlong marker, responded into the final sixteenth, rallied in the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding safely for the place honors.
TAVERNELLE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked R HEART OF GOLD through moderate early fractions, attended to the pace two wide nearing
the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and chased R HEART OF GOLD nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, got caught in tight
behind the leading pair in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding clearly for third. MR. DUFF chased the moderate early pace, saved ground into
the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. IT'SANYBODYSGAME was void of early speed, guided to the two path into the turn, trailed to
the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch.

WHERE IT'S AT broke well and went to the front without being asked, soon joined by DADS DREAM before the turn, was taken under a hard hold and
slowed the pace down to a crawl, got a bit rank passing the seven-eighths and drifted out a path, carrying the rival out, continued down the backstretch still
under a tight hold with the DADS DREAM a constant shadow, quickened passing the half, then shook clear passing the quarter pole, took command at the
top of the stretch, was challenged and met a bid from GROGU, engaged in a furious run to the wire and won the head bob in the last jump. GROGU broke
inward at the start and bumped mutually with COME OUT FIGHTING, checked slightly then fought the rider while last going into the first turn, pulled towards
the leaders down the backstretch then relaxed a bit going into the far turn, went to challenge for the lead approaching the top of the stretch then came up a
nose short after a thrilling duel to the finish. DADS DREAM broke well and engaged with WHERE IT'S AT on the lead, was floated out on the first turn but
continued on shadowing that foe for step for step, quickened in tandem passing the half mile pole, dueled through the far turn, gave way near the quarter
pole but kept to task and was able to hold third. COME OUT FIGHTING broke out and mutually bumped with GROGU at the start then rebounded into
WHERE IT'S AT, sat just behind the two leaders going into the first turn, the took the rail approaching the six furlong mark, steadied briefly when WHERE
IT'S AT took the path, then was last of the compact field going down the backstretch, had to be ridden when the pace picked on going into the far turn and
was outrun from that point.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT was allowed to settle mid-pack and saved ground through the first half-mile, bided time then gradually advanced to a position just behind the
top two, checked slightly near the three furlong pole, then went into a drive, tipped out to the three path then split horses at the top of the stretch, finished
strong under steady handling and got up to share the top prize. PLAYBOY STYLE was prompted from the gate to get forward position and got into a stalking
position behind LYING GHOST into the clubhouse turn, pulled even near the five-sixteenths pole then dueled that foe down the lane, gained a short lead in
deep stretch, finished strong but had to share the prize in a solid effort. GALLANT WARREN tracked three wide behind the top pair and was content to hold
that position to the far turn, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, sustained the run through the stretch under strong handling and intermittent urging but
came up short in a blanket finish. LYING GHOST hustled from the break and easily gained the rail and the lead going into the clubhouse turn, managed to
set a pedestrian pace down the backstretch with the rest falling into line behind to the half-mile marker, tried to quicken away at that point and was set upon
by PLAYBOY STYLE, engaged that rival in a spirited duel down the stretch then weakened a bit in the last sixteenth. LOOKOUT POINT lacked any early
speed and lagged behind the field to the half mile marker, saved ground and slipped inside of POUR ON THE COLE on the far turn, angled out to the
middle of the track and finished with good energy but came up short. POUR ON THE COLE went three wide into the first turn the raced mid-pack not far
behind the leaders down the backstretch, launched a bid with three furlongs to run but could not go on with the others and was outrun to the finish.

Footnotes
MR. BIG HEART was away from the start a step slowly, was unhurried in the early going while a bit green, guided three wide into the turn, swung widest for
the drive and made a mild advance at the furlong marker, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and edged away under
hand urging in the final strides. NOT MY RODEO hustled away from the start, engaged with BEGIN AGAIN in the early stages and disputed the solid pace
heading into the turn, took a narrow lead at the quarter marker then shook free into the stretch, kicked clear approaching the furlong pole, was overhauled
by the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. NO MORE DING DONGS fractious prior to the start, was allowed to settle in the early
going, saved ground into the turn and trailed nearing the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive and improved position at the furlong pole, finished well
in the late stages and was clear at the finish for third. HARTMAN was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the solid early pace while outside of the
leading pair heading to the turn, chased two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted out into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could
not muster a late response and was outfinished for third. MAJESTIC COTTON settled in mid-pack away from the gate, tracked the solid early pace and
raced between rivals approaching the turn, came in tight and checked at the three-furlong pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and trailed at the
furlong marker, re-bid in the late stages but was unable to make an impact. ST BOADIN tracked the solid early pace from the inside, gained ground nearing
the quarter marker, chased into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way. BEGIN AGAIN broke alertly and assumed early
command, was engaged by NOT MY RODEO and contested the solid pace with that rival heading into the turn, dueled two to three wide nearing the quarter
marker, was outrun to mid-stretch and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
CLOVISCONNECTION broke alertly leaving the gate, ceded the early lead to SIR GREYSON and prompted that rival through decent fractions heading into
the turn, contested the pace two wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into the stretch and shook free at the furlong marker, drove clear into the
final sixteenth and powered home under firm hand urging to be much the best. STAR RACER was forwardly placed leaving the start, staked the decent
early pace from outside of the leading pair and was well positioned nearing the turn, gained ground three wide approaching the quarter pole, ran in pursuit
into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, could not impact the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished the rest to secure the place
honors. MURPHYS TIGER allowed to settle while never far back in the early going, trailed at the half-mile and was guided two wide and between runners
heading into the turn, waited for racing room while between rivals nearing the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch, split foes at the furlong pole
and rallied into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. SIR GREYSON was sent away from the
start, engaged with CLOVISCONNECTION and disputed decent early fractions with that rival heading into the turn, maintained a narrow lead into the bend
and set a prompted pace approaching the quarter marker, was asked for more into the stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, lacked a response into
the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. LOVE CANDY hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the inside,
was well placed heading into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the final stages.
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent early pace from the outside and raced four wide into the turn, lost
position at the quarter pole, went widest into the stretch, could not keep pace in the drive and tired.

Footnotes
EL JOY settled into a tracking position to the inside behind the pacesetting pair, built up some momentum through the turn then swung out three wide into
the stretch and unleashed a strong rally under a stiff hand ride to get up in plenty of time. NIGHT PROOF broke sharply then set out for the lead, was joined
by MACHO CHROME and went on with that one to set moderate fractions to the far turn, responded when set down near the quarter pole, opened up a lead
in the stretch, finished strong but could not hold off the winner. ROARING TIGER settled inside, well behind the pace, took the inside path through the far
turn, got clear run up the rail, loomed a threat in mid-stretch but could not find the needed response while holding clear for third. UPSTART YANKEE settled
two to three wide through the early going, launched a bid with three furlongs to run got clear run into the stretch then hit some traffic, altered path the outside
in mid-stretch, and finished willingly under strong handling and intermittent urging. SUGAR BEETS raced up close to the leaders while three wide, set down
to go after the leaders with three furlongs to run, swung four wide into the stretch then flattened out. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF broke a step slow and lacked
any speed from the break, settled at the rear of the field, started a run in the middle of the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and was gaining some
down the stretch but had far too much ground to make up. MACHO CHROME was away well and went into the first turn contending for the lead while racing
on the left lead, alternated setting the pace with NIGHT PROOF through moderate fractions, took a brief lead passing the quarter pole then faltered in the
stretch while racing on the wrong lead and dropped back through the field. OH GREAT (IRE) lagged near the back of the field through the early going,
started to make a move going into the turn but was unable to go on when the others quickened and was outrun the rest of the way.

Footnotes
LA PRIMER ESTRELLA was hustled away from the start, showed good speed and assumed early command, set a decent pace heading to the half-mile and
held a clear lead into the turn, was prompted along the bend and showed the way nearing the quarter pole, was set down into upper stretch and led to the
furlong marker, dug in while under pressure into deep stretch and held on in the final strides for a determined win. BOBBY'S GENIE took back off of the
decent early pace, tracked between rivals approaching the half-mile pole then was guided to the inside heading into the turn, came in tight at the quarter
marker and waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, chased into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, dove inside at the
sixteenth-marker and closed willingly in deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and held for second at the finish. AIRKITA
broke alertly, ceded the early lead to LA PRIMER ESTRELLA and stalked that runner through decent fractions heading to the half-mile marker, raced two to
three wide into the turn and prompted the pace nearing the quarter pole, chased LA PRIMER ESTRELLA into the stretch and was within aim at the furlong
marker, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for third. SOO BROOKLYN rated off of the decent early pace while not far back,
tracked from the inside and saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, offered a mild late response
but needed more in the final stages. LION'S LAIR was forwardly placed leaving the start, raced close up to the decent early pace and tracked while widest
nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a three to four wide bid approaching the quarter pole, could not sustain that run into the stretch and flattened out.
ROSE OF MOONCOIN hard sent leaving the start, failed to respond to that urging and trailed to the half-mile marker, was guided two to three wide along
the turn and trailed to the quarter pole, swung widest for the stretch drive and did not factor.
