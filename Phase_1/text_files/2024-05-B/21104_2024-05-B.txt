navigated the turn from the two path and kept on to the wire. CAT DADDY'S CAT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came
around the bend in the three path and finished evenly. WARRIOR'S FLEET raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the three path and made up some ground in the lane. CAJUN COUNTRY raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter, came
around the bend in the three path and showed no kick. R AND R STAR raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path and made no bid. CADILLAC BO tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded from there. HARD
SQUALL raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, angled in to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the stretch.
