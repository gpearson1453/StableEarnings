WHERE YOU GONNA GO sprinted clear early while setting the pace in hand, responded when challenged leaving the quarter pole and increased his
advantage. PAKAS SECRET saved ground chasing WHERE YOU GONNA GO, moved up to offer a bid to that one leaving the quarter pole but was unable
to match strides with that one late while clearly second best. COY ROY dropped back after an alert beginning, came five-wide into the stretch and rallied
late. LONG GONE SILVER was allowed to settle while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. MO MAMBO saved ground while being unhurried
and failed to be a factor.

clear late. EMPEROROFTHENORTH saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held on gamely
when headed. SUMMER SHANDEE was prominently placed racing between horses, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished well in a
steady effort. MY SUNSHINE was forwardly placed while three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MARKSMAN ON TARGET vied with
EMPEROROFTHENORTH for the lead from along the outside and weakened. PROUD LION prompted the issue for six furlongs while four-wide and tired.
BABY FRANKIE dropped back early and trailed.

Footnotes
CANDIED JOULE dueled with MANY MEMORIES for the led to the stretch from along the outside, was carried out slightly at the three-sixteenths pole then
shook that one off, responded when challenged by ALWAYS GALLANT at the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling. ALWAYS GALLANT
saved ground while being close-up slipped through entering the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to get by CANDIED
JOULE late in a game effort. MANY MEMORIES dueled with CANDIED JOULE from along the inside, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole
and held on fairly well for third. EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE was forwardly placed from between horses while racing two-wide, found room entering the stretch
but lacked a rally. VANDULIE was allowed to settle early, moved up three-wide to reach contention on the turn and then flattened out during the drive.
