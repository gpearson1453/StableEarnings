Footnotes
RUNNING RIO sped clear from inside, ridden along into the stretch, asked right handed past the eighth pole and drew away from the runner-up. LEE'S
BABY GIRL chased inside a pair of rivals under coaxing while off the rail, put to right handed urging in the two path around the bend, drifted out a bit in
upper stretch, could not make any headway on the winner late and held the place. WHAT ABOUT Q chased the lone speed outside a pair of rials, went four
wide into the turn, angled over to the rail around the bend, kept trying along the fence but could not get by LEE'S BABY GIRL for second. SHE'S MY FLAME
coaxed along near the backstretch, took the turn two then three wide, raced a bit greenly in the lane and could not threaten. PRESS YOUR LUCK was off
slow to begin, moved to the inside while trailing, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. RUNNIN ON PROMISES chased between foes to the
turn, lost ground three then two wide around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
LANSDOWNE (GB) broke a step slow, attended the pace three deep up the backstretch, came under a ride four wide on the turn, took aim entering the
stretch, dug in outside TULANE TRYST edged that rival in the closing moments. TULANE TRYST broke a step slow then moved up to press between foes
early, fought from the three path through the turn, grabbed the lead in upper stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and was bested by the winner
late. WINDRIBBON got fractious in the gate and had to be backed out then reloaded, broke alertly and out slightly, took control early under pressure from
outside, showed the way in the two path with a pair of rivals still hounding him around the bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, stayed on to the
sixteenth pole and faltered late. TRUSTY RUSTY stumbled leaving the gate, took a stalking position on the inside, saved ground through the turn, altered
out from behind the leader at the top of the lane, chased in range with a sixteenth remaining but flattened late. WINE AND WHISKY dropped back and
lagged behind early, saved ground around the bend and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
R HEISMAN pressed from outside then fought on even terms around the turn, inched ahead leaving the bend, cleared when roused in upper stretch and
padded the margin under hand urging. MR. MACHUPICCHU away quickly to take command, showed the way under pressure from R HEISMAN into the
turn, dueled with that rival around the bend, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and kept on for a clear second. NAP chased from inside, exited the bend
in the two path and tipped out a bit further at the top of the lane, could not produce a bid and churned on to hold third. EL ONDEADO chased the top pair
outside NAP, got floated out slightly at the top of the lane, shifted to the inside shortly after and weakened. ESCAPE PLAN brushed the gate then broke out
in a slow start, trailed four wide exiting the backstretch, moved into the three path around the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MYSTIC SPIRIT stalked from inside then tipped out and applied pressure on the first turn, lost touch with the leader and stalked up the backstretch,
challenged again on the far turn, dueled down the lane and dug in late to best KNOWN IDEA in the final strides. KNOWN IDEA took control early and
moved inside, got pressure around the clubhouse turn then moved clear early on the backstretch, took some awkward steps from the nine-sixteenths pole to
the half-mile pole but continued to show the way to the far turn, confronted by MYSTIC SPIRIT on the far turn, battled into and down the lane and yielded
grudgingly in the end. REFOCUS settled inside, drew closer in the middle stages, roused behind the leaders at the quarter pole, asked left handed into the
stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane and lacked the needed late punch in the final furlong. TRAVELIN' SHOW broke out, tracked two wide outside a rival
into the first turn then eased out to the four path around the bend, chased three deep up the backstretch, came two wide into the stretch, came up empty in
the lane and was not persevered with late. PRINCE PRANCEALOT stalked outside a rival then between foes, trailed two wide then along the rail on the far
turn and tired in the lane.

UR IN TROUBLE away quickly and fought for the lead between rivals, drifted out slightly and had to be ridden cautiously from the three-eighths pole to the
five-sixteenths marker and relinquished the lead, fought back outside QUEEN GIRVIN into the lane, regained command outside the eighth pole and edged
away in deep stretch. QUEEN GIRVIN raced up close inside a trio of rivals, launched a rail bid at the five-sixteenths pole and put a head in front, dueled with
UR IN TROUBLE into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, stayed in touch to midstretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. SUPER ENTICING coaxed
along early trailing the field, navigated the turn two wide then along the rail, moved off the fence in the lane and was along for the show. GREYLIGHT hit the
gate to lose a step at the start, pressed three deep between rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up approaching the quarter pole, driven three
wide into the lane and faded. PINEAPPLE CRUISE tracked five wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend and weakened. TOULOUSE
DETRAC away quickly from outside, vied four deep to the turn, could not keep pace with the top pair around the bend, tired and was eased in the final
furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
MALIBU COAST reserved along the inside then shifted to the two path and entered the backstretch between rivals, chased three wide into the far turn,
angled down to the rail and loomed dangerously behind the leader leaving the far turn, found room on the fence and was give his cue in upper stretch, took
over approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BEE CATCHER settled in the two wide then three deep around the first turn, challenged four deep at
the midway point, continued to fight four deep on the far turn then three deep with a quarter mile remaining, battled into the furlong grounds, could not match
the winner in deep stretch but kept on to edge NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) for second. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) stepped to the front and angled
over to the rail around the first turn, took pressure from a trio of rivals on the backstretch, maintained command around the far turn, resisted into the final
furlong, lost command outside the sixteenth pole and was outkicked for second. FLINT STROLL took back and moved into the two path, made progress still
two wide on the far turn, steered out in the lane, finished well and missed second and third three deep on the line. TOM AND JAZZY stalked keenly in hand
early from the two path, tugged forward to press the pace on the backstretch between rivals, fought two wide to the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. LIMITED HEATWAVE tracked three deep around the first turn, moved up to vie three deep between rivals on the backstretch, failed to keep up with
the top trio on the far turn, chased three wide into the lane and faded. SEATTLE BREAKOUT stalked from inside, dropped back to last on the far turn and
had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
NANCI GRIFFITH sped to the front and set the tone in the two path while under pressure on the first turn, cleared WARREN'S SHOWGIRL past the
three-eighths pole, was given her cue at the top of the lane, put to right handed urging with a furlong left to run and inched away in deep stretch.
WARREN'S SHOWGIRL pressed the pace from outside in the three path around the clubhouse turn, kept the pressure on up the backstretch, roused early
on the far turn but could not keep pace with the leader, continued to give chase from the three path leaving that bend, stayed within range into deep stretch
but could not summon the needed late kick. MINERAL RIGHTS bobbled a bit leaving the gate, raced keenly under a hold along the rail early, ridden along
on the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, failed to make any progress in the drive and finished a clear third. DEVIL D' ORO chased five wide outside rivals
around the first turn, chased four deep up the backstretch, navigated the far turn three then two wide and weakened. MISS ALLURE raced up close four
wide early, chased three deep between rivals in the middle stages, weakened two wide then along the rail on the far turn and came up empty in the drive.
BLONDZILLA stalked off the rail then between rivals, coaxed along at the midway point, asked right handed leaving the backstretch, tired around the far
turn, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ISSA COURT dueled into the first turn then took a stalking position outside the pacesetter around the bend, was closest in pursuit from the two path up the
backstretch, drew alongside the leader into the far turn, took over and cleared late on that bend, remained unchallenged into the final sixteenth, then
received a late threat from HEY DEMPS and lasted. HEY DEMPS pulled along the inside early, continued to tug the rider along early on the backstretch to
the half-mile pole, needed room behind the leader on the inside then shifted to the two path and was boxed in at the quarter pole, roused chasing behind
ISSA COURT into the stretch, shifted in to bother rivals inside the eighth pole, straightened course and set his sights on the ISSA COURT, surged late from
outside and ran out of time. JESSEBEAR reserved in the two path early on, had to steady and altered in early on the backstretch, drew closer past the
half-mile pole, roused two then three wide on the second bend, tipped out in the lane and got up for the show honors. QUANTUM INNERGY unhurried and
tucked inside towards the rear, drew closer still along the rail on the far turn, tipped out and went between foes in upper stretch, got forced into a tight spot
and checked between rivals past the eighth pole, kept on through deep stretch and lost third. SWEET LAYLA RAE brushed the gate, tracked two wide
around the first turn, continued a bit off the rail into the far turn then moved to the inside, steered out in upper stretch, paused briefly when cautious of
trouble rivals midstretch, then ridden out through the late stages. CHAMAVILLE tracked three deep, roused on the far turn and took aim three wide into the
stretch only to weaken down the lane. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY sent for the lead from inside and dueled with outer rival into the first turn, cleared that rival
around the bend, showed the way to the far turn, headed at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command and could not keep pace with the new leader late on the
bend, got put in tight on the fence and checked inside the eighth pole and weakened after. BACK ON TRACK stalked four then three wide on the clubhouse
turn, had to take hold and alter inward around rival who was pulling up early on the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then two wide and was not
persevered with in the final furlong. BLONDE BOMBSHELL forwardly placed in the two path, sustained an injury and pulled up early on the backstretch and
was transported off the track via equine ambulance. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED HEY DEMPS FROM SECOND TO
SEVENTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO BOTH QUANTUM INNERGY AND COUNCILWOMAN JILLY NEAR THE EIGHTH
POLE.
