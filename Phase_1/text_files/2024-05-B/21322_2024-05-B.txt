Footnotes
WICKLOW LADDIE was allowed to settle off the top trio up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive, responded when
called upon, roused forward and collared the embattled duo approaching the final sixteenth and held clear. RAZOR WIRE tracked the pace in the opening
quarter, moved up three wide with three furlongs left to run, dueled outside of MADETHEDEANSLIST around the turn, battled on into the lane, got collared
by the WICKLOW LADDIE approaching the sixteenth pole, fought back gamely but had to settle for second best. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST was forwardly
placed racing just off the early leader, moved up in tandem with RAZOR WIRE with three furlongs left to run, vied around the turn, battled on into the lane
and came up empty late. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace, got collared by outside duo upon entering the turn,
swung four wide into the upper stretch and steadily faded. COUNTY JAIL raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

MISTER CHAIRMAN tracked the top pair up the backstretch, moved up to engage duo mid-way around the turn, shook off MEDICINE TAIL and kept on with
WESTONS WILDCAT, battled on two wide into the lane, took a slight edge along the outside, dug in under firm handling, fought off stubborn inside foe and
edged away. WESTONS WILDCAT vied for the early lead with MEDICINE TAIL, took on the challenge of MR CHAIRMAN mid-way around the turn, battled
on for command with rival holding a slight edge, stayed on stubbornly then yielded late. ITWASTHISBIG rated just off the early pace racing four paths wide,
angled to the rail late on the turn, tipped wider for the drive and churned on for a share. BIG BOSS BEN stalked four wide in the early going, hustled along
two wide around the turn and failed to threaten late. MEDICINE TAIL vied inside of WESTONS WILDCAT for the early lead, weakened when the winner
moved up to challenge mid-turn and retreated in the lane. MY UNCLE LEON raced in range along the outside, was ridden three to four wide around the
turn, eased up mid-stretch, walked across the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
KINGSWOOD vied for the lead with RECORDER from the onset, matched strides up the backstretch and continued to battle through the turn, shook free
turning for home, widened advantage then held late under a driving finish. THUNDERSHOOK settled off the early pace, chased two wide without much
response around the turn, found another kick in reserve in the final furlong, surged to the wire and ran out of time. COWBOY DON tracked the top trio,
launched a three wide bid around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and secured a share. RECORDER hooked up with KINGSWOOD in
initial stages and dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle through the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner turning for home, ran on then
weakened late. GINGER RULES raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the stretch and showed some interest in final stages. CONQUERED briefly
vied for the early lead, chased in range around the turn then faded in the lane. TOUGH COMPANY had no response racing in the back, lost contact with the
field in upper stretch and jogged in. PER RULING #ECM2024-183 FROM HIWU, THUNDERSHOOK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED
DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
IRISH VALOR settled around the first turn and into the early backstretch, picked up the pace nearing the half mile marker, launched a a bid around the far
turn, dug in two paths wide down the lane and got a nose up on the wire. AMERICAIN JOEY vied for the early lead then edged back and stalked the top
pair, launched a three wide rebid mid-way around the far turn, took over the lead, continued to dig in gamely in the final furlong and got nipped in final stride.
ASSUMPTION rated while saving ground through early stages, hustled up two wide midway around the far turn, shifted four wide at the head of the lane,
sustained a steady bid and cleared the rest. CHISHOLM TRAIL raced off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide around the far turn, shifted in a
couple paths and lacked the needed kick for serious impact. SUBURBAN PRINCE vied for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not
match strides past the mid-way point on the far turn and gave way. FAKE SOLUTION raced off the pace, edged up closer racing four wide around the final
turn, fanned wide into upper stretch and gave way. POKER PLAY was forwardly placed around the first turn, vied for the lead up the backstretch then
quickly retreated around the far turn.
