Footnotes
TRUVY'S BANDIT back off pace, moved up to race in the second fight, asked late turn bid between foes, proved best under steady handling. HEZA SEXY
ZONG in the second fight while racing four wide, fell back a bit late turn then came again to earn the place between horses. OLDER AND WISER back off
the early pace, staged a mild rally to earn the show. JAMAICAN ME void of early foot, came five wide out of the turn, improved position. CUSTOM PRAYER
sprinted clear to set the pace, showed the way for over a half, faltered when headed by the winner in midstretch. BYATHREAD lacked speed, was fanned
six wide into the stretch, angled in, failed to rally. CLASSIC RED RACER within striking distance early, tired in the drive. SMART ANALYSIS saved ground
to no avail.

Footnotes
HUNTLEIGH in the second flight inside, called on for some run late in the final turn, engaged the leader from the outside nearing the furlong grounds, wore
that rival down under firm handling. HAUNTRESS dueled up front along the inside, disposed of that rival second turn, responded and turned back a second
foe upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late. A LIL PSYCHOTIC in the second flight off the inside and outside the winner, advanced and lodged a
brief bid outside the runner up into the stretch, failed to sustain that effort in the drive. WORLD OF HURT void of speed, came five wide into the lane, staged
a mild, belated rally to improve position. ATHENAIS made a mild advance into the stretch, flattened out the final furlong. HONEST ANGUS steadily faded.
HIGH DONNA dueled up front in the two path, stopped.

Footnotes
MOON TRIP last to leave, continued to lack speed, circled five wide into contention with a strong move in the second bend, challenged entering the stretch,
proved best in the run to the wire while drifting in a bit late. MOONOVERMONTGOMERY with the pace into the first turn closest to the inside, continued to
vie up the backstretch, edged away from the other speed in the second turn, responded when the winner came alongside exiting that bend, gave ground
grudgingly to that rival while clearly second best. MY UNCLE BILLY lacked early foot, four wide through the final turn when making a moderate advance,
continued with some additional mild interest through the lane to finish up best of the rest. WATCH THE COAST five wide into the first turn, fell back and
dropped inside, continued to save ground second turn, went evenly through the lane. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE vied four wide into the first turn, continued to
contest the issue up front while racing outside, began to weaken second turn, continued to falter through the lane. WILD FIST void of speed, managed a
modest improvement into the lane then flattened. ROCKY BOY remained back in failing to threaten. COLE'S SENSATION vied between rivals and outside
the runner up early, stopped to finish well back, jogged in.

Footnotes
BACK BAYOU broke well, quickly sprinted out to a long early leader, saw that advantage shrink through the turn when given a breather, remained clear
through the stretch under steady handling. SAUCY ARGUMENT lacked early foot, picked way through some traffic while toward the inside late in the turn,
continued willingly to the wire to earn the place. PUPPETEER settled in mid pack early, made a good gain when asked in the turn, came four wide for the
drive, flattened out a bit in the late going to settle for the place. HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT lacked early foot outside, fanned seven wide into the stretch, mild
late interest. HALF CRAZY in the second flight while racing three wide, remained within striking distance through the turn, lacked a closing punch through
the lane to finish up evenly. IDE LIKE HAWAII raced in mid pack outside, four to six wide through the stretch, lacked a closing bid. TUCKER THE GRUMP in
the second flight for a half along the inside, had little left the final furlong. ST PIERRE off sluggishly, remained well back early, improved position a bit while
not proving to be a serious threat. CARLOS'S MAMA underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, well back early, passed some tiring rivals to also better his
position without posing a menace. FREE FROM GUILT in mid pack early, tired in the drive. CLEVER PRINCE in the main body early along the inside,
steadily retreated after a half. COUNT ON RAIN in the second group early while between rivals, began to back up before a half.

Footnotes
FITZY broke well, set a pressured pace in the two path up the backstretch, allowed the runner up the inside far turn, repelled that rival into the stretch to be
clear, not threatened in the run to the wire. POT'S PAYCHECK light bump early, behind the early pace, advanced and tried the winner from along the rail
through the turn, turned back into the stretch, remained well clear for the place. LADY CHERYL'S SONG squeezed back early, moved out and raced four
wide into and through the turn, went evenly through the stretch to finish best of the others. RANOLOGY balked at loading, broke back, improved position a
bit without posing a threat. GEMMY came in early to help squeeze back, LADY CHERYL'S SONG, pressed the runner up from the outside, began to fade in
the turn, continued to retreat through the lane. REINE LE FER broke back and failed to menace. SECRET WINE off slow, raced well back, jogged in.

Footnotes
JAYS HOLIDAY unhurried in the early going after a bump, swept up to a contending position four to five wide by late in the second turn, lost some ground to
the leader as a result, displayed good resolve to keep that advance going, late bid, edged clear in the final furlong. RISING KOTO STAR broke sharp, set or
forced the pace along the inside, clear stretch, could not contain the winner in the waning strides. SOUTH SIDE settled off the pace inside, continued to
save ground middle half mile, moved out, getting to runner up. INFINITESIMAL in the second flight, lodged a three wide bid turning for home and hung.
NEPHI set or forced the early pace in the two path, weakened through the stretch. DOUBLE ON THE RED jostled early and was then five wide through the
first turn, four to three wide in the second bend, also retreated down the lane. GOTTA DEAL remained back in failing to menace. CHIEF KIMOSABI bumped
early, six wide into the first turn, was finished early.

Footnotes
SHE HAS IT ALL broke well from between horses, showed the way into the turn off the inside, headed into the stretch from the outside, dueled with that rival
to the wire, battled back in game fashion to prove best. SASSI STRUTTER pressed the winner in the three path early, advanced and put a head in front
entering the stretch, extended duel to the wire, outkicked in the late going. CORA PEARL in the second flight outside, four wide turning for home, proved no
match for the top two. SHELLEY'S MONEY last away, lacked speed, picked off a couple of rivals late in showing some mild interest the final furlong.
THISONEISFORYOU behind the to two in the run up the backstretch, continued to chase, had little left for the final furlong. MALIBU TOAST settled off the
pace, lacked a closing response. NANA'S CORN MUFFIN fell back to trail into the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
APRIORITY AVENGER close from the start off the inside, was challenging for the lead when floated five wide into the lane, continued on well, edging clear
late. ROCKING TOBE broke on top, set a pressured pace closest to the inside into and through the turn, got out a bit to carry a pair of foes out into the
stretch, lugged out with a furlong remaining to bother APRIORITY ROCKET then outlasted lasted that one to the wire. APRIORITY ROCKET prompted the
pace off the inside, was challenging between horses and inside the winner when also floated out turning for home, bothered again as ROCKING TOBE
lugged out nearing the furlong marker, altered and ducked to the inside but could not get by that same rival for the second spot. THE LAST CAT lacked
speed, raced five wide through the turn, failed to muster a closing response. LOST MY BAG rank early when racing back, displayed some belated interest to
improve over several rivals late while between horses. THE FACT IS raced in mid pack and outside, five wide through the turn, lacked a serious closing
response. CADILLAC BO in the main body toward the inside, asked along in the turn, came up empty for the drive. TIME ON THE TOWN made little impact
from well back. MY BUDDY off slowly, moved up, lodged a brief rail bid late in the turn and stopped. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE RUN THROUGH MIDSTRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF APRIORITY ROCKET AGAINST ROCKING TOBE FOR
INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.
