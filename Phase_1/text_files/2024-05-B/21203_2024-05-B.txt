SUAVE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a late challenge and missed under steady

show. UPPITY UP allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and improved position to gain a share. TEAM FEISTY
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded the final furlong. VARSITY DOLL
well placed and outside, steadily lost ground. MY BRIDGET VERDOT broke a step slowly from the gate and was no factor.

Footnotes
HE'S ON THE FLY led early inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, came through inside the leader, came again to edged ahead and held
under steady pressure. ROCK WITH YOU set the early pace well off the rail, shook clear three and four wide through the turn, then drifted out slightly into
the stretch, loosing sway, then could no challenge the winner, while best of the rest. CAPTAIN MAD JACK well placed, gained position three wide through
the turn, came four and five wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. MR TITO'S unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came
three wide into the stretch, and held a share. SPICY SHOT unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and
improved position. EXECUTIVE SIGHT never far back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final
furlong. PONT DU GARD passed tiring rivals. GALAXY BUILDER was never involved. BLOODPROF was a brief factor.
