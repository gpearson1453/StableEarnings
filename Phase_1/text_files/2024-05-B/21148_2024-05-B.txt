WHERE'S THE PUMPS broke alertly then quickly crossed over to set the pace, drew clear and was kept to task. CHURCH HARBOR settled early, shifted
out leaving the final turn, rallied outside of TELLTALE and was up in time. TELLTALE sat just of the the pace in the turn, was roused at the head of the lane,
lacked the rally needed and was worn down. VILLA NOVA saved inside and lacked a kick. NO MORE JO KING chased outside and failed to threaten.
FASTESTGIRLINTOWN stumbled hard leaving, and chased throughout.

KAUAI DAN vied between foes, drew clear into the final turn, opened up through the stretch under a brisk hand ride. SLEW'S BAK pressed the early pace
from the rail, chased the leader into the lane, and held under a long drive for place. BON PRIX sat just off the pacesetters, drove five wide at the head of the
lane, closed gradually through the stretch and missed after a good effort. EL NOBLE saved inside early, lodged a bid inside but lacked the kick required.
WEDGE POND broke alertly but was outsprinted to the turn, was roused into the stretch but came up empty. POINT TO THE STARS lacked a solid bid.
CAB SAV chased outside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SIX SHOTS OF T was quickest to the turn, drew away through the turn, and was kept under light handling. KISS ME HELLO chased the leader, was no
match for the eventual winner and held for place. TRAPEZE brushed leaving, chased five wide leaving the final turn, closed well and missed. CASSANO
broke inward brushing inside rival, raced three to four wide into the opening turn, and lacked a closing response. MARINE MAGIC bumped leaving the gate,
and offered a mild rally late. JOKERSRWILD AGAIN broke outward into MARINE MAGIC and rallied mildly. DO YOU NO WHO I AM offered little. SPEEDY
PIEDY some early interest and faded.

Footnotes
ALL RUN vied hard outside, sat just off the early leader, moved up alongside SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS to contest the lead, and edged clear in the late
stages. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS was quickest to the turn, led the way, responded to challenge from ALL RUN, and weakened late stretch. VARATTI sat
in range while four wide and closed gradually under steady encouragement then missed. COOLWIND dropped back leaving the backstretch, and closed
steadily late. BRODY'S PAL bumped leaving, settled inside, and offered a late bid. LIFES ADVENTURE bumped from the gate, hustled to the opening turn,
and gave way late. PACHECO last away and passed tiring foe. SMART CAT showed little.

SKIPPER'S PRIDE contested the early lead inside of CAPE COMANDER, responded gamely from a looming threat from TICKET TO THE TOP, and drew
clear in the final sixteenth. TICKET TO THE TOP sat in striking range, took closer order nearing the final turn, loomed boldly nearing the three sixteenth
pole, was no match for the winner and finished second best. SHINING TIGER bumped leaving the gate, raced wide into the stretch, and got by late for show
honours. CAPE COMANDER contended the early pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and was caught late for show. SAMURAI
CHALLENGE bumped leaving, and trailed. HALLISAR chased inside and tired.

Footnotes
TIGERITO sat midpack from four to five wide, swung three wide in the final turn, drifted in nearing the eighth pole, grabbed the lead into the stretch and
edged clear. LAHUN chased inside, shifted out to the four path, and closed well to earn place. RUN ROSSCO RUN stalked three wide, overtook the lead
into the final turn, rallied inside of TIGERITO, was not able to move on, then held for show. ROCK CHALK trailed early, shifted inside nearing the stretch,
lodged bid inside then flattened late. AMEER chased outside and came up empty in the drive. LADY KALIPA hurried to the front, and left nothing for the
drive. STAY OUTA MY WAY vied outside, fanned three to four wide, and faded.
