Footnotes
BLAZE ON vied with SHORT OF DINERO for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off leaving the three-eighths pole and quickly drew clear then
was ridden out to increase her advantage. ABUNDANT LIFE was prominently place while racing three-wide, could not threaten the winner but proved clearly
second best. BOSSY BOOTS saved ground while being reserved early, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SHORT
OF DINERO vied for the early lead from along the inside and weakened. HOPEFUL CURE was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the stretch and
was not a serious factor.

CITY HUMOR saved ground setting the pace in hand and maintained a safe advantage. I WANNA ROCK was allowed to settle early, came eight-wide into
the stretch and closed strongly. SEAX was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out three-wide during the drive and finished well
for third in a steady effort. RIGHT QUICK saved ground while dropping back, angled out 2-wide nearing the quarter pole to split rivals and was gaining late.
ON THE CHILL chased CITY HUMOR to the stretch and weakened. WHO KNEW GIRVIN was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide and
failed to seriously threaten. FAST LEARNER gave way after showing brief speed while racing four-wide. TYRANT REGIME saved ground throughout and
failed to menace.

GEAUX YOSHKA was allowed to settle early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and quickly drew clear.
RED DEVOLUTION set the pressured pace while three-wide into the stretch, responded when headed and held on well for the place. BONNIE BILL was
reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid and then flattened out. SPRITZER was unhurried early, came
three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. RAHMER disputed the issue while racing two-wide, was in tight between horses nearing the quarter
pole and weakened. CLASSY SOLUTION was prominent early racing along the inside, steadied nearing the quarter pole in tight and finished willingly when
clear. MY BEAU was close-up early while racing four-wide and weakened during the drive. THE RIGHT OF RAHMER LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
BONNIE BILL, BUT AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS OF THE RACE THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
