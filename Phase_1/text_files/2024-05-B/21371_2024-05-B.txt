Footnotes
SIMPLY JACK settled just off the pace about the four path the opening turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, closed to the lead in the three path
toward the head of the land and dug in to draw clear late yards. NEVER GREW UP tapered in and stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. MON GATEAU rated the pace
inside, was pressured toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the head of the lane then missed the nod in the stretch duel for
second. COMMON PROSPERITY saved ground racing well off the pace, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path and flattened leaving the turn. HERE COMES RUSTY settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. TAPACHILL raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
GLENHOLME raced off the rail the first turn and never factored. OBOY saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened at the rail into the far turn.

Footnotes
WATERLOO ROSE became a bit anxious in the gate, rounded the opening turn about the four path and started her bid nearing the five sixteenths pole,
raced in the five path on the far turn and dug in widest to take over the final yards. MRS. DEL raced off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and took over at the rail past the eighth pole, dug in from the head of the lane but was caught in the final yards. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY raced in the
three path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well to take third the final stride. RIDE
THE RAPIDS rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, kept the edge near the rail on the far turn, drifted into the
stretch and remained a factor to mid-stretch before relenting. MISS ANTIETAM saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. FORTUNATA ITALIA raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. FLAT DISCOUNT rated close off the rail, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, remained close off the rail on the far turn but was
carried out entering the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TIZAFASTBULLET ducked out leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took over later
yards. LANDON JACK pressured the pace at mostly even terms, contested the edge two deep on the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement,
gave up the lead later yards but continued the duel for second. THANK YA PETE set a pressured pace at mostly even terms with Landon Jack, contested at
a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. AIR KENNEY gave chase, raced in the four path on the
turn and ran evenly in the lane. GOLDEN ADAGE chased inside, entered the turn near the rail, angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane and
passed some rivals. BILLYKUS gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. SMOKIN SMITTY gave chase and rounded the
turn in the four and five paths. GREEK EASTER chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. MIMS HAT TRICK popped
open the stall gate prior the break then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. MONEY MAC came away awkwardly and
saved ground on the turn.
