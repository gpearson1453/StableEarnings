off in the lane. APRIL FLOWER BOUND raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far
bend from the two path and chased on in the stretch, no match for the wire. AUNT KENDRA saved ground around the first bend, tracked the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path and never threatened. CARBONEL raced in the two path around the first turn,
stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field from the three path around the far turn and was empty in the lane.
