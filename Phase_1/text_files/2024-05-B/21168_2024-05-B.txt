DESVIO , unhurried while saving ground, eased off the inside advancing past the five sixteenths, shifted out to about the six path in upper stretch, leveled
off under right handed asking inside the furlong grounds, overtook ST. JOHN'S from his outside in deep stretch then went clear at the wire. ST. JOHN'S ,
under snug rating early while saving ground, pulled his way forward to the inside of rivals heading to the half, angled out near the quarter pole, worked
further out past the three sixteenths, rallied past the dueling leaders to take the lead a sixteenth out, kept on gamely but could not resist the winner.
PORQUEROLLES rated forwardly and towards the inside, edged up then bid between foes around the far turn, emerged in a duel to the inside of
UNDERSTUDY KITTY into the lane, exchanged a bump with that one soon after, stayed on to battled past the sixteenth pole then faded late.
UNDERSTUDY KITTY stalked in hand while off the inside, bid three deep around the far turn, sparred on a short lead outside PORQUEROLLES, bumped
with that one near the three sixteenths, remained a solid presence to the sixteenth marker then faded. CHELONIAN , three wide, took closer order into the
far turn, chased the embattled leaders to the quarter pole then came up empty. BREAKWATER rated towards the inside, edged up two wide between rivals
near the far turn, saved some ground into the stretch but failed to drum up a serious response. SOUTHERN LAD , keen to a clear lead, set the pace under
rating and towards the inside, dug in when meeting outer bids around the far turn, stayed on to the head of the lane then weakened. JOLLY BY GOLLY ,
four wide early, drafted in and gave way. RAKIA , four wide, failed to go on under pressure near the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
APPLE PICKER , off the pace in about the two path, was under a hustling ride gathering momentum into the lane, worked between runners in mid stretch,
eased out, closed sharply under stout left handed asking, took control outside SWALL in deep stretch then eagerly went clear. SWALL prompted the pace
three wide outside SWEET SHILD O MINE, applied more pressure past the five sixteenths, dueled briefly in upper stretch, shook clear under a drive a
furlong out, failed to contain the winner but continued with good effort to the wire. LATE FROST , away a bit awkwardly, recovered and pulled her way
forward towards the inner rail, rated off heels nearing the turn, gained inside under a ride nearing mid stretch, altered out then flattened out very late.
ROYAL POPPY broke slowly, raced well back into and around the turn, swung six to seven wide in upper stretch and finished with good energy. DISCO
EBO had speed to the inside of rivals then was rated back nearing the half, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide under a hearty ride into the
stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. SWEET SHILD O MINE took over outside DISCO EBO early on then dropped in when clear, set the pace
towards the inside, took pressure past the five sixteenths, ceded the lead in upper stretch, stayed on to remain a solid presence past mid stretch then gave
way in the final seventy yards. ANONYMOUSLY , fractious in the gate, raced between foes early, was under a ride three wide mid turn but failed to respond.

Footnotes
CONCEPTUALIZE accelerated to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, floated out a bit turning for home and was kept to her business in the drive.
MODAROSA , a forward factor near the inner rail on the turn, chased the winner in a willing effort and remained on her left lead in the stretch. THE
AMAZING MIZZEN lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. UP FOR
IT , steadied behind the winner after breaking slowly, moved to the inner rail leaving the turn and weakened. SHARED AUTHORITY chased the early pace,
raced in the two path on the turn and gave way. RYE SMILE , outrun, drifted six wide leaving the turn. CALL THE QUESTION broke well along the inner rail
and was done early. LENAMAGNETTA , three wide on the turn, drifted to the four path turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
FROST FREE was sent clear early, set the pace off the inside, entered the lane three to four wide, kept on under left handed asking past mid stretch,
wandered outward, was corrected inside the sixteenth pole with right handed encouragement then proved resolute to the wire. CATS BY FIVE , urged inside
chasing the winner, eased out in upper stretch, continued strong pursuit past the furlong grounds, drifted out a bit late and continued gamely to steadily
bridge the gap. MR SKYLIGHT , off slowly then ducked in toward the gap spotting the field multiple lengths, recovered and raced well back into the turn,
saved ground advancing past the quarter pole, came off the inside for the drive and finished well. CATAHOULA MOON stalked the pace three deep past the
three eighths, shifted wider under pressure into the stretch, gave willing chase mid stretch then came up empty late. MARKET STREET bobbled at the
break, was lightly shuffled early, dropped back into the turn then lacked a rally. PETINGAS TWIN saved ground giving hard chase, raced forwardly to about
the quarter pole then gave way. SWEET SODDY J , between runners leaving the far turn while chasing the pace, lacked a punch past the five sixteenths
and retreated. CLASSIC JOKE , four to five wide, failed to make an impact and gave way into the stretch.

advanced outside TEQUILERA to take command in upper stretch and pulled away under energetic urging. FIVE TOWNS (GB) , allowed to settle early,
raced in the two path leaving the backstretch, followed the winner in the two path around the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and finished willingly.
TEQUILERA gained the lead outside BLISSFUL mid way on the backstretch, moved over to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground the far turn,
lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. BLISSFUL showed speed along the inner rail, weakened on the far turn, faltered in the stretch and switched to
her left lead inside the eighth pole. ASCENDANCY , up close in the two path on the first turn, remained in striking position on the backstretch, circled the far
turn three wide and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER CHOW , hard sent between runners to take the lead, moved clear leaving the five eighths, set the pace under some rating and towards the inner
rail, was put to a ride entering the lane, widened under brisk urging past mid stretch, wandered outward a bit late and held firm. PREVALENCE tracked
under rating while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch, kept on gamely while drifting out some late and slowly cut
into the winner's margin. PRINCE OF JERICHO , taken to rate off the pace, dropped in towards the rail around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch,
moved up past the furlong grounds and churned on. COASTAL MISSION broke a step slow, moved up to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, was ridden
along pursuing past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, angled back in past mid stretch but lacked a solid finish. JAXON TRAVELER
rated three wide outside PREVELANCE while stalking the pace, came under a ride past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened.
BOURBON BASH , off the pace three to four wide, was under asking nearing the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
FULMINEO stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, gained command in upper stretch and drew off under
steady handling. CRYSTAL QUEST hugged the inner rail down the backstretch, waited for room approaching the turn, remained along the rail, checked in
tight quarters entering the stretch, eased off the rail and rallied gamely inside foes. ABRUMAR , steadied when bearing out at the start, raced in the two path
between horses leaving the backstretch and on the far turn, steadied in close quarters approaching the stretch, angled outside and rallied on his left lead.
MASSIF lacked speed, stayed along the inner rail the first turn, moved up a bit on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired
horses. ECHO LANE , steadied when bearing in leaving the starting gate, was kept outside horses throughout, floated to the seven path in upper stretch
and was no factor. SPEEDYNESS , clear soon after the start, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way in mid stretch. NAPTOWN raced near the inner
rail on both turns and weakened through the stretch. TOCAYO came out at the break, prompted the pace outside SPEEDYNESS and faltered. BUCKIN'
DREAMER , outside horses down the backstretch, chased the pace and faltered entering the stretch.

Footnotes
CORPORATE POWER , forwardly placed four wide, took closer order leaving the far turn, saw the leaders get away a bit leaving the three sixteenths,
picked things back up under left handed encouragement, leaned in slightly exchanging contact with IMPERIAL GUN near the sixteenth pole, corrected to
sustain his bid then got the bob at the wire. GOULD'S GOLD prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure while in hand
past the three eighths, dueled, shook clear under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted by outer rivals inside the sixteenth marker,
kept on in valiant fashion and was nipped at the line. IMPERIAL GUN , a bit washy, raced in close attendance three wide and between horses, dropped
back a bit nearing the lane, bumped with the winner when working outward for room near the sixteenth marker then came back gamely between foes. REAL
MACHO steadied when in tight at the break, regrouped and settled well back off the inside, angled six wide under a ride in upper stretch and finished with
interest. DAILY GRIND sped to the front then dropped in towards the rail, took pressure into the far turn then dueled, stayed on well past mid stretch then
weakened late. D DAY SKY , between foes early, edged up some nearing the far turn, chased wide into the lane but came up empty. CIRCLE P , off a beat
slow, raced between foes near the half, angled in to gain past the five sixteenths, had aim into the stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened.
DEPOSITION steadied off heels into the first turn, recovered and saved ground stalking, lacked a punch leaving the far turn and gave way. There was a
stewards' inquiry into the stretch run and an objection by the rider of IMPERIAL GUN against the winner alleging interference in late stretch. No action was
taken.

Footnotes
GROOMS ALL BIZNESS broke well, raced inside horses down the backstretch and on the turn, eased off the rail turning for home, was blocked and altered
course to the seven path in mid stretch, closed with a rush on his left lead, led late and drove clear. WITTY , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate,
circled the turn four to five wide, gained a short led near the sixteenth pole and was out finished. SMOOTH B chased the pace racing in the two path around
the turn, remained between rivals through the stretch, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. WHERE'S RAY stumbled soon after the
break, worked between horses, steadied in traffic entering the stretch and finished willingly between rivals. BEER CAN MAN came in at the break, raced
forwardly while wide around the turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. HUNTER JOE lacked speed, swung to the seven path in mid
stretch and passed tired horses. BOAT'S A ROCKIN disputed the pace in the two path down the backstretch and on the turn, held the lead in mid stretch
then weakened inside horses. CAROTARI showed speed inside horses, hugged the inner rail around the turn and gave way. SURPRISE BOSS was outrun.
THAT'S RIGHT , three deep disputing the pace for three furlongs, gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BALNIKHOV (IRE) , unhurried early while saving some ground, edged up past the three eighths then eased out to work between rivals approaching the
quarter pole, shifted further out to take aim on the dueling leaders in upper stretch, closed in under left handed asking to take command near the furlong
grounds, spurted clear then held firm while solidly hand ridden the final seventy yards. CRABS N BEER rated three wide early on, angled further out leaving
the far turn, circled five wide advancing into the lane, straightened and took closer order in mid stretch, switched over to his left lead near the sixteenth
marker and gave game chase to the wire. RUNNING BEE stalked three wide and outside a rival, moved in hand to engage the leader into the far turn, took
a short lead past the three eighths then edged away briefly, was taken on from his inside by HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) entering the lane, dueled to about mid
stretch then faded late. HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) rated forwardly while saving ground, took closer order when easing out past the half, checked when
attempting to work through a seam soon after, regrouped and bid to the inside of RUNNING BEE, near the quarter pole, sparred with that one past the three
sixteenths then gave way in the final seventy yards. ATONE , between runners while not far back early on, moved up four wide and between foes past the
three eighths, gave chase into the lane then weakened while on his left lead. EONS settled off the pace and off the inside, was under pressure past the five
sixteenths but lacked a rally. ENGLISH BEE rated inside early, eased out, was under a hustling ride chasing three wide past the quarter pole, lacked a
further response and gave way. BEATBOX lost ground four to five wide outside rivals, was under coaxing leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on entering
the lane and faltered. HELMS DEEP cleared early in hand while off the inside, dropped in to set the pace, took pressure into the far turn, stayed on past the
five sixteenths then tired.

Footnotes
SEIZE THE GREY sprinted to the early lead, set a controlled pace near the inner rail, was well clear on the far turn, came under a ride near the five
sixteenths, kept on under solid left handed encouragement past mid stretch, drifted out approaching the finish and held firm while steadily hand ridden
through the final yards. MYSTIK DAN, away in good order, was taken to rate while saving ground and within range, crept closer past the half mile marker,
eased out leaving the far turn, was corrected when drifting in a bit in upper stretch, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds, flattened out late and just held
the place. CATCHING FREEDOM, snugly rated early while towards the inside, moved up in about the two path into the far turn, gained inside rivals under a
ride approaching the stretch, worked outward for the final three sixteenths, finished gamely and just missed second. TUSCAN GOLD, away last when
bumped and put in tight by JUST STEEL, regrouped and raced off the pace and removed from the inside, was ridden along outside a rival into the stretch
then finished up with interest through the final sixteenth. JUST STEEL broke outward bumping TUSCAN GOLD, corrected and edged up four wide to stalk
the pace, remained well wide while taking closer order leaving the far turn, circled five wide under a ride into the stretch, lacked a punch near mid stretch
then gave way. UNCLE HEAVY saved ground most of the way and failed to get involved. IMAGINATION, under firm rating outside the winner into the first
turn, stalked that one three wide through the backstretch, failed to go on under pressure in upper stretch then gave way. MUGATU, off the pace and
removed from the rail, lost ground four to five wide past the half mile marker, faltered in upper stretch, was eased late then walked off.

Footnotes
UNION FLEET was alertly taken to the inner rail after breaking slowly, saved ground around the first turn, eased off the rail on the backstretch, swung to the
four path entering the stretch, closed outside horses and was up at the wire. IT'S VIPER , three wide leaving the first turn, stalked the pace down the
backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn and rallied gamely between horses. FRIGHTLAND chased the pace outside SPEARGUN, over took that
one in upper stretch, went clear in mid stretch, drifted out in deep stretch and just missed. SPEARGUN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the
inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch, weakened and drifted out in mid stretch. SHERIFF RONNIE , a forward factor along the inner rail around the first
turn and down the backstretch, gave way on the far turn.
