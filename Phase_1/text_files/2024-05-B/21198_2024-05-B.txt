HARD TRUTH WINS vied inside, settled, bid between foes at the quarter pole, vied briefly before drawing off in a strong drive and then gearing down late. I
MADE IT stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, vied briefly but was no match for the winner. BICARB BETTY was unrushed in the two
path, shifted to the four path at the eighth pole and offered a mild late bid. SNEAKIERTHANSARAH broke outward, vied in the three path, went to the rail in
the stretch but faltered. TRIP CHARGE saved ground to no avail. SANTIVA DIVA bobbled the start and led between rivals to the turn and gave way.
LILMISS SASSYPANTS was off awkwardly, stalked the pace in the three path and faded in the stretch. EMPIRE SUNRISE was not a factor. SALTY SUE
bobbled the start.

Footnotes
GIRLS WEEKEND bore out at the start, drew off and stayed to mild urging. SACOS STOGIE raced in the four path, steadied in the early going and bid for
the place late while no threat to the winner. LADY CHAI was squeezed at the start, raced in the three path and gained the show spot late. NEED A BIT OF
LUCK pressed the early pace between rivals but was no match. REGAL QUEEN pressed the early pace inside and faded in the stretch. DON'T TOUCH
was done early while in the three path.
