Footnotes
WINDY WALK pressed three wide and between horses, forged an advantage between a pair of rivals tucking to the three path into the turn, then kicked
away in upper stretch, drew off and held sway under a drive. MALU stalked four wide, pressed the top pair from the four path while under consistent urging
around the turn, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, yet ran on well to chase that one home while pulling clear of the rest.
MITOLE'S LEGACY prompted between the leaders early on, failed to sustain pressure and chased them two wide into the turn, sustained stride three wide
in the final furlong and edged show late. MALAWNIA broke inwardly, pursued along the inside and failed to menace. LADAN laid off of the pace in teh five
path and failed to factor. HAYUNEVANO was a bit reluctant to load, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, got headed while inside of a pair of rivals at
the three furlong pole, sustained vying position turning for home but weakened in upper stretch. SHE'S A SAINT broke multiple lengths slow, trailed in the
two path and got outrun.

Footnotes
CURLINS INCHARGE moved forward to show the way along the inside into the first turn, dueled with an outer prompter into and around the far turn, inched
free of that one passing the three sixteenths pole, leapt over the tracks marks left by the starting gate at the furlong marker, yet maintained an advantage
while recovering and changing back to his right lead at the sixteenth pole, then inched away once more. AMERICAN RAIDER stalked along the inside,
checked running up on the leader's heels around the first turn, settled in pursuit down the backstretch, chased before tipping outside of the top pair in upper
stretch, then ran on to edge place in the final sixteenth. BLOOD BROTHER prompted outside of the leader and from the three path around the first turn,
sparred for the lead with that one while taking the far turn in the two path, but failed to maintain level terms in upper stretch and gradually yielded through
the final furlong. COAL BOSS stalked in the four path early on, came under urging pursuing in the three path around the far turn, but got floated back out in
upper stretch and gave way. VACCINATOR broke multiple lengths slow, laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. SKY KEY broke a bit
inwardly, raced off of the pace along the inside and tired. STRICKLAND brushed the outer stall door upon leaving the gate, trailed along the inside early on
and got outrun.

Footnotes
COOL QUARTET tracked in the four path, bid outside of the top pair turning for home, vied outside of rivals through the lane, wrestled an advantage in the
final furlong and held firm. ROYAL ACT tracked two wide and between horses, took aim between the leading pair in upper stretch, bid in the final furlong but
was denied late. KHOZY MY BOY stalked in the three path, bid two wide into the turn, led turning for home, dug in sparring with an outer rival in upper
stretch, sustained the duel with a pair of foes in the final furlong but was bested late. RACKATAPTAP raced off of the pace three wide and between horses,
shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on. DREAMING OF SMARTY prompted along the inside, chased into the turn, shifted off of the fence
in upper stretch and lacked a bid. KEEN ON YOU took contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace five wide, then between horses turning for
home and failed to factor. SHORTLIST trailed early on, gained in the six path while widest into and around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch without
reaching contention. FERRYBOAT bumped an inner rival upon leaving the gate, showed the way in the two path, tucked to the inside as an outer rival bid
into the turn, got headed while inside of a pair of rivals at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. COOL MEMORY pursued along the inside, lost position
before taking the bend in the two path and failed to factor. JOB SECURITY lacked speed four wide and between horses, dropped back to trail at the half
mile pole, took the turn in the three path and got outrun.

Footnotes
NEON ICON prompted outside of the leader, gained an advantage at the three furlong pole, took over turning for home and drew off under mild urging. VIVA
LA RED stalked the leading pair from the two path, chased them around the far turn, shifted out to the four path entering the lane, gained place leaving the
three sixteenths pole and fended off an inner challenger. CALL ME TONI laid at the rear hung in the four path around the first turn, tucked while trailing
down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, improved position turning for home, took aim place in midstretch but was kept at bay. MARIA'S
REVENGE brushed the gate upon leaving it, showed the way inside of a pressing foe, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole, proved no match
shifting out entering the lane and weakened between horses. ROBIN SAGE tracked in the three path and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
WILLOW BEND bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked four wide, bid turning for home, wrestled an advantage nearing the lane, maintained an
advantage through midstretch and drove clear with a sixteenth to go. FRANGO ELECTRICO stalked in the three path, bid along with an outer rival turning
for home, fought on while headed by that one through midstretch, but gave way at the sixteenth pole yet saved place at the wire. LITTLE SISTER SUE laid
off of the pace in the five path, tipped to the six path entering upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but hung late and missed that
position. JE SUIS RAPIDE tracked along the inside, slipped through narrow rail quarters entering the lane, but only managed to chase and lacked a bid.
SPARKLE OF HOPE raced at the rear along the inside, trailed in the three to four path around the turn, then moved up late. CRACKALACKING bumped
with an inner rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, got headed by a pair of outer bidders at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses
in upper stretch. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA chased forwardly in the two path, gave way between horses with three furlongs to go and weakened.

shfited out to the five path at the nine sixteenths pole, trailed briefly entering the far turn before advancing six wide around that bend, claimed show passing

shifted out to the five to six path entering upper stretch and moved up. WASHINGTON'S UNION bumped with an outer rival early on, laid off of the pace in
the four to five path, but got outmoved by an outer advancer turning for home and improved position. YORK TAVERN pursued from midpack two wide and
between horses, chased around the far turn and lacked a bid. TIZZY INDY tracked in the four path, came under a drive into the far turn, chased between
