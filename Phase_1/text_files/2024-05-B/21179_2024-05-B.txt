OOPS AND DOWNS vied between for the early lead, gained the lead through the turn, drifted out wide through the stretch under handling, and drew away.
STAY UP sat just off the pace, was no match for the winner and held safely for place. MARAMAX squeezed out leaving the gate, fanned six wide leaving
the backstretch, rallied four wide through the stretch, and edged by late for show. OOPS (GB) chased four wide, rallied three wide through the stretch, and
weakened in the late stages. SIZZLIN ROSE broke in bumping into MARAMAX, pressed the early pace, and faded. CRANBERRY CHILL jostled leaving,
and was never involved.

Footnotes
BAKFIRE BABY was quickest to the turn, and drew away to an easy victory. GET BAKK reserved off the early pacesetter, chased in vain through the stretch
but was no match for winner and held safe for place. OUT FRONT hustled outside, drove five wide at the head of the lane, and rallied for show. BEAUTIFUL
BABE offered a late bid. DAZZLING CHIC chased inside and flattened. CHATTY GAL stalked three to four wide, and faded late. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY
outrun throughout. BEAUTIFUL BABE was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled.

Footnotes
THE BEAT sat midpack, rallied outside of BARE BACK JACK into the stretch, matched strides late and inched clear. BARE BACK JACK saved ground
inside, dueled inside of THE BEAT and gave way grudgingly late stretch. LIGHT FAST FEET set the pace from just off the rail, moved clear of outside rival
at the top of the lane, was overtaken and evened out. DANCING WILLIE raced near the back, offered a mild rally in the stretch and finished evenly.
ESTIFRAAD shifted inside to the rail leaving the final turn, and rallied evenly. CREDIBILITY fanned four wide, raced wide through at the head of the lane,
and passed tiring rivals. TRUMP UM brushed leaving, hustled up then pressed the pace, and came up empty in the drive. AMUSING WAY chased from the
six path early and tired.

PERDITION raced in striking position, rallied determinedly through the stretch, and was up just in time. ISLE OF SKYE hustled outside then crossed over on
the field to gain a clear lead, saved ground while showing the way, was showing signs of tiring nearing the stretch and was nipped at the wire. BROWNING
ISLAND chased inside early, drove four wide setting sights on the leaders, closed well under light urging and missed. WYE CROSS trailed early, took closer
order in the final turn, and closed well late. DUNE D'ORO chased outside, and rallied mildly in stretch. CASHLINGS settled early, swung four to five wide
leaving the last turn, and flattened out. LITTLE CHICAGO lacked a kick. KOVACS failed to menace. BIG AL'S VISION chased the pace from the three path,
dropped back quickly in the far turn, and was eased.

Footnotes
SMASH FACTOR chased the pace from the rail, moved up inside of FIRECRAKER STAND, gained the lead entering the stretch, drew away and was kept
under light handling. SIMMS unhurried early, gained closer order nearing the stretch drive, and closed steadily late. DELIRIUM went in pursuit of dueling
pacesetters in the far turn, and passed tiring rival late for show. FIRECRACKER STAND quickly went to the front, duelled through the final turn, was unable
to move on with the eventual winner and gave way. CALI CONQUEST trailed wide early, and rallied belatedly. GIVE EM HECK BECK settled inside, lodged
a mild bid through stretch and flattened. ADRIEN'S AURORA brushed leaving, saved inside and lacked a bid. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR failed to menace.
FORGOTTEN VOWS reserved off the pacesetters, and tired early.
