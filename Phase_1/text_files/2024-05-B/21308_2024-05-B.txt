BIG INVESTMENT had inside speed under early pressure, opened up into turn, good lead stretch, kept to task. SCREENPLAY stalked outside, advanced
three-wide turn, finished well, was gaining late. KITON trailed to stretch, rallied outside for show. HEAVENLY TRIP, well placed inside early, dropped back
turn, faded. PROPERLY CONNECTED advanced off the rail, tried to come through a narrow opening between BIG INVESTMENT and C C's KITTEN
passing the 7/16ths pole, was bothered mildly by both rivals as they came in and out slightly, steadied, was well placed inside through the turn, tired in the
drive. C C'S KITTEN pressed outside early, well placed off rail turn, tired stretch. The rider aboard PROPERLY CONNECTED lodged a claim of foul against
the rider of BIG INVESTMENT for interference at the 7/16ths pole. There was no change.
