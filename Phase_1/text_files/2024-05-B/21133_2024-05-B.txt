BAD LINEAGE settled off the early pace inside then moved to the outside entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved
steadily, raced in the four path into the far turn, drifted to the six path toward the head of the lane but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew clear later
yards. ZIGGY STARDUST stalked inside then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead passing the five sixteenths, raced at the rail into the
far turn but drifted while making contact with SHOOT THE BREEZE nearing the head of the lane, was met mid-stretch but continued to duel for second. The
latter rated close in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, took over and dueled approaching the three eighths, was caught past
the five sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, was forced out into the lane and relented second leaving the sixteenth pole.
CEDAR RUNS FIBER rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole but was caught past the pole, checked in tight at the
rail leaving the five sixteenths and faded through the far turn. MAJESTY'S COWBOY stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.

ROMAN CANDLE raced with the pace and took the nod into the backstretch, dueled at mostly even terms through the backstretch and on the far turn, drew
clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. PHILMARY CASTLE raced with the early pace inside, gave chase and dueled at mostly even terms through the
backstretch and rounding the far turn, remained a factor in the upper stretch but dropped back mid-stretch and settled for second best. WOODEN SHIPS
saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. KEY TO THE
CASTLE came away awkwardly and exchanged contact with Floridified, rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase passing the three eighths
pole and raced in the four path on the far turn. OFFICER CALLY showed little response through the backstretch. FLORIDIFIED became fractious in the gate
then broke through prior the start, exchanged contact with Key To The Castle at the break, rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase into the
backstretch but faded leaving the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MISS LAUREN quickly took over and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily encouraged to hold on. QUANTICO CREEK stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far
turn, dueled through the stretch for second and was gaining on the winner. THUNDERTURTLE settled in the three path, gave chase approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and relented in the stretch duel for second. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY settled toward the inside, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened in the stretch. DREAM OF GOLD raced off the pace about the three
path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH showed little
response and rounded the far turn about the five path.

LIME STAR rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled to
hold on. QUINN ELIA saved ground on the first turn, started her bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, raced in the four path on the
far turn, dug in to clear second later yards and was gaining on the winner. QUEEN SABINE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, was roughed off the heels of Full of Charm at the eighth pole but recovered stride quickly and finished
well while dueling for third. SWIPE THAT CANDY raced in the six path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the five path and finished well outside. FULL OF CHARM stalked two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far
turn, but flattened in the lane. COLD CASH stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole, raced in the three path on the far
turn and weakened in the lane. MASH TATERS hesitated then veered out at the break, raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed
little response.

Footnotes
YO VINNIE saved early ground, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily from that point, rounded the far turn about the four path, took
the lead past the eighth pole and was edging away later yards. SCOTCH NO ROCKS raced with the early pace inside but dropped back at the half mile
pole, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, steadied at the rail approaching the five sixteenths, though, recovered stride and took the lead two
deep nearing the head of the lane, dug in from the eighth pole but was caught flattening stride leaving the eighth pole. ROAD SLEW settled off the pace
about the three path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and cleared third past the eighth pole.
DON'TCALLTOOEARLY settled off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane.
DEPLANE settled in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. FIELDSTONE rated a slim lead off the rail, raced clear into the
backstretch and was pressured from the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the head of the lane and weakened. PAYMENGOLD
came away rank causing the rider to lose his irons and was eased after a half mile.
