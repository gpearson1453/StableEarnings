Footnotes
CHANEL POINT was bumped at the start, contended for the early lead inside a foe but under a tight hold, settled down easing off the outside rival and
switched outside that one leaving the backstretch, advanced about three wide leaving the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, forged clear and was eased
up late. GOOD MAGIC WOMAN forced the pace from outside moving clear nearing the half and racing just off the rail, was no match but held second.
BABAS GAL veered out at the start, settled mid-pack outside, went three to four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch but missed place. SHARP ATTACK
was bothered badly at the start, advanced rapidly between foes up the backstretch, was in a bit tight down near inside heading into the turn, saved ground
through the bend in range but could not kick on late. FEATURED POWER settled off the pace, asked to pick it up past the five-sixteenths but had no
response. FLASH IT WIDE OPEN broke outwardly badly at the start bothering a rival and bumping another one and appeared to lose an iron in the process,
recovered to bring up the rear well back of the field and off the inside, was never a threat.

Footnotes
IZEONDEC brushed very lightly at the start, settled well back of the leaders off the inside part of the track, began to really pick up coming to the
five-sixteenths and forced five wide, took aim on the leader in upper stretch, gained steadily and slowly to strike the front a sixteenth out and edged past.
SLAVA UKRAINI dueled outside a rival in the early going, moved clear about the half, raced off the inside with open-lengths advantage turning for home,
was engaged in mid-stretch and outkicked. PERFUMER settled well back racing off the inside, swung seven deep turning for home, finished well but far too
late. BLOOMING GARDEN dueled inside the runner-up in the early going, switched outside that one past the half once relegated to a chasing position, kept
on in the stretch but needed more. U S HONOUR NAP bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was caught outside five deep through the first turn, shifted in
late up the backstretch racing three to four wide on the far turn and within range but failed to rally. POWERFUL MAN exchanged a light bump at the start,
raced mid-pack off the inside in the four then three path on the first turn, angled in further later on saving ground on the far turn and closer turning for home,
flattened out. MEATLOAF'S CHANCE stalked the leading pair early, retreated outside foes up the backstretch, was eased through the stretch and walked
off.

Footnotes
PACIFIC VIEW broke outwardly a bit, settled into stride and made a swift early advance to press the pacesetter after the opening quarter, bid three furlongs
from home, moved clear by the top of the stretch, was put to urging at that juncture and held sway. CHURCH PEW tracked mid-pack inside saving ground
on the turn, was ridden along about the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide turning for home, was second best. SAFECRACKER SUE brushed lightly with a
foe at the start, was encouraged clear to set the pace, pressed by an outside rival after the quarter racing just off the rail, faded in the sretch. MISS
MADALINE exchanged a very light brush at the start, settled outside at the rear, went two to three wide through the turn fanning out a further path for the
drive, was never near enough to threaten. LIGHTNING MELODY saved ground on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
MAQAMAT exchanged a very light brush at the start, moved forward between runners to force the pace two to three deep, was clear in upper stretch, held
under steady handling. PARKER settled off the pace while guided out off the inside, raced mostly in the three path on the turn mid-pack, came out five wide
turning for home, drifted in through upper stretch in front of rivals, was second best. CODETOWIN settled at the back, made a bold move outside four to five
wide on the turn while swinging six deep turning for home, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, kept on but needed more. IDEA MAN was in a bit tight at the start,
advanced inside, altered outside a drifting rival near the furlong grounds, ran on. TEA WITH LEMON settled at the back, swung seven wide into upper
stretch, kicked on mildly. CHRISTMAS PRESENT exchanged minor contact at the start, settled at the back, swung nine deep, needed more. ALPINE
GHOST moved forward with the eventual winner outside that one, pressed the pace three to four wide, weakened through the stretch and was in a bit tight
in upper stretch while tiring. GOLDENPENCE came out a bit at the start, was urged forward to set the early tempo but soon joined by outside foes, vied
inside, was done at the seven-sixteenths and retreated. PER RULING ECM2024-195 FROM THE ILLINOIA RACING COMMISSION, MAQAMAT WAS
DQD FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S SUCCESS brushed lightly with a rival at the start, moved forward forcing the pace between runners on the first turn then dictating terms up the
backstretch shadowed by an outside rival, moved clear passing the seven-sixteenths, was asked for more at the three-sixteenths, responded by extending
the margin and was eased up late. NOT VERY GENTLE exchanged minor brushing with the inside foe at the start, settled off the pace, made a steady
advance between foes coming to the four- and one-half, moved out racing four to five deep and passing foes on the far turn, was no match for the winner
but secured the place. FLASHY RICHIE was last but one racing off the inside early then shifted in, saved ground on the far turn still far back, came out in
the stretch and finished well but too late. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was prominent early inside foes showing brief speed but soon eased back off those
content to stalk while in the clear, came to the top of the stretch three wide, flattened out. WHERE'D THE DAY GO saved ground, was one-paced and never
a threat. FLYING SAMURAI brushed with a foe lightly at the start, was forwardly-placed pressing the eventual winner from outside three to four wide,
weakened. MISTER CHARMING exchanged minor brushing at the start, stalked mid-pack from off the inside in the two then three path, continued wide up
the backstretch dropping back outside foes four deep, tired. WICKED SUPRISE was kept off the inside part of the track while trailing and was never a factor.
PER RULING ECM2024-196 FROM THE ILLINOIS RACING COMMISSION, KHOZANS SUCCESS WAS DQD FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
WHAT A COUNTRY advanced between foes under urging from the three-eighths, moved out five wide turning into upper stretch, bid at the three-sixteenths,
forged clear late. SOUL COAXING took back off the leading pair on the first turn and switched out stalking in behind for the run up the backstretch, moved to
challenge four wide coming to the quarter pole and took a narrow and brief lead, was outkicked but second best. LAND MARK DEAL settled outside off the
pace four to five wide early, took slightly closer order on the far turn still racing wide, drifted in a bit in mid- to late-stretch but kept on to get up for show in
deep stretch. GLOBAL EMPIRE was forwardly-placed pressing the pace outside three wide, forced the issue up the backstretch, took the lead and moved
clear past the seven-sixteenths, was overtaken by the top of the stretch and weakened late. SIMPLE LOGIC was rated but keen to go on making a rapid
advance inside up to race just in behind the leaders up the backstretch, moved out a bit on the far turn, failed to rally in the stretch. SIR LUMPALOT was
urged from the break, set a pressured pace two to three wide, came up empty. KRAMDEN settled two to three wide between foes early, dropped back and
shifted in, saved ground on the far turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT stalked the leader in the clear, moved closer coming to the five-sixteenths, floated out a bit coming four wide to the quarter pole, struck the
lead about the three-sixteenths, edged clear and held sway while being kept to the task. RICHIESONAROLL chased from outside mid-pack, swung six wide
turning into upper stretch, kept on late to be second best. MEGAN'S HONOR broke just a half-step slowly, advanced to race between foes two to three wide
on the turn, came out a bit in the stretch, needed more but secured show honors. HUEY ATTACK chased from inside mid-division, failed to rally. BUREAU
broke a step slowly, raced well back while kept off the inside part of the track, failed to rally. FAST JACK set the pace from the outset racing just off the rail,
drifted a bit in the stretch while weakening. BEEALEA broke a step slowly and lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
SHE BE SHEEHAN had the very early lead but ceded that to an intent rival while sitting just off stalking, took charge past the seven-sixteenths, was clear
into upper stretch, asked for more at the three-sixteenths, held under steady handling. FOURFIFTYSEVEN settled in behind tracking the pace near but off
the rail, advanced through traffic while shifting out leaving the turn, was five wide and put to a drive at the quarter pole, couldn't reach the winner but was
clearly second best. CITY SHACK lacked early speed racing outside, swung six deep turning for home, lugged in soon after, straightened out and kept on to
gain show honors. MISS TENA MARIE settled between foes early and continued racing off the inside, was one-paced. SENSE OF SELF was in a hair tight
at the start, made a swift early advance three to four wide early on the turn, drifted about eight deep leaving that bend, faded in the stretch. ALLOTROPE
was intent on the lead, set the pace from just off the rail, came up empty. FULL PLACE PICK EIGHT WINNING WAGER COMBINATION:

Footnotes
MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR stalked then advanced four wide late on the turn, bid at the three-sixteenths putting a head in front, was soon engaged by the prior
leader from inside, dueled with that one and gamely held that rival at bay. PHILIPSBURG (IRE) was quickly in front to set the pace facing pressure, was
headed in upper stretch, put to all out urging while coming out to engage the new leader, dueled to the wire but was held at bay while second best. CHAOS
REIGNS broke just a hair slowly, raced up in behind the leading group, angled out at the half, advanced outside five wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch.
AFTER MY BROTHER moved forward up the backstretch pressing the pace three wide, had no extra for the late going. HANDSOFFTHEGOODS moved
out and was kept wide going five to six deep through the turn and ridden along past the three-eighths, ran on but was unable to menace the top ones. JIM
AND JIM broke a step slowly, raced off the inside, was not a threat. JOYFUL GHOST bobbled ever so slightly at the start, rated in behind but close up while
between runners heading to the turn. BALADINE was urged at the break, showed brief speed then continued to chase from inside, weakened. ANCIENT
MAN broke awkwardly and slowly, angled in, was not a threat.
