Footnotes
I AM LOWKEY vied inside of KISSED A CADET up the backstretch and battled through the turn, cut the corner turning for home, shook free to a two length
lead then held late over regaining KISSED A CADET. KISSED A CADET dueled outside of I AM LOWKEY from the onset, battled for command around the
turn, could not match strides in upper stretch but stayed on stubbornly, found more in reserve late and regained to the wire. LIL SCREECHER was forwardly
placed racing just off the top pair, continued to chase the embattled duo around the turn, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and cleared the rest.
LA FEE'S SECRET was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace and saved ground, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to pose a threat. OXFORD
OUTING raced in contention in opening stages then steadily weakened off the top trio, saved ground entering the lane and never menaced. SING FOR UR
SUPPER lacked speed and raced well off the early pace, came three to four wide into the upper stretch and steadily faded.

the upper stretch, widened command and kept clear under steady urging. SUIT ME UP CHARLIE was forwardly placed racing three wide through the
backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, got collared by rail running BARREL THIEF at the top of the lane, sustained a solid bid
through the stretch run and finished clearly second best. CODE ONE rated off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the turn, swung wider for
the drive and gained a share. GONZAGA BAY set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued with a slim advantage around the turn, got collared on
both sides turning for home and gave way in the lane. MACHO STRIKER pressed the early pace, remained in close contention around the turn then tired in

widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. SEASIDE BOY was off slow at the start and remained well reserved in the back, edged closer four wide late
on the far turn, came four to five wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained second best. EXECUTIVE ACTION tracked the pace along
the inside, shifted out three wide for the drive, continued in pursuit and cleared the rest. MEGATAP sat off the early pace and saved ground through early
stages, raced in the back around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened. CANADIAN GAME pressed the pace around the first turn
and up the backstretch, dueled two wide around the final turn then came up empty in the stretch. NASTY EXAGGERATOR set the pace up the backstretch,
dueled around the far turn and retreated in the lane.

GRAPHENE CASSOCK vied outside of OBVIOUSLY TOO up the backstretch and continued to match strides around the turn, shook free to a slim lead at
the head of the lane and kept clear under steady encouragment. GALACTIC EMPIRE raced off the early pace, hustled up and saved ground around the
turn, tipped two then three wide for the drive and closed willingly. MOJITO saved ground racing off the top pair through early stages, shifted three wide
leaving the turn, sustained a steady bid and secured aa share. OBVIOUSLY TOO vied inside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, battled on around
the turn, could not math strides at the head of the lane, fought on to the furlong marker then weakened. BRILLIANT COLORS raced off the early pace,
hustled up two wide around the turn, shifted three to four wide in the stretch run and needed more for impact. APOLLO BAY was reserved racing in the
back, urged along the rail into the lane and showed interest in final stages. JUST JOHNNY chased in contention in then opening quarter, hustled up around
the turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch and gave way.

A JUST CAUSE was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, vied for the lead around the turn, took command at the head of the lane, sustained a
steady bid through the stretch run and held late over oncoming duo. ROCKIN BOOTS tracked the early pace, was ridden two wide around the turn, hustled
along in the three path into the lane, steadily edged up closer in late stages and nipped foe for place. RAMBO'S RETURN raced off the early pace, came
four wide into the upper stretch, roused for more, responded, steadily edged up closer down the lane and got nipped for place. NICE ONE JULIO raced four
wide just off midpack in the early going, was ridden along three paths wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane and improved position without
threatening. FLEETWOOD SMACK quickly cleared the lead out of the gate, led the way through the backstretch, vied for the lead with the eventual winner
around the turn then tired in the drive. DO IT LIKE KEVIN raced in range near midpack along the inside, came two paths wide into the upper stretch and
steadily weakened. BAD BOY BRAWNY raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to advance along the rail when called upon at the head
of the lane.

ATTA PARTY was forwardly placed in opening stages then settled back a couple spots, angled inside entering the turn, shifted out leaving the quarter pole,
was confidently handled four paths wide in the upper stretch, given cue, responded gamely, rallied along the outside and got up in time. TRIPULANTE raced
in contention three wide in early stages, edged up and vied for the lead with BOLT FORTY FIVE nearing the quarter pole, shook free from rival then took on
the challenge of DIAMOND CITY entering the head o0f the lane, vied then shoo free to a slim lead, stayed on gamely and got caught in closing strides.
DIAMOND CITY was off slow at the start and spotted the field four lengths, remained settled in the back then let out a notch entering the turn, quickly moved
up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, vied with TRIPULANTE in the upper stretch, could not match strides at the eighth pole but sustained a
solid bid to the end. CONCEPT was forwardly placed along the inside, flattened out around the turn, came two to three wide into the lane and had a mild
regain. BOLT FORTY FIVE led the way in opening stages, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, failed to match strides but ran on into the upper stretch then
gave way in the final furlong. ROMAN GIANT was not too far back early on, chased in range into the turn then weakened near the quarter pole.

LUCKY'S SECRET broke out and bumped with rival at the start, raced in contention three paths wide through early stages, vied for the lead with
MISCHIEVOUS MAX around the turn, fought back to the furlong marker, shook free to a slim lead, dug in gamely with DANCIN ROCKET in striking distance
and prevailed under a driving finish. DANCIN ROCKET bumped with rival at the start, was forwardly placed along the inside, waited along the rail around the
turn, shifted three wide at the head of the lane, roused forward to challenge LUCKY'S SECRET for the late lead, raced in striking distance but ran on evenly
in final strides. MISCHIEVOUS MAX quickly cleared the lead and angled over to the inside, led the way then vied for command with LUCKY'S SECRET
around the turn, fought back in upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. YOUNG JONESBORO broke in and bumped with rival at the start, raced off
the early pace, came three paths wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve without threatening. IRISH COAST got bumped at the start, moved up
into close contention racing three wide around the turn then faded in the lane. KICKIN' CHARLIE raced up close in opening stages then was taken up
sharply near the half mile marker and dropped back. GUNPOWDER N' LEAD bobbled and got bumped at the start, raced near or in the back and never
menaced.
