Footnotes
SAM WHEAT quickly took over and rated the pace inside, kept the edge over Kurumi Go Go leaving the half mile pole, came under pressure past the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and held well under steady handling. RUN ROCKY RUN rated close inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, eased to the two path midway on the far turn, drifted entering the stretch and couldn't improve on the winner. RAMSEY raced off the rail the first turn,
left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. TIZAWINNER raced well
off the pace about the four path on the first turn and could only improve his position. ANNIE'S KINGDOM was reluctant to load, settled close in the three
path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. KURUMI GO GO stalked the early pace
two deep, challenged into the backstretch but faded after a half mile.

Footnotes
TAPIO rated close to the early pace inside, eased out from the heels of leaders and bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep midway on
the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn but held on well with steady handling. MARK DID IT saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the
seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn about the three path and cleared second inside the sixteenth pole. HAPPY CHAMP
settled in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along to take third inside the
sixteenth pole. THE GREAT GAZOO bobbled leaving the gate then rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and took the
lead at the five sixteenths, drew briefly clear nearing the far turn but was met at the rail midway through the turn and weakened in the lane. RAISE A
SPEIGHTS raced in the three path the first turn, angled out into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the four path and showed little more. TACO BEAN stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested even terms from
that point, was caught at the five sixteenths pole and faded through the far turn. ROYAL SPY took over and moved to the inside to show the way early on,
was met approaching the three eighths pole and contested even terms, but gave up the lead at the five sixteenths pole and faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
MOONLIT SHADOW took over into the first turn and rated the pace, kept the edge over Lucylou Who leaving the half mile pole and dueled to clear that one
past the quarter pole, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the far turn and just lasted. CHANGE THE WORLD settled off the rail the first turn, picked
up the chase past the half mile pole and steadily improved, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and drew alongside the winner
in deep strides, but just missed. LUCYLOU WHO angled in with a brief early lead then stalked two deep, challenged into the backstretch and dueled from
that point, but dropped back past the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. ALPINE MOON exchanged contact with
SNEAKY LYNK leaving the gate then settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on
the far turn and flattened in the lane. The latter came away awkwardly and was jostled soon afterward, raced in the three path on the first turn, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. BOUNDTOBEOK rated close off the rail the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened on the far turn. IHEARTRAINACOMN exchanged contact with Sneaky Lynk leaving the gate then
settled in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

PINK DINGHY quickly took over and tapered to the inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was kept
sharp in the lane. GOLD FIBER was bumped inward and into Aim For The Cork leaving the gate then gave chase, raced close off the rail on the turn but
couldn't improve in the lane. MISSIONARY became a bit anxious in the gate then broke inward, engaged in close chase through the backstretch and
remained a factor three wide on the turn, but flattened in the lane. FROGGY THE GREMLIN was forced inward and into Gold Fiber leaving the gate then
gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little more. AIM FOR THE CORK ducked out and exchanged contact with Gold Fiber leaving the gate
then gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path, left the turn widest and showed little in the lane. TIMMY gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and
showed little in the lane. KIDMAN KERRY broke a step slow, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the
lane.

STRETCH THE TRUTH set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge at the rail on the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on.
ISLAND D'LITE gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn but lugged in through the upper stretch and was outfinished the final
sixteenth. FLAMING EAST chased outside through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and dueled through later yards
for third while inching closer to the top two. STEVETHEVANDRIVER pressured the pace and contested at near even terms two deep on the turn, dropped
back mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. JIMMY THE KID chased inside early, raced off the rail on the turn, eased to the outside leaving the turn
and finished well. HEY CONGRATS chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA mostly saved ground then drifted toward the head of the lane. BUBBA G gave chase then weakened in the four path on the turn.
The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Stretch The Truth for alleged interference in the upper stretch, lodged by the rider
of Stevethevandriver.

Footnotes
ALDRINALINE raced in the seven path the opening turn and started an outside bid leaving the half mile pole, circled rivals six wide on the far turn and dug
in from the head of the lane to take over the final strides. DOCTOR PARDO stalked the early pace two deep, took the nod passing the half mile pole and
dueled to clear Estrella Fugaz midway on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides. KING OF LUCK
saved ground on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in to take third past the eighth pole then flattened
stride late yards. NEVERFOLD raced well back off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and finished well. PINNACLE REEF steadied from tight quarters between horses approaching the first turn, raced three wide through the turn then
gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened. ONE CANDY CASTLE raced off the rail the first turn then
stalked into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened nearing mid-stretch.
JEFFERSON SECURITY rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole, steadied from the heels of rivals approaching the head of
the lane and weakened. OCEAN STORM rounded the first turn about the six path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.
MEETMARYSMAN saved ground on the turns. ESTRELLA FUGAZ rated a slim early lead inside, was met past the half mile pole and dueled from that
point, raced at the rail on the far turn but dropped back midway through the turn and gave way in the lane.
