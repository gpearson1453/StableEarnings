Footnotes
NAA DUDETTE trailed in the two path, swung six wide in upper stretch, closed with a rush, took over near the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. RED
HAIRED GAL raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied between foes for the place. TIZ
ERIN settled off the pace while racing three and four wide and ran on for the show. SONADORA GIRL stalked the pace inside, bid between foes nearing the
far turn, took over midway around the bend, drew clear near the quarter pole, led to sixteenth pole and weakened. STARLIT SOFI set the pace along the rail
and tired in the drive. LADIDA prompted the pace in the three path and faded in the stretch. SPREAD THE RISK was outrun inside. VERINA chased the
pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. I LOVE IRELAND played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
KUWAIT TOWERS chased in the three path, tipped inside and was ridden into the far turn, bid in the four path at the top of the lane, took the lead while
drifting out passing the eighth pole, and inched ahead late. CHROMOTION trailed in the two path, waited under a hold in the four path rounding the far turn,
fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. FRANKS MIMI had an awkward start, was out in the four path around the first turn,
rated in the five path down the backside, was coaxed in the four path early around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept
on for show. MONEY ON ICE set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, but
yielded in the final furlong. WE GOT THIS tracked in the four path, was cued between foes going into the far turn, but flattened from the six path down the
lane. CUCUY hopped at the start, got a bit keen around the first turn and prompted the pace in the four path down the backstretch, but backed up early
around the far turn.

Footnotes
GREY PRINCESS settled off the pace while racing two wide, cruised up three wide around the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths marker,
quickly cleared and widened under left-handed urging while lugging in through the stretch. ANDIE ONE raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied for
the place. GRANDMA'S PUDDING had early speed between foes, settled back late on the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn and churned on to
gain the show. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA vied inside around the first turn, pressed two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in
the lane. WHAT A KNOCKOUT saved ground and failed to menace. KILLARGUE'S GIRL played no factor while racing three and four wide. SHE'S SO
BEARRISH advanced three wide around the first turn to the lead, took over late on the bend, cleared and angled in early on the backstretch, led inside to
the five-sixteenths marker and faltered. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS saved ground off the early pace, made a middle move down the backstretch, chased
inside around the far turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
CART GIRL SAM set the pace in the three path, was cued approaching the quarter, floated out to the eight path at the top of the lane, opened up slightly
while drifting out passing the eighth pole, and held sway. FAR AND FEW prompted the pace in the four path, was driven around the turn, got carried out to
the ten path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. TEASING had a slow start and was hustled from off the pace inside, but kept on inside of foes
from the three path down the lane to get up for show. VIBING trailed in the two path and made no impact from the five path in the stretch. A TOUCH OF
HAIL stalked in the two path, but flattened on her left lead in the four path down the lane. THREE TIMES chased in the five path but weakened in the
stretch.

Footnotes
SIMPLY STRIKING set the pace along the rail, drifted out in the stretch and held firm. MI AMORE raced off the pace three wide, edged closer three wide
between foes around the far turn, rallied between foes in the lane and just missed. GOATS ON A TREE raced two wide in midpack, swung five wide in
upper stretch and rallied widest. SHE TAKES CASH was bumped at the start, trailed two wide, circled five wide around the far turn and flattened out in the
lane. ROMANTIC STORY was up close while strung out four wide around the first turn, pressed two wide around the far turn and weakened in the stretch.
MY HAPPY HOLIDAY stalked the pace three wide between foes around the first turn, chased inside around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. WOW
LUCKY saved ground off the pace, made some progress four wide around the far turn but lacked the needed rally. BONMATI bumped at the start, was hard
held inside around the first turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
ICELANDER broke in and bumped an inner foe, set the pace in the three path, waited in the two path while pulling away around the turn, was cued while
floating out to the five path at the top of the lane, and continued to draw clear. MORAL AGENCY broke in and bumped an inner foe, stalked in the three
path, was coaxed along around the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and chased on for place. ARROW GHOST got pinched at the
start, raced off the pace in the five path, was ridden around the turn, tipped out to the seven path turning into the lane, and was along for show. SWIFT
DANCER tracked in the four path, was cued into the far turn, but failed to bid from the two path in the stretch. TREASURE FLAY broke out and bumped an
outer foe, chased in the three path, tipped to the rail while being cued entering the turn, but had to check passing the quarter, swung out to the eight path
entering the lane, and was no threat. BIGLY DEAL trailed along the inside early and never menaced. GO GO SANTI got bumped by an outer foe at the
start, prompted the pace in the two path but weakened along the inside around the turn. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF ARROW GHOST
AGAINST THE RIDER OF ICELANDER FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
MAKIZAN set the pace between foes down the backstretch, drew clear at the rail entering the far turn, widened around the bend, drew off readily in upper
stretch and widened while ridden out. THAT MAGIC MOMENT vied inside of the winner down the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, was no
match for that foe but kept on to hold clear of the rest. LE MISTRAL saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. SIR DANIEL failed to menace
while racing four wide. BIG TOBY broke out and soundly bumped POSEIDONS MYTH, chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. ERUDITE was
bumped after the start, had some speed three wide and faltered in the lane. POSEIDONS MYTH was bumped between foes and checked at the start and
never involved while racing four wide. SHIPWRECK was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BIG EFFECT set the pace inside, was cued in the two path passing the three-eighths pole, floated out to the four path and bumped an outer foe at the top of
the lane, but dug in to hold on. EL PRINCIPITO chased in the two path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, got bumped out to the five path by an
inner foe while making a bid at the top of the stretch, ran on to sustain that bid, but hung on his left lead for place. BLUE SLIDE PARK trailed in the three
path, was coaxed along the rail around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and was along for show. ROUKI prompted the early
pace in the three path but weakened from the two path in the stretch. CANDYMAKER raced off the pace in the four path and never menaced.
