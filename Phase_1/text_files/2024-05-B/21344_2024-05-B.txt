Footnotes
STARRY EYED sprinted away to a clear lead to set all the pace and was kept to task in the drive. MYSTIC HOPE prompted the pace from three wide to the
seven sixteenths then chased the leader around the turn, raced a little erratic in the stretch but kept on to be second best. HEAVENLY DEAL prompted the
pace from the inside to the seven sixteenths then fell back on the turn but made a rebid in the stretch to be up for the show. ALLONANITA'SLUCK raced
near the back spotting the field several lengths then moved up from three wide around the turn but faltered in the stretch. A TRUE TARGET showed no
early speed and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. DUE WE DARE rushed up between horses at the nine sixteenths then saved ground around the turn and
gave way.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL BUSINESS raced off the pace on the inside then angled out to four wide before the quarter pole and engaged the leaders in upper stretch and
matched strides to the sixteenth and inched clear late to prove best. MYFRIENDSAWINNER tracked the leaders from three wide to the turn then moved up
to engage the leader near the quarter pole and match strides with outside closer but gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. ZOOM ERIN was off a step
slow and spotted the field several lengths, then hustled along from three or four wide and made a rally for the show. DARE TO WISH sprinted away to press
the pace from the inside to the quarter pole and weakened. IZEONPOINT was off a step slow and spotted the field several lengths, saved ground through
the turn and passed tired ones in the stretch. CALABRIAN QUEEN went to a pressured lead from the two path and was challenged near the quarter pole
from outside rivals but was overtaken and tired. BLUEBIRD SING saved ground throughout and was never a threat.

DADDY'S CINDERELLA stalked the pace from three wide on the backstretch then moved out to four wide at the five sixteenths and drove past the leader at
the top of the stretch and sailed home to prove best. MID WEST FUN raced off the pace from the two path then made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths
to engage the leader near the quarter pole but couldn't match strides with the winner but was clearly second best. SWEET MARIN raced near the back from
three wide and steadily advanced through the turn for the rally to be up for the show. KERRIGAN'S TOUCH rushed up the rail to press the pace from the
inside then matched strides to the five sixteenths where she inched away but was quickly eclipsed by outside rivals and tired. JONESBOROHURRICANE
saved ground throughout and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. DEES LITTLE GIRL trailed the field and showed little. ON THE MONEY LUV shot away

Footnotes
MANSOURA went to the front to a pressured lead to the pace throughout and held sway. HEXCEL stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch
then tipped in to two wide and engaged the leader around the turn but couldn't catch and was clearly second best. SAUCER EYES raced off the pace
around the first turn then steadily advanced on the backstretch, he kept on but was no match for the top two. PRINCE PERFECTA raced near the back
around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch, but had to steady slightly at the seven sixteenths and flattened out. WHISKEY WITH
YOU pressed the pace from two wide to the half mile marker and was done. STONECOAT tracked the leaders from inside but failed to menace.
METRONOME was unhurried around the first turn, distanced and jogged in.

the turn then fell back slightly but made a rebid to into the stretch but was outfinished late. NOTABLE QUEEN raced off the pace on the inside but lacked
the late response. MS CARROLL COUNTY raced close to the pace to the turn then moved between horses at the three furlong marker but faltered. BIEN

COWGIRL vied for the lead from four wide to the half mile marker and retreated.

the eighth pole and drew clear. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN rushed to a clear lead to the top of the stretch where she was engaged by outside rival at the

out to three wide at the eighth pole and flattened out. OUR GIRL FLINT raced near the back around the first turn then steadily advanced on the backstretch,
made a three wide bid at the half mile marker and faltered. PARIS GARTERS raced near the back from three or four wide but had no impact. MAREBELL

MYGLORYBEE was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack from off the rail through the turn then moved between horses at the eighth pole to take the
lead and fended of the late closing outside foe to hold on for the win. HOLDING PATTERN was unhurried to the turn then started to find his stride around
the turn, closed willingly and finished strong. PREMIUM shared the command from two wide to the turn, inched away but was engaged again in midturn,
drifted out at the three sixteenths but kept on and gave way grudgingly. MEAN JAKEY tracked the leaders from three wide to the turn then made a mild bid
but was out kicked late. LO LO'S LAUGHTER rushed to contention in the early stages but flattened out. OAK HILL LG passed tiring rivals. JACK BOB AND
LARRY raced in the middle of the pack, gained ground on the turn but faltered. CHI TOWN HUSTLER shared the command from the inside to the turn and
fought gamely to the top of the stretch but was empty.
