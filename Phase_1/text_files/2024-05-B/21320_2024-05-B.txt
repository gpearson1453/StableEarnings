Footnotes
ECHO LAKE led clearly inside, vied in the stretch, lost the lead nearing the eighth pole then gamely came again to get the nod. SUMMERSATTHESHORE
stalked the pacesetter, edged to the front in midstretch, dueled and lost the narrow decision. THE LAST JET saved ground off the pace, finished willingly but
was no match for the top pair. MISSUPTOWNTOODELOU bid briefly closer into the stretch then flattened out. DRIVEN TO SUCCESS chased off the
leaders four wide and lacked a rally. ALMA BRILHA dropped back early, chased extremely wide and was no factor. LOU'S IRISH LADY tugged along early
just off the pace then began fading on the turn. WINBORI broke sluggishly and trailed throughout.

behind early, bid inside on the turn and closed well. INCOMPARABLE dropped back wide and was always outrun. BRUNO BARBER GIRL trailed early then

slightly. MISS ALEX dropped far behind then narrowed gap without menacing. ROAD TO DREAMS raced within striking range outside and faltered. MAZAL

flattened out. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE dropped back inside, was put to urging on the turn and lacked a solid rally. ANAITA stumbled at the start, dropped
back and never menaced. LA LUISA set the pace in the two path and stopped in the stretch. FAST INTENTIONS raced outside and gave way readily.

ELOQUIST dueled briefly inside, shook loose into the stretch and edged away under steady encouragement. RICH'S WAY trailed far behind then finished
with a strong late surge too late. SIMOVITCH prompted the winner outside and weakened in the stretch. YODEL E. A. WHO stalked the pacesetters three
wide, bid at the quarter pole then flattened out. LEGAL DEAL eased back in the opening quarter, chased near the inside and faded. DREAMING OF
GERRY raced wide off the leaders and gave way on the final turn.

of the pacesetter then flattened out in the stretch. INDOCTRINATE raced wide off the leaders and gave way readily. RELISHMENT dropped back along the
inside and retreated.
