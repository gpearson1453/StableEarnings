Footnotes
READY MADE broke on top, soon had the inside as he shared the lead with I'M YOUR CAPTAIN, battled in the lane, drifted out when put to left-handed
urging nearing the sixteenth marker, was straightened and kept the latter at bay. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN vied for the lead from the beginning, was two wide
through the bend, floated out some upper stretch, altered out slightly deep stretch as READY MADE came close, fought gamely but had to settle for second.
MAPACHE G was away somewhat slowly then bumped, settled outside, in path three through the turn, altered inside PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN at the top of
the stretch, surged along the rail the last furlong but came up a bit short. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN hesitated then broke outward, bumping MAPACHE G,
chased from inside, angled out some upper stretch and found best stride too late. GREER CROSSING chased the top pair from just outside, had the rail on
the bend, fanned outside I'M YOUR CAPTAIN for the stretch run and lacked the needed late kick. SAFE also hesitated at the break, lost ground widest
through the turn then showed a willingness to run deep stretch. CALL ME DROSSEL improved position two wide on the bend, fanned outside GREER
CROSSING into the lane and gave way between rivals.

Footnotes
NAPABIT broke on top and was quickly clear, showed the way in hand just off the inside then gradually widest command under urging in the lane. ZOEY
ATTACK was hustled up from a bit slow start, came into contention along the rail on the bend, took over second upper stretch, was no match for NAPABIT
but proved clearly second best. HANABI in contention early between rivals, swung out to path five for the stretch run then could only edge ahead for third
late. QUEEN GITA hesitated at the break then was rushed up to contention, just off the rail on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, altered in some upper
stretch for a clear path then lacked a significant response. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE prominent from inside, fanned out to path four entering the lane,
battled to hold third but slowly yielded in the late going. HER SPEAKER'S ON wan an early factor between rivals, came five wide into the lane, drifted out
some upper stretch, kept a straight path the last furlong but finished evenly. JUST AT MIDNIGHT inattentive in the gate, hesitated then appeared to swipe
the gate breaking a bit outward and was never a factor. SILVER EYES chased from outside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GOLD OAK shared the early lead inside RAIN ATTACK, saved ground through the bend, moved clear upper stretch, drifted out some in the late going but
held sway. PADDY GAL raced closest to the early speed, stayed in path three on the turn, rallied belatedly the last eighth but was easily second best.
HARPER BRIANA in midpack early, drifted out badly through the bend and passed tired ones from outside in the stretch. RAIN ATTACK displayed early
speed from outside but gave way from path two in the lane. NAUGHTY VISIONS hesitated at the start, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail
some entering the stretch and failed to have a significant response. DERBY DAY GOLD hesitated, as well, at the break and failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. GOT NO MORE TEARS quite reluctant to load, was fractious in the gate, reared up at the break and was never a factor. SHOE BIZ
hesitated too at the start and showed little. There was a stewards' inquiry into GOT NO MORE TEARS start. After their review it was deemed GOT NO
MORE TEARS was prepared to start with the rest of the field but did not.

Footnotes
TAPICITA forced in early, gradually altered out midway on the backstretch, moved back to the rail into the turn, steadily advanced to vie for the lead inside
LUCKSME leaving the bend, moved clear inside the last furlong and maintained control. LUCKSME broke on top, set the pace well off the inside, angled in
nearing the turn, stayed just off the rail, was challenged from inside leaving the bend, gradually drifted out through the stretch but held off HAPPY WORLD
for second. HAPPY WORLD raced in contention while toward the outside, advanced four wide on the turn then could only make up minor ground through
the lane. DESSERT FIRST urged to stay close early, was three wide through the bend, fought to keep third in the stretch, gradually began to yield inside the
sixteenth marker, was steadied behind LUCKSME with sixty yards to go and altered in. MISS DUTTON was hustled along from outside to also help prompt
the pace on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC trailed from off the rail, was widest taking the bend and had no late bid.
BLAME TERI was steadied behind traffic while along the rail after the first furlong then began to yield from inside on the turn.

Footnotes
SMILE AT THE STORM angled in beside I LUV THIS BAR early on as those two shared the lead, moved clear into the turn, came off the rail some entering
the stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth but dug in under steady encouragement and held off HELEN MAE'S SONG. The latter chased the top
pair from outside on the backstretch, was in path three on the bend, floated out some into the lane, moved clear for second, continued her bid deep stretch
but came up short. WARM BEAUTY void of speed, picked up her pace some from along the rail on the turn, was forced to alter out six wide for a clear path
upper stretch, made a strong moved but was too late. ONACOUNTA in midpack early, began to close the gap just off the inside on the bend, swung out five
wide into the lane then drifted a bit and lugged back in as she rallied belatedly the final furlong. I LUV THIS BAR displayed early speed in tight quarters
along the rail, did not stay with SMILE AT THE STORM after a quarter mile, came off the rail some into the turn, moved back to the rail for a clear path at
the top of the stretch and flattened out. MUD HUT chased in midpack from inside then failed to have a significant stretch bid. MINI DRESS was steadied
behind traffic after travelling the first furlong, progressed along the rail on the bend but had no late bid. CARSON RESERVE was steadied behind MINI
DRESS shortly after entering the main track, moved out widest and showed little. BUMPER GIRL stayed well off the inside, came into the lane from path six
and had little to offer.

Footnotes
SPANISH DOUBLOON unruly in the gate, vied for the lead inside rivals from the early going, began to float out on the bend, came into the stretch from path
four, edged ahead inside the last furlong and narrowly held on. TIZWOW contested the pace between horses, angled in beside SPANISH DOUBLOON on
the turn, was forced out by that one leaving the bend, floated out further entering the lane, fought gamely on even terms but lacked the extra needed in the
waning yards. ICONICUS chased from inside, came off the rail some on the bend, rallied from path three in the stretch but came up a bit short.
JUSTICEONEMORETIME came into contention along the rail on the turn, had every chance just off the inside through the lane but could not close the gap
the final eighth. MR. CHIVAS away somewhat slowly, chased from just off the inside, swung out behind SPANISH DOUBLOON entering the lane, angled
out some for a clearer path midstretch, then altered in for racing room with a sixteenth left. CHARTED pressed the early speed from outside but began to
fade four wide on the turn. INSIDE THE CIRCLE displayed early speed between foes but began to yield on the bend.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD RUBEN bumped at the break, soon shared the lead just outside SMOOTH ATTACK while in hand, moved ahead when asked leaving the
bend, came into the lane from path four, drew off under urging and was being wrapped up nearing the wire. HE'S A FINE MAN progressed from just off the
rail on the turn, altered out five wide for a clear path at the top of the stretch then took over second with a sixteenth to go. MOVE IN SILENCE forwardly
placed from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up four wide on the bend, lost considerable ground staying outside KRUELESS entering the stretch
and showed a willingness to run late. SMOOTH ATTACK displayed early speed from inside, was no match for WILDWOOD RUBEN when set down for the
drive then gradually wore down between foes inside the final furlong. TRUIST moved to the inside early on, took over third along the rail on the turn but
slowly yielded in the stretch. TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS a step slow at the break, chased from inside, picked up his pace just off the inside through the bend,
came into the stretch from path three and showed some interest inside the last eighth. SPAN was also a step slow at the start, soon trailed from well off the
inside, angled in some on the turn, altered in for a clear path with two furlongs to go, fanned out into the lane and lacked a significant response. KRUELESS
pressed the early speed from just outside, began to fade three wide on the bend, drifted out entering the stretch and continued to gradually yield.
MOCOWBELL broke inward, bumping WILDWOOD RUBEN, stayed off the inside and was never a factor.
