Footnotes
BIRTHDAY PARTY outrun in the early going, angled out five to six wide turning for home, set down for the drive, closed with good resolve down the middle
of the strip to be up in time. SCHNELL broke well, showed the way early off the inside, vied between horses through the turn, regained the advantage
midstretch, continued to lead late, could not match the winner in the final strides while inside that one. TRAELEE lacked early foot, floated out by the winner
to be seven wide into the lane, staged a mild, belated rally well out in the strip to be in time for the show.. BARAHIN moved up to vie with an early move
three wide into the turn and outside the runner up, weakened gradually in the drive, lost the show late. TAPPIN FORA DANCE moved out and advanced
closer while four wide into the turn, mid pack upper stretch, continued evenly through the final furlong. OVERDELIVER set or forced the pace along the
inside, faltered in the drive. BONUS APPRECIATION lacked speed, moved out to be five wide turning for home, made little impact through the stretch.
HONOR MY SPEED forwardly placed early between horses, pulled while rank in continued traffic from the five furlong marker until four furlongs remained,
had little left for the stretch drive in staging a retreat. PERFECT PERIGEE saved ground to no avail, faded stretch.

Footnotes
SEVEN CHANNELS outrun early while off the inside, crept closer three wide late second turn, engaged the leader for the drive and wore that rival down
under steady handling. TOUCHDOWN JOE with the pace while between horses, dueled through the second bend in the two path, proved stubborn in giving
ground grudgingly to the winner in the stetch. MR. FOUR SEVENS settled behind the first flight while saving ground, moved out a bit when making a mild
advance into the stretch, between horses a furlong out, flattened out in the late run to the wire. BUTLER CABIN one paced while toward the inside,
continued in even fashion upper stretch then picked off a single tiring foe to improve a bit late. GUITAR DOCTOR a bit rank while with the first flight through
the first turn while trying to get out, settled a bit in the run up the backstretch, dueled inside the running up through the second turn while continuing inside,
gave way in the drive. DON'T BOX ME IN with the lead flight while three wide in the first turn, fell back after a half and did not threaten thereafter. I'M D'CAT
broke back and failed to threaten. FAHAN last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
A RUNNIN AFLEET within striking distance outside, tipped out five wide into the stretch, roused, late surge, drew clear. GIRL AFRAID prompted the pace
from along the inside, continued inside to be covered up through the turn, got through along the rail into the stretch, up for the place while unable to match
the winner late. FABS pressed the pace in the two path, continued vied upper stretch, lugged in a bit to put RAIN in tight, weakened a bit in the late going.
MISS DARLENE pressed the issue up front in the three path, weakened from between horses stretch. RAIN showed the way inside, two path into the lane
allowing the runner up the inside, bothered, put in tight and steadied a furlong out to lose position. BEYOND D'ORO off slow, trailed throughout.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF RAIN AGAINST FABS FOR
INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
SPOONFUL OF SUGAR broke sharp from the outside, cleared toward the rail, was given a bit of a breather though the turn and maintained daylight through
the stretch while wrapped up a bit at the wire. DESPEIGHTFUL back off the pace toward the inside, came three wide for the drive, proved determined for
the place, not a threat to the winner. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE forwardly placed along the inside, also could not do much with the winner late while
outkicked for the place. SPARKLE CITY lacked speed, raced four to five wide through the turn, bumped with TROSKA into the stretch, improved position a
bit. TROSKA in mid pack, moved out, four wide into the lane, bumped upper stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a significant closing response.
EVERLYN'S ANGEL one paced in mid pack, had little left for the drive. APRIORITY GIRL chased the winner for three furlongs and tired. REAL DEAL RYAN
failed to menace while racing four wide. SHARE THE DOE last to leave, was always outrun.

SOCIAL SOLUTION outrun in the early going while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, advanced while once again four wide through the
second bend, set down for the drive, took over, drifted out late but proved best under firm handling. ZESTINY also back off the early pace, checked up in
traffic three wide in the first turn, three wide second bend, came inside the winner into the straight, challenged with that one while between horses,
outfinished in the late going. JAYDE'S BANDIT popped stall doors, early move, dueled, no match for top two late, gained the show. NAVARRIAN got out
while a bit rank in the first turn, pulled onto he backstretch, dueled into and though the second bend, continued to vie upper straight then began to weaken.
GEM BUOY back off the pace for a half, improved position slightly without making a serious impact. RUNNER RUNNER carried out four wide in the first turn
when with the pace, continued within striking distance, lacked response drive. AVERY'S GEM last to leave, trailed most of the way and was never a threat.
THE JUDGE antsy in the gate prior to the start, raced forwardly placed early along the inside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
ANSLIE'S GUMDROP allowed the first flight to go early, angled out four wide turning for home, set down, kicked down leader. SPECIAL NOTE with the
early pace three wide, shook clear in the turn, continued to maintain a daylight advantage inside the furlong marker, yielded to the winner late. WAKE UP
DOLORES back off the pace and the inside, steered out to be five wide into the stretch, along for the show while not a serious threat to the top pair.
STRAIGHT MEADOW flashed brief speed along the inside, fell back off the other early leaders into the turn, went evenly to the wire. NANNY'S HOUDINI
lacked speed in racing back early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SHE'S THE SHERIFF broke in, bumped REQUITE
THE EFFORT to break back then turned in an even effort toward the inside. REQUITE THE EFFORT bumped at the start, raced back and failed to menace.
QUEEN'S SOLDIER broke back and remained there in failing to threaten. DOLLY'S HARBOR sluggish from the outside while well out in the strip, continued
to lag, well back, jogged in.
