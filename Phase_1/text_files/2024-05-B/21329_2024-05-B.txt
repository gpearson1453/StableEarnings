settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and rallied late. LULU'S LULLABY stalked the early leader and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick.
PICK A PENNY was in touch, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. GRADEVOLE was in touch but chased on the turn and had no impact. MISS SCHILLER was in range
and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response.

Footnotes
BEYOND MY DREAMS was in touch, had a slim lead on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. HICKSY was in range, a factor on the turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. FOUR KNIGHTS was in mid pack, saved ground on the turn and from the five path
at the top of the stretch finished well. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was well back, had a mild gain on the turn and rallied late. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL was hustled
early and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. A I INITIATIVE was off the pace and roused on the turn but was
no threat. CRYPTIC CREED had no speed, showed little and had no impact. HALF LIT was away alertly but chased on the turn and from the four path at
the top of the stretch had nothing left. LOQUACIOUS was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was
empty.

SPIRIT BELLE was away alertly, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. T'PRING was unhurried
early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. STOLE THE RING was in touch and a factor on the turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. DOODLE DANDY was well back, closed the gap on the turn and from the eight path at the top of
the stretch was no real threat. NICOLE'S SONG was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but had no rally. STRIKE THE POSE was in range and
moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. SPRING HIGH was off slow and roused on the turn but had no response.
PERFECT PROVISION stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

BELLASPINA was away alertly, had a slim lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. AMI'S GIRL was hustled early, dueled on
the turn and vied to mid stretch but was no match for the winner. KNOTTY AND NICE tracked the early leaders and had a good position on the turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. BAMBOO'S BABE was off slow, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was
up for a share. ALMONTE PRINCESS was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. AMONG
THE ROSES was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. ROHESE was in range but chased on the turn and
had no late kick. GAMBLER'S POSE showed no speed, raced evenly on the turn and angled outside at the top of the stretch but had no rally.

Footnotes
BUSTA GROOVE was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. FAJARDO tracked the leaders from
the outside, was roused on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. DRILLHALL stalked the early leader and was a factor on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. OPEECHEE was in touch early but trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at
the top of the stretch was no threat. FOLLOW ME HOME was off the pace and raced evenly from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top
of the stretch had no late kick. DISCOVERY CHART was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch
was outrun. SCREEN LEGEND was in range and saved ground on the turn but had no impact.

Footnotes
CHROME'S BIG BREAK set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SHES HOT TO
TROT stalked the early leader and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. JIMMY IS A
BREEZE was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path a the top of the stretch needed more. ALWAY'S ROSIE was unhurried early and
moved up on the turn but was no real threat. FRAULEIN VICTORIA was in touch and roused from the inside on the turn but had no response.
KINDOFBLUEKITTEN was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but had no rally. HELECONIA was in mid pack early but chased on the turn and had
no impact. WICKEN CENTS had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.
