Footnotes
TAPITURES ACTOR pursued the pace from the inside, came out three wide leaving the bend and dug in gamely to edge past the dueling leaders and held
on while in a strong drive to prevail in the end. CLARISIT chased the pace while two wide, then rallied in the stretch to gain second position, lacked the
winning bid and held the place position. GIVE EM HAIL GAYLE pressed the pace while two wide, gained command briefly at quarter pole, then was over
powered by an outer foe in the upper stretch and was best for the show prize in the end. TEXAS KISS was no threat. BLAKE'S SONG showed the way
while being pressured by an outer foe, then lost command at the quarter pole while in a hard drive, was used up in the upper stretch and tired in the end.
CHECKER'S SONG was no menace. HOLIDAY CRUISE ducked outwardly at the start and was no factor.

LARRY'S LEGEND emerged from the pack to press the pace into the turn, was in an all out drive down the lane to edge past the pace setter in the final
yards and was up in time to prevail. GRAPNEL set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive down the lane then was out finished in the final yards by an
outer foe and was second best. HARD GOLD chased the pace while two wide, then rallied leaving the turn and was up for the show prize in the end. HELLO
HELLO MISTER was allowed to settled three wide at the back, then bid mildly in the lane and came up empty. WEIRD YEAR was allowed to settle while
two wide, then urged eagerly on the turn before coming up evenly in the stretch. DOSE'S DREAM was allowed to settled while two wide, then menaced
leaving the turn, tried to gain the show position in the upper stretch, could not and gave way in the end. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK bid for the lead early then
settled back at the back and failed to rally. DRAFT CHOICE chased the pace from the inside at an evenly pace and lacked rallying in the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY JAE tracked the pace from the inside while being nicely rated, then gained command at the eighth pole and was kept to task till the end to prevail.
BLOOD ORANGE saved ground in the early stages, then bid while four wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and was closing well in the end.
ENCHANTED NILE set the pace from the inside heading into the first turn, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch then faltered in the final
furlong. OPTIMISTIC COWGIRL raced mid pack while three wide down the backstretch, bid on the far turn while holding third position then came up evenly
in the stretch and missed the show prize in the end. GASTOWN saved ground early, then bid on the far turn while five wide, rallied in the stretch but it was
too little too late. OUR DAVINA was no threat. TWIN MISCHIEF was no menace. RIVERCREST GIRL raced mid pack while four wide down the backstretch,
then faded on the far turn, lost rider at the top of the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
UNCLE HAPPY showed the way from the inside, was overtaken by an outer foe at the quarter pole, found more to retake the lead in the late stretch and
held on determinedly to the wire. CLASSIC RICK chased the pace while four wide, was moving up steadily on the turn to gain second position in the late
stretch but could not catch the leader. LAST ATTACK was brushed at the start, then pressed the pace while two wide, gained command at the quarter pole,
then lost the lead in the late stretch by a determined UNCLE HAPPY and was best for third place in the end. MO WINNING raced at the back between
rivals, was urging steadily on the turn but did not spark in the stretch. PURE MALICE brushed foe at the start, then chased the pace while three wide into
the turn, then flattened out in the stretch. NEW BERN chased the pace from the inside while in a hard drive, was used up on the turn and weakened in the
stretch. RUSTY was no threat.

up in time to prove best. MO WILLA broke inwardly and bumped rival, then set the pace while two wide, was challenged by an inner foe on the turn, re
gained command in the late stretch then was superseded by IZE A BLAST in the end. NEPTUNE'S GROTTO pressed the pace from the inside, then dueled
inched up to duel for the lead on the turn and into the early stretch, drifted out while in hard drive then was out finished in the final yards. LADY DRILLER
chased the pace while five wide, then bid on the turn while two wide, menaced in the upper stretch but it was not enough in the end. IN A MINESHAFT was
allowed to settle along the inside, then bid leaving the turn and came up evenly. ERUMPENT broke outwardly and bumped foe, then chased the pace while
three wide, settled back on the turn between fields, rebid in the upper stretch and came up empty. INDY SPRINKLES was allowed to settle while three wide,
made a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty. MAGICALTHINGZTODO settled at the back early and was no menace in the end. PASS DA COCO

Footnotes
TALKIN CADEE showed the way from the gate and held on well to the wire to prove the best over all. PAINTBRUSH raced towards the back in the three
path while saving ground, was in a steady drive on the far while between rivals, rallied in the late stretch, bested the rest of the field but lacked the winning
bid to catch the leader. CAFEZINHO was bumped at the start, then tracked the pace while two wide throughout the early stages, gained second position in
the late stretch but did not have enough to claim victory and was out finished for the place prize. RUBY FOO tracked the pace from the inside throughout the
first three quarters, was in a long drive entering the stretch, rallied gamely but it was not enough in the end. RESOURCE broke awkwardly at the start, then
settled towards the back while two wide, rallied mildly in the late stretch but it was not enough to make an impact. SUPER CINDY broke outwardly, then
raced mid pack while two wide down the backstretch, then bid in the upper stretch to no avail in the end. ARINNITI (FR) raced at a moderate pace along the
rail and needed more in the end. TAHITIAN BREEZE settled in the back duo and came up empty in the end. PLAYMATE broke outwardly and bumped foe,
settled along the inside and came up empty. SAN MATEO KAT stalked the pace while two wide, could not over power the leader on the far turn and gave
way in the home stretch. HASHTAG WINNER was out run and no factor.

Footnotes
SHOTSHELL angled inside to lead the way into the first turn, was in the clear heading in the far turn then held sway down the lane while never being
pressured and was much the best in the end. PRINCE RAMA tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, gained second position on the far turn
but could not catch the cleared leader down the lane. CATHOLIC GUILT tracked the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far turn and was
best for the show position in the end. LIONS NOT SHEEP was unhurried early, then bid eagerly on the turn while two wide then continued to rally mildly
down the lane to no avail in the end. WORDS OF WISDOM raced in the middle pack while three wide, then rallied on the far turn but it was not enough in
the end. MUFFIN NUTS raced mid pack inside, then retreated in the late backstretch, re bid in the upper stretch and came up empty. GET WITT GONE was
no threat. SPERLE raced mid pack while two wide, then dropped back on the far turn and failed to rally in the stretch.

in the end. TILLIS chased the pace while three wide mid pack, then rallied gamely at the top of the stretch, gained second position, was moving in on the
leader but did not have enough in the end. SAINT PIO vied for the lead from the inside into the turn, then was out kicked by an outer foe in the upper stretch
and held onto the show prize while in a mild drive. FLIP THE COIN JAN was allowed to settle along the inside, then bid mildly on the turn and closed too
little too late in the stretch. TEXAS TITAN raced in the middle of the pack while four wide and outside of rivals, then came out seven wide leaving the bend
and continued in a mild drive down the lane to no avail in the end. GRAMI'S BOY chased the pace while four wide, then rallied on the turn, could not out bid
the leaders and gave way in the late stretch. TEXAS HOLDEM vied for the lead while two wide, gained command briefly on the turn while in a hard drive,
then was out kicked by an outer foe and gave way in the final yards. FLY'N SEXY was allowed to settle while three wide, then came out five leaving the turn
to bid in the stretch, was brushed by an inner foe and came up empty in the end. WHOOPING JAY raced mid pack while five wide, urged eagerly on the
turn then brushed foe in the upper stretch and was no threat in the end. SUEZ trailed early and was no menace. SR. BI BI pursued the pace early while two
wide, then settled back along the inside on the turn and lacked bidding in the stretch. MAGIC BOW stalked the pace from the inside, was urging mildly on
the turn before flattening out in the stretch.
