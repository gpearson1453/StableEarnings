POPULIST showed good early speed to set an uncontested early pace, met bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, hard ridden near the rail and drew off
through the stretch run under steady handling. IMPLICATOR settled off the early going, raced just off the inside around the far turn, was two to three wide in
the stretch run, moved up late to narrowly secure the place position but was no match for the winner. THUNDER ROAD stalked the pace, raced four wide
into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. BEER CHASER tracked the early leader under a snug hold two deep from the outside and weakened the
final eighth of a mile. MAX PANDOWDY had an inside run and no late response. BIG POWER RED raced near the back of the pack early, was four deep
near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid.

TAKEOVER FIFTYFOUR tracked the early leader two deep, ridden into the far turn, had command just past the quarter pole and drew off to be clear under
strong handling. DOUBLE ON THE RED settled off the early going, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire while racing
from the outside. BIG TAP BABY showed good early foot to set the early pace and weakened a bit through the drive. PUNCHIE was unhurried early on,
ridden between two deep near the three eighths pole and flattened out in the drive. LONE STAR MAX was forced to check sharply early on between rivals,
dropped in to saved ground and never threatened. MARVINS' POSSE stalked the pace near the rail and faded while off the inside in the drive.

Footnotes
PINCHING PENNIES rated along from the outside, raced four wide around both turns, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling in a determined run.
RADIANT REBEL stalked the pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled out into the upper stretch, took aim near the eighth pole and missed in
a game effort. CHAPELLETE pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened through the drive. BACK STREET BABY was bumped at the break,
showed good early foot to set a pressured pace near the rail and faded. MY IDEA dropped to the back of the pack early, swung six wide into the upper
stretch and never was a serious threat. OUR INDIAN GIRL dropped back to race mid pack early on, three deep near the quarter pole and gave way.
MALLORY UNBRIDLED failed to respond. WITH A SONG was bumped, took up at the break, hard ridden near the three eighths pole from the rail, shuffled
back and was empty the final quarter of a mile.

DEBATER chased the early pace, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and edged up late under strong handling. STARSTUDDED AFFAIR
dueled for the early lead between horses and kept on gamely to the wire. ONLY A DREAM was off very slow, raced at the back of the pack after the poor
start, moved up from the inside around the far turn, angled out and closed in gamely. KANT CONQUER ME dropped back to race mid pack early, made a
three to five wide bid in the lane moved up. EL GABRIELO dueled near the rail and weakened. BRONTE DIEM dueled three deep from the outside foes and
faded. ALL JACKED UP raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. CAPITAN GEORGE raced six wide around the far turn and never
