Footnotes
CURLIN'S LIL GAL tracked the top pair through early stages, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, dug in under steady urging in upper stretch, took
control over the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and finished going away. PRETTYWITTYANDWISE set a pressured pace up the backstretch and
around the turn, took a clearer lead at the head of the lane, continued determinedly past mid-stretch then got collared at the sixteenth pole. LIL KNOCKOUT
lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied along the outside and narrowly missed place. LITTLE TAP DANCER pressed
the pace in opening stages and continued to force the issue around the turn, could not remain in touch with the leader in the upper stretch but ran on then
weakened in the final furlong. RUN FOR HOME raced off the pace, hustled along two wide around the turn and never threatened. BREATHTAKING FOLLY
saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
FLOATING was off slow at the start, quickly advanced up the inside to sit just off the early leader, angled out and moved up to engage MORE THAN A DIVA
at the quarter pole, briefly matched strides in upper stretch, took control a furlong out and finished going away. MORE THAN A DIVA sped to a clear lead
soon after the start, set the pace and continued to lead the way into the turn, took on the challenge of FLOATING near the quarter pole, fought back in
upper stretch, failed to move on with winner approaching the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. JAVISTHA raced off the the top two leaders,
hustled up along the rail around the turn, ran on into the lane and stayed on for a share. CHAI TEA sat back off the pace, urged two wide around the turn,
continued under pressure into the stretch run but had no response.

MY FOUR POINT OH hustled along between foes in early contention, moved up closer near the quarter pole, given cue two wide late on the turn, drifted out
turning for home, dueled inside of LAZY N LUCKY and drifted out down the lane causing rival to go wider. LAZY N LUCKY sat back in early stages then
ranged up to challenge four wide at the quarter pole, dueled outside of MY FOUR POINT OH and was carried out wider down the lane. CANADIAN JANE
hustled along three wide in pursuit up the backstretch, continued in close range late on the turn, was forced to steady when MY FOUR POINT OH drifted out
turning for home, weakened and churned on for a share. BACKSEAT BABY set the pace up the backstretch, took on challengers late on the turn, lost the
lead in upper stretch and gave way. NATIVE QUEEN sat just off the early leaders, saved ground and hustled up into the the stretch but failed to threaten.

READY FOR WINE tracked in opening stages then moved up to engage with KANTIRUN entering the turn, raced on equal terms then failed to match with
rival in the upper stretch, stayed on determinedly, steadily edged up closer and prevailed on the wire. KANTIRUN set a pressured pace up the backstretch
and around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, stayed on gamely but got caught in final stride. TIZ A STRATEGY tracked the early pace, ranged up
closer four wide late on the turn, ran on into the lane and cleared the rest. SECRET CITY was never too far back in early stages, saved ground around the
turn, hustled up along the rail in upper stretch and had no response. FLAT OUT NICE pressed the early pace, weakened late on the turn and retreated in
the lane.

Footnotes
COLORFUL NATIVE sped to the lead out of the gate and angled closer to the inside, raced under pressure in opening stages then shook free and held
clear entering the turn, roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly, widened to commanding lead and kept to task. ROWDY RAY tracked the early
leader, raced in hand two wide around the turn, launched a bid entering the head of the lane, was no match for the clear leader but dug in gamely to capture
place. HOOKED ON DREAMS got bumped at the start, was forwardly placed along the inside, saved ground then angled out three to four wide for the drive,
sustained a steady bid and got outnodded for place. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL broke out and bumped with rival at the start, settled through early stages
inside, tipped two wide for the stretch run, shifted out wider and had a mild improve. STAR OF MINE got bumped at the start and sat just off the early pace,
hustled along three to four wide through the turn then gave way. WELLER ROGUE lacked speed, raced in the back and never menaced. FRANKLYGREAT
was forwardly placed up the backstretch and into the turn, weakened near the quarter pole and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
WOKE UP IN LOVE rated two wide just off the early pace, waited patiently around the turn, launched a bid in the three path upper stretch, dueled with
SHIPS ON FIRE deep stretch and just got up under a driving finish. SHIPS ON FIRE vied for the early lead, continued under pressure around the turn,
shook free to a slim lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely on top, dueled with WOKE UP IN LOVE deep stretch and just missed. JAYSKER stalked the top
pair in the opening quarter, remined up close three wide late on the turn, spun out four wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid and edged up closer in final
stages. TEMPLE CITY RUN settled and saved ground up the backstretch, lacked racing room along the rail at the head of the lane, waited briefly then got
through two wide, edged ahead then evened out. WARRIOR'S RUN lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four wide into the lane and never menaced.
UNCLE SINGH vied for the lead in the opening quarter, continued to match strides through the turn then quickly retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KEEN CAT saved ground on the first turn and rated just off the top two flights up the backstretch, made a move two wide turning for home, edged ahead,
took the inside position, took over the lead from stable-mate and held safe. DINNER AT CRUMPIES tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden
between foes around the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, shifted out a path wider in the final furlong, found more in reserve and edged up
closer to the wire. DAVIDIC LINE raced two to three wide around the first turn, pressed the pace up the backstretch, cleared command upon entering the far
turn, continued to lead the way a furlong out then got collared by stablemate and weakened to show. TEXTHELEGEND was well reserved racing in the
back, hustled up five wide into upper stretch and improved possition. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR raced well back early on, hustled along four wide into
upper stretch and never threatened. CASEYS MEMORY raced in range four wide up the backstretch, continued in contention along the outside around the
turn then tired in the drive. UXMAL led the way around the first turn, set aa pressured pace up the backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and
continued to tire in the drove.

Footnotes
ADDABABY vied inside of rivals up the backstretch, shook free still in hand around the turn, given cue at the head of the lane, had more left in the reserve
and kept clear under steady encouragement. SWEET MOTHER MARY raced near midpack in opening stages, edged closer three wide near the quarter
pole, sustained a bid in the three path down the lane and dug in gamely to capture place. SINGING EMMA vied for the lead in early stages, remained
forwardly placed just off the leader around the turn, continued with response down the lane and got nipped for place on the wire. PAT'S RIDE tracked the
pace along the inside, launched a two wide bid turning for home, continued in strong contention into the final furlong then got edged in final strides for runner
up spots. ROSE PARADE raced between rivals in opening stages, hustled along four to five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. KAYLA
raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the stretch run and never threatened. SING CHARMER SING lacked speed, raced in the back, came two to
three wide into upper stretch and had no response. CHARYBDIS vied three deep in early stages, came up empty in the turn, retreated and jogged in.
