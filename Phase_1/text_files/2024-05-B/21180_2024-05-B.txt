Footnotes
IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME stalked the early pace three wide, then two wide on the turn, made a two wide bid and took over off the bend, then was given one
pop right handed with the crop nearing the furlong marker and responded well to draw off while being ridden out to the wire. HONEY RUN was off a step
slow, settled four wide, then advanced three wide on the turn, then proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. COINMAKER pressed the
early pace from the inside, then was rated back on the turn, tipped out two wide off the bend and weakened. HOPE OVER FEAR was away alertly to set a
pressured pace early in the two path, then was clear and on the inside on the turn but gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
VINEGAR HILL showed good early speed and set a pressured pace on the inside while in hand, then was roused leaving the three sixteenths and sent
down and responded well to kick clear to prove best. INDIGO WIND pressed the winner two wide on the turn, made a bid three wide off the bend but could
not match strides with the winner in the final furlong while staying on to be second best. CHADO tracked the pace four to three wide, made a four wide bid
off the bend but flattened out, bested the rest. EL DANDI steadied slightly leaving the seven sixteenths, then chased the pace four wide on the turn, came
five wide off the bend and had no rally. ACE IT broke awkwardly and was off slowly, settled in the back and came four wide off the bend and improved
position. COST OF WAR was settled on the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and had no rally. SLANDEROUS was away alertly then had to
check early and dropped back on the inside, angled out in the furlong grounds and was not a threat. SWEET MO B broke in at the start, settled early and
was in between rivals by the three eighths marker, then came off the bend on the inside and weakened.

POUNDS IN TOWN dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid off the bend and drew clear then was kept to left handed crop urging to prove best.
INDY'S UNIVERSE hesitated at the start, reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn and came seven wide off the bend and finished well to be clearly
second best. GLAMOURCENTS tracked the pace early and was towards the inside on the turn, moved out and made a three wide bid off the turn but
needed more late while besting the rest. DELICATE stumbled shortly after the start, then checked leaving the half mile marker and dropped back to trail the
field, then made a inside move on the turn and moved out off the inside in the lane but flattened out late. SEVILLA chased the pace and was four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the lane and had no kick. BAYTOWN STORM chased the pace three wide on the turn and came five wide off the bend and had
no rally. VONGOLE showed good early speed and dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn but gave way in the lane, eased late.

four wide move, then took over leaving the bend and was clear by the furlong marker and then drew out to prove much the best. GRAYTON showed good
speed to set a pressured pace on the inside, turned back CLOSING PRAYER leaving the bend but could not match strides with the winner while staying on
to be clearly second best. MIDWAY VOW was settled early, two wide on the turn and came three wide off the bend and moved out in the lane and was
along for the show award. ROCKAWAY REEF tracked the early pace on the inside, fell back on the turn, then moved out in the lane and was out-kicked for
the show award. CLOSING PRAYER prompted the pace three to two wide, then was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. E B

along the inside and saved ground on the turn, waited by the quarter pole and tipped out two wide leaving the bend but had no kick while just missing the
show award. SAINT ROCCO chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened. LAZARUS was bumped at the break, settled on the inside on
the turn and had no rally. FIRE WIRE was reserved early and failed to menace. MAKE IT SPEND IT was outrun early and never factored.

HOUSE UNITED stalked the pace three to two wide, then came three wide off the bend, then ran on willingly and had a late surge to get up in time to prove
best under a drive. CARNITINE set the pace on the inside and was well handled, then was sent down and spurted clear by the furlong marker and then
wandered by the sixteenth marker and was denied late to just fail. ASK ARTHUR was rated along four to three wide, then continued to be three wide on the
far turn and came four wide off the turn but lacked the needed stretch bid while clearly besting the rest. GLENBROOK GERRY was reserved early, two wide
on the far turn and came three wide into the lane, moved out in the lane and improved position to gain the last spot in the superfecta. REYNOLDS
CHANNEL was rated early, then pulled on the first turn nearing the six furlong marker and continued hard to handle to the eleven sixteenths then settled
nearing the five furlong marker on the inside, then was ridden along by the five sixteenths and angled out in the lane but came up empty. YELL COUNTY
was four wide into the first turn, then settled, saved ground on the far turn and tired. MR SCATTER was void of early speed, came wide into the lane and
was not a threat. ACCONA was bumped hard at the start, reserved on the inside and tired. CODE WORD was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace
four to three wide, then was two wide on the far turn and stopped.

JUSTIFIABLE BELLE stalked the pace two wide under a hard hold, then made a three wide bid off the bend and was clear by the furlong marker, then was
given a reminder left handed with the crop to remain clear to the wire. ZAWISH was rated along two to three wide, came five wide off the bend and finished
well and held the place award late. GLITTERING LIGHTS (GB) was settled early, two wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied well on
the outside to just miss the place award. EMBRACE ME was reserved early, saved ground on the far turn and then had a rail rally to gain the last spot in the
superfecta. SECRET STATEMENT was a bit in tight entering the first turn, then tracked the pace along the inside, eased out and came three wide into the
lane but had no kick. QUALITY STAR was settled back three wide, came six wide into the lane and had a mild late kick. BEST PERFORMER was settled
early on the inside, came two wide into the lane and had no rally. WONDERFULL LADY (FR) was reserved early, two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally.
HONEY HAULER set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed by the three sixteenths and gave way in the final furlong. FLATTER ME SILLY
was settled back early, four wide on the backstretch, three wide on the far turn and was not a threat.

the three sixteenths to widened the margin by the furlong marker and then was given one more right handed pop with the crop in the furlong grounds to
remain clear to the wire. ROCKABILLIE was rated early, two wide and in between rivals on the turn, then finished willingly to be clearly second best while no
match to the winner. LIL TOWN SIS chased the pace along the inside and cut the corner off the turn but faded while staying on for the show award. R
QUEEN CANDY was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and between rivals, then came four wide off the turn and weakened. WEST COAST
HARBOR stalked the pace two wide, came three wide off the turn and then was empty in the final furlong. VERY WEALTHY chased the early pace on the
