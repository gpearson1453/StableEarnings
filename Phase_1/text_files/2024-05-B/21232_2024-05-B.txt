raced in range three wide and finished evenly to maintain the show. CHEESE failed to menace while racing three wide. BELLE MIA was bumped at the start
then checked soon after, raced well back two wide and never threatened. STUBOLD was bumped then checked at the start, raced three wide and was
never in contention. OVERNIGHT EXPRESS had only brief speed inside. RUBY TIGER played no factor while racing four wide. U BET JO'S PRAYING was

Footnotes
EL ROJO VIVO set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the turn, kicked away from an outer foe at the top of the lane, and held sway.
FONTINA prompted the pace in the four path, bid two wide midway around the turn, was coaxed approaching the quarter, lost touch with the winning
pacesetter in upper stretch, but ran on for place. ANTILLEAN had a slow start, trailed along the inside, hit the rail going into the turn, cut the corner turning
into the lane, and kept on for show. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES chased in the three path, was ridden into the turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, but
flattened. DIVINING STONE raced off the pace in the three path but never menaced from the six path in the stretch.

Footnotes
ACAMAR set the pace in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear while drifting out. TRUTH AND HONESTY was bumped at the start,
prompted the winner in the three path, could not gain on that foe but kept on to hold the place. WARLORD CRUZAN raced off the pace five wide and rallied
for the show. FORT ATTITUDE was bumped just after the start, raced in range in the two path and finished evenly. FORTY FLASH stalked the pace four
wide and lacked the needed rally. JAMES GANG raced off the pace three wide, steadied near the three-eighths marker and never threatened. GONE NUTS
saved ground and failed to menace. MISTER MOORE broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. ROWDY JESS
bobbled then bumped at at the start, saved ground and was involved.

AWESOME BEAST bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, angled to the rail early around the turn, appeared to bump with an outer
foe midway around the turn, bid passing the quarter, took command while tipping out to the three path at the top of the lane, and drew clear. SIOUX
prompted the pace in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, swung from the seven path into the stretch, and chased on for place. JONAS'
DREAM set the pace in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, appeared to bump with an inner challenger midway around the
turn, lost the lead while floating out to the six path at the top of the lane, and faded to show. MOR SPRING SPIRIT laid up close in the five path, was roused
between foes from the four path passing the three-eighths pole, but weakened on his left lead in the stretch. ADIOS PAPA CHICO trailed in the seven path,
was urged from the five path around the turn, but did not factor. YOURAMYSTYLE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, but drifted
out midway around the turn, and failed to threaten. NEVER SAY NEVER broke out at the start, raced off the pace in the six path and never menaced.

Footnotes
MISTER ABARRIO settled off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
INTERNAL CAPITAL saved ground in range, raced two wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane
and gained the place. IRON MAN JIMMY set the pace along the rail, led to upper stretch and held well enough for a share of the show. SPLIT STRIKE
prompted the pace two and three wide, could not match strides with winner in the final furlong but kept on between foes for a share of third. HALON failed to
menace while racing three wide. SAM STORMY was bumped after the start, saved ground off the pace, made some progress in upper stretch but was
blocked through the final furlong. ADMIRAL'S WAVE was bumped after the start, trailed inside around the first turn, went five wide around the far turn and
never threatened. MOTIVO chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. TIZ THE COAST had his head turned at the start, came in an bumped soon
after, tracked the pace three wide between foes but was through after a half.

of the lane, and drew clear. STREET EARNINGS raced wellback in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the turn, angled out to the six path
turning into the stretch, and ran on while on his left lead for place. ASHER'S EDGE stalked in the four path, was driven around the turn, swung from the five
path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. ARROGANCY pressed in the three path, was driven two wide around the turn, but flattened from the four

ANATOMY saved ground off the pace, swung widest in upper stretch, closed outside and was up and clear late. ADMIRAL HOPPER set the pace in the two
path and led until deep stretch. FORTUNA BELLE stalked the pace three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. BAHAMIAN MOON raced well
back two wide early, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole and rallied belatedly inside of foes. ONE OF ONE broke through the starting gate prior to the
start, trailed early, raced three wide and improved position in the lane. SOPHIA'S STORM failed to menace while racing three wide. FLIRTINI pressed the
pace two and three wide and weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
MODICA hesitated at the start, rated in the two path, tipped out under rousing midway around the far turn, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane,
rallied, and drew clear of inner foes late. SIR MENDEL stalked in the two path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, bid in the four path at the top
of the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. WHITING FIELD prompted the pace in the three path, bid
two wide going into the turn, took the lead passing the quarter, but lost the lead to an outer foe in upper stretch, and kept on for show. DOWNING STREET
laid in midpack along the inside, was cued into the far turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, tried to angle further out but got shutoff and bumped
with an outer foe passing the eighth pole, then evened out. FIRST SHOT FIRED chased in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn,
tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and flattened. PALPITO set the pace inside, was coaxed
midway around the far turn, but yielded along the inside in the stretch. NAMELESS bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the two path,
bumped with an outer foe while in the four path going into the far turn, then angled towards the rail, and did not factor. DIXIE PREACH trailed in the three
path, got bumped out to the five path going into the far turn, and did not threaten. FIGHT TIL DAWN raced off the pace in the five path but never menaced.
WINE GOGGLES bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path but backed up around the far turn.
