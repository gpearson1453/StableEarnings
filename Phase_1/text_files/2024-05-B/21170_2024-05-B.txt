Footnotes
ADRIA set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead inside of SPANISH DELIGHT around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and kept clear
under steady urging. SPANISH DELIGHT applied pressure to ADRIA through early stages, vied with rival around the turn, could not match strides in upper
stretch but stayed on with response and cleared second best. IRISH TAP lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along three to four wide into the lane
and captured a share. AWESOME VIEW was forwardly placed tracking the top pair, weakened off the top duo past the half mile marker, chased two to three
wide around the turn and got edged late for show.

THAT'S OUR VISION tracked the pace along the inside, waited patiently for a clear path around the turn, split foes in upper stretch, roused forward to a slim
lead, challenged by GISELES MAP late dug in gamely and held firm. GISELE'S MAP drifted in and steadied at the start, recovered quickly and moved up to
race mid-range, launched a a four wide bid near the quarter pole, came five wide into upper stretch, shifted in a few paths, challenged the winner for the late
lead but yielded nearing the wire. CLIMB TO GLORY was forwardly placed, vied for command around the turn, battled on into the final furlong then gave
waay. SISTER SWEDE tracked the early pace, moved up to challenge near the quarter pole, raced in striking distance four deep a furlong out then failed to
keep pace. MISSION MAKER raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and had a mild improve without threatening. LUCYS STROLL raced in
the back, came three to four wide into the lane and never threatened. BACKSTAGE PASS set the pace, vied around the turn, fought back top of the lane
then tired in the drive.

WEARACAP quickly cleared the lead and angled inside, set the pace then came under pressure late on the backstretch, edged ahead to a slim lead and
held gamely around the turn, widened advantage in the upper stretch and kept to task under steady encouragement. TALONS TIME tracked the pace along
the inside, waited patiently for room along the turn, launched a two wide bid entering the head of the lane, put in a good effort down the lane but had to
settle for second best. FREDDY J was off near the back and steadily edged up closer up the backstretch, angled out and moved up three wide at the
quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and prevailed for a share. LEAPIN TY MAN moved up and pressed the pace late on the backstretch, chased in
close contention around the turn, came three wide into the lane and flattened in the final furlong. DREADPIRATEROBERTS raced off the early pace, saved
ground, cut the corner entering upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. ANNUAL BUDGET raced in range up the backstretch, flattened a bit mid-way
around the turn then gave way. LEADING THE CAUSE failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
RAHM was nicely rated while saving ground up the backstretch, picked up the pace along the outside late on the turn, came under strong right handed
urging five wide at the head of the lane, responded gamely, rallied up to take control of the lead past mid-stretch and finished clear. GREY STORM tracked
in contention up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, split foes leaving the turn, stayed on with response and finished second
best. VALE pressed the early pace, took a slim lead late on the turn, continued on top a furlong out, then got collared by the winner and weakened to show.
FIRE BRYAN raced in range two wide, was ridden along three wide around the turn then flattened in the drive. MR CREED raced off the pace, saved
ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. SISAWAY NOW led the way in the opening quarter, vied for the lead entering the turn then tired in the
drive. AL'S ROMEO was restless in the gate, raced off the pace and never threatened.

for home, quickly widened to a commanding lead, stayed sharp with willing response and pulled away to an easy score. RUN FIRE RUN raced in range two
wide between rivals just off the top flight, hustled along into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained
response and captured place. DESPERATE MAN was quickly clear from the outside, angled inside and led the way, came under pressure then vied for the
lead with MR FILLIP around the turn, could not match strides turning for home and weakened to show. FIRESPITTEN KITTEN raced in close contention
along the inside up the backstretch, remained in close range and launched a bid near the quarter pole, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained
bid into upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. SIR OTTO raced in contention positioned four deep in a bunched up field, hustled along in range
around the turn then gave way. POWER SLAM was not far from the frontend while racing three wide between foes in the opening quarter, weakened then
got pulled up while injured late on the turn and vanned off.

BAYSHORE FOXES bumped with inside foe and came away a step slow at the start, quickly advanced up the backstretch and vied for the lead with
SLUSHY around the turn, continued in striking distance of leader a furlong out, dug in gamely, raced noses apart approaching the wire and prevailed under
an all out drive. SLUSHY set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with BAYSHORES FOXES around the turn, shook free to a slight edge in upper
stretch, then raced noses apart with aforementioned foe in final stages, dug in gamely from the inside and got nipped for the win. FULL SPIRIT tracked the
pace along the inside, angled out and hustled up late on the turn, came three to four wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and prevailed for a share.
HOUSE WRECKER was forwardly placed, chased the top pair around the turn, came three wide into the lane, ran on then evened out in late stages. GIRL
PRO bumped with outside rival and came away a step slow at the start, raced in the back then urged for response entering the turn, briefly gained closer
contention, fanned five wide into upper stretch and had no late response. BLOW SUM SMOKE was not too far back racing to to three wide in the early
going, swung four to five wide into the lane and weakened. GAME TO PLAY steadily retreated after early stages.
