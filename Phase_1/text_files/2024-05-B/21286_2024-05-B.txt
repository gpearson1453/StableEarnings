Footnotes
STRIKE A CHORD broke in on the start bumping fellow rival, was then hustled to take command outside with four furlongs remaining, opened up going
around the turn, drifted out momentarily when urged left-handed in upper stretch, straightened out for the drive in the final eighth and pulled away again for
the score. FEATHERWEIGHT broke sharp to have the early lead, was relegated to a chasing role inside at the half mile marker, continued to run after the
loose pacesetter through the turn, edged closer by upper stretch to pose the only threat to the winner but was repelled in the final furlong. GET MY DRIFT
broke out exchanging bumps with the outside foe on the start, was then briefly taken a hold of entering the backstretch, co-trailed on the outside by the half,
had to be checked outside rivals into the turn, angled out widest in the six path for the drive and closed in to be a distant third under a troubled trip. SOUL
JOURNEY travelled on the outside in mid-division down the backside, could not get into gear showing little interest three wide outside foes on the turn,
angled out in the five path between runners at the top of the lane and finished up willingly for a minor role. LADIES RUM stalked between runners down the
backstretch, was asked going into the turn trying to keep forward position, made little headway on the fence travelling around the oval, had nowhere to go,
losing her path at the eighth pole and could not be a factor late. SWIFT RIVER was off a bit slow to begin, co-trailed on the inside mid-backstretch, improved
on the rail into the turn, shifted out in the four path for the drive but wilted in the final furlong. GOINGTOARUBA tracked the top two in the early stages, was
roused at the three eighths pole, maintaining position around the bend, began to shorten stride inside in upper stretch and folded at the furlong marker on
the wrong lead to the wire.

Footnotes
POETIC AMY had an ideal spot nestled on the fence watching the four engaged leaders in mid-backstretch, closed in on the rail with five sixteenths to go,
shifted outside to bid for the lead at the furlong pole and drew away smartly in deep stretch. IRON PYRITE brushed the gate on the start, recovered to have
a slim lead early, was a part of the quartet in the mix up front at the half between runners, had tight surroundings and was shuffled back some at the three
eighths pole, was roused starting to re-rally on the fence by the quarter marker and burst between horses late to get up for second money when crossing the
line. SIGIRIYA was away slowly to trail after the break, began to smartly pick up runners saving ground with a rail rally throughout the turn and finished up
with interest on the fence just missing out on the place share at the wire. CHERRY GARDENS pressed the pace inside at the start, emerged from the four
pronged duel to have the lead with four furlongs remaining, was going comfortably setting the fractions around the bend, had little to give when passed by
the winner outside just inside the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch losing a couple of placings at the finish line. VIRGINIA'S LEGACY stalked near the
rear in the early going, offered a mild run shifting out to be three wide at the three furlong marker, continued to rally on the turn to be in the hunt widest in the
six path at the top of the stretch but stalled being one paced to the finish line. IT'S ME was unhurried down the backstretch seeing the field at the half, could
not get involved still at the back through the turn and passed tired runners in the final sixteenth. MOET MONET forced the pace outside at the half, came
under a hard ride chasing the frontrunner around the bend, could not find more turning for home and flattened out running to the wire. SPEED LOADER
tracked four deep outside horses down the backstraight, was scrubbed on with runners on each side by the quarter pole, could not keep up with rivals and
emptied out down the lane.

Footnotes
SEA TO AIR emerged with a clear lead from the outside while in hand at the seven sixteenths marker, travelled confidently unopposed setting the fractions
on the turn and had enough left in reserve to hold off rivals down the stretch under a well rationed front end score. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE was reined in on
the rail to sit behind the frontrunning winner along the backside, patiently waited behind the pacesetter on the fence throughout the turn, shifted just off the
rail for the drive and was gaining some late but it was not enough at the finish. WARP RIDE tracked outside in the second flight, was asked for more two
wide outside on the turn, could not gain on the loose leader on the bend, battled in the three path straightening out for home, lacked a finish late and could
not threaten the top two at the wire. HARDWARE GAP trailed the field down the backside, was roused three wide closing the gap at the three furlong pole,
was in the thick of things outside foes with a quarter remaining but could only finish up evenly down the lane to settle on the fringes. SUPER HEADLINE
stalked near the rear down the backside, could not get interested losing contact with the field around the turn and made no impression in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ANAM CARA broke outwardly a bit, settled near the inside at the back, raced two to three wide coming past the quarter pole in behind runners, shifted a bit
inside a foe, advanced past that one then came out three to four deep with aim on the leader, took over a sixteenth from home and drew clear under steady
handling. HOT CARGO set the pace shadowed by a foe racing just off the inside, moved clear coming to the seven-sixteenths, was encouraged turning for
home, collared at the sixteenth pole, outkicked but held the place. JULIE'S MIST tracked from mid-pack inside, came out a bit leaving the turn then further
still to be five wide by mid-stretch, kept on one-paced. ZISISIT (IRE) was briefly among the leaders but quickly dropped back between foes heading up the
backstretch, angled eight wide in upper stretch, showed good energy but was too late. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY stalked from outside four to five wide on
the turn, came out seven wide in the stretch, kicked on evenly and made no bid. KNOW HOW (GB) pressed the early pace then continued to chase three to
four wide, asked for more by the five-sixteenths but failed to rally. HOLIDAY WITH AMY broke a step slowly, settled outside at the rear, swung eight wide
turning for home, failed to rally.

Footnotes
PEJA DU took control from the start setting a soft pace, rated comfortably on the lead down the backside, had no challengers running around the final bend
and had more to get when set down turning for home to draw away convincingly at the wire. SUNRISE DRIVE was situated in mid-pack on the inside down
the backstretch, started to gain on rivals when encouraged left-handed midpoint on the far turn, angled out in the four path at the top of the stretch with
momentum and closed in belatedly to capture second money. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY was quite content to sit behind the pacesetter in the early going, kept
tabs on the frontrunner down the backstretch, was asked to reel in the leader three furlongs from home, could not close the gap, chased the winner down
the lane and faded late to lose the place share. CASANOVA KITTEN broke out, having his head cocked at the start, stalked the top two on the rail into the
first turn, continued to keep a close eye on the front pair down the back straight, closed in mildly on the fence at the quarter pole and battled inside for the
place share to the wire but faded late to hold for a minor share in the end. EMBRACE MY UNCLE had one rival beaten in the first turn, made little progress
along the backside, could not get into contention be the three eighths pole and passed a tired one in the stretch. HELL BENT settled outside rivals down the
backstretch in mid-pack, had little to offer losing ground to the leaders on the final turn and yielded in upper stretch. BUTTERED TOAST trailed the field
from the onset, could never get into gear and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PONCE DE LEON was forwardly-placed tracking inside, saved ground advancing on the turn, sought room past the quarter pole in behind the leader, came
out at the top of the stretch with aim, steadily gained taking the lead inside the final furlong and drew clear. HAWKESBURY was bumped just after the break
but quickly recovered, set the pace shifting in but racing off the rail and pressed by an outside foe, shook clear passing the seven-sixteenths, was collared
inside the final eighth but second best. HIGHLAND BLUE bumped a rival after the start then pressed that one's pace up the backstretch, continued the
pursuit three wide through the turn, kept on in the lane but needed more. GILT EDGE stalked from outside with good position just off the leaders, moved out
from four to six wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. MAESTROS MUSIC settled off the pace outside, was four to five wide through the turn
making a mild advance, lugged out in upper stretch, evened out late. AMERICAN DECISION tucked in while reserved toward the rear well back of the
leaders, swung eight wide turning for home, finished strongly but far too late. VITALITY broke outwardly, moved up between and behind foes heading up the
backstretch and was in a bit tight, settled while racing off the inside, shifted six wide turning into upper stretch, ran on. ARYEH shifted in, saved ground on
the turn riding the rail into upper stretch but could only run on evenly. HAVE IT MY WAY was strongly urged from the start, raced inside, came out a bit
nearing the quarter, failed to threaten. GOOD SIN appeared to the hit the gate at the start, was devoid of speed racing well back early, swung nine wide,
failed to threaten. ONE LAST KISS chased mid-pack near the inside, came out four wide turning for home and under urging, came up empty. LOST STAR
broke a step slowly, was kept off the inside racing toward the back and never got near enough to threaten. CONNOR chased from mid-pack outside a foe,
tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE TEDDY was brushed on the break inside, settled comfortably on the rail in the middle of the pack along the backside, rallied two wide between
runners midpoint on the turn, quickly split foes in the four path at the top of the stretch and was full of run to the wire kicking on by in the final furlong.
HURRICANE CLAIR hopped on the break brushed the outside rival to begin, tracked the engaged duo mid-backside, closed in on the turn to bid in the three
path with horses on each side straightening for home and was out finished by the winner in deep stretch. PRIMA travelled between foes in the two path in
mid-pack with a half mile to go, was under a snug hold waiting, looking for room to move on the turn, advanced inside with a quarter remaining, found a
seam in the two path at the top of the lane to bid for the lead but was outdueled in the final furlong. JUST FOLLOW ME broke alertly to clear to the rail for
the lead, was then headed outside at the nine sixteenths marker, opened up again by the half, maintained a diminishing lead by the quarter pole and faded
with an eighth left to go to settle for a minor share. SPIRIT BEAR travelled in mid-division four deep along the backside, advanced around foes in the three
path with three furlongs to go, was in the hunt five wide straightening out for home, was brushed mildly inside in upper stretch, could not continue the run
and stalled in the last sixteenth. CANDID CANDACE was void of early speed trailing down the backside, caught up to rivals five wide at the top of the lane
and finished with interest passing runners down the stretch. BRAQUET stalked inside near the rear, made no headway running around the bend and could
not get into contention running to the wire. MAGICAL TRICK settled in mid-pack three wide between foes at the half, was checked having runners on both
sides at the three furlong marker, recovered when roused four wide at the quarter pole, had a chance for a share widest in the six path turning for home but
flattened out down the lane. SWEET CHARLIZE stalked outside near the back of the pack, was urged but offered little run through the turn and had no finish
to give in the stretch drive. LADY WELLINGTON pressed the pace outside in mid-backstretch, was then relegated to track the leader outside into the turn,
came under a ride between rivals but could not quicken on the oval and folded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE took a clear lead getting to the rail entering the backstretch, had little pressure from behind when dictating the pace around the
bend, spurted away in upper stretch and had no challengers around at the wire. QUEEN MACHA broke outwards to begin, was ahead of only one rival
down the backstretch, could see the field while running on the fence turning for home, finally found a seam in the three path with a sixteenth to go and burst
between runners to nail place at the wire. EFFICACIOUS forced the pace inside at the beginning, was reined in to settled behind the leader through the turn
and finished up willingly on the inside to hold for the show award in a multiple horse photo for the minor placings. LUZ DE LA LUNA tracked three deep
down the back straight, chased the loose winner throughout the turn and determinedly battled for the place share down the entire lane just losing second
money strides before the wire. TOERIS was pinched on the break to trail outside horses down the backstretch, started a good rally going five wide outside
foes with five sixteenths to run and was inching closer at the wire but ran out of time. LADY ONYX (IRE) was squeezed on the start, travelled in mid -division
inside foes, became headstrong when under restraint by the rider in the backstretch to be in tight surroundings at the half, was shuffled back some at the
three furlong pole, looked for room when bottled up at the quarter pole, found a seam in the three path by mid-stretch but was outdueled to the finish line.
PLEASURE'S GOLD hopped on the start, settled outside foes in mid-pack down the backside, made an early move four wide at three eighths marker
circling runners, could not continue and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ENGLISH SHIRL assumed the lead clearing from the outside while under a hold, easily set the pace up front going around the bend, was pressured mildly
for a moment straightening out for home on the outside, responded to urging at the furlong marker and cruised in for the score. JAB was throttled down
behind a wall of runners to be near the rear at the five eighths marker, rallied three wide three furlongs out, continued a good sustained run in the six path
turning for home and closed in to best the rest at the finish line. BOLT ENOREE broke in on the start, tracked outside through the backstretch, chased the
frontrunning winner in vain on the turn, loomed in the two path outside briefly in upper stretch, could not threaten the winner who had more in reserve down
the lane and faded late losing the place share. WEEHAWKEN was content to track on the rail in the beginning, stayed on the fence watching the top two
rivals throughout the turn, was in the mix inside at the top of the stretch and finished up evenly for a minor role in the end. SPIDER BELLE was pinballed at
the start to trail down the backside, began to pick up horses circling four wide by the quarter pole, angled out widest in the seven path at the top of the
stretch and was reaching for ground to the wire finishing up well late. BOTTA SWING ran between runners in the third flight at the half, was asked for more
three furlongs out, put in a mild turn of foot until the eighth pole and levelled out in deep stretch. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B settled on the rail in the third flight
stalking the leader, saved ground through the turn keeping even with the front pack, shifted out in the five path turning for home but lacked a bid to the wire.
LADY MOONSHINE was situated in mid-field between runners in the early going, stayed level with the leaders travelling in the three path around the bend,
could not keep up by the quarter pole and tired through the lane. SOUPER SINCLAIR broke outwards to begin, settled outside four deep in mid-pack along
the backstretch, kept pace going four wide around horses on the turn, was still in with a chance for a share at the top of the lane but stopped in the stretch
drive. FRANKIE'S GIRL had only one rival beaten down the backside, made little impact through the turn and had nothing to show in the stretch drive.
