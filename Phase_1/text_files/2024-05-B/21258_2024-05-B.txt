Footnotes
GRINGOTTS two then three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered
up a sustained rally to close in through the stretch and was just up in the final jumps to the wire. TRADE SECRET broke on top and then settled four wide in
close aim of the front, advanced into the turn with CUPIDS GIRL to her outside and vied between foes tucked to the two path, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under growing
threat to the outside and was nailed in the final strides. DIVA BANKER coaxed from the start, established the front shortly after the break and showed the
way in hand along the inside, got joined by a pair and vied inside them through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. CUPIDS GIRL broke out a step at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch before advancing to vie outside a pair tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened. SISTER LINDA showed brief speed from the two path, came under prolonged coaxing when shaken
off half a mile from home, chased just off the inside through the turn and into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FIRST SONS broke in but was away fast then corrected by the rider, moved in while speeding clear early then was taken in hand, showed the way with a
clear advantage, drew off while inside on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker
and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. STANLEY ROUGH stumbled at the start but broke with the field, chased the pace between horses,
went around the turn in the three path, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted from the crop in the drive and reached his best stride too late while up for
the place. IRIE MAN broke in and bumped with a foe, was taken back between horses early then settled at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on
the turn, gained under a drive in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. ALPHA SONNY broke out and
brushed the gate then bumped with a foe, was coaxed along on the inside, came under stronger encouragement while saving ground on the turn, turned
into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner in the drive and narrowly missed the trifecta. ETERNAL GLORY raced just off the pace on the outside,
was given his cue in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MONTAUK SURF bumped with opponents
on both sides at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back under urging in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch,
drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the needed response.

JACKSON HEIGHTS broke a half a beat slow and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced just off the inside through the first
turn and down the backstretch, came under encouragement and under a right handed crop a half a mile from home, chased inside through the turn and
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole and rallied to collar the front seventy yards from home, then inched away to the
finish to prevail. BOB JOHN RAY three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four to five
wide into upper stretch, came in slightly despite a left handed crop as AULA came outwards just inside the eighth pole and forced MERLIN'S MOMENT to
steady in behind them, kept on under a drive to get on near even terms for command a sixteenth out and was along for the place honors. BOYS CODE
broke out a step at the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. BAD LARRY hustled from the gate, showed the
way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in clinging to command through
until displaced seventy yards from the finish, then got shaken off in the late stages. AULA coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed three then two wide
through the opening turn, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and came out under a right handed rein just as BOB JOHN RAY drifted in just inside the eighth pole and forced MERLIN'S
MOMENT to steady in behind, then weakened in the late going. MERLIN'S MOMENT chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, lacked clearance between foes with three-sixteenths to go and then had BOB JOHN RAY come inwards slightly as
AULA came outwards and was forced to steady behind those rivals losing two lengths of momentum, tipped out engaged once more by the rider to the
finish. MANNY PENNY broke a half a beat slow and then conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased inside early on and then two
to three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
There was a Claim of foul by the trainer of MERLIN'S MOMENT alleging interference against BOB JOHN RAY at the eighth pole. After review, the claim
was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
TURRIGA was fractious behind the gate, moved in while showing speed then set the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, responded well
when asked for her best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. HEAVENLY GIRL settled just off the pace, was asked four wide on the turn, pursued
the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. NAUGHTY DESTINY moved in while off the pace near the five-eighths pole, saved ground on
the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then angled out behind horses and improved to get the show. EKWANOK broke a half-step slow, moved up under
urging, tossed her head while lugging out leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. CAPITAL SPENDING was well placed while rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch
and also lacked the needed response. PLAY FREE BIRD showed speed on the inside of a foe then dropped back near the half-mile pole, saved ground on
the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole and came up empty. PRINCESS SUMMER was off very slow and spotted the front several lengths,
angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out into upper stretch, moved further out late and failed to threaten while gaining some ground.
TROUBLED LUCK dropped back after the start, moved in while urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch,
remained on her inside lead in the drive and was no factor. LA INDECENTE veered out at the start then bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, went four
then three wide on the turn, came out into upper stretch and failed to rally. GENEROUS LUVA showed early speed, leapt some and lost action outside the
five-eighths pole then was taken up while recovering, tracked the pace under some restraint from that juncture, was given her cue in the three path on the
turn, chased into the final furlong and tired. WELCOME BACK BABE settled on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn, was carried out in upper
stretch and failed to respond. SECESSIONIST was urged along towards the rear, dropped back two to three wide on the turn and faltered.

SUCCULENT just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home, had
FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER attempt to lean out on her straightened away and denied the move, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the
final furlong and was just in the last jumps to score. CAN'T FOOL ME chased along the inside early on and through the first turn before tipping two to three
wide down the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, kicked on
belatedly and missed at the end while up for the place honors. FROM HELLO three wide through the first turn, raced three then two wide in aim before
advancing to vie between foes three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive battling on head to head with
LAKESIDE GETAWAY through to the finish and was up for the show honors in the late stages. LAKESIDE GETAWAY forwardly placed just off the inside in
closest aim of the early leader, took over command into the backstretch and showed the way just off the inside before taking to the inside seven-sixteenths
from home, came under challenge three furlongs out and vied inside a pair of rivals through the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive clinging to command until collared near the sixteenth pole, then got outfinished in the final jumps to the wire. BOXED WINE broke a half a beat
slow, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide, got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but
was outkicked. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER broke in a step at the start but broke on top despite it, led early on past the stands and into the first turn while just
off the inside, tucked inside six furlongs from home and then eased off conceding the front to LAKESIDE GETAWAY, tracked that rival along the inside
down the backstretch and through the far turn patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch, attempted to lean out against SUCCULENT
straightened away and was denied the move, then angled in roused using the infield chute in an attempt to sweep inside the leader, had that opening close
off as the chute ended when unable to pass those rivals and was forced to check off the heels of LAKESIDE GETAWAY sharply losing two to three lengths
of momentum and didnt recover to the finish. ROAGNA was taken hold to allow the rank MIM to get outside once established past the stands the first time
and tucked inside through the first turn, tipped out to chase four wide thereafter coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper
stretch and offered no kick. FAST AND FRISKY tracked the front along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the
inside route into upper stretch, offered no response. LADY OF THOROTON got away to a hesitant start and was last, raced just off the inside through the
first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch, went five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped seven wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. MIM lunged at the break, grew rank and pulled eagerly under the restraint of the rider behind foes and was guided
outside to the four path when ROAGNA eased off to allow the move under the wire the initial time, raced four wide through the first turn keen and pulling,
chased four wide down the backstretch and advanced given some rein to work with to vie three wide from the three-eighths through the far turn, swung
three wide into upper stretch under a drive and tired.

Footnotes
VENGE broke a step slow, picked up momentum while ridden along off the pace, angled in with five furlongs to run, chased the leading group in the two
path early on the turn, angled out five wide behind those rivals near the five-sixteenths pole, made a six wide bid at the quarter-pole then took over into
upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. HOURS IN A DAY bumped with a rival at the start,
chased the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths pole, made a bid between horses leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path while between foes on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. SHAKIN THE BELLE was restless in the gate, moved
in while hustled then set the pace, vied inside of three foes while inside on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and also proved no match
then just missed the place while clear for the show. MR. GEORGIE chased the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the four
path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened. CROWN THAT SAINT bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, was urged along off the
pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. WHITBY
was restless in the gate, broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged along towards the rear, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. APURO chased
the pace, made a bid between horses leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, came out a bit into upper stretch and tired. POOR AND
POLITE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker
and was no factor. VIEJO VERDE was bumped at the start and forced in, moved out while taken up off heels early, raced near the back, rounded the turn in
the three path and never reached contention.

Footnotes
LEGEND OF TIME (GB) bobbled at the break, saved ground at the tail of the field patiently handled, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch behind rivals, looked to tip out and had no seam to do so, angled in to follow the leader inside on pause lacking room,
had CABLE READY drift out slightly under a left handed crop and got roused through the opened seam loosely between foes, offered up a good finish to
close stoutly inside the final sixteenth and was up in the last jumps to the wire. WHITE PALOMINO broke on top despite breaking inwards at the start,
showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was nailed in
the final strides to the finish. ROYAL MAJESTY (GB) tracked the pace along the inside, got patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper
stretch, was in behind rivals and attempted to tip out nudging TRIPLE ESPRESSO at the three-sixteenths and was denied the move, then gained the
clearance to tip out a furlong out home and kicked on belatedly to get up for the show honors. CABLE READY bobbled at the break, recovered to track the
leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting out
slightly under a left handed crop a furlong from home and kept on to the finish. ST JAMES THE GREAT three wide through the first turn, chased three to
four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TRIPLE ESPRESSO just off
the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, got nudged by
ROYAL MAJESTY attempting to tip out three-sixteenths from home and denied the tip, then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
VALENZAN DAY broke in at the start forcing ANYTJING PAZIBLE to steady in behind, prompted the pace of PRINCE OF JOY from the outside three then
two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over command, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear to the finish kept
to task. CANDY TYCOON chased just off the inside until tucked inside briefly at the half mile pole, tipped back to the two path nearing the seven-sixteenths
and forced a pair of rivals to steady and take hold in concert with SKYLANDER who tucked inwards from the outside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on head to head with SKYLANDER through the final furlong and ultimately
bested that rival by a head for the place honors. SKYLANDER chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and the four wide into the turn,
tucked three wide at the seven-sixteenths forcing a pair of foes to steady and get taken hold of when pinching them out in tandem with CANDY TYCOON
who tipped out, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish dueling with the
aforementioned foe but was ultimately bested by that rival while clear of the rest. FUNKENSTEIN chased four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide
into the turn and got forced to be taken hold of when placed in tight near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. CHEEKY TICO chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. DURKIN'S CALL chased eight paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened. ANYTHING
PAZIBLE got steadied at the start when VALENZAN DAY broke inwards directly into his path, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. PRINCE OF JOY coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from VALENZAN DAY to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. TOMMY GUN bobbled at the
break, chased five then four wide down the backstretch, got forced to steady out near the seven-sixteenths when squeezed out due to pressure outside from
SKYLANDER and pressure inside from CANDY TYCOON and lost about three lengths of ground, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired, and was eased
home through the final furlong.

Footnotes
POWER ATTACK bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the two path
on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and held under strong urging. RUSSI moved in then
was well placed towards the front, chased in the two to three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and secured the place. LI'L
LANG bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, came out four wide into upper stretch and finished
willingly to just get the show. BIG PRANKSTER broke out and bumped with a foe, was taken back between horses early then guided to the inside, moved
from the rail to the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position to just miss the show. WAR TERMINATOR bumped with rivals on
both sides at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and lacked the needed response. ALLIED ATTACK bumped with an
opponent at the start, showed speed on the inside of the winner then was taken back off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive in upper
stretch and came up empty. JIMMYTHETOOTH broke a half-step slow then dropped back, settled near the rear, went around the turn in the two path and
failed to threaten. KREESA bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was taken in hand then moved in early, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally.
SOMAMA BEACH broke out then bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, settled towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, moved in near the furlong marker and was no factor. BUCKORTWO was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, settled off the pace, went
two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MAJESTIC ARC was urged along on the outside, went four wide on
the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. P MONEY settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and also failed to respond.
