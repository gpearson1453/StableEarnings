KIRIN dueled two deep from the outside of foe and finished well to edge away late under strong handling. I'MBIGGERTHANILOOK dueled for the early lead
along the rail, headed near the quarter pole, kept on but was no match for the winner. STRENGTHNGUIDANCE chased the early pair, raced three to four
wide in the drive and had not enough. TO THE MAX raced two wide nearing the quarter pole, shifted out six deep and was even with no closing run. GREY
SHADOW dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened. RUIZ JUNIOR raced four wide around the far turn, was six wide into the upper stretch
and never threatened. WARRIOR OF GOLD bobbled at the break, lost ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
SMART JENNY chased the early pace setters, raced five wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the drive and surged up late under strong
handling. STAR PERFORMANCE dueled for the early lead between rivals, dug in late and missed. PRINCESS MISS EMIL took up at the break, raced at
the back of the pack after the poor beginning, saved ground through the far turn, worked between near the inside through the stretch drive and rallied
gamely to the wire. ZOYA'S FAITH broke a bit awkward, made a five wide move through the far turn, raced wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly
to the wire. ELLAGIO raced three wide near the five sixteenths pole, was five wide into the upper stretch, raced between late and finished willingly to the
wire. BOHO LADY dueled three path outside foes and gave way grudgingly late. JURASSIC CHICK dueled near the rail and faltered the final eighth of a
mile.

MODERN LANE raced off the early dueling pair, moved up near rail through the drive and surged up late under strong handling. IMAPEPPA stalked the
early duel, advanced three wide through the far turn to challenge, five wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. DRUM AND DRUMMER
dueled for the early lead near the inside down the backstretch around the far turn, raced a bit off the inside through the drive and gave way grudgingly. EL
DE JOSUE dueled for the early lead two deep from the outside of rival and weakened a bit through the drive. NO PROBLEM JOE settled off the early going,
moved up six to seven wide into the upper stretch to take aim and flattened out. VIVA VICTORY raced two wide around the far turn and lacked a response.

BATUCADA showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside of foe and drew off to be well clear through the stretch run under a steady hand ride.
DOUBLE COSMO GIRL settled off the early pace to race in hand, ridden inside near the three eighths pole, shifted out five wide into the upper stretch, kept
on but was no match for the winner. SLENDER SLIPPER pressed the early leader from the outside of foe and weakened. MISS UCRANIA stalked the pace
along the inside and faded. LLAMARADA void of early speed, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no response. AIN'T NONCENTS lost ground

Footnotes
LADY CHA CHA was allowed to settle early, confidently handled down the backstretch while still racing in hand, asked near the quarter two deep to split
rivals, angled out through the drive, raced well off the inside and edge clear under steady handling. BURNAWAY was unhurried early on, hard ridden four
deep around the far turn and narrowly rallied to get up for the place position. LETS GO KOKO stalked the pace near the rail, shifted out three deep between
through the drive and finished gamely to the wire. NEOM CITY dropped back to race mid pack early on, had an inside run around the far turn into the upper
stretch, raced two deep in the drive and had no final winning bid. PRETTYKEEN tracked the early leader three deep from the outside, led near the eighth
pole and faltered in the latter stages. SPREZZATURA raced in tight quarters in the early stages, raced three wide around the first turn, was five wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. PLANKTON showed good early speed to set the early pace, met bid near the five sixteenths pole and faded.

Footnotes
LOUIE THE SUN KING prompt the early leader two deep from the outside, led narrowly near the quarter pole and held safe to prove best under strong
encouragement. EASTBOSTONBENNY chased the top pair early under steady pressure, moved up two wide between rivals near the quarter pole and
slowly closed in on the winner in a game finish. ADIOS COLE dropped back in the early stages, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and moved up
to improve position late. KING SKULL vied for the early lead along the inside and weakened through the drive. KORRONGO was urged three deep from the
outside of foes and weakened through the drive. GRAND MAXIME raced two to three wide in the stretch run and had no response. RACING STAR trailed
early on, raced four deep near the five sixteenths pole, drifted a bit through the stretch run while racing from the outside and never was a factor.

Footnotes
HOUSE OF MELODY quick to begin to cross over and set the early pace, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. BELLWETHER rated along to
race under a hold, waited for racing room near the three eighths pole, shifted out three deep into the upper stretch, took aim and missed in a game effort.
ANONYMOUS SOURCE dropped to the back of the pack early, made a quick four wide move near the half mile pole and weakened a bit through the drive.
MYWIFEKNOWSITALL settled off the early pace, hard ridden three wide around the far turn and needed more in the drive. D CITY GIRL saved ground and
had no late rally. QUEEN AIKO prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and faded.
