Footnotes
POLITICALLYCORRECT was urged along five wide from the outside of rivals five wide, had full command through the far turn and held well to remain safe
late under strong handling. I GOT GAME vied between rivals early on, took aim four wide into the upper stretch but couldn't get by the winner in a game
effort. PREDECESSOR sent along, was in tight quarters, bumped between in the early stages, settled back off the early contested pace along the inside,
angled five wide through the upper lane and kept on willingly to the wire. SERGEANT CAPPS was bumped by an inner rival at the start dropped back early,
angled to the inside, continued an inside run around the far turn into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. FLYIN PRIVATE void of early
speed, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a bid. ANYTIME ANYWHERE was hard sent near the rail and faded in the drive. MALEVAJE sent
along, checked sharply between in the early stages and faded.

B SUDD vied for the early lead near the rail and finished well to draw away late under strong handling. PINFIRE pressed the early pace three deep from the
outside of rivals, took aim into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. FURIOUS ANGER dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced seven
wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. EPIC BATTLE bumped, shuffled back at the start, settled to race with the second flight early
on, swung wide into the upper stretch to race from the far outside and closed in mildly. MOREAU raced two wide around the far turn, shifted out six wide
near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive. FUNNY UNCLE angled in to down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn into the
upper stretch, waited briefly near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. ONE RED CENT vied for the early lead between rivals and gave way
through the drive. BRAZEN BOY stalked the pace along the inside and failed to sustain a bid. ICEATUDE was bumped, took up at the break, had an inside
run racing just off the inside and never threatened. CHRYSO ALOGO was squeezed back at the break, raced off the early pace setters after the poor start,
raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. VERACRUZIN raced mid pack early and failed to respond.

WORK OF FICTION rated along under a firm hold early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear under strong handling.
DREAMING OF MO stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued a rail bid in the stretch, slipped through traffic inside the upper
stretch and narrowly rallied for the place position. OUR DOTSIE raced mid pack early on, was two deep near the five sixteenths pole, angled to race from
the outside in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. WINGS LIKE EAGLES void of early speed and steadied at the rear into the first turn, raced near
the inside at the quarter pole, angled out and moved up late. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS settled off the early pace, raced near the inside in the stretch, blocked
near the three sixteenths pole, found room near the eighth pole and kept on willingly to the wire. MIRARI prompt the early pace from the outside of foe and
faded. CECILE void of early speed, fanned wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CANDY BAR dropped back to race mid pack, raced four wide,
lacked room near the three sixteenths pole and was even late. EMPIRICAL VIEW failed to sustain a bid. PRIVATE CREDIT set the pace and faltered in the
drive. COCO CRUSH was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no response. KILLSHAVE BEAUTY failed to respond.

EXTRA ANEJO tracked the early leader two deep from the outside and finished well to edge away under strong handling. CALL ME FAST dropped back off
the early pace, waited for racing room near the five sixteenths pole, made three to two wide bid and rallied up for the place position. RAISE CAIN raced mid
pack early on, was near the rail past the quarter pole, shifted out four wide and finished gamely late. TRACK MATE dropped back to trail early, raced six
wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. EYEING CLOVER quick to begin along the inside to set the pace and faltered the final eighth of
a mile. SCOTLAND was allowed to settle early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. SAFFA'S DAY stalked the
pace near the rail and tired readily.

upper stretch and had no final winning bid. MILA JUNES tracked the pace along the inside and faded. THORNY steadied early on, settled to the back of the
