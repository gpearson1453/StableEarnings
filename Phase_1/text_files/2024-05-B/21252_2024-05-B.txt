Footnotes
RITA'S REVENGE sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way into the first turn, set the pace with a duo not too far behind mid-way up the
backstretch, held firm still unleashed around the far turn, saved ground and roused for more entering the upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve, widened to
a commanding lead a furlong out, tapped once mid-stretch and kept to task while ridden out. SOPHIE'S STAR raced two to three wide around the first turn
and tracked the pacesetter through early stages, edged up closer near the half marker then made a three bid for RITA'S REVENGE approaching the quarter
pole, could not reach the eventual winner but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. LITTLEDABWILLDOO was away in good order and raced two
wide into the first turn, stalked in contention near the inside up the backstretch, hustled up along the rail around the far turn, failed to move into closer
contention and churned on for a share. DR. WOODS MIRACLE was off a step slow at the start and continued to lag in the back through the backstretch,
continued far back around the far turn and was never involved. TALL TALE raced in range near the inside around the first turn then dropped back upon
entering the backstretch, continued well back and showed little.

SHANIAH was allowed to settle just off the pace in opening stages, picked up the tempo along the rail mid-way around the turn, cut the corner entering the
upper stretch, roused forward to challenge TRIP TO FREEDOM for the lead, vied a furlong out, edged ahead to a slim lead and stayed on gamely. TRIP TO
FREEDOM vied inside of rival through early stages, shook free and led the way near the five sixteenths pole, repelled the bid from DODGEBALL late on the
turn, led the way into the stretch run, took on the challenge of inside running SHANIAH, fought back then but got collared for the lead and could not get back
by. DODGEBALL was forwardly placed from the onset, moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, could not get by the leader, came three to
four wide into the upper stretch and kept on to secure a share. IRON LOTUS raced in contention four deep late on the backstretch, chased three to four
wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. NOEL'S ANGEL vied with TRIP TO FREEDOM through early stages, came up empty mid-way around the
turn and quickly retreated. PER RULING #ECM2024-184 FROM HIWU, TRIP TO FREEDOM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A

QUIET I'M NOT vied for the lead in opening stages then put a length in front of CLASSIC CASH heading near the half mile marker, held firm around the
turn, given cue turning or home, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. CLASSIC CASH vied with the eventual winner in opening stages then
remained forwardly placed through the backstretch, chased two wide in close range around the turn, was no match for the winner in late stages but stayed
on for second best. RED SANGRIA raced in early contention, hustled up along the rail around the turn, ran on into the stretch run and cleared a share. MY
HEART'S ON FIRE was not too far back in the early going, was ridden three wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. ESPRIT ROUGE broke well
then dropped back off the pace, hustled along three wide around the turn then faded in the lane. STELLA BELLA raced two wide between foes in the early,
failed to advance under pressure around the turn and gave way. OPAL BAY was not too far back three wide in opening stages then steadily retreated.

COALMINER'S KITTEN was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back of the field, edged a bit closer still unleashed late on the turn, was
confidently ridden two wide into the lane, tapped once a furlong out, responded gamely, roused forward to the lead past the sixteenth pole and finished
going away. RAYMOND was forwardly placed up the backstretch, moved up to engage CAPTIVATED DRAMA for the lead midway around the turn, dueled
for command into the final furlong then failed to be aa match when the winner swept by. CAPTIVATED DRAMA vied for the lead with UPTOWN SOCIAL
through the backstretch, began to edge away then took on the challenge from RAYMOND, fought back gamely into the final furlong then wilted under
prolonged pressure. COST BASIS raced up close along the rail in opening stages, edged back late on the backstretch then tipped out to make a three wide
rebid, failed to progress under pressure and steadily weakened. UPTOWN SOCIAL dueled for the lead from the onset, continued to match strides to the
mid-way point on the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
CHAPEL BARN sped to the lead two wide heading into the first turn, cleared on top and angled inside, set the pace by a comfortable margin up the
backstretch, widened on top still racing in hand around the far turn, saved ground entering the upper stretch and pulled away from the field under a mild
drive. I'M CRENSHAW stalked the pace two to three wide up the backstretch, came under a ride three wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane,
was no match for clear winner but finished clearly second best. CHARMING CHARLIE sat back off the second flight mid-way up the backstretch, came
under a ride along the outside around the final turn, ran on two wide in late stages and outnodded rival for show. ONE TIME GEM was reserved racing in
the back, came two wide into the upper stretch, angled to the inside and just missed show. PROMISING SHOES raced off the early pace, swung four wide
into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MAYFIELD STRONG raced in range along the rail in the early going, weakened under pressure around the far turn,
cut the corner entering the lane and gave way. DILLON ROCKS was the closest pursuer of the pacesetter up the backstretch, ran on around the far turn
then tired in the drive.
