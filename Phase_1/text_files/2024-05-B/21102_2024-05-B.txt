Footnotes
CYNERGY'S ELECTRA settled off the early pace in hand to track the leaders, rallied four wide on the bend in an early drive, angled in to the three path
splitting rivals at the head of the lane to take command in upper stretch and drew away through the lane. KAYA'S HALO stalked the pacesetter from
between rivals two wide down the backside, angled to the rail on the turn saving ground while cutting the corner to loom turning for home, was no match for
the winner but kept on willingly to be second best. NANA'S BOOPA slow early to be the trailer and showed mild late interest in the lane to be along for the
show. DIVINE PROMISE broke alertly, taken in hand to press the pace from four wide, made a brief bid on the turn and weakened in the drive. SWEET
FACTOR went evenly without posing a threat. PROVIDING set a pressured pace for a half mile and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BYTHENUMBERS tracked the leaders to the turn from the inside, commenced a long, steady rally while angling out six wide at the head of the lane and
wore her rivals down in the drive. A LOTTA MOXIE pressed the pace down the backside, dueled on the lead through the turn to upper stretch, briefly shook
clear in the lane and was outkicked by the winner. NAY SLAYER unhurried for the first three-eighths and closed belatedly through the stretch to be gaining
late. TRICKY RIVER stalked the early pace to the turn, rallied to duel on the lead to upper stretch and weakened late in the lane. AMELIORATE trailed to
the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. OSO went one-paced as a non-factor. CHELLS GIRL hustled up the rail to make the lead for the first
three-eighths and gradually gave way on the turn. THE HALF MILE TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
PISTOL OR SHOTGUN stalked the pace to midway on the turn, angled out six wide under a steady advance to engage the pacesetter midway down the
lane and pulled away in deep stretch. TAPORICAL broke a step slow to be the early distant trailer, found best stride turning for home and closed well
belatedly to be gaining at the wire. WOW WISH set the pace down the backside, responded on the turn when challenged and was out-finished late in the
lane. PRINCE FRED rated in mid-pack and lacked a closing response when called upon. RUSSIAN HAMMER chased the leaders to the top of the lane and
failed to mount a clsoing rally. JACK CLOUD pressed the pace to the quarter pole and weakened down the stretch. BAD HENRY broke outward from the
gate to be near the rear of the field, made an early bid into the turn from five wide and flattened out.

Footnotes
HURRICANE BON took command from the gates, opened a clear advantage on the first turn, maintained that lead while well rated throughout and finished
unchallenged as much the best. WICKED KITTEN stalked the winner the entire trip, could not gain on that one and kept on willingly to be much better than
the rest of the field. LIME TREE rated n mid-pack for the run down the backside, saved ground on the final turn while mounting a mild rally and kept on in
the stretch to hold the show. PRETTY COAST raced wide in the first turn while being brushed by rival, raced up to track the leaders from four wide down the
backside, lost position on the far turn and finished willingly to just miss the show. BEST WORST IDEA lugged out on the first turn to bump rival, continued to
be rank on the bend fighting the rider, leveled off down the backside, mounted an early bid into the far turn and flattened out turning for home. WOKE UP A
DIVA leaned back at the start to be slowly away, trailed to the quarter pole and passed tired rivals in the stretch. SIRDAR squeezed back while racing
between rivals on the first turn, dropped back to race near the rear of the field and was never a threat from there. SHARP CHEDDAR contended early on
and was through after a half.

Footnotes
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, made a three wide bid to engage the leader midway on the final turn, pulled
clear in upper stretch and was unthreatened to the wire. WALK AWAY JOE reserved off the pace for the first half mile, made a steady advance from five
wide and kept grinding through the lane to gain the place. ALVY unhurried for the first five-eighths, ralied on the turn, split rivals turning for home and
continued mildly down the stretch. GOODLUCKCHUCK prompted the pace to the far turn, made a two wide bid to briefly take command on the bend, was
no match for the winner and flattened out in the lane. POLAR WIND trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MIRACLE SILVER
tracked the leaders to the final turn and faded. CAVALRY COMMAND sped to the lead into the first turn and came up empty after a half mile.

FIRSTLADY ROSALYNN tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied six wide turning for home and closed best of all to be going away in deep stretch.
TIRUPATI prompted the early pace from two wide, lost position on the turn, tipped out to circle four wide turning for home, angled to the inside in upper
stretch and finished willingly. ITHINKILOVEYOU lunged at the start to be a bit off balance at the start, moved up to stalk the pace through the turn from
three wide, loomed in upper stretch and finished evenly. NOTICE ME TOO sped up the fence to take the lead under steady pressure, responded to the
challengers turning for home and weakened late in the drive. FIRST TO ARRIVE was not a threat.

Footnotes
LET IT RIDENESS raced up the fence while in hand to take command shortly from the gate, opened a clear lead on a well rated pace, widened when called
upon turning for home and was kept to task through the lane while unchallenged. AURORA KUMA unhurried early while choosing a path down the
backside, rallied five wide while steadily advancing and finished well to be second best. PAYNTED THUNDER tracked the leader throughout and was best
of the rest while keeping on one-paced. INFINITE SERIES stalked the pace through the turn and lacked a response when called upon. RUBIDOR chased
the pace from the fence and faded. AGENT KELLY hopped at the start, drifted well out leaving the gate and was never a factor from there.
