inside, bid at the half-mile pole, angled four wide at the quarter pole, rallied but was no match for the winner. DELLACROCE pressed the pace outside of the
leader and couldn't hold off the closers. DIRBAS stalked the pace inside, bid at the five-sixteenths pole, was bumped at the three-sixteenths pole and lost
momentum. BOAT HOUSE raced evenly in the four path. ORBI ONE pressed the early pace in the three path, was bumped at the three-sixteenths pole and
gave way in the stretch. DASHED led inside before giving way in the stretch. URSO GRAYDAR saved ground to no avail.

that one. HOW'S UR ATTITUDE pressed the pace in the two path and offered a mild late bid. HOLIDAY HOUSE raced inside, rallied in early stretch but
couldn't close late. FIVE O' SOMEWHERE pressed the pace in the three path to the stretch. EDDIE M broke outward, raced in the two path and improved
position late. METALLIC MAN stalked the pace in the five path and faded in the stretch. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY stalked the pace in the four path, checked
at the five-sixteenths pole to avoid heels and lost momentum. SOUTH DECATUR was bumped at the start and lacked a late bid.
