Footnotes
ROAR OF THE CROWD assumed control clearing to the lead, getting to the rail by mid-backstretch, was in hand comfortably going around the bend with no
challengers in sight and was asked mildly at the furlong pole to cruise home for the win. SO CALLED VACATION broke sharp to lead early on, was shuffled
back to mid-pack with a half mile remaining, started to rally three wide around foes at the quarter pole and lengthened stride widest in the five path down the
stretch to just inch away from a trio of horses for second money. TRUE SHOT had one runner beaten down the backside, split foes in the two path at the
quarter pole, dueled four wide straightening out to the wire but had to settle for the show award in a multiple horse photo for all the minor placings.
IMPERIAL STAR settled on the rail watching the top two down the back straight, was scrubbed on in mid-turn saving ground on the fence, battled inside in
the two path in upper stretch and just faded near the wire losing positions in a close race for the place share. JOEYBONES missed the break starting a step
slow to begin, was nudged on after the start getting better position to track on the outside down the backstretch, chased the front-running winner throughout
the turn, could not closed the gap, dueled between rivals in the three path for the runners up share turning for home. MANETKA was void of early speed to
trail down the backside, could not get involved seeing the field around the turn and made little impression travelling on the fence down the lane.

Footnotes
SECRET THREAT was in tight on the break, stalked near the rear between foes, improved position with runners on both sides at the half, quickly moved to
bid for the lead outside four wide at the top of the lane and began to edge away for the win in deep stretch. BANKINGONAMIRACLE broke in at the start,
set the pace down the backside, was travelling smoothly rating well up top around the oval, was headed by the winner outside at the furlong marker while
being urged left-handed, could not match strides late and settled for second best on this day. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA was checked on the rail a couple of
times down the backstretch when nestled behind a runner who was having his own problems at the five furlong marker, trailed the field on the fence with
three eighths remaining and finished up with good energy in the five path driving to the wire, closing in to be a clear third in the end. POPWEISER broke
outwards on the start, tracked outside along the backstretch, chased the pacesetter running just off the rail throughout the turn, was in the mix up front
bidding three wide between rivals in upper stretch, could not find another gear late and faded for a minor role in the end. TAPPING OUT A TUNE was eager
fighting the riders restraint inside the five eighths pole, lost some ground and positioning on the fence around the turn, was in range for a share on the rail
with a quarter to go but needed more in deep stretch to be a factor at the finish line. OH PEANUTS was off a step slow to begin, seeing the field down the
backside, caught up to the pack outsides rivals with three furlongs to go but lacked a finish behind challengers running in the four path in the stretch drive.
SPEEDY BULLEIT was jostled between horses on the break, stalked three deep outside along the backside, made a brief rally circling three wide through
the turn, could not sustain the run and flattened out five wide outside foes in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
CARLISLE BAY took command from the onset, opened up a touch with five sixteenths to go, came under a drive at the quarter pole when rivals were
closing in from the outside, spurted away turning for home and was kept to the task in the lane to win going away at the wire. SAPPHIRE CONNECT
tracked behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, sat just off the flank on the outside hounding the pace three eighths from the prize, rallied moving
between rivals to be in the thick of things in the three path at the top of the stretch but could only in vain, chase the frontrunning winner home. STUDY
BUDDY (GB) broke slow to begin, trailing the field, picked up the bit quickly rushing up to sit behind the frontrunner by the seven sixteenths marker, tried to
slip up the fence midway through the turn, was tight quarters, checking briefly to be at the back of the pack two furlongs out and finished up evenly on the
inside down the stretch to be a troubled third. D'AURUM stalked on the outside near the back in this compact field, rallied making a three wide move around
horses three furlongs out, continued to press when fanned out in the four path in upper stretch, could not find more and folded at the furlong marker outside
horses.

Footnotes
TRUEBELIEVE was prominent in the very early stages inside the leading pair before settling well back off those two content to stalk from inside, moved out
four then five wide advancing past the three-eighths, bid for the lead near the three-sixteenths, took a narrow advantage while drifting in a bit, edged clear in
the final sixteenth under steady handling. BOLD RELOAD pressed the early pace then forced the issue taking the advantage at the five-eighths, moved
clear by the half and came in a bit on the turn, was challenged in upper stretch, fought on till about a sixteenth from home and yielded but held place.
COLONEL MUSTARD broke a step slowly and in a bit tight, lacked early speed despite some coaxing, raced outside a foe at the rear, swung eight wide
turning for home, gained steadily late but needed more. QUIET INTENT settled mid-division tracking from off the inside, went two to three deep on the turn,
shifted six wide turning for home, kicked on mildly between foes. HE'S FULLY LOADED broke out a bit, set the early tempo for the opening three-sixteenths,
was overtaken at that point and continued to chase into the turn, switched out off the inside, failed to rally and went evenly in the stretch. GATLING GUN
broke inwardly a bit, raced inside at the back early, came out a bit in late stretch, was never near enough to threaten. HANK OLLIE stalked from outside
going three to four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
FOREST BUZZ had an ideal set up, all alone watching the contesting pair down the backside, began to move in midway through the turn, bid for the lead
three wide on the outside at the furlong marker, switched leads and drew off for the score. GRAN SPIRITED stalked near the rear at the back between
horses, started to advance making a rail run with five sixteenths from home, angled out off a tiring foe to the four path straightening out for the drive and ran
on well enough to best the others in a spread out field at the finish. PUDDINGONTHERITZ battled inside along the back straight, put away that rival to edge
clear for the lead midway on the turn, was then collared by the winner outside at the furlong pole, offered no resistance and finished up to be alone at the
wire for third money. HIGHLAND LIFE was checked briefly on the rail in tight quarters five furlongs from the wire, then shifted out to the three path down the
backside, travelled three to five wide around the turn, drifted in momentarily when encouraged right handed turning for home and came home passing tired
runners through the lane. GUNS N' ROJAS hopped slightly to trail after the start, was hard ridden on the outside of a rival but could not make any progress
around the bend and was not a presence, never switching leads through the stretch to the finish. KINETIC STONE dueled outside along the backstretch,
chased the pacesetter outside throughout the turn, had little left to give by the top of the stretch and weakened inside at the eighth pole.

PAT'S GAMBLE settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn, bid up the rail in mid- to late-stretch taking the lead about the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was well-placed stalking the leaders, saved ground edging closer to those on the turn, came out three then four wide at the
top of the stretch with aim on the leader, bid near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked while second best. VICTORY TOWN got away alertly, set the pace
shadowed by a foe racing near but off the rail, kept on but needed more. JO DADDY raced inside foes off the pace moving under some encouragement two
to three wide late on the turn, angled seven wide at the top of the stretch, ran on well but too late. FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN was mid-pack three to four wide,
encouraged along three furlongs out, moved five to six deep for the drive and kicked on evenly. FABELMAN saved ground inside from off the pace and was
never a threat. MOON OVER EGBERT raced off the pace and outside, swung seven wide, was not a threat. GOLD MAGIC stalked just off the pacesetter
from outside, faltered and faded. HUNGRY WOLF broke slowly and a bit unpreparedly, was not a factor.

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL nestled on the rail in midfield early on, patiently waited for room through the turn, shifted off weakening foes three wide at the quarter
pole, posed the main threat in the four path straightening for home and was full or run to get up a few strides before the finish line. LAST AMERICAN EXIT
settled four deep on the outside in the second tier watching the contesting duo down the backside under a good hold, moved in under right-handed
encouragement midway on the bend, loomed three wide at the top of the stretch, took control at the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the late charge by
the winner. PERFECT CRIME was unhurried seeing the pack down the backstretch, began to pass foes on the rail three furlongs from the finish, finally
found a seam shifting out to the five path at the furlong pole, did not switch leads until very late and got up to capture the show award. TWIN CITY hounded
the pace outside along the back straight, prompted the pace outside around the bend, poked his head in front for a moment in the two path at the top of the
lane but faded in deep stretch to settle on the fringes. RAPID TEST was checked between runners losing his path at the nine sixteenths marker, trailed the
field outside with three eighths to go, angled outside, widest in the six path turning for home and finished with good energy closing the gap at the wire.
TARANTO TITAN travelled five deep outside rivals near the rear in the beginning, improved mildly going four wide around the oval, shifted out to the six
path for the stretch run and finished up willingly to the line. CLAYTON emerged from the pack to have a slight lead on the inside five furlongs from home,
dictated the pace while shadowed outside through the turn, was headed outside by runners in upper stretch and faltered in the last sixteenth. MALIBU
EDGE was asked to get better position going for a seam with another rival in mid-backstretch, tracked the leaders between foes at the half, kept pace
running around the bend, had a chance for a share sitting just behind the front trio at the top of the lane but had no finish to the wire. SOUPER WATSON
settled on the rail in the second flight by the half, was hard ridden on the fence midpoint on the turn, offered little energy and emptied out in the final seventy
yards. KAUKOKAIPUU tracked the engaged pair early on in the backstretch, could not maintain position surrounded by runners at the half and was shuffled
back, came under a ride three furlongs out, could not keep pace and backed away through the field on the turn.

Footnotes
MAKE MAGIC shadowed the pacesetter outside, edged away to gain command by the five sixteenths marker, was asked with a tap of the crop in
mid-stretch and won going away under very mild urging. ECSTASY was reined in to watch the lead pair, settling on the rail down the backside, closed the
gap on the contesting leaders midway through the turn, loomed in the three path posing the only threat to the winner, was quickly repelled and finished up to
be a solid second in the end. STOLEN VALOUR had a slim lead inside down the back straight, was collared outside by the winner in mid-turn, could not
match strides with the top two foes at the quarter pole and stayed on the be a clear third crossing the finish line. WHY EM SEA AY was allowed to settle on
the rail co-trailing on the inside in the beginning, made little headway on the fence in the tun, shifted out to the two path with rivals on each side in upper
stretch and won the five horse duel for fourth money in the final furlong. MAURYA tracked the front pair outside, was asked for more but could not quicken
with others five sixteenths from home and faded between rivals in the three path in the final eighth. TIANMA stalked on the outside along the backside,
shifted out to be in the three path between runners at the top of the lane and was one paced at the eighth pole while in the hunt for small share and could
not find more nearing the wire. PRINCESS JADE co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch and throughout the turn, shifted outside five abreast dueling
for a small piece of the prize at the furlong marker but offered no kick in deep stretch. MIA MITOLE stalked inside down the backstretch, saved ground
around the bend, was in the mix for a minor share in mid-stretch but wilted late.

Footnotes
BLAST IN THE SNOW settled just behind the pacesetter early on, waited to move sitting in a good spot behind the embattled trio with five sixteenths
remaining, burst between horses finding clear running room three wide at the furlong marker, took over with a sixteenth to go and just held to prevail at the
finish line. CRUMLIN LAD broke out on the start, relaxed when all alone in the third flight along the backside, edged closer three wide outside foes with five
sixteenths to go, angled out for clear run in the five path for the drive, drifted in under right-handed encouragement in mid- stretch and closed in under a
hand ride to just miss at the wire. RAT PORTAGE was brushed inside on the break, settled in mid-division between runners down the back straight, kept
pace with the leaders running three wide around the oval, swung out widest in the six path in the stretch and was gaining with every stride but could not reel
in the top two at the finish. PROVEN STRATEGIES tracked the frontrunner on the outside, was forced to press the issue between foes at the three eighths
pole, poked his head in front with a quarter to go but faded in the final seventy yards for a minor role in the end. STEAK AND CHEESE travelled in mid-pack
five deep outside rivals, pull the rider to prompt three wide on the outside three furlongs from the finish, loomed boldly in the four path two furlongs from the
wire but could not go on and stalled at the sixteenth pole. SIR SEAMUS set the pace down the backstretch, continued up top through the turn, was clinging
to the lead on the rail three furlongs out, battled on the fence until sixteenth pole and wilted in deep stretch. QUITE READY was situated in the middle of the
pack on the fence in the early stages, could not make up any ground when roused in the turn and finished up evenly in the stretch running.
PAINTTHETOWNSILVER stalked near the rear three deep outside foes in the beginning, was asked for more through the turn, had little response and
lacked a finish in the drive to the wire. BLAME J D was off a step slow at the start to have one foe beaten in the backstretch, could not get interested saving
ground travelling on the fence through the turn and made little presence on the rail down the lane. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE broke with the field, was then
outrun early to trail along the backside, made little impression outside runners on the turn and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.
