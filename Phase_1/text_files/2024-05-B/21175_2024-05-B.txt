Footnotes
WAR NOVEL prompted the pace two wide for five furlongs, assumed command, edged clear before the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and
maintained his advantage under strong handling. BOSS BEAR trailed into the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch, rallied determinedly and was
steadily getting to the winner late. ITASCA drifted out bumping SAY HEY KID at the start, set a pressured pace along the inside for five furlongs, kept on but
was outfinished in the final stages. CANDY CRUSHEM settled three wide and went evenly. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE drifted in bumping SAY HEY KID at
the start, stalked the pace for six furlongs, offered a mild bid entering the stretch then came up empty. DUEL FUEL was through after a half. SAY HEY KID
was bounced around and squeezed between rivals at the start then failed to menace.

MR LAOBAN stalked the pace for a half, rallied three then two wide to draw on even terms for the lead entering the far turn, battled with the runner up into
the stretch then responded under left handed urging past the furlong marker and drew off. SERGEANT COUNTZLER pressed the pace two wide for four
and one half furlongs, gained a narrow lead, dueled with the winner along the inside until mid stretch then was no match and held on for second by the
narrowest of margins. ELEGGUA saved ground into the far turn, fanned out to the six path entering the stretch, rallied determinedly and just missed getting
up for second. DONAHUE set the pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs then weakened. RAMBLIN CHROME was through after a half.

gained second. ELLIOT THE DRAGON stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch, was bumped repeatedly by the runner up through
the final furlong and finished determinedly. MAY MAYHEM bore out bumping STUNT MAN at the start, was taken out five wide, offered a mild bid into the
stretch and finished with good courage in the seven path. RED COMET had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO

EXCITEMENT chased the leader into the stretch, rallied two wide under left handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker in the six path and
drew off under confident handling. WILDCAT EXPRESS broke in front, opened a daylight lead soon thereafter, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the
five path then was no match for the winner. RAISE THE PURSES allowed to settle, had a mild late rally in the six path. CRYPTO COPY well placed, failed

MISSION GIRL stalked the pace along the rail into the stretch, responded under left handed urging to make the lead in the final stages and proved best
while fully extended. PRETTY PATTY sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch, drifted out to the five path and
couldn't handle the winner. PANAMANIAC raced in the five path and had a mild late rally for a minor share. BOX STEP bobbled at the start, pressed the
pace two then three wide into the stretch and faded late. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE was no factor. DANZA MAGIC failed to menace. BOSSY LADY was through
after a half.

handling. ARTIES CRYPTONITE stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the six path and got up for second. OUT FOR FUN unhurried
early, found her best stride late in the seven path. BAY MAGIC set a pressured pace along the inside to the quarter pole, altered course to the five path at
the top of the stretch then faded. CONGRATS JENSEN saved ground and went evenly. CAT'S RHYTHM had brief speed. CATABOUT was no factor.
