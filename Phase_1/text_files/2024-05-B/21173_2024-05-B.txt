Footnotes
MISS ROCKETTE stalked behind the pacesetter on the inside, waited in hand on the far turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, challenged from outside at
the top of the lane, took over at the eighth pole and drew off under hand urging. PETITE ANGE stalked two to three wide on the first turn, roused while
angling out four wide on the far turn, kept on through the drive and gained second. HYMNAL reserved two then three wide at the back early, tugged forward
from outside and pressed the issue three deep past the half-mile pole, chased the leader three wide through the far turn, kept to task through the lane,
chased between rivals late and missed second. MS BO J showed good early speed to grab the lead, led three then two wide while dueling with outer rival
on the first turn, inched ahead on the backstretch, cleared with three furlongs remaining, showed the way a bit off the rail into the stretch, asked right handed
but yielded to the winner at the eighth pole and flattened in deep stretch. TIZ SILVER pulled early while drifting out to the five path early on the clubhouse
turn, went up to force the issue from outside, kept the pressure on to the far turn, fell back to last around that bend and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
AVENTAPP settled early, drew closer in the two path and got boxed in for a split second at the quarter pole, remained in hand entering the lane, tipped out
past the eighth pole, rallied between rivals and won the bob at the wire. A REAL JEWEL stalked the top pair off the rail then moved to the inside entering the
turn, shifted to the two path around the bend then took aim three wide leaving the turn, bid four deep in the furlong grounds, put a nose in front late but lost
the bob on the line. TEEN DRAMA stalked outside a rival, chased two, three, then four wide around the bend, bid five deep in the late stages and got
outkicked. DANCING SOUL took the front quickly from inside and set the pace under pressure, dueled around the bend, carried a short lead into the stretch,
resisted to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) tracked the pace from inside to the stretch, launched a bid along the fence but got
outkicked in the final sixteenth. TRUE FRIEND lacked early speed, traveled along the rail then came out into the stretch and was never a factor. WRONG
TURN CUPID pressed the pace from outside, drew on even terms around the bend, fought to upper stretch, then weakened past the eighth pole.

Footnotes
INSTINCT D' ORO dueled inside SQUARE D' ORO, inched ahead on the turn, put away outer rival at the top of the lane and held well on the wrong lead
through the final furlong. ALOHA CHROME climbed early and lost ground in the process, move forward leaving the backstretch, chased along the rail then
came out with a quarter mile remaining, finished well through the lane but could not close the gap on the winner while earning second. WINSITWELL
stalked the top pair from outside, went two wide into the turn, drifted late on the turn and came five wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed rally
but finished a clear third. THIRSTY LOV content to trail early off the rail, went four wide into the turn, chased six wide into the lane and failed to threaten
while earning a minor award. SQUARE D' ORO dueled from outside, kept the pressure on around the bend, could not kick on with the winner at the top of
the stretch and faded. DAPITAN STAR coaxed along chasing at the back, trailed on the inside to the stretch and failed to make an impact. STRIKING
THUNDER forwardly placed behind the top pair early, started to weaken two then three wide on the turn and tired down the lane.

MAGIC ACCOUNT away quickly then had to battle with VILIFIED for the lead, put away inner rival past the quarter pole, asked right handed once
midstretch, hand urged in deep stretch and coasted in near the wire. VILIFIED fractious in the gate, came away slow then rushed up to challenge for the
lead from inside, fought with MAGIC ACCOUNT to the quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner approaching the stretch and churned on through the
final furlong to save second. GETEMDUSTY chased between rivals on the backstretch and around the turn, kept on through the lane but could not get by
VILIFIED for the place honors. SPEED OF THE NILE chased the leaders inside a pair of rivals, saved ground to the stretch and failed to rally. UNUSUAL
WIN raced wide early at the back, dove down to the two path nearing the turn, lacked room behind rivals through the bend and could not threaten once in
the clear. WESTERN POWER off slow in the beginning, chased three deep into and around the turn, then weakened in the stretch run. BRAINIAC tracked
the dueling pair outside rivals, took the turn five then four wide and came up empty in the lane. CIR JOHNNY trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail
then a bit off the fence into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MISS LIZZY trailed the field to the turn, went outside rival while in the three path on the bend, split rivals at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied from outside,
inhaled the leaders in the final sixteenth and drove clear. GETTHEMONEY grabbled a narrow lead while fighting four deep early, moved over to the rail
once clear of inner rivals entering the turn, dueled with CHISMOSA around the bend, maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth and yielded to the
winner late. CHISMOSA vied five deep between rivals, moved into the two path still between rivals into the turn, dueled outside GETTHEMONEY to the
stretch, kept the pressure on through the final furlong and never found the needed late kick. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) raced up closer from inside then chased the
top trio into the turn, came off the rail and brushed rival crossing the dirt, moved out to take aim in the stretch but lacked late punch. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB)
well placed behind the early speed battle, entered the lane four deep, moved into the three path then came back out a bit leaving the bend, tipped out in the
stretch and could not produce a bid. SELENAIA (IRE) showed early speed three deep then took a stalking position approaching the turn, got crowded
between rivals on the bend, steered to the inside, asked right handed along the fence in the drive, could not respond and was not persevered with in the last
sixteenth. THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) showed early speed between rivals then chased two wide into the turn, brushed with inner rival crossing over the dirt
and weakened down the lane. REBALATION fought for the lead six deep in the early going, vied three deep into the turn, lost touch with the top pair
crossing the dirt and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
MC VAY broke a bit awkwardly from outside, took the first turn six then seven wide while dropping off the pace, drew closer in the middle stages, rallied from
outside to confront the leaders four deep on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole and quickly cleared, drew away in upper stretch under strong handling,
tapped left handed midstretch and was ridden out in the final sixteenth. WINTERFELL chased five wide early, raced in mid-pack outside rivals up the
backstretch, put in a mild bid three deep on the far turn, could not kick on with MC VAY past the quarter pole, kept on through the lane and bested the rest.
WISE COUNSEL got bumped back at the start, tucked inside trailing the field, rallied three then four wide on the second bend and gained the show. PONY
EXPRESS broke alertly then ceded command, stalked two to three wide on the clubhouse turn, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, challenged from
outside on the far turn, could not keep up with the new leader past the quarter pole and flattened to fourth. MIDDLEBURG went up to take control from
inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, challenged by PONY EXPRESS on the outside, relinquished the lead to the winner at the quarter pole and faded
in the furlong grounds. LEADING chased four deep early, moved inside on the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a response when
called upon. METRO bumped outer rival in the beginning, settled along the inside, drew closer in the middle stages, came under a ride on the far turn and
had little left for the stretch run. FAME chased three deep around the clubhouse turn, continued three wide on the second bend while starting to weaken,
came out into the stretch and tired. MAGNIFY settled between rivals, dropped back two to three wide on the far turn, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
DUAL THREAT unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, moved into range on the backstretch, tipped out and loomed two wide leaving the far turn,
drew alongside DE' MEDICI at the top of the lane, battled through the final furlong and dug in late to best the runner-up. DE' MEDICI grabbed the early lead
from inside, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, cleared with three furlongs remaining, challenged by DUAL THREAT at the three-sixteenths pole,
maintained a short lead over that rival into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly in the end. MISCHELOF (CHI) reserved in the two path early, drew closer
and stalked between rivals in the middle stagers, got boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, shifted to the inside for a clear path
then angled back out, could not find the needed rally to threaten the winners but finished a clear third. VEGAS BURNER stalked four deep early, remained
wide to the stretch and weakened. PRECISION STRIKE pressed the pace between runners, forced the issue to the far turn, lost touch with the leader at the
three-eighths marker, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. LETSHAVEONEMORE forwardly placed outside the top pair, roused into the far turn,
dropped back around the bend and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE settled along the inside, started to move approaching the quarter pole while shifting off the inside, angled four wide into the
stretch, collared the leader in upper stretch and drove clear. RUNAMILEINMYSHOES tracked two wide outside a rival, drew closer two then three wide on
the far turn, challenged three deep into the lane, put a head in front in upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to
save second. WARREN'S PARADICE traveled two wide towards the rear, split foes at the quarter pole, moved out in upper stretch, showed late effort, failed
to get up for second, came back and was unsaddled following race, then got vanned off . GLACIER RIM saved ground from well off the pace, ridden along
exiting the far turn, paused in upper stretch, tipped off the fence and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. MIZ CLUBCALI vied between rivals
early then ceded command around the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, drew closer around the far turn, bid two wide into the
stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. NOTHING IS FOREVER shifted in leaving the gate, raced two wide near the back early on, moved to the inside,
trailed into the far turn, continued at the back entering the lane, came off the rail with a furlong remaining and improved position. LAST ELIZABETHAN
chased three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled out of range in the middle stages, ridden along on the far turn, got floated out into the stretch
and weakened. PIPPA PHILIPA reserved near the back and taken to the inside, angled to the three path briefly on the far turn before coming back to the
two path, moved out in the drive and lacked further response. ANNIE'S HOPE vied three three deep then cleared inner rivals and crossed over on the first
turn, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, held a diminished lead with a quarter mile remaining, lost command at the top of the stretch and
gave way in the final furlong. FASCINATOR showed early speed inside a pair of rivals then ceded command on the first turn, dropped back out of range,
gained along the rail on the second bend but flattened out in the final furlong. GIRLCANTHELPIT hesitated leaving the gate to come away last, trailed near
the inside around the first turn, had one beat into the second bend, chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped out into the lane and could not make an
impact. MINERAL RIGHTS unhurried in the opening stages and moved into the two path, spun three wide into the lane and was never a factor.
