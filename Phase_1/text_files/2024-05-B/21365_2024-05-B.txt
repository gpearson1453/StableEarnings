Footnotes
ADEERA dueled for the lead with an outer rival, shook free in upper stretch and drove clear. SALTED dueled outside of the eventual winner, failed to keep
pace in upper stretch and held place. SUPER MAXIMA tracked the embattled leaving pair from the two path, chased them through the lane and needed
more to threaten place. COMBATTANTE hopped slightly and broke slow, pursued in the three path and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT IN AUSTIN leaned in
and bumped a rival at the start, was taken back in the aftermath, trailed in the three path, entered the lane in the four path and failed o factor. HEY
SCOOTER bobbled a bit and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
LITE IT UP LOUIE tracked along the inside, stalked behind the leaders and from the two path around the turn, bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch, dueled
with an outer co-bidder through midstretch and shook free in the final sixteenth. PATTY VAN TWINKLE pursued from midpack in the four to five path into
the turn, ranged up outside of the leaders entering the lane in the six path, bid along with an inner rival in upper stretch, sparred through midstretch but was
turned away late. GRACE GIVEN broke a beat slow, lacked speed along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane, moved up willingly and edged show
late. PRISON BOUND broke a step slow at the start, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, moved up entering the lane and sustained a chase
without threatening. GALADINI set a pressured pace inside of rivals and a path off of the rail around the turn, shifted a path further out entering the lane, but
was headed between bidders in upper stretch and gave way. NO MAP NEEDED raced towards the rear in the four to five path around the turn, entered the
lane between horses, altered course outwardly in upper stretch and moved up. MOON FLEET was floated out by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the
pace in the five path, came under urging in the six path around the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. MIRANDA stalked
outside of the top pair and from the four path, pressed inching closer to offer a bid turning for home, but weakened between horses entering the lane.
RETAIL THERAPY pursued from midpack in the three path, chased between horses around the turn, shifted out behind rivals in upper stretch and failed to
factor. MISS RUTH prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, vied between around the turn, yielded in the four path entering the lane and
faltered between horses. ANDREA BEACH broke out, trailed in the five to three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
HALINA'S FORTE stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid nearing the lane, gained an advantage entering it, shifted out while driving clear
in upper stretch and held sway. TANYA SHOWERS broke a step slow, pursued from off of the pace in the four path, inched closer around the turn to gain
place in upper stretch, took aim with multiple lengths to find on the clear leader in midstretch and chased her home to prove second best. TRIAL broke half a
beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, awaited racing room behind rivals turning for home in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper
stretch and ran on willingly. LET THEM WATCH recovered quickly after a flat-footed beginning, raced forwardly along the inside, shifted two wide chasing
the new leader entering the lane, then lacked a bid and gave way late. MS. TART broke towards the back of the pack, trailed in the two to three path, then
stayed on to advance between horses in the closing stages. HONEY DIJON tracked in midpack from the three path, chased between horses around the
turn, yielded entering the lane, floated out in upper stretch and failed to factor. HOT BEACH set a clear pace in the two path into the turn, got headed by an
outer bidder entering the lane and caved.

Footnotes
BEYOND BEST trailed in the three path, advanced in the four path around the turn, tipped inwardly rather than fanning wide entering the lane, offered a rail
chase to bid at the sixteenth pole, forged an advantage and held late. PIKE PLACE tracked in the three path, entered the lane in the four path, tipped
outside of rivals in upper stretch, rallied to offer a late bid but missed. EXPENSIVE CUT vied two wide and between horses, then inside of rivals while a path
off of the rail around the turn, sustained the battle among foes while leading into the final furlong, but was outkicked between bidders late. PERFECT
FLIGHT pressed four wide, then outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, bid in the five path entering the lane, vied into midstretch but
yielded between horses with a sixteenth to go. HERN lacked speed in the two path, shifted to the four path around the turn before tucking back to the two
path entering the lane, and moved up while failing to menace. PIPES AND DRUMS vied three deep, then two wide while between horses in the three path
around the turn, drifted out to the four path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, then changed leads whlie yielded between horses at the furlong
grounds. HE'S GOT THIS chased from midpack in the five to four path, spun to the six path entering the lane and tired. SOUTHERN SUNSET raced off of
the pace in the four path, but faded in the two path and between horses around the turn. COLOSSEO prompted inside of a pair of foes leaving the chute,
stalked them approaching the turn, but weakened with three furlongs to go.

DEPICTION settled well back in the two path, advanced in the five path around the far turn, sustained a rally to reel in the leader leaving the sixteenth pole,
led and held from an outer challenger late. UNLEASH THE POWER pursued from midpack two wide, then between horses down the backstretch, pursued
from further back around the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, tipped out in upper stretch, offered a late kick outside of rivals in hopes of bidding
at the wire, but came up short. DOUBLE CLUTCH showed the way a bit off of the inner rival, scooted clear in upper stretch, but was collared by an outer
bidder at the sixteenth pole, got bested and lost place late. TIVERTON (GB) tracked along the inside, chased in the two path in upper stretch, but hung on
his left lead and needed more. CARCANO trailed along the inside, swung out seven wide entering upper stretch and stayed on willingly. THREE ON THE
TREE hopped at the start and brushed with an inner rival, pursued from midpack along the inside, dropped back around the far turn, then improved between
horses through the lane. DECANTED tracked four wide, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, lacked a bid and yielded. RANSOMWARE stalked
in the three path and faded between horses in midstretch. GO BALI GO took back from between horses early on, laid off of the pace three wide and failed to
factor. GATLINBURG tracked three wide and between horses, chased in the four path around the far turn, got outmoved by an outer rival nearing the lane,
shifted inwardly entering upper stretch and gave way. BOLT FROM ABOVE broke slowly and brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in
the two path, between horses nearing the backstretch, took the far turn in the four path and made little impact. ROYAL MENDE stalked in the two path,
chased between horses entering the backstretch, yielded position passing the five furlong pole, chased along the inside around the far turn and weakened.

EVERSO MISCHIEVOUS stalked along the inside before tipping outside of the leading pair at the nine sixteenths pole, pursued from the four path around
the turn, ranged up entering teh lane to bid in upper stretch, dueled with an inner bidder into the final furlong, edged clear leaving the sixteenth pole and
held sway late. RUNNIN' RAY chased from midpack in the four to three path, swung to the six path entering the lane and rallied willingly to gain place in the
shadow of the wire. HAPPY AMERICAN settled off off the pace along the inside, gained ground while saving it around the bend, paused behind a faltering
foe nearing the lane, slipped through entering it to offer a rail bid in upper stretch, dueled with an outer bidder into the final furlong, but yielded with a
sixteenth to go and lost place late. DENINGTON lagged well behind in the two path into and around the turn, picked up stride nearing the lane, shifted out to
the seven path in midstretch and sustained progress for a minor share. U. S. ARMY vied with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, led turning
for home, but got headed between bidders in upper stretch and faded. HOWLING TIME vied with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inside, gave
way earing the lane and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SIR GREYLIND pressed two wide, bid entering the lane, assumed command and drew off under a drive. LIAM'S JOURNEY showed the way inside of the
eventual winner, proved no match in upper stretch and lasted for place. BAYTOWN BRUISER stalked three wide, chased in the four path entering the lane
and stayed on to hold show from an outer bidder. BRILLIANT MAN broke a step slow, trailed in the two path, then three wide around the far turn, stayed on
between horses but was denied show late. MO RHODES was off a beat slow, laid off of the pace three wide, then in the four to five path around the far turn
and failed to factor. WHO'S THE KING tracked along the inside while briefly rank into the first turn, chased turning for home and tired. MONTEVALLO
pursued two wide and faded between horses around the far turn. I'M YOUR MAN laid off of the pace while a bit keen around the first turn and saved ground
to no avail.
