DEUS EX MACHINA was steadied slightly when MEADOW VALUE bore out early, went clear and drew off under mild handling. MEADOW VALUE bore out
early and checked, raced inside and dueled for the place. BOULDER BAY stalked the early pace in the three path and dueled for the place, narrowly
missing it. LORD GRANTHAM raced in the three path and had no late bid. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE raced in the three path, fading in the stretch. LAST

path and bid late for the place. PICKLE FEET bore out at the start, stalked the pace in the two path but had no late bid. VICTOR'S DEAL raced evenly in the
four path. DO YA WANNA DANCE and BLUEGRASS PRAYER faded in the stretch. STOP HAMMERTIME was off awkwardly.

Footnotes
OTAGO stalked the pace in the three path, rallied on the far turn and was clear in the stretch, then just lasted under strong urging. DEGREE OF RISK saved
ground, lacked running room at the three-sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path, rallied and just missed. GEWURZTRAMINER stalked the pace in the three
path and bid belatedly in the four path. FAITH RUNNER stalked the pace inside, bid late but couldn't hold off the closers. CABALLO FELIZ was clear early
under restraint, then yielded at the eighth pole. POOL GUY was unrushed in the four path and found his best stride late outside. JEOPARDY THEORY
stalked the pace in the two path, bid at the quarter pole but faltered. MAASAI WARRIOR was not a factor. NO NO JOE stalked the pace between rivals but
gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
LUCK OF THE DRAW was clear early and held sway under steady urging. OFF THE MEDS stalked the pace in the three path and found his best stride late.
MY BARILEY was unrushed early and bid late in the four path. ROTARY DIAL and VERSATILE pressed the pace outside of the leader and gave way.
IMPULSIVENESS trailed inside and passed tired rivals. AVIANO was off awkwardly and was not a factor. LOADEMUPJUSTICE saved ground and gave
way in the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
