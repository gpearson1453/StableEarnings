Footnotes
CAJUN EXPECTATION bumped with an inner foe at the start, set a clear pace inside, extended her advantage approaching the quarter, was roused from
the two path into the lane, kicked on, and held sway. BALENCIAGA BETTY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, was roused into
the turn, and chased on from the four path down the stretch for place. HOLY KINGDOM bobbled leaving the gate and trailed along the inside, was driven
from the rail around the turn, kept on while tipping out to the five path in the final furlong, and got up for show. MY SARASOTA QUEEN stalked in the three
path but faded from the seven path in the stretch. ROYAL ABERDEEN chased in the four path, floated out to the nine path in upper stretch, but never
threatened. NOUVEAU RICHE raced off the pace in the five path but never menaced.

PLANKTON set a clear pace along the rail and held well clear under a drive. ARISAEMA was pinched back at the start, raced well back two and three wide
and rallied between foes to gain the place. TAKE YOUR POINT was bumped after the start, saved ground in midpack, went three wide between foes around
the far turn, shifted further out in upper stretch, was clipped behind nearing the sixteenth pole and gained the show. NAA DUDETTE was bumped at the
start, saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SWEET JUDY BLUE was
bumped after the start, chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. FEAR AND FRIDAY chased the pace three and four wide and weakened in the
final furlong. SHINING SKYE bumped at the start and was outrun inside. COOL TRICKS failed to menace while racing four and five wide. REINA MAR was
bumped between foes at the start, saved ground off the pace, was never close and steadied near the sixteenth pole. EXOTIC DANCER was bumped after
the start, stalked the winner two wide, retreated nearing the quarter pole then steadied to avoid a faller nearing the sixteenth pole. TIME MISS chased the
pace two and three wide, checked while tiring nearing the sixteenth pole and was not urged from there. DARLING LUNA raced in range two and three wide,
clipped heels leaving the eighth pole, fell, immediately regained her feet and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
OCEAN CLUB laid up close in the two path, bid in the three path early around the far turn, took command passing the quarter, was roused into the lane, and
kicked on, drifted out in the final furlong, but held sway. TOWSER trailed in the three path, was roused between foes passing the quarter, angled out to the
six path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. ANGEL NADESHIKO stalked in the three path, was cued into the far turn, and kept on from the two path
down the lane for show. CHARLIE'S WISH bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path, was ridden between foes into the far turn, fanned
out to the six path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. EMPRESS ELLIE bobbled at the start and bumped with an outer foe, rated in the two path,
came under a ride along the inside going into the far turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch. THIRTY THOU KELVIN set the pace inside but
yielded entering the stretch. STARSHIP AGENDA raced off the pace in the four path but never menaced, pulled up after the gallop out and was vanned off.

JULEE'S LEGACY was off a bit slowly, advanced inside down the backstretch, bid inside of the pacestter near the five-sixteenths pole, took command
approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe late. ALESS QUEEN pressed the pace in the three path, could not match strides
with the winner in upper stretch but kept on through the final furlong to narrow much of the gap. BROWN EYED BEAUTY chased the pace four wide, lacked
the needed rally but churned on for the show. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES raced in range three wide and was one-paced through the lane. TIMELY REWARD
set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. GOULDIAN was outrun while racing two wide. FIVE EYES ONMICHEL

Footnotes
HEY RIVER showed the way in the two path, was nudged around the far turn, opened up while floating out to the five path under a drive in upper stretch,
and held sway. BOLD ADVANCE chased in the five path, was driven around the far turn, got carried out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and ran on
for place. CANDY STREET prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed along from the three path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at
the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. HECHICERO broke out and bumped an outer foe, tracked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, but
flattened in the final furlong. PIRATE RADIO steadied at the start, rated along the rail but made no impact. AMBUSHED raced wellback in the two path and
did not factor from out in the six path in the stretch. GO GO GE stalked in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, but weakened on his
left lead down the lane. NOBLE WAVE got bumped by an inner foe at the start, trailed inside and never threatened. DARTH raced off the pace in the two
path and was no menace. DANLEY raced in midpack from the three path but backed up after a half.

Footnotes
SWIRVIN set a pressured pace along the rail, edged ahead in upper stretch and just lasted. LEGACY ISLE was bumped at the start, trailed early, advanced
four and five wide around the turn, closed outside and just missed. CLASSIC CAR WASH pressed the pace two wide, reached even terms around the turn,
vied between but was outkicked in the lane. X Y POINT came in and bumped foes at the start, prompted the pace from the rail and was one-paced through
the stretch. CELESTIAL GLAZE stalked the pace three wide between foes, had aim in upper stretch but evened out in the final furlong. AVANT GLORY
hopped at the start, chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. GATSBY was bumped at the start, appeared to be trying to get out
throughout the race and was never in contention.

MO GO stalked inside, was cued from the rail early around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and inched past an inner foe in the closing
stages. INHERENT PROMISE tracked in the three path, took command under rousing early around the far turn, ran on from the two into the stretch, but was
edged out by an outer foe late to place. SWIFT DELIVERY laid in midpack along the inside, was coaxed while tipping out to the three path early into the far
turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on to get up for show late. IL SICILIANO had his head turned and bumped with an inner
foe at the start, was unhurried in the three path early, coaxed along in the two path around the far turn, and kicked on down the stretch, but made no impact.
RIVERWALK rated in the two path, was driven three wide around the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. SON OF
A SLEW had a slow start, raced wellback in the six path but never threatened, and bumped with an inner foe late. BLUE SPEARMAN raced off the pace in
the five path but failed to menace, and bumped with an outer foe late. LAMCARO bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace inside, but lost the lead
early around the far turn, and gaveway in the stretch. SHARP WONDER prompted the pace in the two path but backed up between foes around the far turn.
AWESOME LIFE trailed in the two path and could never get involved. MONOPOLY OF HONOR laid up close in the three path early, but gradually
weakened down the backstretch, was pulled up midway around the far turn, and walked off.

Footnotes
NOTHING BUT PUMPS settled off the pace while racing three wide, cruised up three wide around the far turn, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole
and drew off under a drive. WICCA WISDOM bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, angled to the rail turning for home and finished well to be
clearly second best. SMART SPENDING raced off the early pace three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, took the lead two wide midway
around the far turn, was collared by the winner not long after, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. CURRENT SITUATION chased the pace
two wide and lacked the needed rally. BARBARA had speed between foes, rated back midway around the first turn, steadied nearing the far turn, chased
three wide around that bend an lacked a closing bid. DUBSTEP hesitated at the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn but
had little left for the drive. WINNING AT EASE vied inside and was through after a half. SLIME QUEEN bobbled and was bumped at the start, rushed up
three wide to the lead around the first turn, vied outside down the backstretch and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ADVOCATE bobbled at the start, was prompted along while in range from the two path, inched closer to the pacesetter along the inside rounding
the turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and drew past the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth. REEF RUNNER rated in the three path, was
coaxed into the turn, floated out to the six path at the entering the stretch, and ran on while on his left lead for place. SIR FLASH raced off the pace in the
three path, tipped to the rail rounding the turn, was cued passing the quarter but got immediately stymied turning into the lane, tipped outwards into the final
furlong, and kept on for show. OKIRO chased inside, steadied going into the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and mildly stayed on.
ESPERON went clear to set the pace in the two path, tipped to the rail going into the turn, was roused entering the stretch, but yielded around the sixteenth.
LIGHTING CLOUDS bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path and never threatened. SNOWNAME bumped with an outer foe at the start,
tracked in the four path, but drifted way outside leaving the turn, and continued trying to drift out in the stretch while being eased.
