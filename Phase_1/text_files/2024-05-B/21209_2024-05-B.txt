jumps to be second best. MO CLASSY stalked the pace from three wide through the final turn then made a late stretch run to be up for the show. CALAJA
raced off the pace saving ground throughout while giving and even effort. SHE'S TAKIN OVER was unhurried through the final turn then made a strong late
surge in the stretch but was too late. HOT PATOOTIE raced in the middle of the pace and was not a threat. SUMMER IS HOT sprinted to the lead to set
most of the pace then was engaged on the final turn and dueled to the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INTO WISHING bobbled slightly at the start then was allowed to settle off the rail behind the leaders down the backstretch then moved up around the final
turn going four wide into the stretch and cruised past the leaders to prove best. FIRST LINE stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then
moved up to engage the leader on the final turn and took a brief lead into the stretch but was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. BIG
ROJO roused to the lead to the final turn from the two path then was challenge by inside and outside rival on the final turn but couldn't fend them off and
gave way. DREWPOWER trailed the field to the stretch and passed tired rival. ANICLUDE prompted the pace from the inside down the backstretch then
moved up to engage the leader entering the final turn but started a slow fade midway through the turn.

COLT FICTION stalked the pace to the turn then made a three wide bid on the turn and drove past the leaders and cleared late. GLENN'S JUMPER rushed
up and dueled on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. VERB raced in the middle of the pack and made a five wide bid into upper stretch for a rally.
UPTOWN HUSTLER raced off the pace on the inside giving an even effort. WESTERN AFLEET was a little fractious in the gate then sprinted away to duel
around the turn and tired late. CIBOLO saved ground to no avail. DONNA'S COURT showed little. TRIPPER JOHN was unsettled in the gate, was forwardly
placed into the turn but lugged out around the turn and was taken up.
