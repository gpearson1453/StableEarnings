Footnotes
SPECIAL DISPATCH laid off of the pace in the three path, advanced in the five path turning for home to take aim on the leader from the four path entering
the lane, bid in upper stretch and drove clear at the furlong grounds. COACH CAMPBELL stalked forwardly along the inside, got outmoved by a wide bidder
while tipping two wide behind the leaders nearing the lane, shifted back in as the aforementioned foe kicked clear in midstretch and sustained a chase to
edge place at the sixteenth pole. SEVEN TAYLORS stalked in the four path, ranged up to bid at the five sixteenths pole, led tucking to the three path
entering the lane, but was headed by an outer challenger in upper stretch, faded yet lasted for show. LEBOMBO tracked two wide, gave way under urging in
the three path around the turn, yet regained stride and kept on mildly. BOUNTEOUS trailed in the four path, fanned out to the six path entering the lane and
failed to menace. MALIBLUE led in the two path, got headed by an outer bidder nearing the lane and weakened. DROBNY pressed the leader from the
three path but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
FOREVER HOME dueled for the lead two wide, cleared his inner counterpart in upper stretch, drifted out through the final furlong and lasted at the wire.
KYLE BEAUTY sparred for the lead with an outer rival, failed to maintain level terms in upper stretch, but kept on through the final furlong, closed in to offer
a rebid as the leader drifted in the late stages but narrowly missed. KITTEN CALLS trailed in the four path, shifted in to the two path in upper stretch, rallied
inside of rivals, bid for show while flopping back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole, dueled for that position through the closing stages and prevailed.
ROSE PALACE chased in the two path, shifted out to the four path with multiple lengths to find on the top pair in upper stretch, lacked a bid before meeting
an inner challenge for show at the sixteenth pole, dueled with that one late but was bested. ABITIBI hopped at the start and broke multiple lengths slow,
raced off of the pace along the inside, steadied into the turn, took the bend in the three path before fanning out to the six path entering the lane, and failed to
menace. GOSHEN stalked the dueling leading pair from the three path, but faded getting floated to the five path entering the lane.

Footnotes
VODKA WITH A TWIST set the pace along the inside, inched clear tipping to the two path entering the lane and held sway from an outer bidder. MURPHY
GIRL leaned out at the start, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, took aim on the leader in upper stretch but was kept at bay through the
final furlong. ACHIEVE was eased back from inside of rivals passing the half mile pole to lay off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two path,
shifted out to the four to five path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. SLANG pressed outside of the leader, required urging to sustain pressure in the
three path around the turn, then weakened between horses entering the lane. ANAKARINA broke a bit keenly while off awkwardly, pulled while rank behind
the leaders through the opening stages, pursued tracking along the inside around the turn, chased in upper stretch but faded through the final furlong. LA
CARA took back from between horses at the half mile pole, trailed in the three path, swung out to the seven path at the three sixteenths pole and failed to
factor. SWIFTWIND was slow into stride, chased off of the pace in the three path, got floated to teh six path into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CRUSHED ICE tracked from the three to tour path around the turn, floated to the six path taking aim outside of the leaders entering the lane, bid and gained
an advantage passing the furlong grounds and drove clear. RETAIL THERAPY bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted outside of the pace setter,
wrestled a narrow advantage in the three path as an outer rival applied pressure into the turn, maintained an advantage through upper stretch, but was
headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, dueled for place with an inner foe through the closing stages and narrowly lasted. ROSE ALABAMA raced
forwardly along the inside, came under a snug hold when subtly put to tight rail quarters at the five furlong pole, tracked from the two path around the turn,
then sustained a rail chase to vie for place in the final sixteenth but just missed. GEORGIA ON E'SMIND took contact from an inner rival and veered
outwardly at the start, advanced outside of foes to stalk outside of the top pair into the turn, prompted from the four path around the bend, but drifted to the
five path entering the lane and faded between horses in upper stretch. VINO VELOCE checked between horses at the nine sixteenths pole, trailed in the
four to five path around the turn, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to menace. LOW KEY FLEX showed the way early on, got headed
by a pair of outer rivals entering the turn and weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BEAR RIVER showed the way inside of a prompting rival around the turn, scooted clear in upper stretch and held from a late challenger. COMMITTEE OF
ONE laid off of the pace in the two path, split foes four wide launching a rally entering midstretch, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the closing stages,
but ran out of ground to reel that one in. RUN CARSON broke a step slow before being hustled forward, chased while forwardly placed along the inside,
entered the lane in the two path, sustained pursuit to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival shortly after and held show.
DEMOLITION DUKE broke a step slow and brushed with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed two wide, swung out to the eight path in upper stretch and
ran on willingly. POLSTER tracked two wide and between horses, shifted out to the fie path entering the lane and lacked a bid. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD
laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and stayed on mildly. SILVER HALO was a bit reluctant to load,
prompted outside of the leader and from the three path around the turn, but failed to sustain pressure in upper stretch and weakened between horses at the
furlong grounds. CIGARETTE BOAT brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked three deep, floated to the six path entering the lane and weakened
between horses. PRETTY FAST broke slowly while last away, raced at the rear in the four path before fanning to the seven path entering teh lane and made
little impact. CHAMBERS BAY trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
MAUNA KEA BOUND pressed outside of the pace setter into the turn, bid and assumed command nearing the lane, then drew off under driving pressure.
WRITE OFF JERRY broke a step slow and was put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, gained from well back in the four path around the turn,
cut the corner entering the lane, sustained stride tipping two wide leaving the furlong grounds, edged show passing the sixteenth pole and fended off an
outer challenger. MORE THAN FIVE broke a step slow and brushed an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two to four path around the turn, then stayed on
to offer a late bid for place but missed. SOUND DOCTRINE showed the way inside of the eventual winner into the turn, proved no match for that one leaving
it and weakened. SMOOTHDINI made little impact from the two path. QUARRYMEN tracked in the three to four path and tired. FAMILY FACTOR stalked
along the inside and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
ON A SPREE laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order approaching the far turn, stalked in the two path around that bend, bid outside of the
new leader turning for home and drew off under mild urging. HOODLUM tracked two wide around the first turn, bid inside of the leader into the far turn,
gained an advantage passing the seven sixteenths pole, but was headed by an outer rival entering the lane, was no match and well clear of the rest. GUN
RUSH pursued from midpack three wide, chased in the five path around the far turn, hung on his left lead and bumped an inner rival at the furlong grounds
while improving. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) led in the three path as an outer rival applied firm pressure, left the rail vacated, got headed by an inner bidder
into the far turn, faded shortly after and continued to give way after taking contact for an outer foe in midstretch. NEPAL UP trailed in the two path, moved
out of last saving ground around the far turn and made little impact. P H FACTOR prompted outside of the leader while kept in the four path by that one,
then weakened between horses with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
ANYWHO vied two wide, cleared entering the lane and drew off under a drive. CHARRIERE laid off of the pace in the five to four path, spun into the lane in
the five path, bid for place along with an inner rival in upper stretch, took contact from that one inside the furlong grounds causing her to flop to her left lead,
drifted in and bumped her counterpart leaving the sixteenth pole, then prevailed for place. HOWL broke slowly, recovered to stalk along the inside, pursued
from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of the leaders and to the four path entering the lane, bid for place along with an outer rival in upper stretch,
drifted out and brushed that one leaving the furlong grounds causing herself to also change back to her left lead, took contact from her outer counterpart
while continuing to vie for place in the final sixteenth but was bested. UNSUNG MELODY vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, proved no match
for that one entering the lane and gave way. CHANDANA trailed in the two path, swung out to the eight path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. AMARETTI
raced off of the pace in the four path and between horses, yielded at the three furlong pole, tucked to the two path turning for home before shifting back out
entering the lane, but failed to factor. SWEET ALYSSA leaned into the outer stall door upon leaving the gate, saved ground off of the pace and faded.
BACKYARD MONEY chased forwardly in the three path, but gave way turning for home.

LUCKY SPEECH stalked outside of the leader, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, drew off under a drive and was wrapped up with a sixteenth
to go. TIMELESS ELEGANCE tracked along the inside, gained place entering the lane in the three path and held that position. KIMBER SPICE laid off of
the pace in the two path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, stayed on but was denied place. MISHKA stuttered a step soon after the start, lagged
behind early on, then moved up. WITHOUT CAUSE showed the way along the inside, but proved no match for an outer bidder nearing the lane and
weakened. MO LANTERN tracked two wide, chased in the four path around the far turn and tired. HEARTSTRUCK pursued from midpack four wide, but
was through early and eased through the lane.
