Footnotes
ROCKSTAR RO stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, surged three wide on the turn to make the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace
and widened through the stretch under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. STAGE NAME battled for the lead along the inside for a half then was no
match for the winner while gamely gaining second. MUGSY MALONE dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch and weakened late. AUTHENTIC
COWTOWN saved ground and lacked the needed response. OVER THE HILLS had speed five wide and gave way in the stretch. PER RULING
ECM2024-186 FROM HIWU, ROCKSTAR RO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

I'LL FIGURE IT OUT tracked the early pace four wide, responded readily when set down, angled inside the pacesetter before the furlong marker, surged
two wide and was along in time. INSIDE STUNT slow early, closed rapidly in the five path through the stretch and got up for second. JOKEMEISTER
sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace while getting rapid fractions into the stretch, drifted to mid track, was righted through the final
stages and outfinished in a game effort. SHADOW TRACER chased the leader along the rail, inherited the lead as that one drifted wide and was also
outfinished. CUGINE failed to menace. GILLIGAN was no factor. OTIS OTIS OTIS well placed, failed to respond. VENETIAN DREAM was outrun. MON
CAMO was through early.
