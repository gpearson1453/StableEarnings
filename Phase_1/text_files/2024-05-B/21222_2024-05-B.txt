Footnotes
HIDDEN CACHE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over at the quarter pole and quickly drew away under moderate urging. CLOUDY TIMES
saved ground, angled out in the stretch and continued willingly. WICKED LADY outrun early, moved inside on the turn, back outside in the stretch and
flattened. NOW ACT SURPRISED dropped back at the start, moved wide on the turn with a mild bid. AYEARTOREMEMBER lacked speed chasing near the
inside and was never a factor. AUNT BERRA raced four wide off the pace and proved empty in the stretch. DUNE JUMPER sprinted away in the opening
quarter then stopped at the quarter pole. WAR MOON stumbled badly unseating her rider at the start.

LAZARETTO quickly took control then widened throughout while never menaced under moderate urging. LARGE broke sluggishly, rushed up, was blocked
into the far turn, split rivals and rallied late to earn place dead heat. MAXIM MOMENT prompted the winner outside to midstretch and lasted for place dead
heat. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS lunged at the break, advanced wide then flattened out in the stretch. HIBACHI raced close up inside then began fading on
the turn. RUDY ROD raced off the pace between rivals and lacked a rally. CREATE AGAIN lacked speed and weakened steadily. PER RULING #ECM
2024-188 FROM HIWU, LAZARETTO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

WALDRIP led briefly inside, eased back after quarter, bid in the stretch, brushed rival in the stretch and continued gamely to get the nod. FRIZZANTE broke
slowly, moved up inside, was in tight into the far turn, rallied and was brushed by the winner in the stretch. DYLAN'S RUBY alternated for lead outside, led
narrowly on the turn then weakened. JUST STEP ON IT prompted the pace four and three wide then came up empty in the stretch. BET THE LINE settled
off the pace between rivals, steadied on the final turn then faltered. TOP OF THE STREET moved off the pace, raced wide throughout and proved empty in
the lane. JESUS' DREAM alternated for the lead in the two path and inside then gave way in the stretch. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the
winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

SOCIAL LADY settled close up inside, slipped through to the front at the top of the stretch and gamely held off late challenge. MAGNIFICENT PEARL led
under pressure inside, lost the lead at the top of the stretch then battled back to the wire. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE raced just off the pace, bid inside
stretch and gained third. LAMASCO forced the pace outside to the stretch and weakened slightly. DIVINE GRACE raced three wide just off the leaders and
was finished after half a mile. CIVIL NOTION rated just off the pace between rivals early then bore out tiring on the final turn.

Footnotes
THIRSTY PAPPY forced the pace outside, held a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was challenged again in the final furlong and held on with determination.
COALVILLE rated behind the dueling leaders, bid inside late, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. VICTIM OF THE NITE broke poorly, steadied
on the first turn, was blocked in the stretch and forced to alter course. MORETHANAFEELING broke through gate prior to the start, held a pressured lead,
continued well but tired late. SPEIGHTSTER RED steadied inside on the first turn, saved ground, faded on the final turn then offered a mild bid. MODERN
ERA trailed far behind then narrowed gap without menacing. NEW COMMISSION broke slowly, moved closer wide before half a mile then faded.

FROSTED DIAMOND reserved just off the pace, bid into the stretch then wore down the leader late. PUT THE CRAZY AWAY forced the pace outside, took
over at the quarter pole but could not hold off the winner. STEAL THE DEAL far behind early, advanced outside and was no match for the top pair. ONE OF
THE ONES dropped far back then rallied inside on the turn. JAVA'S LUCKY LADY forced the pace along the inside then gave way in the stretch.
EQUISTAR angled inside setting the pace, lost the lead at the five sixteenths and faded. CHARLIZE CHUB chased three wide in midpack and faltered.
KEEP ON ROCKIN broke in a complete tangle losing any chance and trailed.
