Footnotes
BAYTOWN BUTTERFLY prompted two wide and between horses, took light contact from his outer counterpart into the turn, forged an advantage tucking
from the four to three path at the five sixteenths pole, led into the turn and drove clear at the furlong grounds. BOTTOMS UP broke sharply, showed the way
in the three path, tucked to the two path as an outer pair prompted around the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, then kept on to be second best.
HERB ELIAS broke inwardly and was off slow, saved ground off of the pace, improved to gain show leaving the furlong grounds and held that position.
AMERICAN CITY broke awkwardly and was off slow, trailed in the three to four path before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and ran on willingly.
BAYTOWN AMY ROSE pressed the top pair from the five path, but shifted inwardly while shying from the shadow casted by the seven sixteenths pole into
the turn, brushed his inner stable-mate in the process, sustained pressure from the four path around the turn, but yiedled entering the lane and weakened.
CASE ACE tracked pursuing outside of the main group early on, but faded tucking to the two path at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
GREEN LIGHT prompted two wide, vied down the backstretch, led traveling well in hand turning for home and impressively kicked away. CLOUDY
HOLIDAY was fractious in the starting gate, pursued from midpack along the inside, brushed an outer rival to split foes two wide while gaining nearing the
lane, claimed place from among foes entering the lane, shfited out and secured that position while no match for the leader. SUGAR HOOK stalked along the
inside early on, then two wide around the far turn, got brushed three wide before bidding for place entering the lane, but was outkicked for that position in
the process, then saved for show from an inner bidder at the wire. CABERNAYDO saved ground off of the pace, split foes two wide in upper stretch, ran on
to offer an inside show bid late, but missed. SPIN IT tracked in the two to three path and between horses, but gave way in the four path turning for home
and failed to re-rally. AK SAR BEN DERBY lacked speed in the two path, then saved ground at the rear around the far turn, and improved position. CALL
ME CASSIUS laid off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, then two wide and between foes around the far turn, but failed to factor.
ACCIDENT tracked in the three to four path around the first turn, got floated to the five path around the far turn, lugged inwardly in upper stretch and
weakened. UNBRIDLED PLEASURE vied with an outer rival, proved no match for that one nearing the lane and folded. SARDIS broke a step slow and was
slow early on, trailed along the inside, then two wide around teh far turn and made little impact. BOOKIE BRENT lacked speed three wide, fanned to the six
path entering the lane before being floated wider in upper stretch and made little impact.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TANGO tracked three wide, issued a bold challenge outside of the top pair entering the far turn, led leaving the three furlong pole, cleared in the
four path entering the lane, held sway from an outer pursuer into the final furlong, dug in as that one closed in in the closing stages and held. ROCK STAR
DOCTOR laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked shifting two to three wide as the new leader took charge around the far turn, tipped to the five path to
take aim while sustaining pursuit into the final furlong, slowly closed in in the final sixteenth to issue a bid but was kept at bay. DREAMING ALWAYS trailed
along the inside, advanced between horses shifting to the four path entering the lane and moved up. THE CLUB pressed outside of the leader, but was
outmoved by an outer bidder at the three furlong pole and gave way through the lane. CARIBBEAN NIGHT laid off of the pace in the three to four path early
on and failed to factor. RED SUN DRESS showed the way tugging under snug restraint into the backstretch, got headed by a pair of outer rivals at the three
furlong pole and folded.

Footnotes
DISARM set a soft pace via a leisurely gallop, established a loose margin down the backstretch, showed the way in hand around the far turn, but was set
down in upper stretch as an outer rival loomed a danger, yet held well under a drive before being put to hand in the closing stages. ONTHESTAGE stalked
two wide, took aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, offered a bid but was fended off through the final furlong. BABA VOSS tracked along the inside
and chased willingly through the lane. TEXAS RED HOT trailed throughout.

FAN THE FIRE was bumped by an inner rival a the start, tracked forwardly two wide and between horses, offered a rail bid in midstretch, gained an
advantage at the sixteenth poled and edged clear. WESTERN COMMAND tracked four wide, bid in upper stretch, vied with a rail bidder leaving the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked by that one at the sixteenth pole and held place from a late outer challenger. PICO D'ORO laid off of the pace three to four wide,
tipped five wide in upper stretch, rallied to offer a late bid for place but was denied. SHUFFLE DANCE prompted three deep, sustained pressure around the
turn, but was outkicked between bidders in upper stretch and sustained a chase through the final furlong. SUTHERLAND leaned into an outer rival at the
start, pursued from midpack along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the two to three path entering the lane and lacked a rally. BETTERING broke a step
slow, trailed in the two path, entered the lane in the four path, tipped wider in midstretch and improved position. TRUE JEDI vied two wide and between
horses, led around the turn, briefly cleared entering the lane but faltered between bidders reaching the furlong grounds. ONCOMING TRAIN vied inside of a
pair of rivals, but gave way with three furlongs to go and faded.

ICE TIME pursued from midpack two wide, shifted five wide entering the lane and rallied to drive past the leader approaching the wire. STRASSE set the
pace inside of a pressing foe, kicked clear entering the lane, shifted off of the inside in midstretch, but was caught by an outer challenger late and lasted
safely for place. ACTIVE DUTY saved ground off of the pace, then offered a rail charge to bid for place leaving the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an
outer counterpart and kept on. SAGITTARIUS tracked in the four path, sustained pursuit around the far turn, bumped with an inner rival chasing into the
lane, stayed on in upper stretch to gain place reaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the sixteenth pole.
LAUGHNOWCRYLATER lacked speed along the inside, shifted two wide nearing the backstretch, took the far turn in the five path before tipping wider into
upper stretch, then moved up while hanging on his left lead. AUDEN broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, then in the six to seven path
around the far turn and surpassed tired rivals. SIR ROCK prompted outside of the leader, vied around teh far turn, but yielded entering the lane and
weakened between horses. MASTER OF THE NITE broke half a step slow, tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, chased in the two to three
path around the far turn, but was bumped and put to tight quarters entering the lane, then faded hanging on his left lead. PUCKSTER stalked in the three
path and weakened between horses turning for home. NOW IMA BELIEVER broke a step slow, trailed two to three wide early on and was outrun around the
far turn.

Footnotes
SUGOI vied two wide, gained an advantage around the first turn, showed the way in hand with his ears pricked around the second turn, led from a pair of
pursuers around the far turn, met an outer challenge in midstretch, repelled that bid with a sixteenth to go, shook free and held well. STRONG TIDE stalked
three wide getting briefly keen entering the first turn, pursued forwardly two wide and between horses around the second turn, came under urging inching
closer along with an outer foe turning for home, chased before attempting a bid in midstretch, but was turned away at the sixteenth pole and narrowly saved
place at the wire. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) brushed an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch,
sustained a grinding rally to steadily close in inside the final sixteenth but missed reaching place. BOLD ACT (IRE) steadied back when brushed and put to
crowded quarters among foes at the start, trailed early on, gained in the five path around the first turn, sustained progress outside of rivals to track three
wide around the second turn, inched closer within striking range turning for home, but leveled off in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and was
outkicked for show at the sixteenth pole. UTAH BEACH lacked speed in the four path early on, then in the two path around the second turn, three path
around the far turn and moved up entering the lane. KING CURLIN raced forwardly along the inside early on, took contact from an outer rival entering the
first turn, backed off around that bend, laid off of the pace around the second turn, came under urging into the far turn and failed to factor. RECKONING
FORCE bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, brushed with an inner rival into the first turn, chased leaving the final
turn and tired. QUADRA ISLAND bumped with an outer foe at the start, vied along the inside before stalking an outer rival around the first turn, then faded
around the final turn. GUNTOWN laid off of the pace along the inside, retreated to trail with a mile remaining and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
HIGHWAY ROBBER broke a step slow, settled well back three wide, swung six wide entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the new leader at the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. CLYDE'S GOT A GUN was off a beat slow, trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path around the far turn before fanning
to the seven path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes chasing the eventual winner and gained place late. GRAY'S FABLE was brushed between horses
at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path around the far turn before launching a rally entering the lane, progressed to drive past the
leader at the furlong grounds, but was bested by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, yielded yet saved show at the wire. LINCOLN HIGHWAY lacked
speed along the inside, then in the two to three path around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane before tipping wider in upper stretch, then
ran on belatedly and missed show at the wire. SCOOBIE QUANDO brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, entered the
lane in the five path and stayed on between horses. ESCAPE ARTIST stalked the leader from the three path before applying pressure in the two path down
the backstretch, vied around the far turn, led into the lane, but was caught at the furlong grounds and faded. LOYAL COMPANY tracked along the inside,
pursued from the two path around the far turn, then chased between horses and lacked a bid. FAIR DINKUM stalked the top pair from the four to three path,
took aim on the new leader entering the lane but yielded between horses in upper streth. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS pursued from midpack in the five to four
path early on, got outmoved by an outer rival entering the lane and faded. POWERFUL pursued from midpack in the three path, tucked around the far turn
and failed to factor. PACKS A WAHLOP brushed an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, chased in the three path around the far
turn and faded entering the lane. MALIBU SPRINGS was brushed between horses at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUSNESS showed the way in the three to two path, dug in entering the lane, dueled while headed by an outer rival into the final furlong, leaned
out and brushed his counterpart at the sixteenth marker, fought on gamely and prevailed while exchanging contact at the wire. LETSTALKABOUTME
tracked two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path to gain outside of the top pair turning for home, bid entering the lane, sparred with an inner
rival while wrestling an advantage in midstretch, was brushed at the sixteenth pole before bobbling subtly, then hung and missed while exchanging blows
passing the wire. SANCTIFY stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around teh far turn, but yielded between the eventual top pair in
upper stretch. ALICIT INTENTION pursued off of the pace in the two path and failed to threaten. WINE AND WAVES stalked along the inside, chased
around the far turn and faded. TIME FOR MAGIC took back from between horses at the start, trailed in teh two path, shfited to the four path entering the
lane and failed to factor. BABY AVERY broke towards the rear, tugged slightly while racing in the bit off of the pace in the three path, came under a drive in
the four to five path around the far turn and tired.
