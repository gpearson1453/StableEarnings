Footnotes
GHOSTLY SPITFIRE was off just a tad slow to begin, settling nicely at the back of the pack, was allowed to canter down the backside seeing the pack,
made a big move swooping the field three wide midway on the far turn, easily took control outside with a furlong remaining and won going away at the wire.
NIGHT STRIKER took control from the onset, set a soft pace while mildly pressed outside down the backstretch, maintained a slim advantage on the fence
going around the final turn, could not fend off the much the best winner at the furlong marker but easily bested the rest for the runners up share. TAPROOM
was under a snug hold shadowing the pacesetter outside early on, continued to flank the frontrunner outside down the back straight, pressed the issue
making a bid around the far turn, could not match strides with the leaders on either side in upper and ran on to hold for the show money. STUD MUFFIN
settled on the rail behind the front duo in the first turn, inched closer to the leaders down the backstretch, came under a ride inside midway on the final turn
but could not get into contention and under a vigorous ride could only be one paced in the stretch drive. COPROLITE travelled three wide outside rivals in
the second flight around the first turn, continued outside horses watching the front pair along the backside, was asked for more run with five sixteenths to go,
could not quicken with others and was not a factor in the drive to the finish line.

Footnotes
MUSICAL SPELL was content to be near the back inside on the rail down the backstretch, followed a fellow rival making a move on the fence at the quarter
pole, shifted just outside in the three path finding clear running room at the furlong marker, switched leads and wore down the leader with a sixteenth to run
to edge clear at the finish line. FIELD HOCKEY forced the pace on the rail in the beginning, began to pull away up front at the quarter pole, braced for the
challenge by the winner outside with an eighth left to run but could not hold on in deep stretch. DISSECTOLOGIST hesitated at the break trailing down the
backside, continued at the rear throughout the turn saving ground, made a sharp move on the fence with a furlong remaining and closed in well to be a solid
third after a tardy beginning. BAJAN BULLET stalked between runners in the two path near the rear in the early stages, waited behind the contesting trio at
the quarter pole, found a seam in the four path to be in the hunt turning for home and won the battle for a minor role in the end. MR. MARSHALL broke in at
the start, was hustled to take command down the back straight, surrendered the lead between foes at the quarter pole, chased the leader in upper stretch,
could not go on and gave way in the final eighth. RY PIE travelled in mid-pack four deep outside foes down the back straight, was scrubbed on for more but
made little headway going three wide around the bend outside rivals, angled out to be in the six path widest of runners at the top of the stretch, drifted in
while urged left handed at the furlong marker and could not get involved late. APRIL DE VELP tracked three wide outside horses at the half mile marker,
took closer order to bid three wide midway on the turn, continued to fight being in the mix five wide at the top of the lane, could not find more late and
retreated in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
CADFAEL broke sharp to be loose on the lead, continued to set the pace with little pressure applied from the other challengers around the bend and had
more in reserve in the stretch to draw off convincingly at the finish. TODAY settled on the outside of runners in the third flight down the backstretch, was
getting out while urged right handed on the turn, keep on coming though under a determined ride, loomed the only threat in the five path at the top of the
lane and finished up to be a clear second in the end. BOSTON BAY was travelling on the rail in a stalking position in the third flight, saved ground keeping
pace inside on the turn and finished up willingly on the fence to capture the show award. SCAT FACTOR co-trailed on the inside by the half, made little
impression having one foe beaten running on the oval, shifted out at the furlong marker and finished with intent to settle on the fringes. QUANDALE chased
the lone speed down the back straight, came under a drive but could not make any gains on the frontrunning winner on the turn, battled for the minors in
upper stretch but yielded between foes at the sixteenth pole. GARGAS broke in at the start, stalked in the third flight on the outside three deep, improved
down the backstretch to track outs on the turn, could not sustain the run at the quarter pole with rivals on either side and wilted through the stretch. BEER
MOSA was antsy in the gate while the field was loading, broke slow, co-trailed on the outside at the half, could not keep up through the turn and was not a
presence in the stretch running.

Footnotes
MIRAMICHI got away well and was prominent very early but ceded the lead content to track in behind the pacesetter, advanced on that one to bid three
wide coming to the three-sixteenths, took command and was quickly clear despite lugging in a bit, extended the margin and held safe. GO GIFFEN was a bit
rank heading to the turn late up the backstretch fighting the rider in behind and outside at the rear, swung seven wide turning for home, kept on late to
edged past for the place while no threat to the winner. MOMUNNYFOR RO settled outside mid-division, came out six wide in upper stretch, kicked on from
between runners but needed more. MARDENE stalked from outside the eventual winner into the turn, moved out from three to four wide on that bend,
loomed a threat five wide at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. GOOD NEWS MONEY tracked mid-pack racing inside,
was off the rail two deep in the stretch run, kept on evenly. NO LAYUPS was reluctant to load, broke well and was keen to move clear to set the early tempo
racing near the rail, was overtaken in upper stretch, kept on under stout urging while switching outside the new leader coming to the sixteenth pole but
needed more late. MAIKEN THE VIKING was fractious behind the gate, broke several lengths slowly, saved ground on the turn bringing up the rear, was
never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
COUNTRY LIVING was situated near the front four deep outside watching the trio up top, bid three wide halfway through the turn, chased gamely in upper
stretch, never gave in down the lane and surged nearing the wire to just get up for the well timed late rally. SUMMER COMMANDER had a slim lead on the
inside down the backstretch, edged away for the lead five sixteenths from home, opened up mildly in upper stretch but could not hold off the tenacious
winner who got up in the final few jumps. JOHNNY GOLD broke in at the start, settled on the outside of runners in mid-pack, advanced when roused for
more on the turn and closed well to be a non-threatening third in the end. INDY ONE prompted the pace in the two path with rivals on each side, chased the
pacesetter between horses with five sixteenths from home, had little left to give at the top of the stretch and faded late. REBELIOUS was unhurried trailing in
the beginning, could not make any headway seeing the field on the turn and had a good late rally reaching for more ground between runners in deep
stretch. HANLAN hopped slightly then was pushed in at the start, improved through the backstretch, rallied three wide outside foes at the quarter pole, could
not sustain the run to the wire and stalled in the late stages. QUIET KNIGHT broke through the gate prior to the start, was in the mix early three wide
between foes, could not accelerate into the turn losing forward position, was asked to keep up left-handed midway around the bend, could not offer anymore
and was empty for the drive to the finish. LOADED JUSTICE was steadied leaving the chute, travelled on the rail in midfield down the back straight, was
asked to go on around the turn running on the fence but was travelling in the wrong direction and had little to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO raced up close in the early stages but taken back just off the leaders tracking about two wide, angled in late on the turn, bid up the rail,
fought determinedly to the wire to prevail. PRICELESS WILL settled off the pace inside, shifted seven wide for the drive, gained steadily through the stretch
but missed. SOULMATE was coaxed from the break, had forward position stalking up close heading into the turn, went three to four deep on that bend, bid
at the top of the stretch taking a narrow lead, was game to the wire but outfinished. SALVATOR MUNDI broke just a half-step slowly, was allowed to settle,
steadily advanced outside on the turn four to five deep, evened out in the lane. LONG POND was ridden along three furlongs out racing about four wide in
behind the leaders, ran on one-paced in the stretch. READY FOR A FIGHT settled outside at the back through the turn, came out in the stretch, kicked on
but too late. SHADY EMPIRE got away well then was encouraged clear, shifted in a bit but still off the fence setting the pace in the two to three path,
weakened in the stretch. SPITE STORE was forwardly-positioned but steadied on heels after the opening furlong, tracked in behind saving ground on the
turn, came up empty. JIMMIES BIG DAY raced inside at the rear and was never a threat.

Footnotes
PLAYMEA TUNE had an ideal trip down the backstretch, sitting behind the early speed foes rating kindly, was forced to move maintaining position between
runners at the three furlong marker, then was set down taking control at the quarter pole, quickly opened up turning for home and won as pleased while kept
to the task to the wire. RIDEAU HALL was nestled on the rail in the middle of the pack, closed to gap on the leaders by the quarter pole, angled out with
momentum five wide at the top of the lane and closed in willingly to best the others at the wire. TUTTI CONTENTI hopped slightly to trail in the beginning,
began to pick up runners by the half and put it all together in the stretch run rallying smartly between foes to be a solid third in his debut.
BACKONTHECHAINGANG broke out on the start, tracked the front three four deep on the outside down the backside, moved in to bid three wide through
the turn, could not go on with the dominant winner by upper stretch and faded in the lane while not switching leads to hold for a minor prize. TIMES A
BREEZE was forced out on the break, could see the field at the half mile marker and passed the early speed horses who were weakening driving to the
finish line. UNSTABLE STORM took command outside from the onset, set the swift fractions while hounded outside running around the bend, was collared
by the winner at the quarter pole, had nothing left and retreated on the fence by the sixteenth pole. HAPPY QUAD pressed the issue inside down the
backstretch, could not keep inside position and was shuffled back behind the front trio at the three furlong marker, chased the leaders through the turn until
upper stretch and folded at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER cleared from the outside post to be loose on the lead by the five eighths marker, dictated terms unchallenged around the bend,
opened up at the top of the lane and kept on going to hold safe from his stablemate at the wire. THREE SONNY SIDEUP was situated outside runners in
the third flight at the half, was hard ridden but could not make any progress on the top two traveling around the turn and dug in late, finding more between
foes in deep stretch to get up for the runners up share. COMMANDER JOE sat alone tracking the loose front-end winner going comfortably down the
backside, chased the leader on the turn but to no avail, continued in vain to reel in the winner in upper stretch, could not find more and faded late, saving for
third money at the finish line. LENNY K stalked inside near the rear down the back straight, split foes two wide making a move three furlongs out and ran on
mildly in the stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. JAMIESTA co-trailed on the inside in the early going, rallied, improving on the rail at the three eighths
marker, shifted out three wide at the quarter pole and finished up evenly through the stretch. KING ALFREDO co-trailed on the outside to begin, saved
ground on the turn but made little improvement, made a mild run passing a tired rival at the quarter pole but could not get into contention running one paced
through the lane. RACE FOR PINKS stalked outside rivals near the back of the pack in the early going, could not quicken with runners who were making a
move inside at the three furlong pole and was not able to be a factor in the stretch run. BOXER BRIEF travelled on the rail in the third flight along the
backside, was scrubbed on while on the fence at the three eighths marker, offered little response and backed away by mid-stretch.
