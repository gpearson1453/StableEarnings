Footnotes
TIZ VICIOUS away well and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing just out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in deep stretch to get up in time. I'M CORFU broke sharply and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn while racing out from the rail,
maintained an advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off the late surge by TIZ VICIOUS, while clearly second best. STAY FANTASTIC away alertly
and eased into a stalking trip while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly
three wide in the drive to garner a share. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY stalked the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon late while finishing from along the rail.
JERSEYS IMAGE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

Footnotes
TEXAS MOONSHINE away alertly and eased off the pacesetter while holding a stalking trip into the stretch the first time, maintained his position through the
second turn and into the backstretch, took up the chase two wide approaching the final turn, assumed control leaving the turn, and held SLEW'S DA BOSS
safely at bay late to prove best. SLEW'S DA BOSS broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the
stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive
to prove clearly second best. BARNEY GOOGLE settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the stretch the first time, continued to bid his time near
the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up for a
share. DEALERS HAND rushed up to assume command entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, opened a clear lead entering the stretch the
first time, maintained that advantage through the second turn, and into the backstretch, was quickly overtaken leaving the final turn, and tired late. TEX
HANLEY stumbled in the opening strides and trailed the field into the first turn while racing just out from the rail, continued from the back of the pack in the
run down the backstretch, saved ground entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid.

BAKKEN OVERDRIVE raced to the lead and secured the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, repelled the bid of COUNTERACT leaving the turn, and inched clear in the drive to prove best. COUNTERACT broke sharply and stalked the
pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn to loom a danger, was unable to keep tabs on
BAKKEN OVERDRIVE entering the lane, and finished three wide in the drive in a solid effort. ROCKCLIFFE away well and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, but failed to sustain that bid in the stretch drive while proving
clearly best of the rest. ARISTOCRACY was bumped soon after the start, and trailed the field into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack while
racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and passed a tiring rival late while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. DADDY'S
PEPPER away alertly and eased into a tracking trip from along the inside entering the first turn, chased the leader into the backstretch, struggled to maintain
his position in the run to the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

BAKBURNER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, and was never seriously threatened. VIVA LA DIVA away well and tracked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove easily
second best. BROOKE MAGIC settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering
the final turn, but failed to sustain her bid in the stretch drive. LIZZIE'S RAYNE broke sharply and stalked the leader from along the rail entering the
backstretch, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, went wrong leaving the turn, was pulled up and transported off of the track via the
equine ambulance. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the mishap leaving the final turn, after review there was no
change made to the original order of finish.

THERE GOES MY HERO stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the
final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up in time. BECKETT'S BEST away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of
DON W entering the first turn, continued to set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, got the better of his pace rival in mid
stretch, and just failed to last. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from
along the rail entering the final turn, awaited room at the rail leaving the turn, before tipping four wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for a
share. DON W broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of BECKETT'S BEST entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the
outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival in mid stretch and faded in the
late going. CRYPTO MUNNY unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and
finished with late interest in the drive while unable to threaten. CHAMPIOSA away well and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing
two out from the rail, continued three wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

WHEN IN MEXICO away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, turned back
a bid from ON MY GOOD SIDE through the final turn, and drew off in the lane, while being ridden out late. ON MY GOOD SIDE broke sharply and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn to loom a threat, but was unable to sustain
his bid in the lane. GO LENT GO away well and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. I'M SEEING RED was slow into stride and trailed the field into the first turn while
racing out from the rail, was always well back, and was being eased in the late stages.

WEEKENDINDELMAR entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the

the rail, continued four wide entering he final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. EYES OF BEAUTY broke inwards, and was taken in hand and
dropped back to trail in the run to the first turn, continued to trail the field into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
