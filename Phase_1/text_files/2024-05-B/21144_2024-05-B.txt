Footnotes
GUN MAESTRO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused at the
three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prove much the best. UNION LIGHTS coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, kept on safe for the place honors. STRONG LIGHT stumbled at the
start and was bumped by CUMBERLAND BLUES, who broke outwards, conceded four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to close in late and secure the show
honors. CUMBERLAND BLUES broke out at the start bumping STRONG LIGHT, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, continued
in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. SKI COUNTRY broke out at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the

Footnotes
TEN TEN prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, gained the lead just inside the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear at the
quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging.
DANCING LIANA broke a step slow then was taken in hand, moved out early then was reserved at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came through inside
of foes while roused at the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the final
furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. SENDERA moved out early then settled near the back, passed the five-eighths pole between foes,
dropped back some near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused between foes at the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. APOLLONIA VITELLI moved up outside the three-quarter pole then was well placed
just off the pace, came under urging while inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. JINGLE JANGLE
went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused under threat with three furlongs to run, lost the
advantage just inside the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the stretch and tired. BELLA ISOLA broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow, was urged
early then settled on the outside, chased three then four wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final

Footnotes
VETTRIANO stalked the pace while well out in the track, went around the turn in the four path, took the lead at will into upper stretch, drew away while
remaining on his inside until near the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead when thrown in by the rider at that juncture then was eased up while much
the best. HE HAS IT ALL moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, came under urging before the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. SCHLOMO was coaxed along early,
dropped back with five furlongs to run, went two then three wide under urging on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MAMA'S
MIDDIE dropped back under urging then angled in, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ROYAL BROWNE broke a bit slow then dropped back
more while tossing his head, spotted the front several lengths, moved up some under urging, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. AELFGAR was
off slow then slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
CURLIN'S HUSTLE broke very slow then veered in, spotted the front many lengths, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch and trailed.
TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE STEWARDS'. PER RULING EMC2024-182 FROM HIWU, HE HAS IT ALL
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

TWENTY SIX BLACK coaxed from the gate, led briefly early on before backing off to concede the front to CITY MISCHIEF, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, dug in and prevail at the end.
WORKS FOR ME coaxed from the start, raced three wide in aim of the front, tucked to the two path and advanced on the leader to duel with that foe from
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command a furlong out, got collared a sixteenth from home and
fought on to the finish to preserve the place honors. CITY MISCHIEF forwardly placed from the start, took over command five furlongs out and showed the
way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn and dueled with the aforementioned foe, took the inside route into upper stretch, got caught furlong
out and ran on through to the finish. SEAVER chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. NOBLE EMOTION coaxed from the start, raced four wide
just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and offered up a bid swinging three wide into upper stretch,
then weakened in the late stages. KING MOONRACER coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ME 'N SAP coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and weakened. DREAMPOINT broke out at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. FEATHERS ROAD chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coaxed along from midway, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DESTIN'S MISSION chased three wide down the
backstretch, suffered an injury near the half mile pole and was quickly placed to a protective hold and expertly backed out, guided outside and pulled up just
into the turn and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
RUSE was well placed just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the two path while asked at the quarter-pole, gained to make a bid between horses in upper
stretch, held a narrow advantage passing the eighth-pole, fought gamely with multiple foes in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
OPERATION TORCH tucked into the two path for the run around the first turn, settled in fourth position, ranged up two then three wide on the far turn, was
roused four wide at the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch, fought on well to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. TORIGO
settled on the inside, moved off the rail near the five-sixteenths pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to
make a bid in the final sixteenth but missed while up for the show. GHOSTLYPRINCE traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled towards the
rear, saved ground on the far turn, moved out near the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the last spot in the superfecta. ROYAL SPIRIT
moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and
improved position. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside with a clear advantage, responded well when
asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive near the furlong marker and weakened. ASSUME NOTHING stalked the pace on the outside in the
two path, was asked on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. AL'S ROCKET went three wide on the
first turn, settled on the inside of an opponent, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
SCRAMBLE went four wide on the first turn, settled outside without cover, was roused four wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. HAVE YOU HEARD was taken up while rank early, saved ground on the turns and was no factor.

Footnotes
WEEKEND RAGS settled just off the pace on the outside, went three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside
the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. FANCYPANTS JULIANA was coaxed from the gate, disputed the pace on the outside of two
foes, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back a bit under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to get the place. LINARITE settled
at the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the two path at the quarter-pole, angled out in upper stretch, gained between foes late and finished with
good energy to just get the show. QUICK POWER NAP settled just off the pace, raced between foes in the two path while dropping back some on the turn,
shifted four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. STOLEN FUTURE was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside
of two foes, vied along the rail on the turn, moved to a solo advantage in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken and
weakened. BEACH CRUISER bumped with a rival while off a step slow, was reserved off the pace then eased back between horses nearing the half-mile
pole, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GRAM bumped with a foe at the start, angled in early
then settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came three wide into the stretch then moved further
out and failed to threaten. DUSK dropped back early then settled towards the rear, went two to three wide while roused on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and was no factor. BERN ROSEY BERN was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked the
needed kick. RUMINT disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHANTILLY ROAD two to three wide through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth out, dug in under a left handed crop coming out and brushing her main danger
in the final strides while holding safe to the finish. OPERA DE RAVEL (FR) three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit advancing from mid
pack to be just off the pace midway down the backstretch, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue
a challenge inside the final eighth, got brushed by the top one in the last jumps to the finish when ultimately repelled to the wire. JUSTDENY three then two
wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
JUST SO PRETTY got bumped at the start by OUR FINEST HOUR breaking inwards and in turn bumped THE TACO LADY, established the front and
showed the way crossing to the inside into the first turn, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive under threat from a pair and was collared at the sixteenth pole, then got shaken off in the late stages. SUNDAY TIFF tracked the pace along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. OUR FINEST HOUR (FR) broke in a step
at the start bumping JUST SO PRETTY into THE TACO LADY, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, offered no response. AUTUMN'S TURN settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. THE TACO LADY got bumped at the start by JUST SO PRETTY due to pressure from OUR
FINEST HOUR, who broke in a step, chased just off the inside coming under encouragement three furlongs from home, tipped three wide at the top of the
stretch, tired in the drive.
