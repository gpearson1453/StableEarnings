Footnotes
BOOK OF WISDOM brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend,
remained on her inside lead in upper stretch, came out then bumped twice with MONTAUK MYSTIQUE and created room out from behind horses inside the
three-sixteenths pole, gained to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. GOING FOR GLORY was urged along on the far
outside, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, gained under a drive in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. NEIGH JUDE
broke in and brushed with an opponent, raced tightly between horses early, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, moved into second position into
the turn, chased while dropping from the two path to the rail going around that bend, came under the crop in upper stretch, gained along the rail to make a
bid inside the furlong marker, battled on even terms for the advantage into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while just able to get the show. STEPPIN'
HAWK angled in while speeding clear, showed the way in the two path, came under the crop with her lead diminishing in upper stretch, fought on gamely
when challenged near the furlong marker, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, kept on well to the finish and just lost the show. MIA NIPOTINA was
urged along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, was put to the crop in upper stretch, gained to make a bid near the furlong marker, reached even
terms for the lead outside the sixteenth-pole but weakened late. MONTAUK MYSTIQUE broke in and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved
up under some urging, raced between horses passing the five-eighths pole, went four wide on the turn, was bumped twice by the winner inside the
three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed response. BABI DREAMS brushed with foes on both sides at the start, had a hind-right bandage begin to come
loose near the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the three path with the bandage dangling more, continued to have the bandage unravel in the
stretch and was no factor.

marker when shown the crop to the left side while kept to task safely clear to the finish. NOVA RAGS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
KURAMATA (IRE) was hustled from the gate then taken in hand, saved ground while rated just off the pace under snug restraint, bobbled just inside the
three-eighths pole, drafted just behind the leaders past the five-sixteenths pole, was roused while shifting out three wide late on the final turn, gained to
make a bid outside the furlong marker, took a short lead outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BODECREAM was hustled
to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, fought on gamely in the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
sixteenth-pole, battled with that foe to the finish and just missed while clear for the place. HIGH TIDE tugged hard at the bit under tight restraint at the back,
went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn then gained four wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable
striking position before the furlong marker and improved while flattening out to safely secure the show. FRONT MAN tracked the pace on the outside in the
two path, was given his cue on the final turn, chased into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. VALUE ENGINEERING moved in early, saved
ground while settling under some urging, came under stronger encouragement on the far turn, moved out into the stretch and failed to threaten. MAJESTIC
EAGLE prompted the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was asked on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened.
LANDBISCUIT settled in the middle of the field in the two path, was roused on the far turn, dropped to the rail into upper stretch and failed to rally. FIRST
GLIMPSE saved ground towards the back, was urged on the final turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
EVER SO SWEET (IRE) went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear into upper stretch and held
under strong urging. KERRY bobbled at the start but broke towards the front, settled off the pace, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and proved no match but showed good courage to just hold the place. PROUD MARY settled off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and improved to just miss the place while up for the show. LILLY
SIMONE settled towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also improved position but missed the show.
LOW SOCIETY tossed her head at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the
turn, came off the rail into the stretch, angled out sharply inside the furlong marker and gained late to just miss the superfecta. A NEW PEACE settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path late on that bend and failed to rally. CYNANE brushed the outside of the gate at the
start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. MISS SAN GABRIEL settled
between horses, dropped back early on the turn, went around that bend in the two path and was no factor. MAJESTIC RETURN pressed the pace on the
outside of the winner, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back at the quarter-pole then moved to the rail into upper stretch and tired. BELLE OF THE
BALL broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, raced between foes late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and faltered then was
eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SCREAMING UNCLE coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside in close aim of an early duel before advancing to vie with that pair with five
furlongs to run, tucked three wide once into the turn forcing MAGNIFICENT RIDE to steady off his heels, went three then two wide through the turn
emerging three furlongs out to duel with MIDNIGHT WORKER, swung three wide into upper stretch roused for the stretch drive, edged clear to the finish to
prevail. MIDNIGHT WORKER dueled from the two path early on with REMEMBER THE NAME before vying inside a pair five furlongs from home, tucked
inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the
place honors. BIG SAVE chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path near the half mile pole, came under coaxing along the inside at the
five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FEATHERS ROAD coaxed from the start, chased four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. STREET SWAGG coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MAGNIFICENT RIDE four wide in pursuit, tucked three wide at the half mile pole and was
forced to steady when SCREAMING UNCLE tucked directly in front, lost two lengths of ground as a result, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths
tucking to the two path to escape the retreating REMEMBER THE NAME, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. REMEMBER THE NAME hustled
from the gate intent on command, dueled with MIDNIGHT WORKER in the early stages, came under the crop to the right side near the five-eighths when
joined by the top one and vied from the two path between foes urged along from the start, began to get shaken off midway on the turn and retreated, swung
three to four wide under a protective hold being eased up and along into upper stretch, then got pulled up inside the sixteenth pole and was subsequently
vanned off.

Footnotes
HAMILTON'S WAY was taken in hand early, saved ground under vigorous restraint while just off heels along the rail going around the opening bend, was
rated just off the pace, came under urging outside the three-eighths pole, chased inside on the final turn, came off the rail into the stretch, made a bid
outside the furlong marker, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. SWORDOFHONOR (IRE) went to the front, was well
rated while showing the way on the inside, came under encouragement on the final turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, led under a drive into the
final furlong but was overtaken while just able to hold the place. FACTOR ANALYSIS settled on the inside, was asked late on the backstretch, brushed with
a foe into the final turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished with good courage to just miss the place. STOP THE PRESS settled towards the rear while
two to three wide, moved to the four path under urging late on the final turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. STEADFAST RESOLVE was
urged early then taken back under strong restraint to the rear, went two then three wide on the first turn, entered the stretch for the first time in the four path,
moved up near the wire, tracked three wide from that point, was given his cue near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased on the final turn, pursued the top two
in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. EL REZEEN settled in the three path, was asked on the final turn, moved to the four path late on that bend, came
five wide into the stretch, raced between horses in the final furlong and lacked the needed response. TAKE YOUR SEATS (IRE) went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside in the three path from that point, was urged along on the final turn and also lacked the needed response. CIAO CHUCK stalked
the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked late on the backstretch then urged along on the final turn, spun three into the stretch and tired.
TRANSCENDENTAL settled between horses in the two path, came under urging near the half-mile pole, brushed with a rival leaving the backstretch, spun
three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ROBAIRE was asked from the gate then taken under a tight hold early, saved ground while reserved on
the inside, tried to move up passing the chute for the first time then was taken up some while in tight quarters then dropped to the rear, saved ground on the
second turn and was pulled up on the backstretch then walked off.

Footnotes
BANK FRENZY established the front soon after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. DR. KRAFT broke out at the start bumping SHADOW DRAGON, chased four wide,
tucked three wide nearing the three-eighths and forced HORSE BE WITH YOU to check out off his heels, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. SHADOW DRAGON got
bumped at the start by DR. KRAFT, who broke outwards, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to just miss for the place honors. BALDIZAR chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the two path into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. CUT THE CORD chased three
to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. ROCKET AND ROLL broke in at the start
bumping MASON MANIA, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.
COLLOQUY chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MASON MANIA
got bumped at the start by the breaking inwards ROCKET AND ROLL, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HORSE BE WITH YOU hustled from the gate, raced three wide in closest aim of
the leader, had DR. KRAFT tuck in front near the three-eighths and was forced to check off his heels, retreated under a light hold and was guided out eight
to nine wide into upper stretch, then got eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
YOUR MAN ALEX bumped with a rival at the start, drifted in early, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, dropped in a bit into
upper stretch then shifted back out, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. DAYBRIGHT DELIGHTS broke a step slow,
was urged along towards the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the
place. LAUNCH CONTROL was away alertly then went clear early, came under a challenge near the nine-sixteenths, vied inside on the turn, dueled inside
a foe into the final furlong, disposed of that opponent near the sixteenth-pole but was quickly overtaken by the winner then lost the place while tiring late.
SEBASTIANTHE FIRST broke a bit awkwardly, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
kick. FERRIS MULER broke very awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, raced well back in the field, lugged out some between
horses leaving the backstretch, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, was driven between horses in upper stretch and improved
position. IRISH TENOR chased outside early then moved up to press the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, dueled with a foe until near the
sixteenth-pole then weakened. NANO MAN settled in a good position, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to rally. ART OF COURAGE chased the
pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. Z DANCER broke out and bumped with a foe then
dropped back, fell well behind the rest of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came well out into upper stretch and was no factor. SAINT
BONES bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then was carried in early, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and showed little. MAZZEI
was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, dropped back while two to three wide on the turn and retreated.
