SWEET UNIQUE prompted the pace two wide for three furlongs, took command, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as
much the best while being ridden out. LA CUMPARSITA sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for three furlong then was no
match for the winner while narrowly hanging on for second. SERGER stalked the pace from the start and finished determinedly two wide. IN TROUBLED
WATERS failed to menace. TATTERED HEART tracked the pace in the three path and lacked the needed response. CAUSE OF LOVE was no factor. H. T.
XENA was no threat.

Footnotes
WEEKEND RETREAT settled mid pack, began to close ground through upper stretch, drifted from the four path to the seven path when put to left handed
urging causing CINSAULT to clip heels inside the sixteenth pole, surged late and got up in time while drifting inward. OLLIE'S FOLLY pressed the pace two
wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead at the furlong marker three wide and was caught in the final stages. D J'S FIRST STEP bore in bumping
CINSAULT at the start, stalked the pace down the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, battled four wide the balance of the trip,
was in tight inside the winner at the wire and outfinished. DREAMINGABOUTTIME found his best stride late along the rail. GOTTOMAKEITHAPPEN rushed
to the lead, set a pressured pace until mid stretch then weakened. CINSAULT hopped then was bumped at the start, trailed down the backstretch, circled
rivals through mid stretch, clipped heels with the winner inside the sixteenth pole when that one drifted out in front of him, stumbled and lost momentum.
WHY KENNY WHY was outrun. LUCY'S FIRST SONG was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF CINSAULT
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF WEEKEND RETREAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED WEEKEND RETREAT AND PLACED HIM SIXTH.

KEY TO SUCCESS allowed to settle, closed ground rapidly four wide through the turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of
the trip to win as much the best under a hand ride. MISS EASY unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the four path and finished clear for second. NOT
TODAY well placed, offered a mild bid three late late on the turn then leveled off. DANCE MY WAY stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied three
wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, kept on into the stretch then came up empty in the final stages. CANDYMONIUM was no factor. VIMISOFA
broke through the gate prior to the start, upon being reloaded dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn then folded. OROZIMBA battled for the lead
two wide into the turn and was through after a half.
