Footnotes
BORRACHO set the pace on the inside, dueled with DUNPHY into the stretch, battled back gamely inside of that rival past the furlong marker and prevailed
determinedly. DUNPHY stalked three wide, bid on the turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, dueled with BORRACHO, dug in gamely and had the rider
lose the crop near the sixteenth pole. DESERT RULER raced off the pace, moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane and closed late outside.
WHERE IS MIKE stalked two wide, chased on the turn and tired. STRUGAR raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and had no rally. MY
DANNY BOY broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
ARMY CADET tracked the pace setter from the two path, when readied around the far turn went clear with ease, held safe under a steady drive. TIMO,
raced well back off the early leaders, circled the field five wide around the far turn, found traffic in deep stretch, angled inside weary foe, and finished
willingly through the wire. NANGA PARBAT (GB) saved ground around the first turn, and down the backside, angled off the rail for clear room in upper
stretch, out kicked through the lane. INFINITE SERIES rated back off the pace nearing the three quarter marker, inched up three wide around the far bend,
loomed a threat leaving the quarter pole, failed to kick on late. WHO KNEW GIRVIN was very slow into stride around the first turn, raced well off the pace
down the backside, went by the faders late. POP SOCKS raced along the rail around the first turn, saved ground from off the pace into the far turn, came
under a drive leaving the three eighths pole, failed to respond. PRALINEPOPSBOTTLES raced off the pace and five wide down the backside, lacked a late
rally. LOVE HOPE FAITH off to a quick start, set the pace along the inside, came under pressure around the second bend, and retreated through the
stretch.
