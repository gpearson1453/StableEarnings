Footnotes
CARTHAGE CAJUN forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer three wide before a half, vied on the outside through the final turn, kicked clear into the
lane, not threatened to the wire to win ridden out. MIDNIGHT AVENGER behind the pace, inside bid into the far turn, dueled with the winner late in that
bend, proved no match in the drive, fully extended to hold sway for the second spot. CATHY'S BOY broke awkwardly to trail early, continued in the back for
four furlongs, bit closer late backstretch, moved out to be widest for the drive when mounting a mild rally, along for the show late while closing the gap on
the top two. DONEGAL MOONSHINE four wide into the first turn, closer after half, flattened out, caught show. NORTH OF BALI settled off the pace, lacked
a closing response. MICHAEL'S MOON set the pace inside, gave way when headed. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION
AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
ZIPPING MOLLY in the second flight while off the rail, made a good move four wide to challenge into the lane, kicked well clear. MOR KISSES back off the
early pace, advanced three wide while the winning was circling to this one's outside into contention exiting the turn, proved no match for that one in the run
to the wire, second best. COME WHAT MAE off a step slow, fell back in the turn, rerallied to gain the show late, no threat to the top two. CANA GRIS lacked
early foot, moved closer from between foes late in the turn, chased the winner upper stretch then faltered to lose the place the final furlong. HART'S
PRETTY GIRL chased the leader while off the inside, closer turn, weakened in the drive. THAT IS AWESOME broke on top, cleared early, set the pace for
over four furlongs then caved in stretch.

KELLYS THE BOSS settled in the second flight while between foes, continued to pursue the winner off the inside, had little for the drive to trail home.
WATRUGONNADOKAREN sprinted quickly clear after the start, set the pace in the three path early, rated in the run up the backstretch while continuing off
the inside, maintained a daylight advantage into the stretch and held off the others under steady handling. BEYOND THE HYPE behind the pace while
along the inside, continued to track while saving ground into and through the final turn, cut the corner to be closest to the winner entering the stretch, could
do little with one through the lane, persevered for the place. MEAN AMERICAN widest of the second group, crept a bit closer turning into the stretch,
outkicked to the wire for the runner up position.

Footnotes
A MISS DEAMEANOR forwardly placed while off the inside, challenged between horses exiting the turn, took over, clear, held runnerup safe late under
steady handling. MOION in the second flight early, closer to challenge three wide and widest of the lead pack into the lane, stalled a bit to fall off the winner
a furlong out, getting back to that one late. KISSTER back off the early pace, got out a bit turning for home to float a couple of rivals out, set down for the
drive, mild late interest to the up late for the show. USAIN D'ORO sprinted clear soon after the start, vied inside the top two into the lane, failed to match
then to the wire, nipped late for the show. LIGHT FACE went one paced throughout while saving ground, lacked closing kick. LITTLEBITOFAQUEEN lacked
speed, floated out five wide turning for home, failed to muster a closing kick. MILITARY CHARM dwelt at the start, trailed, advanced far turn well wide,
floated out to the six path into the stretch, had nothing left for the run to the wire.

Footnotes
CANKTON'S COWGIRL away in good order, dueled off the inside, alternated up front into the lane, disposed of the other speed nearing the furlong marker,
clear, enough left to last. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA back off the pace while out in the strip, raced five wide through the turn, late run at the winner and was
closing the gap on that one late. COPPER MOON broke forwardly, dueled into the turn closest to the inside, continued on equal terms with the winner
through upper stretch, relented the final furlong, saved the show. RUNNING ARGUMENT back off the early pace, improved a bit through the turn, flattened
out the final furlong to lose the show. THAT'S MY MAMA lacked early foot after breaking back, improved a bit without posing a serious threat. KAN SHE
prompted the issue early from along the inside, began to fade after three furlongs. ADEN'S RANSOM lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, faded.

second spot the final furlong, no match for the winner. GRUNT broke back, behind the first fight, between horses into the stretch, up for the show. LIFE IS A
BANQUET moved up out of the chute to contest the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into and through much of the turn, began to falter with

JEFFROW unhurried early to be outside, moved closer after a half, ranged up outside turning for home, drifted in slightly to help put a tiring TOUCHDOWN
JOE in tight nearing the furlong marker, continued to drift in and brushed COFFEE COUNTY then outkicked that one in the final strides in a determined
effort. COFFEE COUNTY rank along the inside when behind the pace onto the backstretch, tracked the next three furlongs, between horses into the lane,
lugged out nearing the furlong marker to help put TOUCHDOWN JOE in tight, challenged, put a head in front as JEFFROW continued to drift in, brushed
with that foe, outgamed in the late going. TOUCHDOWN JOE pressed the early leader, vied into to the lane while in the three path, appeared to be tiring
when put in tight between the top two a furlong out, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. PEANUT N IKE broke sharp, quickly sprinted clear, set the
pace, responded briefly when challenged far turn then gave way when headed. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN

Footnotes
STARSHIP NOLA outrun for over a half along the inside, began to advance late in the turn, steered out three wide into the stretch when continuing to rally,
challenged soon after, kicked strongly clear under steady handling. ABBEY CAKES with the lead pack out of the chute outside, tracked four wide into the
turn, advanced and challenged into the lane outside the winner as that one came calling, proved no match for that one the final furlong, clearly second best.
C C LLAM closest to the leader up the backstretch,closer turn, vied late in the bend, then could not keep up with the top two in the drive. NANNY'S
HOUDINI void of speed, swung out four to five wide turning for home, improved a bit late without posing a serious threat. LAST PENALTY forwardly placed
early, began a steady fade after a half. RAGAZZA broke on top, set the early pace toward the inside, gave way when headed late in the turn.
