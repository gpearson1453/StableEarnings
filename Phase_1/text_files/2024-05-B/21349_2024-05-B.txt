Footnotes
DRIFTWOOD set the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, opened up well clear near the eighth pole and held safely in the final stages. WIND
TWIST chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. PERFECT PAINTING chased
the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. MALTHAEL raced three wide in the first turn, stalked the pace early on,
was in the two path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. MAMBA FOREVER was through after a half. CALLOWAY PEAK was a tad slow at
the start and trailed the field throughout.
