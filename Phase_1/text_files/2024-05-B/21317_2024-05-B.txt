STAND PROUD showed good speed to go to the front while being pressured by inside rival, edged away on the turn and drew off in the stretch under a
confident ride. MONEYSTRIKE hustled away to press the pace from the inside to near the three furlong marker and couldn't continue to match strides but
held on to be second best. CRUE'S N CONTROL stalked the pace from off the rail but was no match for the top two. REV TOO chased the top two while
saving ground to no avail. AOIDE was outrun.

Footnotes
BACK STREET BABY was slightly unsettled in the gate, then was allowed to settle around the first turn and steadily advanced up the rail through the final
turn then angled out at the top of the stretch to take aim at the leader and ran her down to be up in the final jump. IN B. J.'S HONOR rushed to the lead from
the inside and held that position to the top of the stretch and drew off but was ran down and nipped at the wire but was clearly second best. CHAPELLETE
raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail down the backstretch then moved between horses into the final turn and made a mild bid in the stretch to be
along for the show. EVERYLITTLESINGH prompted the pace from the two path through the final turn, lacked the late response and tired. DELIGHTFUL
HALO was unhurried down the backstretch then made a bid from four wide on the final turn but flattened out. WICKED SAINT stalked the pace from three
wide but was through early.

VORTEX roused to the front to set all the pace, inched away on the turn and drew off in the stretch to prove best. CLASSIC RUNNER pressed the pace
from two wide to the three furlong marker but couldn't match strides with the winner but proved to be a clear second. BIG FIG stalked the pace from four
wide down the backstretch then made a middle move on the turn and was best of the rest. COME ON COME ON vied for the lead from three wide to the
three furlong marker but lacked the late kick needed. PARTYINTHESTREETS raced off the pace from the inside but failed to menace. PERFECT STRIKE
stumbled leaving the starting gate and remained back. AWESOME CAJUN trailed the field and passed tired one in the stretch. MADMARTIGAN rushed up
the rail to be in the middle of the pack on the backstretch and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
IRONIT went to an unchallenged lead to set all the pace, pulled away on the final turn and prove much the best. TENACIOUS LADY was slightly fractious in
the gate then settled in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a looming four wide bid for the late rally to be second best. QUINN ELLA was
forwardly placed from two wide down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the final turn but failed to sustain that bid and was outfinished. CRYSTAL
CRESCENT was unhurried around the first turn then steadily advanced on the inside through the final turn, angled out to the two path in upper stretch for a
late run and missed the show. SWEET PERFECTION raced off the pace on the inside through the final turn and lacked the late response. TRIPLE L'S
CUTTER was slightly unsettled in the gate, then was allowed to settle around the first turn from three wide but was never a threat. GLANCE stalked the
pace from three or four wide to the final turn then retreated. SHE'S STORMING prompted the pace from off the rail to the final turn, weakened and dropped
back.

Footnotes
GET GUSSIED UP broke out and bumped inside rival leaving the gate, sprinted away to take a pressured lead throughout and just lasted to win the photo.
E R'S MIREYA hopped leaving the gate then was hustled along from four wide to press the pace while moving in to the two path, gave a late kick in late
stretch but lost the nod. MY IDEA bumped by rival leaving the gate then raced off the pace from two wide and was along for the show. LONG SHOT
LOUISE hesitated leaving the starting gate and trailed the field early, gained momentum from three wide around the turn and tipped out to five wide in the
stretch for a rally. INEZ was slightly unsettled in the starting gate then raced near the back and passed tiring rivals. QUITEGIRL showed no speed and
remained back. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY tracked the leaders from three wide through the turn and gave way in the stretch.
