SOUTH DECATUR was clear early and drew off in the stretch under a strong hand ride. YOU'RE FIRED bore out at the start, stalked the pace in the four
path and gained the place late. RICKY WANNABE was off awkwardly, rushed up to press the pace but was no match and shared the show spot with
SECRET RENDEZVOUS who stalked the pace in the five path and bid late. MY PAL GREG stalked the pace and gave way on the turn. BENNY'S DAY was
not a factor. GAZOOP stalked the early pace in the three path prior to giving way.
