launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. MINISTER OF SOUL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the

Footnotes
DISTORTED PRO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to get up for the win. SAM SEZ dueled on the inside through the opening
quarter, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and dug in to the wire, drifting out late and carrying DISTORED PRO with him a bit to
narrowly miss. GENERAL BATTLE AXE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three path and chased on from there. MIDNIGHT ROYAL trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn
and improved position in the stretch. JONNY B GONEY dueled on the outside early, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and faded in the
lane, racing in tight quarters as he dropped back. CAUGHT OFF GUARD bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the
rail for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, switched inside in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. SUPERSTAR
SWANK bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the
three path and made no bid. GOT GHOSTED tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane.
BIRDIE MACHINE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and was empty in the stretch.

early, saved ground around the bend, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. MARTINI BLU chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and kept on to the wire. IN THE ARCH raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter,
continued around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, switched inside in upper stretch and improved position from there. BOAT
SONG stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path and was outkicked in the lane. TENTH STREET DON
was away from the gate slowly, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, moved up from the two path coming around the turn and never
threatened. CITRUS BAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and faded in the stretch.
