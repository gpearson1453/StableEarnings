Footnotes
DEL MAR JERRY got bumped from outside in the beginning, chased the top pair from the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, surged clear midstretch
and won going away. JAMMING EDDY chased outside a rival in the two path, tipped out at the top of the lane and got up for second. HAPI HAPI trailed
from inside up the backstretch and around the turn, steered out widest in the stretch, finished well but missed second. HOT BOX broke in and bumped rival,
went up to take control with MARKS HIP applying pressure to the outside, maintained a slim lead through the turn, put that rival away in upper stretch but
was quickly confronted by DEL MAR JERRY at the eighth pole, yielded to that rival in midstretch and weakened late. UPWARD MOBILITY got bumped into
inner rival leaving the gate, was a bit chasing from off the pace, saved ground on the inside around the bend, moved out in the lane and could not rally.
MARKS HIP pressed the pace from outside to the stretch and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
IN THE AIR TONIGHT broke alertly then chased off the rail, rounded the bend four then three wide, was closest in pursuit of the leader with a furlong
remaining, put in a late bid and got up at the wire. THIRSTY MAMA broke a bit slow, was sent clear early, led two to three wide on the turn, remained
unchallenged to midstretch, threatened by IN THE AIR TONIGHT in the final sixteenth, fought gamely but got caught on the line. THIRSTY DESTINY broke
slow and inward, chased from inside into the turn, hugged the rail around the bend, continued within striking range through the lane but finished evenly late.
TROPICAL RAIN DAY off slow in the beginning, coaxed along chasing off the rail, went between rivals on the turn, got boxed in a bit late on the turn behind
the leader, roused in the lane and weakened in the late stages. SWEET ELLA RAE broke slow and shifted out, raced in range five wide into the turn, angled
down to the two path around the bend and failed to menace. LULA BELLA came away a bit slow, ran up on heels and checked at the seven-sixteenths pole,
went four to five wide around the bend and lacked a rally. DYIN A THIRST broke alertly, dropped back while steering from the three path to the rail around
the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

RUN FOR MY HONEY pressed the pace from inside, moved up even terms, inched ahead at the half-mile pole, cleared outer rival with three furlongs
remaining, drew away in upper stretch and widened through the final furlong under urging. HALF NELSON broke through the gate and was brought back to
be reloaded, broke alertly and took control outside RUN FOR MY HONEY early, dueled with that rival backstretch, failed to keep up early on the far turn,
chased three wide into the lane and churned on to best the rest. MIDNIGHT SILENCE stalked three deep or in the four path on the first turn, continued
outside rivals three wide into the second bend, spun four wide into the lane and gained the show. MISS KALINE stalked in the three path then between
rivals, rounded the far turn two then three wide and got outfinished for third. CROWN OF HOPE broke a bit slow and lost her path, chased near the inside
early on, eased over to the two path on the far turn, weakened in the lane and was eased in the furlong grounds, then walked off following the race.

GOLD FOOT stalked the top pair from the rail inside a rival, waited for room on the far turn, given his cue when finding an opening at the top of the stretch,
challenged inside several rivals at the eighth pole and edged away in the final sixteenth. GOLDENEYE unhurried in the early going, traveled near the back
in the two path, moved into range leaving the backstretch, eased out and bid four deep into the lane, put a head in front five deep at the eighth pole, drifted
in late and got outkicked by the winner. LAHAINA FLAVOR antsy in the gate, threw his head at the start to come away last, raced outside a rival at the back,
drew closer on the far turn, angled out in the lane and rallied for third. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) stalked the top pair outside a rival, bid three deep at the
quarter pole, fought four deep into the final furlong and got bothered a bit by GOLDENEYE drifting in late. MEGA MOON stumbled leaving the gate, went up
to take control and moved inside then dueled with SVENTEEN BLACK for command, battled that rival to the stretch, fought between foes in the final furlong
and yielded late. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT broke a step slow, reserved along the inside, moved into range on the far turn, tipped two wide in upper stretch,
came out further in the final furlong and needed to find more late. SEVENTEEN BLACK broke well and chased MEGA MOON for a bit before challenging for
command from outside, fought through the far turn and into the lane, stayed in contention with a sixteenth remaining and weakened late.

Footnotes
LIL' BIT BOSSY bobbled and bumped with inner rival at the start, chased three deep and got bumped from inside into the turn, moved into the two path
quickly on the turn, bid from outside entering the lane, drifted in midstretch, then dug in the final sixteenth to take over and held off the runner-up. PAVEL'S
ETOILE off slow in the beginning, tracked outside a rival, tipped three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, launched a late bid but ran out of time.
SWIFT HARMONY off alertly to grab the lead, showed the way on the rail through the bend, pressured by LIL' BIT BOSSY exiting the turn, resisted to the
sixteenth pole and yielded late. THIRSTY IN VEGAS brushed the gate and broke in a bit, steadied off the heels of the leader early, bumped with outer rival
entering the turn, continued to give chase from the rail under urging, tipped two wide into the lane and kept on for a minor award. GOBERNADORA ELY
chased in range from outside, took the turn three wide and lacked a bid. CHATTY LEROYBROWN hesitated and came away slow, chased along the inside
and started to climb, shifted out at the quarter pole, went two wide into the lane and failed to menace. GRACIE'S BIG DAY bumped with outer rival leaving
the gate, chased between foes leaving the backstretch and got bumped on both sides entering the turn, dropped back and moved inside, cut the corner into
the lane, steered off the fence in the stretch and lacked further response. UNBRIDLED BRIDE hesitated and came away slowest of all, trailed two wide to
the stretch and never got involved.

FLASHIEST unhurried in the early stages in the two path, remained in the two path through the far turn, rallied between rivals midstretch and bested
DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) in the final sixteenth. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) sat well off the pace in the two path to the far turn, tipped three wide around
that bend, moved out further in the lane, collared the leader past the eighth pole but got outclosed by the winner in deep stretch. LIVING LIFE tucked inside
at the back early, tipped out into the stretch, angled out further and was along for the show honors. REIQUIST settled off the pace along the inside, gained
two wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and got outkicked by the top trio. STANDING O showed the way early with MUBTADAA pressing
from outside, cleared that rival on the backstretch, remained clear through the far turn, tried to shake loose in upper stretch but was reeled in past the eighth
pole and folded once overtaken. LEGISLATOR saved ground off the pace to the stretch and could not rally. MUBTADAA stumbled badly leaving the gate,
went up to press from outside, lost contact with the leader but remained close up on the backstretch far turn, stayed within striking distance to upper stretch,
then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RUMBLE KING broke out and bumped with GO GO PRANCER twice then got bumped again after a couple strides, chased three wide into the turn, moved
into the two path around the bend then angled back out and came four wide into the stretch, closed well through the lane and overhauled the top trio late.
CHARMZ AWAY bumped with inner rival at the start, chased four wide through the turn, bid outside the top pair in upper stretch, fought gamely to the wire
but was outkicked by the winner. I'M A BAD BOY came away well then dueled inside GO GO PRANCER for command, raced a bit off the rail into the lane,
battled inside a pair of rivals down the stretch and yielded grudgingly late. GO GO PRANCER got pinballed leaving the gate and bumped again lightly with
the winner shortly after, went up to fight for the lead outside I'M A BAD BOY, fought between rivals in the stretch and weakened late. INFAMOUS ANGEL off
slow from inside, chased out of range early, moved into striking distance along the fence but could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch.
WILLISAU was off slow to begin and climbed a bit while trailing, saved ground through the turn, moved off the rail in the lane and failed to menace.
PANUCO coaxed from the gate, chased two wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail on the turn, tipped three wide into the lane and weakened.
WHISKEYINATEACUP broke well and chased in range from outside, dropped back five then four wide on the turn and never responded to urging.

Footnotes
LOTERIE (IRE) traveled in mid-pack two wide then along the rail, moved closer on the backstretch, went between rival at the quarter pole, angled out into
the lane, challenged with a furlong remaining and drove clear. SHE'Z THE LAW tracked from the two path or outside a rival, eased out a bit and took aim
three wide on the far turn, put a head in front in upper stretch and yielded late. WILLA T chased outside a rival then three and four deep on the clubhouse
turn, made progress three then four deep again on the second bend, challenged in the final furlong and gained the show honors. ASHLEY broke well then
ceded command to the pacesetter, stalked three then two wide outside a rival early, took aim two wide leaving the far turn, bid between foes in upper stretch
and got outkicked. SWEET DELTA DAWN forwardly placed from inside early, followed behind the leader while continuing to save ground to the stretch,
launched a bid from the fence and also got outkicked. BLUE FASHION broke a step slow and got forced in leaving the gate, unhurried along the fence then
moved into the two path, trailed into the far turn, went outside a pair of rivals on the far turn and could not threaten late. SWEET GEM cleared in the two
path then moved inside, set all the pace to the top of the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. RUNYON CANYON broke
inward to bother BLUE FASHION, reserved in the early going and tucked inside, roused leaving the far turn, lacked room from upper stretch to the sixteenth
pole and had little time left to rally. POPPY'S JOY reserved in the three path early, asked two wide on the far turn, paused in upper stretch and could not
rally. DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) settled in the two path then between rivals, went three wide into the backstretch, trailed to the half-mile pole, chased four
deep into the far turn, spun five wide into the lane and weakened.

ADARE MANOR took control quickly and moved into the two path, showed the way to the far turn, remained clear into the lane, drew away in upper stretch
under hand urging and coaxed in the last sixteenth. COFFEE IN BED tracked in range from the two path to the far turn, chased three deep at the quarter
pole, offered a mild response to urging and edged HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN for the place honors. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN stalked ADARE MANOR along
the inside, tipped out at the quarter pole, could not make any headway on the winner in the stretch and lost second. SUPER SHINE (ARG) stalked the lone
leader from three path early, raced up close to the outside on the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the far turn, drifted to the inside in upper

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO stepped to the front, showed the way two wide into the turn, shifted to the inside crossing back onto the grass, kicked clear in upper
stretch, remained unchallenged into deep stretch and held over the late run from the runner-up. FIRST PEACE had his path taken by MUCHO DEL ORO
and was forced to steady early, chased two to three wide on the turn, chased within striking range at the sixteenth pole, launched a late bid but could not get
by the winner. ALMENDARES (GB) brushed the gate, reserved in the early going then began to pull approaching the turn while moving inside, angled out to
the four path around the bend, finished willingly down the lane and gained third. JOHNNY PODRES settled off the pace, went three wide into turn, got
moved out to the five path crossing the dirt, kept on determinedly from outside in the final furlong but got outkicked for the show honors. LANE WAY stalked
four deep early then outside a pair of rivals into the turn, came two wide into the drive and weakened between foes in the late stages. NINEELEVENTURBO
bumped with inner rival and bobbled at the start, trailed a bit off the rail into the turn, tipped out crossing surfaces and improved position late. DANIEL'S
MAGIC stalked between rivals then two wide on the turn, found traffic in upper stretch, moved to the fence and could not rally. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN
brushed the gate, stalked from inside, roused late on the bend, lacked room when the leader took his path crossing the dirt, stayed within range to
midstretch, then weakened in the final sixteenth. ASTRONOMER bumped with outer rival in the beginning, settled off the pace, chased two wide into the
turn, moved to the inside around the bend, moved off the fence entering the stretch and was not a factor.
