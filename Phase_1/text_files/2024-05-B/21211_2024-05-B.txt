BURN THE EVIDENCE pursued the loose pacesetter, bid into the stretch, led at the eighth pole and edged away. JACKSON ROAD chased off the pace
between rivals, faded on the turn then came again to gain place. TATUM set clear pace along the inside, was collared in midstretch and yielded in the final
furlong. PRIVATE CABANA was urged just off the leaders inside then flattened out in the stretch. WHO KNOWS moved close up outside to midway on the
turn and gave way. RUMAWAY broke slowest, raced far behind and was never a factor. TRAVEL GUIDE lacked speed, drifted very wide on the turn and
retreated.

LOVE TO EAT controlled the pace, widened in the stretch and was never menaced while kept to urging. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK lacked speed, advanced
in the two path with a gradual late gain while no threat to the winner. NATURE'S CANDY pressed the winner outside to the stretch and weakened. GRACE
REFORMED trailed for half mile, rallied wide and finished strongly too late. MERRYCHILL saved ground close up to the far turn and gave way. WILD GIRL
flashed speed then stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

BURNING EMBERS quickly moved clear, repelled a challenge on the turn and edged away well off the inside while kept to a drive. DIANE'S MERLOT
settled just off pace inside, bid on the turn then went evenly late. BAILINTIN lacked speed then advanced four wide with some late energy. NEIGHBELLINE
moved close up three wide then flattened out in the stretch. NAMORA broke sluggishly, chased inside and was no factor. DUELA DENT prompted the
winner outside down the backstretch and faltered. JODY'S RUBY dropped back early three wide and was never in contention. HONORABLE CHILL rushed
up inside, went after the winner on the turn then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
CUPID'S DUDE settled close up inside, angled out in advancing into the stretch, led late and just lasted. BATTER UP BUD trailed far behind for five
furlongs, rallied very wide and surged just missing. JEWELS IN THE BAY prompted the pace, led at the quarter pole then weakened slightly late.
CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED raced off the pace, moved five wide into the stretch with a mild rally. FERRARI KID set a pressured pace inside to midway on
the final turn and tired. ZAMBONI WARRIOR forced the leaders three wide for three quarters and weakened. WINGED FOOT saved ground close up then
began fading before half a mile.

RESPECTFULLY quickly moved clear, widened in the stretch and remained clear while never seriously threatened. GOLD MEDAL ANNA settled off the
pace inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well with a gradual gain. DANCING ON MY OWN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued
gamely. TURN ON THE CHARM raced wide off the leaders and lacked a rally. MARY Q chased off the pace four wide and was never in contention.
GAMESTONKS stumbled badly at the start and trailed throughout.
