Footnotes
JUSTTHEFACTSJACK was hustled to the front, controlled the action on a clear advantage with her ears forward, cruised around the turn in the two path,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, extended the advantage while put to a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was flagged with the crop into
the final sixteenth and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride to the finish. PATTY BROWN EYES broke very fast then chased the pace, moved out
near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the three path, pursued the winner under the crop into upper stretch, chased that foe in the drive and was
second best. REFUSE TO LOSE broke a half-step slow then was taken in hand briefly, moved up some under urging, chased inside on the turn and tired
while best of the rest. LESLIE'S HUMOR was rated behind horses while taking a lot of kickback, remained behind horses while in the three path for most of
the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole then was roused into the stretch and failed to rally. SHINY LURE brushed the outside of the gate
and was off a half-step slow, was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the five path and came up empty. COIF tracked the pace on the
outside, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
SACRED WISH coaxed from the gate, raced three wide into the first turn before quickly tucking to the two path and then along the rail, showed the way in
hand along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to
prevail. SWOOP TO FINISH coaxed from the gate, got pinched back after the start by BREATH AWAY, tracked the pace along the inside and was on hold
until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. MALLEYMOO tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. BREATH AWAY (GB) came in after the start
pinching back SWOOP TO FINISH, raced three then two wide through the first turn, tracked just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. ELYSIAN FIELD coaxed from the start, got floated four wide into the first turn
when SACRED WISH remained in the three path to her inside, steadily tucked three then two wide before making her way into the backstretch, tracked the
leader from the two path in closest aim, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages.

FLASHY ALEX showed speed then stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four path on the turn, gained to take a short lead in upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, responded well to multiple challengers into the final
sixteenth and held under strong urging. PAPI ON ICE moved out while settling at the rear, dropped from the four path to the two path under urging early on
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths pole in the three path, spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed
strongly while lugging in some under extra right-rein pressure and just missed while up for the place. OPPORTUNITY SET showed speed then set the pace,
vied inside on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought on gamely in the final furlong but
missed while able to get the show. PHANTOM JEWEL broke out then brushed the gate and was off a step slow, settled on the outside, chased four then
five wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly but missed the trifecta. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE settled under some
urging, was roused in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the vanguard to the finish and just missed the superfecta.
GAME MISCONDUCT settled off the pace then moved in, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed
response. DEPUTY CONNECT settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the turn and was no
factor.

POSEIDON'S MIST coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun two to
three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the eighth pole, inched away briefly, then dug in and held safe over a late closing rival.
MOONLIT WEEKEND brushed the near side stall at the start, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. FRANNIE LEW established the
front and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, took back to the rail
straightened away, dug in under threat to the outside and was collared inside the eighth pole, ran on to the finish to preserve the show honors on the wire.
DOLCE SERA coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. PAUCILOQUENT struck the near side stall at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ALLEY'S SONG raced four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped six
wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE SHAKE was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, gained in upper stretch, took the lead under a hand-ride at
the furlong marker and proved best under confident handling to the finish. HONORARY DEGREE moved up to get the lead inside the three-quarter pole,
went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner at the
furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place. CAJUN CASANOVA moved in while going to the front early, chased the pace after losing the
lead inside the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the three path and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. PRINCE OF JOY
settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. JOKER BOY was urged along off the
pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DATESFREEDOM settled early then came under urging, moved up
near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. ANYTHING PAZIBLE was taken up while squeezed back between horses after the
start, raced at the rear under urging, went around the turn in the four path and trailed.

Footnotes
TURF KING (IRE) broke in at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out and seized command near the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish
geared down late. GRAND SONATA grew a bit fractious and broke through the gate prior to the start inspiring PIONEERING SPIRIT to do the same,
tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up
a mild kick to secure the place honors. BIG EVEREST (GB) prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide, advanced to take command swinging
three wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught near the sixteenth pole, kept on to preserve
the show honors. MAKER'S CANDY tracked the front just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, had lost some position to the eighth pole and stayed on one paced to procure the last major share. DISARMED tracked the pace along the
inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CLOUDY got bumped after
the start by KALIK, who recovered outwards from a stumble, chased along the inside and then just off the inside, got set down spinning two to three wide
into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. PIONEERING SPIRIT broke through the gate just after GRAND SONATA did so and was reloaded prior to the
start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CALL ME
HARRY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits under prompting from BIG
EVEREST to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the
final furlong. KALIK stumbled at the start recovering into CLOUDY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. STOLEN BASE chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
weakened.

Footnotes
BOSS TWEED went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked in the two path at
the quarter-pole, showed strong acceleration while kicking clear in upper stretch, drew off under a strong hand-ride until the sixteenth-pole then was eased
up while much the best. FOUR EYES bumped with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, was urged along towards the rear, dropped from the four path
to the two path early on the turn, moved to the three then five path late on that bend, came seven wide into the stretch and got up for the place. SPOOFY
broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of
the rest. YOU BEAUT pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and tired. FRATELLINO
was well placed in third position, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.
EXCALIBRATE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand briefly before coming back under urging, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and
also came up empty. SPOKEN BLUNTLY broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path and failed
to respond. QOROKWE broke in the air and was off a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch then moved further out and was no factor.
