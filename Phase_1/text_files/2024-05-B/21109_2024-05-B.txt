Footnotes
OUR BET stalked the pace while racing in hand to the turn, moved up to vie three across through the stretch and got up in the final strides to prove best.
GRACE THE LADY ran alongside of the pacesetter to the turn, challenged for the lead, dueled between horses through the stretch and was outfnished in a
good effort. SAYAAD AIN'T SO set a pressured pace, responded to duel when challenged and was outclosed. PEARL'S CODE saved ground while racing
close to the pace, lacked the needed rally and failed to menace. VA VOOM got away well, raced five wide to the turn and lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
SIDETOWN was sent to the front to set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. MISTER CHAIRMAN trailed the
field while never far back, angled out own the turn, went widest in the drive, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up at the wire for place.
MISTER WAYSIDE pressed the pace along the rail, backed up on the turn, altered course at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and was caught for
second. HARD CANDY stalked the pace while racing three wide, fell back on the turn, closed steadily and narrowed the gap. TIM'S BUDDY was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
TALKIN CADEE pressed the pace three wide, challenged for the lead leaving the turn, dueled to deep stretch and drew clear. BIG UN moved up along the
rail on the backstretch to assume command, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, yielded late and finished second best. GOSPEL B. HAVIOR
was unhurried early, raced outside, advanced on the turn, was crowded in the upper stretch, shied from the whip in the drive to have an uneven course and
earned show. RAINBOW SMILES broke slowly, trailed the field, offered a mild bid and passed a tiring rival. GOSPEL CHARITY led to the backstretch, vied
to the second turn, fell back, angled out for the drive and came up empty late.

KISSOFTHENILE settled off the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was ridden out. SUPERHERO was taken outside early,
rallied on the turn, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. EMPYREAL SHADOW earned show in a steady effort while no threat to the top
two and was best of the rest. GOSPEL PREACHER was slow early, went widest in the drive and failed to threaten in an even effort. CRUE'S N CONTROL
broke slowly, raced wide early, angled in, advanced on the turn and lacked a closing response. GOSPEL FOREST sprinted clear, was used up early and
stopped.

WEST COAST FASHION got away well to set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held under steady urging. EUTYCHIA pressed the
pace, bid willingly, couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a game effort. PURE CONNECTION was off a step slowly, hustled along to get an
inside position, stalked the pace, got through along the rail leaving the turn, bid to loom a threat, hung late and settled for show. ANGEL ON FIRE raced
close to the pace, lacked a stretch response and failed to menace. FREYAS CATZ trailed the field.

close to the pace, challenged between horses on the second turn, fell back and held for place. LIGHT THE CODE broke in the air to be off a step slowly,
moved up on the backstretch to challenge for the lead, fell back, closed through traffic and earned show. BROWN RESERVE set the pace to the second
turn and flattened out. I BE A KING bumped at the start, raced close to the pace towards the outside, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. GOSPEL

and drew clear. MISSING CODE vied inside to late stretch, was outclosed and all out for place. RACHEL'S CAPER vied three across to late stretch, was
outclosed and outnodded for second. RED MOUNTAIN bumped mildly at the start, stalked the pace, bid six wide and finished well. MR PELOTON bumped
mildly at the start, vied between horses past the eighth pole and was unable to sustain his bid. HOPGUN veered out at the start, stalked the pace while
racing outside, went seven wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. GRANDSONSAM trailed the field in an outside trip, offered a mild bid only
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NOMOREMRNICEGUY was unhurried early, rallied into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late.
DEL MOON pressed the pace while racing three across, challenged for the lead on the turn, inched clear mid stretch and was caught late in a good effort.
UNITED PATRIOT set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel, didn't have enough late and held safely for show. FATHER PATRICK broke
in and bumped at the start, saved ground mid pack, bid along the rail leaving the turn and lacked the needed rally. RIVER LIBERTY pressed the pace
between horses to the second turn, fell back and leveled off. WAVERUNNER failed to threaten in an even effort. LIMBO'S PROMISE bumped at the start,
stalked the pace while racing outside, swung wide entering the stretch, tired and gave way. CHARING CROSS came in at the start and was not a factor.
