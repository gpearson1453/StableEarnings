Footnotes
OWN THE TOWN prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch, dueled through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch under right handed urging then
dug in gamely through the final strides to prevail by a narrow margin. MORE THAN GOOD pressed the pace two wide, matched strides through the turn,
shifted outside the winner at the top of the stretch then came on again late and just missed. GRAND DEAL drifted out bumping DIXIE GIANT into
UNIDENTIFIED MAN shortly after the start, trailed into the stretch, swung wide and had a mild late rally. DIXIE GIANT was bumped shortly after the start,
sped to the lead, set a pressured pace for nearly a half then weakened. UNIDENTIFIED MAN also bumped soon after the start, was squeezed between
horses causing his rider to check near the five furlongs marker, moved closer two wide on the turn then faded. JACK'S ADVANTAGE vied for the lead along
the inside and lacked the needed response. CHACO SPIRIT failed to menace.

under a hand ride while drifting inward nearing the wire. FAIR AND SQUARE away alertly, set a pressured pace until deep stretch, drifted out a bit under left
handed urging then couldn't handle the winner. I WANNA WIN vied for the lead along the inside and finished with good courage. UPTOWN pressed the
pace two then three wide until deep stretch and checked inside the winner nearing the wire while being outfinished. OAKS HONEY failed to menace.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path under right handed urging and wore down rivals in a game effort. LUCKY
STREAK never far back, loomed boldly outside the winner in upper stretch but finished second best. POWERFUL MOON battled along the inside with the
winner until mid stretch then faded. KERANOS failed to menace. MR LOOOCH had speed along the inside through the turn then weakened. CORNER
OFFICE well placed, failed to respond. ORO DE MORO MORO trailed.
