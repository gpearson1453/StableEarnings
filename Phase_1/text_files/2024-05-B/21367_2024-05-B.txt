Footnotes
SUMMER SHANDEE saved ground prompting MOON TIME, moved up along the inside to gain a slight lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that one
from the point and prevailed in a stiff drive. MOON TIME set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed by SUMMER SHANDEE, battled
with that one to the wire but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. PLAYOFF BOUND was closed up early racing between horses, angled out out to be
three-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid and then flattened out late. MY SUNSHINE was prominently placed for a half mile while three-wide and
weakened.

Footnotes
MOVE OVER (GB) was close-up early while racing in tight, found room nearing the half mile pole, took a slight lead nearing the quarter pole then dueled
with CREATIVE BID from that point and was all out to prove narrowly best in a stiff drive. CREATIVE BID prompted STEPHEN JAME from along the
outside, moved three-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid then dueled for the lead from that point and just missed in a game effort. BERNALINHO
was reserved off the early pace, swung out to be four-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. STEPHEN JAMES saved ground setting the early
pace under pressured, drifted out slightly nearing the half mile pole then continued for disputed the issue to near the stretch and weakened. MARCH ON
LINCH was allowed to settle early while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked.

ROCKIT A DAY saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. I'M TELLING MOM was off a step slow, then angled out to move forward
on the turn while racing four-wide and finished strongly for the place. MY QUIET PLACE prompted the issue from along the outside and held on well for
third. SHE'S A KRAKEN saved ground stalking the pace, angled out nearing the eighth pole but lacked a rally. PARKER'S FIFTEEN was reserved off the
early pace, came five-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. LUTES SEA GYPSY dropped back early and trailed.

Footnotes
ATTA BOY LLOYD broke out to brush with LETSGOTOTHEAR then quickly sprinted clear, settled into the stretch with a clear lead while drifting out slightly
and was fully extended to prevail. STREET MOGUL saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through nearing the stretch and finished fast.
MONGOLIAN SPRING broke in then chased ATTA BOY LLOYD while racing two-wide and finished fairly well for third in a steady effort. EARTHLY TIGER
was pinched back shortly after the start then saved ground while being unhurried and improved his position late. LETSGOTOTHEBAR was brushed at the
start then dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to seriously threaten. FIRST ENDEAVOR was pinched back shortly after the start
then reserved off the pace while racing three-wide and failed to menace. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A REVIEW INTO THE START OF THE RACE
BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED IT WAS MUTUAL CONTACT AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
