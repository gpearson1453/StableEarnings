SHEWEARSMYRING stalked the pace while saving ground along the rail, responded under right handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch inside the
winner and prevailed under strong handling. LIAM'S LASS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, got out through the clubhouse turn, drifted to the four
path in upper stretch, maintained the advantage until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. GRACIE DANCE unhurried early, swung wide and
closed ground late four wide in the eight path. SICILIAN STYLE TWO chased the pace two then three wide into the stretch and was outfinished while in the
six path. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN was bumped at the start and outrun. DELOVELY broke outward bumping JACK'S YACHT QUEEN at the start and was no
threat.

ORLEANS STORM rushed up between horses three wide to make the lead before a quarter, set the balance of the pace, edged clear in upper stretch under
right handed urging and lasted under a strong hand ride. BIG TIME FLIRT close up along the inside, altered course four wide at the top of the stretch, rallied
determinedly in the seven path and missed by a narrow margin. MY HOMBRE away in front, set the pace for nearly a quarter, kept pressure along the
inside through the turn, kept on through the stretch but was outfinished. PLAYING BALL trailed through the turn and found his best stride late along the rail.
KETTLE KING raced outside and failed to menace. AGNELLO CITY chased the winner three wide and faded in the stretch.

MO SNOW forwardly placed while hung five wide down the backstretch, rallied four wide through the turn, engaged the leader in the five path nearing mid
stretch, drifted in under left handed urging bumping the winner late and just got up by a narrow margin. JIMMY JUNGA sprinted to a clear lead soon after
the start, set the pace into the stretch, dug in gamely when joined by the winner, was bumped nearing the wire and just missed. TURBO TRIP chased the
early pace, bid two wide into the turn then leveled off. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY went evenly. HEY HEY GOODBYE failed to menace. BIG POPPER was no
factor. ALWAYS SPRING bore out at the start and has brief speed. BOOYAH settled mid pack and lacked the needed response. CAMILAS WARRIOR
broke inward, had speed through the turn then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF JIMMY JUNGA LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED MO SNOW AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

REAL NAUGHTY dueled for the lead two wide past the quarter pole, shook clear entering the stretch, set the balance of the pace and prevailed under a
strong hand ride. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY stalked the pace along the inside through the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch and finished with
good courage while clear for second. EL BANDIDO found his best stride late inside. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF failed to menace. AURA OF GOLD raced
outside down the backstretch, inside through the turn and had no rally. DESTINO was no factor. BRION battled for the lead along the inside to the quarter
pole then was used up. COURTHOUSE COVE had speed into the turn three wide then stopped.

Footnotes
QUICK QUICK WHIT stalked the pace in the four path through the turn, drifted out to the six path entering the stretch, responded with a burst of speed
under left handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch and won going away. MEXITEXAFORNIA battled for the lead two wide for a half, shook clear in
upper stretch, maintained his advantage until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. LORD MARXMAN unhurried early, found his best stride late
outside. TAP VALLEY dueled then pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then faded. IT'S ABOUT TIME was fractious in the gate, broke slowly then
passed tiring rivals late along the inside. SKYPASS wouldn't load, was also fractious in the gate then no factor. PANTHERA'S FATE battled for the lead
along the inside and was through after a half. BUMPKIN was outrun.
