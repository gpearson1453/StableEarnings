Footnotes
SUGA STEVE disputed the pace outside BOX N BEN, asserted himself in mid stretch and drew clear under urging. BOX N BEN hugged the inner rail,
dueled with the winner and weakened late. VESELSKY saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path for the drive and failed to rally. WEMBY , three
wide on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. BOLD HONOR , steadied when squeezed back entering the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch
and was no factor. PERSPICACIOUS BOY , well placed along the inner rail around the turn, gave way and was eased late. THRUSTER trailed.

outside a rival, gained command nearing mid stretch, edged away a bit, failed to contain the winner in deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. BOX OF
ROCKETS rushed up between foes early then checked, swung well wide for the drive and rallied. COUSIN GIORGOS flashed speed inside foes then
jumped track in the opening sixteenth, was shuffled into the turn, eased outward and kept on with interest. CORRECTED PEDIGREE , inside, steadied
nearing the turn, angled out and offered a mild run. SAIL ON HOME had belated action. TRUE ACCOUNT was not a factor. KINDA FONDA WANDA , off
slowly, saved ground mid turn and failed to menace. ACT LIVELY chased between foes and weakened in upper stretch. MISCHIEF EXPOSED set a
pressured pace inside, ceded command nearing mid stretch and weakened. TEAR IT UP , three deep, pursued around the turn then tired.

Footnotes
WON AN AWARD prompted the pace outside the leader, went on the attack leaving the three eighths, wrested command in upper stretch, kicked clear
under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert. COME RAIN OR SHINE rated off the rail and behind foes, tipped three wide nearing the lane,
moved up to loom past mid stretch, kept on willingly but had to settle for second. STARLIFTER checked early, saved ground into the far turn, angled out and
churned on. ENZO , headstrong on the early lead, set the pace towards the inside, sparred inside the winner into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch
then faded. OWHATANITE , between foes into the far turn, angled out but lacked a rally. MORTAL SIN , inside stalking, eased out under pressure for the
drive and faded. LONGWORTH stumbled when in tight in the opening furlong, regrouped to save ground but lacked a rally. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE ,
between foes into the far turn, was not a factor. KISSTHEMOON was not a factor. SHERIFF JOE stalked the early pace, was under pressure three wide
between foes near the quarter pole and gave way. DOMINGUEZ broke in the air and also grazed the gate, recovered then lost ground four wide while
moving up, appeared to jump tracked near the five eighths and gave way. WHITE SERIES , keen outside a rival stalking the early pace, faltered before
going six furlongs.

DANCE FOR GREEN showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to the stretch, drifted out a bit and pulled away while kept to his business. MISTER AGENT
, steadied in close quarters along the rail about a sixteenth of a mile after the break, saved ground on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied. THE
ICE MAN CARLOS disputed the pace outside the winner and weakened. ONE WAY FARRIOR broke slowly, swung wide entering the stretch, failed to rally
and drifted in near the eighth pole.

PARK PLACE was sent hard and took command between foes, dropped in after clearing, responded when shaken up in upper stretch, widened in mid
stretch and held firm under a drive. SWITZER drafted back between rivals early, settled inside, worked outward leaving the three sixteenths and finished
strong. ABUELO PAPS , three deep early, gave hard chase into the lane and faded. KBCYA LATER had speed to the inside of the winner, eased out and
pursued two wide into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then faded. CLAUDEE BOY was forced out entering the turn. FLASH IS BACK saved ground and
came up empty. SPEAKERIT was checked and forced out near the three eighths. DREAM RIVER chased between runners, checked and altered out
nearing the turn and gave way. BARON'S LEGACY , wide, jumped tracks near the half then was taken up sharply and altered out into the turn. MOONSET
steadied at the break, moved up between foes then angled in then lost his rider after jumping tracks nearing the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
run into the turn. No action was taken.
