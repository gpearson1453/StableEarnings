Footnotes
ROCKALL was hard to load, then stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn to run down the leaders
and cleared late. ROULETTE was reluctant to load into the starting gate, then vied for the lead from two wide to the top of the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. SLEW CITY HENRY broke well then settled near the back through the final turn then slipped through into the stretch then angled out to four
wide at the eighth pole and made a late rally to be up for the show. STATLER went to the front to set the pressured pace to mid stretch and weakened late.
JUST BE HAPPY raced near the back from two wide and was never a threat. BOLIVER raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a mild bid
but lacked room and dropped back.

FROSTY FLIRT vied for the lead from the two path around the first turn then settled off the pace through the final turn, moved out to three wide in upper
stretch for a late run at the leaders and was just up. PAT HAND GIRL stalked the pace from off the rail down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on
the final turn to take the lead at the top of the stretch and pulled clear but was caught in the final jumps. SASSY SAGEY went to the lead to set most of the
pace then was challenged midway through the final turn and fought gamely down the stretch. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO was allowed to settle near the back
and was not a factor. BEYOND THE HYPE was unhurried to the first turn while saving ground to no avail. BATTY was allowed to settle in the middle of the

Footnotes
DRIED PEPPER was fractious in the gate and popped it open prestart, settled off the pace down the backstretch then took command going into the final
turn and drew off in the stretch. MAU MAU was forwardly placed from three wide down the backstretch then moved up to press the pace around the final
turn but couldn't match strides with the winner and proved second best. SHAMAYIM bumped with FEDERAL HILL leaving the gate, settled off the pace
down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn but flattened out. BIZZY LEGS raced near the back through the final turn then made a five wide
bid in upper stretch for the late gain. FEDERAL HILL bumped with SHAMAYIM leaving the gate, saved ground through out, moved up on the final turn while
racing evenly. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN raced near the back throughout and was never a factor. COMPUTATION went to a clear lead for a half then
retreated.

never a threat. DON'T BLINK TWICE was forwardly placed from two or three wide to the turn then retreated. KERRIGAN'S TOUCH was off slow and
