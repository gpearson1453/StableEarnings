Footnotes
DELIGHTFUL FLAME was hustled to the front, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, controlled the action in the two path on the turn,
extended the advantage in the four path into upper stretch, was let out a touch near the three-sixteenths pole and drew off under a mild hand-ride to win
handily. MOONLIGHT PROMISES was hustled from the gate, pressed then chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, spun six
wide into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TRIPLE SWEET dropped back while moving out and climbing into
kickback, fell well off the pace, rounded the turn in the four path, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed
response while able to secure the show. THE SUGARS broke a bit slow, was urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and
failed to threaten. LUCKFORYOU was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
VOLEUSE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the
sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish. NEWSDLEY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under pressure from
PERPETUAL PRAISE to the outside and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and got
collared near the sixteenth marker, ran on to preserve the place honors. PERPETUAL PRAISE coaxed from the start, raced inside briefly before tipping out
to the three path after NEWSDLEY tucked to the two path, raced in closest aim of that rival before advancing to prompt that foe from the outside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to procure the show honors. FOXY
CARA struck the off side stall at the start when breaking outwards, chased five then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BIG HAZEL brushed the off side stall at the start, chased two to three wide until tucked inside into the turn,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and offered no response.

pace, came under urging while inside to the two path for most of the turn, shifted to the three then four path late on that bend, chased into upper stretch,
gained to make a bid approaching the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and earned the place while no match for the winner. FOCUS POCUS

advanced under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped to the two path midway, continued to advanced taking command just outside the quarter pole,
swung five wide into upper stretch, drifted one path straightened away and went clear under a drive, then got geared down inside the final seventy yards to
the finish. EVERLYS GIRL lunged at the break, prompted the pace three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one, weakened in the late stages while up for the place honors. WILLFUL DESIRE hustled from the gate, showed the way
coaxed from the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, got collared by the top one just outside the quarter pole and swung four to
five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. AWESOME ANNMARIE tossed her head at the break and grew rank at the start forcing the rider to
be against her mouth and stargazed tossing her head while conceding at minimum eight to ten lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to
four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper

Footnotes
GOLDEN DEGREE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, cruised to the front then opened up a sizable advantage under her own power, extended
the advantage in the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, had the rider take a peek behind him inside the three-sixteenths pole, widened
even more into the final furlong and won easily. ADDRESSABLE MARKET (IRE) broke in at the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground
on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and narrowly earned the place. THAT'STHEFACTJACK veered out at the start then bumped with a foe, angled out
early, chased the pace then dropped well behind the leader, went three then four wide on the turn and lost the place. CISNEY broke out then bumped with
an opponent and was off a bit slow, raced on the outside under urging, dropped to the rear late on the backstretch, went five then four wide on the turn and
showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, THERE WAS NO CHANGE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

DONEGAL MOMENTUM coaxed from the gate, vied from the three path between foes down the backstretch before emerging at the seven-sixteenths in
tandem with LIGHT THE WAY to his inside, dueled from three path through the turn with that rival and swung four then three wide into upper stretch seizing
command straightened away, then went clear under a light drive before being geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish and prevailed comfortably
on the wire. TREATY OBLIGATION brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to
six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, ran on to secure the place honors. LIGHT THE WAY lunged at the start, vied from the two path
inside a pair down the backstretch and then dueled with the top one through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was displaced from
command straightened away, weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. ARTETA coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. ORIGINAL IDEA coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed
tired rivals. DEPUTY MISCHIEF stumbled after the start, chased just off the inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. DIVER chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. DRUNK ON SAKE broke out at the start and was corrected, vied from the four path
outside a pair down the backstretch, got shaken off at the seven-sixteenths and tucked three wide, faded and swung four wide for home and folded in the
stretch.

CALL HER BLUFF broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, angled in with five furlongs to run, raced inside under urging for most of the turn then
shifted to the two path, came out into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the furlong marker, took a short lead in the final sixteenth, fought with the
runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BARONESS BOURBON was bumped at the start then taken up while in tight between
horses, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along near the back, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, came off the rail into upper
stretch, rallied inside of foes to make a bid in the final sixteenth, battled with the winner to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. NEXT ON
STAGE went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, was asked while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, came under
heavy pressure in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole but was caught while just able to get
the show. LA VITA SOFIA prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth,
raced between foes at that point, fought on to the finish but just missed the show. KEEP IT SEXY broke out and bumped with a foe, stalked the pace, was
urged along in the four path on the turn and tired. KAREN'S HONOR tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along in the five path on the turn, remained
on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to respond. FROM HELLO broke out and hit the gate, dropped
well off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
TIL THERE WAS YOU broke a half a beat slow and then got bumped by STORMIN HEIST, who broke outwards and then BOOK OF WISDOM, who broke
inwards, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to get on near even
terms with the runner up a sixteenth from home, dug in knocking heads through to the finish and got the bob on the wire. HOUDINI'S BRIDE chased four
paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path into and through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, seized command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive under threat and dueled through the final sixteenth with the aforementioned
foe to her outside and just lost the nod on the line. BOOK OF WISDOM broke in at the start bumping TIL THERE WAS YOU, chased six then five wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. TERESA traded a bump with BABI
DREAMS at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the
finish. STORMIN HEIST broke out at the start bumping TIL THERE WAS YOU, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got caught at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. BABI
DREAMS traded a bump with TERESA at the start, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and weakened. SIX O THREE chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. SONIA'S
FLAME coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, faltered and was
eased home through to the finish.
