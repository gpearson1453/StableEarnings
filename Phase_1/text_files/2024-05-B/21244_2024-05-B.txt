Footnotes
PHILHARMONIC stalked along the inside, moved forward to press outside of the leader into the far turn, bid entering the lane and drove clear. NACHO
CHROME brushed with an inner rival before grazing an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in the two path around the far
turn, then kept on in the final furlong to edge place late. BEER WITH ICE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, set a clear pace in the two path, then
along the inside as an outer rival applied pressure around the far turn, got headed by that bidder entering the lane, weakened and lost place late.
ONEPARTICULRHARBOR was bumped by an outer rival and took back from crowded quarters between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, then
two wide turning for home and moved up. FREAKY Z brushed an outer rival leaving the gate, tracked in the three path, chased under urging around the far
turn and tired. STAR NATION lacked speed in the three to four path despite consistent heavy urging from the rider, saved ground turning for home and
never got involved.

Footnotes
THREE ECHOES broke out and bumped a rival at the start, stalked along the inside, dedicated to a rail charge inside of the top pair in upper stretch, slipped
through a very narrow rail seam passing the furlong marker, brushed with a rival while bidding at the sixteenth pole and edged past. CHARLIE TOLU broke
a touch slow, moved forward to press the pace setter from the three path, vied in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds but was
bested by an inner bidder in the late stages. CLOCK TOWER was a bit reluctant to load, set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure
around the turn, got headed by that one in midstretch as an inner foe took aim, brushed the latter in the final furlong and yielded between horses. B
GRAYSON was bumped by an inner rival and brushed by an a outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack in the four to five path and ran on willingly.
BEIJING BOSS brushed an inner foe at the start, raced forwardly two wide, chased in the three path around the turn and gave way. CHARBONNAY broke a
step slow and failed to factor from the three path. ART FAIR leaned into the inner stall door upon leaving the gate, lagged behind around the turn and made
little impact. STREET LASS broke a bit outwardly, lacked speed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
ZEITLOS was last away, trailed two wide, split foes turning for home, rallied to bid inside of the leader leaving the sixteenth pole and edged past. YOUR SO
SILLEA pressed the leader from the three path, bid well in hand turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds
but was bested by an inner bidder in the closing stages. SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS showed the way inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one entering the
lane, shifted out while getting headed in upper stretch, yielded while losing place to an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, faded yet narrowly saved show at
the wire. DARING DO tracked from the five path, took aim from within striking range entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leaders while chasing
thereafter and missed show at the wire. CURRENT CLIMATE chased forwardly along the inside but faded around the turn. MISS ARLINGTON pursued
from the six to four path and tired.

MISS HARMONIC prompted outside of the leader, bid in the three path turning for home, drew off in upper stretch and was driven home. CANDY CRAZE
showed the way inside of a pressing rival, got headed by that bidder in upper stretch, proved no match yet was well clear of the rest. COMPUTADORA
stalked along the inside, chased the top pair around the far turn and held show from bidders on either side. PITTORE D'ORO broke a bit outwardly at the
start, laid off of the pace in the four path before tucking entering the backstretch, retreated to trail before saving ground around the far turn, improved inside
of rivals in midstretch, offered an inside bid for show in the final furlong but needed more and saved fourth. MORNING SPLENDOR took back soon after the
start, trailed early on, moved out of last in the three path into the far turn, altered course to two wide at the five sixteenths pole, shifted four wide into upper
stretch, stayed on to attempt a bid for show in the final furlong, but flopped back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole, hung late and missed fourth.
NAUGHTY MISS pursued from the two path, chased in the three path and between horses around the far turn, then gave way. UNION DAME tracked in the
three path, came under urging with nine sixteenths to go, chased in the four path around the far turn, faded turning for home, got floated wider into upper
stretch and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
AL AMEEQ vied two wide, led narrowly around the turn, resisted a pair of outer challenges entering the lane, shook free in upper stretch and held sway from
a pursuer. MELLIFLUOUS laid off of the pace four wide, inched closer to track around the turn, ranged up and offered a bid entering the lane, but chased an
inner rival in upper stretch, wandered about in pursuit in the final furlong and was kept at bay. ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT laid off of the pace in the three path,
steadied among foes at the three furlong pole, shifted out to the five path soon after, then stayed on to edge show at the furlong grounds but failed to
threaten the top pair. OVERSTATEMENT broke multiple lengths slow, trailed in the three path, shfited out to the six path in upper stretch and stayed on to
reach fourth at the wire. DU MONDE chased along the inside, shifted out nearing the lane, then to the three path in upper stretch, surpassed tiring rivals in
the final furlong but got outfinished by an outer rival and missed fourth. LUCCHESI pressed three wide, then between horses turning for home, but faded in
upper stretch. ENDLESS REIGN vied along the inside, but yielded to a trio of outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole and continued to fade through the lane.

prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, bid nearing the lane, led narrowly in upper stretch but was bested by an inner bidder in the final
sixteenth. RYVIT set the pace inside of a prompter, got headed shifting off the rail entering the lane, then yielded between horses at the sixteenth pole.
CONDEMN laid off of the pace in teh four path, inched closer to striking range entering the lane, but chased on his left lead and yielded. WINFROMWITHIN
stalked two wide into the turn, chased between horses and gave way.
