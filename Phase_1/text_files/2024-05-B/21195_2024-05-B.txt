Footnotes
BIJOU BABY co-trailed on the outside three wide heading into the first turn, made an early move going around foes at the three quarters pole to get better
position down the backside, tracked outside going easily down the backstretch in the second flight, moved in to bid three wide at the quarter pole, took
control in the three path at the furlong marker and prevailed in a stretch battle to the finish line. RETAIL THERAPIST had a good spot tracking the engaged
pair on the fence down the backside, was under a snug hold waiting for a seam to develop while behind the front trio around the far turn, swung out with run
four wide at the top of the stretch, determinedly dueled to the wire from the eighth pole home but was denied by the winner. SHE MAKES A POINT
prompted the pace outside into the first turn, hounded the pacesetter down the back straight, closed in to bid for the lead turning for home with runners on
both sides, was no match for the top two who drew away at the eighth pole but stayed on to hold for show. BEDAZZLE ME co-trailed on the inside early on,
was steadied sharply between runners in the first turn at the three-quarters pole, made a mild run four wide outside horses at the quarter marker and
finishing up evenly to settle for a minor role in the end. TALK TO YA LATER seized control from the onset, set the fractions maintaining a slim margin up
front down the backside, was collared outside at the top of the lane, battled until the sixteenth pole and gave way late. INSCRUTABLE settled on the rail in
mid-pack after the break, was relegated to trailing the field inside down the backstretch, could not find more to get involved running on the final turn and was
not a factor in the drive to the finish. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #1 BEDAZZLE ME AGAINST #2 BIJOU BABY AT THE

Footnotes
MEDIA SENSATION settled near the rear in the early stages, began to lengthen stride passing foes on the outside by the half, quickly assumed command
circling the field by the three furlong marker and was kept to the task through the lane to hold off many challengers in every direction with a gritty stretch
drive. JAY BIRD was nestled on the fence just behind the frontrunner in the first turn, was shuffled back from the half to the three eighths pole being throttled
down to trail the field, re-rallied with a quarter to run between horses, loomed three wide actually putting his head in front briefly at the furlong marker but
was outfinished by the winner late. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY cleared the field getting to the rail up top on the first turn, ceded the lead by the half mile marker
losing a few positions, had nowhere to go when the field bunched up at the three furlong pole, came on again smartly on the fence, two furlongs out, rallied
up the rail down the lane but did not have enough to threaten the winner late. MO TOURIST trailed the field on the fence, continued to see the pack
unhurried down the back straight, started to rally going by runners at the three eighths marker, shifted out widest in the six path turning for home and
finished with intent to be involved in the minor placings at the wire. FOUR K FORCE was checked between rivals in the two path going into the first turn,
recovered down the backside to track the pacesetter by the half, moved in around the final turn chasing the leader, angled out with momentum five wide for
the drive, could not sustain the run and stalled in deep stretch. STORMIN DAVE stalked in the three path between runners on the first turn, assumed the
front down the backstretch, was headed outside by the winner three furlongs from the prize, fought on until upper stretch but retreated in the late stages.
VINCENZINO travelled four deep outside horses into the first turn, tracked three wide down the backstretch, came under a ride but could not maintain
position when the eventual winner was circling the field at the three eighths marker, backed away throughout the turn and was not a factor in the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
MY BOY PRINCE was content to sit outside off the flank of the early leader through the backside, seized command outside easily with five sixteenths from
home, opened up in upper stretch and drew off for a decisive win. ROI SOLEIL was brushed then bobbled slightly after the break, tracked under a good hold
on the rail down the backstretch, moved in to close the gap throughout the turn, posed the only threat to the winner turning for home, could not keep up to
the dominant winner late but easily bested the rest in the end. MIDNIGHT MASCOT travelled in the second flight in the middle of the pack early on, was
roused three furlongs from home to go after the leaders, offered little response around the bend and mildly finished up to the wire to capture third money in
this compact field. MAXIMUS MAGIC broke sharply to lead this field down the backside, was headed outside by the winner in mid-turn, could not find more
to battle on by the quarter pole and faded in mid-stretch to settle on the fringes. BREAK THE SPELL hopped slightly, then was checked leaving the gate to
trail, caught up to the field three deep outside by the half, kept pace with others on the turn, swung out in the five path for the stretch run but lacked a rally
through the stretch.

Footnotes
GAROFOLI was away well then allowed to settle dropping back off the loose leader, stalked that one two then three wide on the turn edging nearer turning
for home, took a narrow lead past the three-sixteenths, forged clear. ROCK TO FAME got away well then was coaxed along to move clear, set the pace with
a large advantage near but off the rail into the turn, was put to more urging passing the quarter pole, overtaken in upper stretch, could not kick on with the
winner but saved the place. SOCIETY'S THUNDER was away slowly and bumped at the start, angled to the rail bringing up the rear, saved ground on the
turn, came out a bit in the stretch for room, kept on but missed second. COOLER MAN broke outwardly bumping a rival, rated mid-pack inside, came out off
the rail about the five-sixteenths and put to urging soon after, swung into upper stretch four deep, failed to rally. EL COHETE settled outside a foe off the
pace three wide heading into the turn, fanned five deep turning for home, was not a threat.

Footnotes
NO MORE OPTIONS was nestled on the rail tracking the contesting front duo, rated kindly on the fence watching the top two engage down the back
straight, waited to move around the far turn, shifted out finding a seam in the four path turning for home and drew off under a vigorous ride in the final
furlong. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN cleared from the outside post to lead on the fence into the first turn, set the pace while hounded outside through the
backstretch, dueled on the rail on the far turn with a pesky rival who pressed the whole race and could not find more in deep stretch to repel the winner who
had an ideal trip. SOONER LUNAR prompted the pace into the first turn, continued forcing the pacesetter outside along the backside, battled head and
head with the leader throughout the far turn, fought on gamely in upper stretch between foes but faded late to be a clear third at the wire. ZIPPY GIZMO
stalked three deep outside runners around the first turn, tracked three deep in mid-pack into the back straight, lost some positioning into the final turn,
swung out widest in the six path turning for home and finished up getting a minor share in the end. REPEAT THE HEAT stalked the pace on the rail into the
first turn, tracked in the two path with runners on either side entering the backstretch, was roused outside two wide at the quarter pole to be in range of the
leaders at the top of the stretch, lacked a rally to the wire and tired. LIL BIT GANGSTA trailed the field into the first turn, continued stalking at the rear inside
down the backstretch, could not get into gear through the final bend and was never in contention down the stretch to the wire.

Footnotes
WET AND WILD was off a bit slow to begin, made a good move four wide outside horses at the half to swoop to the lead by the three eighths marker, was
well rationed around the turn, had more when the chasing trio appeared to be closing in at the top of the stretch and opened up strongly in the last furlong
for an impressive score. FRACEN MACHO forced the issue on the outside in the early stages, chased the winner with rivals on both sides running on the
turn and determinedly fought to the finish line to win the secondary battle for the place share. READY TO COLLECT broke sharp to have the early lead,
gave way to the winner who made an early but winning move at the three furlong pole, was relegated to a chasing role on the fence through the turn and
fought for the place share down the lane but was outkicked late. STONKS stalked near the back outside rivals down the back straight, made little progress
going around the oval, and finished up willingly between horses to settle on the fringes at the wire. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE stalked near the rear travelling
on the fence, made little headway while hard ridden inside throughout the turn and showed some late energy dueling for a small piece of the prize in the
stretch. CAPTIVE SILENCE stumbled on the break, recovered to track the front pair outside in the three path under a tight hold early on, lost forward
positioning when the winner moved on his outside to bid for the lead at the half, chased the frontrunner three wide outside foes on the turn, angled out in the
five path in the mix at the top of the stretch but stopped in the last eighth. DARE TO BE KING trailed the field down the backstretch, continued at the rear
not very interested running around the bend and could not be a presence in the drive to the wire.

SILENT RESERVE moved clear setting the pace and shifting in, had a measured lead through the turn racing just off the rail, held late while being kept to
the task. CAPTURE THE LION settled mid-pack, swung four to five wide turning into upper stretch and encouraged along, was guided out a further path
nearing mid-stretch, gained too late but was second best. NIAGARA SKYLINE was forwardly-positioned, tracked the eventual winner in behind saving
ground through the turn, kept on evenly in the stretch. LIGHT THE LAMP stalked from outside a rival through the turn, moved out three to four deep for the
drive, kept on evenly. SHEKKY SHEBAZ settled well back between foes at times racing two to three wide, began to advance while shifting out turning for
home, was five wide at the top of the stretch, wider still in mid-stretch, ran on. WARP RIDE broke just a half-step slowly, lacked early speed bringing up the
rear, raced inside through the turn, was never a threat. FORESTER'S FORTUNE broke a step slowly, raced outside rivals at the back, fanned seven deep,
failed to menace.

Footnotes
POSEIDON STEEL was patiently allowed to settle trailing in the early stages, continued to bide his time seeing the field around the bend, closed the gap
smartly when the field entered the stretch and burst between runners at the eighth pole to win going away at the finish. AIM FOR THE SKY pressed inside
after the start, was then reined back to rate on the fence at the half, moved out just off the rail to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, poked his head in front
four wide by mid-stretch but could not hold off the late charge by the winner. JAZZ HANDS was bumped inside on the break to be near the back of the pack
at the start, rushed up three wide to seize control by the half, set a fast pace up front on the turn, began to weaken just clinging onto the lead with a furlong
to go and stayed on saving the show money. SOUPER SUCCESS stalked four deep outside foes down the backstretch, made little impression outside
runners on the turn, angled widest in the seven path straightening out for the drive and was striding out late to get a small piece of the prize. FEELTHEBEAT
was situated on the fence in mid-division tracking the front trio along the backside, saved ground keeping pace through the turn, was in the mix on the rail in
upper stretch for a share, could not go on and stalled in the final furlong. BLACKTECA broke outwards on the start, set the early pace down the backside,
was relegated to chase the loose speedster around the bend between rivals and faltered through the lane. FOUR ACES HIGH travelled in midfield in the
two path between horses down the backstretch, improved to chase three wide outside foes through the turn, had no more to offer turning for home and gave
way in the six path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHAIRMAN BOB stalked between challengers near the back of the field in the first turn, continued to see most runners going down the backside, moved in
comfortably passing foes by the quarter pole, circled around the pack seven wide at the top of the stretch, switched leads at the furlong marker and easily
went on by in deep stretch under confident handling. KIDDIE HOLIDAY settled behind the contesting quartet on the first turn, settled in midfield three deep
along the backside, advanced smartly moving in three wide three eighths remaining, bid for the lead in the five path turning for home but could not withstand
the late surge by the winner in the final sixteenth. SOCIETY JOE tracked outside in the four path on the first turn, settled nicely all alone in the third flight
down the back straight, keep pace with rivals making a move four wide on the far turn, swung out in the six path at the top of the lane and ran determinedly
to the wire to win the battle for third. TOURIST'S DREAM travelled on the fence having one foe beaten in the early going, improved on the rail down the
backside, encountered traffic and had to wait behind foes at the quarter pole, had clear running room finding a seam in the two path at the furlong marker
and surged late just missing the nod for third in a photo. H C HOLIDAY pressed the pace in the two path between rivals on the first turn, chased the loose
frontrunner down the backside and throughout the far turn, could not find more in the stretch and yielded by the furlong marker. MAMBOINTHEFOREST
trailed the pack into the first turn, continued to see the field saving ground through the final bend and rallied mildly on the fence passing tired ones in the
stretch. MAD DOG N JOE tossed his head rearing up at the start to trail, quickly was asked bursting between horses in the three path in front on the first
turn, opened up on the field down the backside, continued to be the frontrunner around the final bend, was headed outside in mid-stretch and gave way late
swallowed up by runners in the final seventy yards. NATIVE PRINCE had a slim on the fence into the first turn, tracked the loose leader down the backside,
chased the pace running on the rail through the far turn, could not quicken with rivals at the quarter pole and wilted inside in upper stretch. BLUE MAX broke
inwards to begin, was checked mildly soon after the start, stalked four wide outside foes on the first turn, trailed the field down the backstretch and could not
get interested in the late stages of the race.
