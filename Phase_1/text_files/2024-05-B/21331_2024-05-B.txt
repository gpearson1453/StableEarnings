the pace inside, bid at the five-eighths pole, was steadied at the half-mile pole when the loose horse was near, saved ground, then couldn't close late. REVS
RUN prompted the early pace inside and then faded. BARB'S VORTEX pressed the early pace between foes, was shuffled back on the first turn, was
clipped behind at the five-eighths pole, checked near the half-mile pole when the loose horse came by and lost momentum. GOODY FOUR SHOES broke
outward and was outrun. GIO'S BABY GIRL stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the eleven-sixteenths pole, clipped the heels of a foe, lost the rider but
continued with the field and left the course under his own power.
