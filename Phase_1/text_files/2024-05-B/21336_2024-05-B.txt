TWENTY FOUR KARAT dueled for the lead between rivals two wide into the turn, took command then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the
best under right handed urging. MY TWO JAKES slow early, rallied three wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. WEEKENDING battled for
the lead along the inside into the turn, kept on into the stretch and faded late. HITCH CITY matched strides for the lead three wide into the turn then
gradually weakened.

WORK'N ON A BUZZ reared at the start, was never far back, advanced steadily two wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole then widened the
balance of the trip to win as much the best under strong handling. MIESHA never far back, rallied three wide through the turn and finished clear for second
in the five path. QUETZALY unhurried early, had a mild late rally three wide while no threat to the top pair. DOMINUS O'S ME broke through the gate prior
to the start, upon being reloaded settled inside and went evenly. BOUNCE PASS well placed, failed to respond. FLAME FOR REAL sprinted to a clear lead
soon after the start, set the pace past the five sixteenths pole then faltered. RUNAWAY ATLANTIC trailed, pulled up injured on the turn and was vanned off.

KERRI'S MIRACLE never far back, circled rivals six wide into the stretch to make the lead before the furlong marker and drew off under strong handling.
TWISTED JUSTICE vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead two wide at the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch
then was no match the winner. IMA MOM unhurried early, finished determinedly four wide. MIZ KEETA stalked the early pace, loomed boldly five wide at
the top of the stretch then was outfinished. KAT TRAX trailed for a half and found her best stride late. OUR LAST SONG pressed the pace two wide into the
turn, gained a slight lead near the quarter pole, matched strides until mid stretch then weakened. RONNI'S WIND was no factor. KISS VALENTINA rushed
to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail for nearly a half then was used up. KISSING MEDALS was through early.
