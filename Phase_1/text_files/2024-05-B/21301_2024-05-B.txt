Footnotes
SHAPE NOTE , with the pace three deep and snugly in hand, responded when asked entering the lane, forged clear with a furlong remaining, kept on under
strong handling then was fully extended to last over oncoming outer rivals. BETTER LUCK saved ground and off of the dueling trio, eased out gathering
steam into the lane, straightened to be about three to four wide, closed in past mid stretch, switched over to his left lead leaving the sixteenth marker,
continued gamely and just missed between runners. UPSIDEDOWN MAN , off the duelers and outside BETTER LUCK leaving the far turn, swung four to
five wide for the drive and finished well. CASSIUS rated two wide behind foes, eased out, worked between runners past the furlong grounds and continued
on with effort. GATTO BE PROUD rushed up and put a head in front after about a sixteenth of a mile, dueled between foes to the head of the lane, stayed
on past mid stretch then weakened through the final seventy yards. REAP WHAT YOU SOW bumped with an inner rival at the break then steadied, was a
bit rank soon after, regrouped, circled four wide into the stretch, made a bit of a run then flattened out late. EVENLY DIVIDED , bumped and in tight at the
start, saved ground off the pace and failed to generate a serious response. SIR LANCE , inside in an extended three way pace battle, failed to go on leaving
mid stretch and weakened. DUCKPINS , three wide into the turn, failed to get involved.

Footnotes
FREEZE THE FIRE bore in causing a jam up leaving the starting gate, chased the pace, swung wide in upper stretch, closed outside and led late. LITTLE
SKIPPY gained a two wide lead leaving the turn, was clear in mid stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. PENNY LOAFER ,
bumped in the jam up soon after the break, saved ground on the turn, raced in the two path in the stretch and rallied late. THE BIG ENCHILADA , bumped,
pinched back and forced in leaving the starting gate, steadied on heels near the three eighths pole, swung wide leaving the turn and failed to recover. EL
DIVINO NINO , steadied when bumped and forced in by FREEZE THE FIRE leaving the starting gate, steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch and
weakened. An objection by the rider of EL DIVINO NINO against the winner for alleged interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed. INTO THE
SAUCE sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail to the stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
LONGBRANCH LOU broke outward a bit and brushed with SIN PERMISO, corrected and was up with the pace three deep into the first turn, relaxed three
wide tracking through the backstretch run, responded when called upon approaching the quarter pole then took over soon into the lane, kicked away under
a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert. PIETRELCINA steadied nearing the six furlong pole, regrouped and rated along between then behind
foes heading to the half, worked outward to be about five wide gathering momentum into the lane, shifted further out from a drifting rival leaving mid stretch,
leveled off nicely after switching to his correct lead leaving the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the winner. FOURONEOHSMOKESHOW saved ground off
the early pace, eased out and was put to pressure leaving the three eighths, advanced between runners in mid stretch and kept on with effort. GRAFT , with
the pace between foes into the first turn, prompted the pace outside YANGARRA through the backstretch and second turn, wandered outward with pursuit
of the winner leaving mid stretch then faded late. FIRE AND KNIVES , three to four wide, jumped tracks near the half then offered a slight response. AZ
SHARP steadied off heels nearing the three quarter pole, raced three deep with pursuit then came up empty in the drive. SIN PERMISO , brushed at the
break, rated off the pace while saving some ground early then passed faders. YANGARRA was sent up inside rivals to take over into the first turn, briefly
cleared then set a pressured pace while saving ground through the backstretch, continued to hounded around the final turn, ceded the lead entering the
lane then tired a furlong out. ROCKY'S ADVENTURE . three wide early, raced between runners with pursuit past the three eighths then faded. LITTLE

Footnotes
REE NEE'S SIX took command inside rivals and set a rated pace in about the two path, handled outside pressure leaving the far turn, spurted clear past the
five sixteenths, was guided three wide and put to asking in upper stretch, kept on under repeated asks and turned back an inside threat from MADDIE TEN.
MADDIE TEN rated close up behind the trio of leaders, shifted in around the turn, moved through towards the rail leaving mid stretch, kept on gamely but
was denied in the final yards. KHOZY COLBY broke on top, was overtaken from her inside soon after but stayed on three deep to attend the pace, was
under pressure four wide pursuing into the stretch and faded. PUDD'N N PIE , with the pace three wide between foes, saw the winner get away past the five
sixteenths, chased into the stretch and faded. CATALINA CRUZIN broke outward, dropped off the pace, raced off the rail and failed to respond.

eighth pole and was kept to her business in the drive. MOSEY lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide and rallied. SURPRISINGLY SWEET showed
speed, raced inside horses through out and faded. POLICE WOMAN , rated back soon after the break, swung five wide in upper stretch and passed tired
horses. FUNZALO lacked speed and failed to be a factor. LUSTY , three wide, bumped with EMM ESS EH entering the first turn, opened up on the
backstretch, set fast fractions and tired. EMM ESS EH showed speed between horses bumped with LUSTY entering the first turn, chased the pace and
gave way.
