Footnotes
CAPT. CANDY was off slowly, then moved up on the outside and dueled three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn, widened the margin off the bend
and then held on late to prove best under a drive. REDEEM EDDIE was allowed to settle early, two wide on the turn and came three wide off the turn,
angled in and split rivals nearing the furlong marker and closed the gap fast but was too late. ROMANTIC GAMBLE chased the early pace on the inside,
eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and rallied. PORTAL ONE was settled back early and outrun, four wide on the turn, came eight wide
off the turn and had a belated rally. CRITICAL THINKING was settled early, three wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had no rally. TWIXTER
chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. DR RAGS set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command, ridden along and fell back on the
turn and then weakened.

pole and came two wide off the turn, then was clear by the furlong marker but was caught at the wire to just fail. JAYJAYDEE 'tracked the pace and made a
four wide bid on the turn but flattened out, stayed on for the show award. YOU MUST CHILL was settled on the outside and advanced four wide by the
quarter pole but weakened in the lane. RON DON SCORESE was settled on the inside and lacked a rally. STRAWBERRY TREAT was settled between

FIERCE AND STRONG set the early pace on the inside while unchallenged, was well handled and drew out leaving the turn and then was kept to mild
urging. CRISPER was reserved early, saved ground on the far turn, swung out seven wide leaving thh turn and closed well to get up for the place award
late. A WESTERN YARN tracked the pace from the inside, tipped out three wide for aim but had no kick and lost the place award late. MARKET MAVEN
was allowed to settle early, was on the inside on the turn and lacked the needed rally. GORDIAN KNOT stalked the pace three wide and weakened. LACCO
AMENO passed the tiring rivals. JOHN DUTTON chased the pace on the outside and was four wide on the turn and weakened. FLETCHER chased the
pace in between rivals and tired. RENEWING VOWS was reserved on the outside and was not a threat. HE'S A MESS was settled three wide and tired.

FIRST WORLD WAR checked shortly after the start, then settled, was in between rivals leaving the half mile marker, advanced two to three wide on the
turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and closed well to get up in time to prove best under a drive. ASPENITE was well paced on the inside, waited by
the quarter pole and made a inside bid leaving the turn and dueled for command by the sixteenth marker and battled to the wire to just miss. TRIKARI
pressed the pace two to three wide and made a four wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead, then dueled for command in the furlong grounds but was
out-kicked late to just miss. GOOD LORD LORRIE was reserved early, advanced on the turn and came two wide off the turn and then rallied on the inside.
SET set a pressured pace and floated out leaving the turn three wide and then faded in the final furlong. PLEASE ADVISE checked into the first turn, then
made a four wide early move to be in contention, then made four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE was settled back
early and lacked a rally. I KNOW MAP failed to menace. TROPANDHAGEN was five wide into the first turn, tracked the pace four to three wide and

Footnotes
LA LIMA set the pace on the inside while clear, then drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the best. CLASSY SADIE was well placed
on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and stayed on to be second best. HELLO GRACIE chased the pace on the inside, steadied by the three
eighths marker, then moved out and came five wide into the land and had a mild gain. KASHAN was off a step slow, reserved early, four wide by the quarter
pole and had no kick. DESI'S REWARD was off slowly, saved ground and had no rally. SCOREBOARD LILY tracked the early pace three wide, then was in
between rivals on the turn and weakened. MYGIDGETMARIE chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but then was empty in the lane.
