Footnotes
OUT OF LUCK took command into the first turn, opened a well measured lead around the first bend, extended that advantage nearing the far turn while well
rated, responded when called upon turning for home and widened down the lane without challenge in a well handled ride. ALWAYS CONNECTED stalked
the pace from four wide in the first turn, held that position down the backside, was set to a drive midway on the final turn and kept on to be second best.
CHAVETA tracked the pace down the backside, rallied five wide on the far turn to gain striking position and failed to sustain the bid in the stretch. BRAVO
REGINA reserved off the pace to the final turn and passed weaker rivals without impact in the lane. LA SANTA CLARA went one-paced without ever being
a factor. D'ORO BABY prompted the early pace and steadily faded.

Footnotes
RED RIVER SUSI reserved along the fence off the pace in the early going, rallied midway on the turn tipping out to the four path to split rivals, closed well
through the lane while drifting in briefly and prevailed in a drive. MAXIMUM EMILY unhurried early, made a steady advance on the turn while forced to rally
eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed with good late interest. DARK DUTCHESS stalked the pace from between rivals into the turn, rallied to take
the lead nearing the quarter pole, led to mid-stretch and flattened out while in hand off the heels of the winner after already having given way. PICARDY
tracked the leaders from four wide down the backside, angled in on the bend to cut the corner and finished willingly along the fence. SWEET SUMMER
LOVE reared at the start to give the field a few lengths, and rallied with a mild non-threatening bid. HUNNY BUNNYNESS well placed along the fence in
striking distance on the turn and lacked a response when called upon. HOME TOWN FAV pressed the pace and faded. WIND BREAKER was loose on the
track while being led over for saddling, required a shoe repair in the paddock, flashed brief speed and was through early on a day where all was against her
participation. THE RIDER OF DARK DUTCHESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON
REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SWEET HEIDELBERG took control shortly away from the gate, set a well rated, well measured pace, drifted out significantly through the lane and held well
to prevail at the wire. FANCY PRINCESS prompted the pacesetter throughout, was unable to get by that one through the lane but kept on willingly to hold
the place. RAISE YOUR GAME chased the leader from three wide and could not gain ground finishing evenly. HAPPY TAPPY TIM raced five wide down
the backside off the pace, angled in on the turn to save ground, cut the corner coming home up the rail with a mild bid. MURUMBI failed to menace. NURSE
RACHETT was not a factor. ILLUSION OF HOPE well placed tracking the pace from the rail through the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
COMMON PROSPERITY stalked the pace from the fence for the first half mile, tipped out two wide on the turn to engage the pacesetter turning for home,
dueled down the lane and edged away late. NANGA PARBAT (GB) hustled away from the gate to take a clear lead on the first turn, continued to set the
pace under pressure into the far turn, responded gamely battling the winner through the lane and could not stay with that one late while a clear second best.
POP SOCKS tracked the leader from three wide into the final bend, rallied to loom up from three wide at the quarter pole and could not sustain the rally
finishing evenly. ART HANDLER rated off the pace while racing four wide down the backside, rallied on the turn under a hard drive and flattened out in the
stretch. PRINCIPE was not a factor.

Footnotes
ZIPPER ZAPPER settled well while stalking the pace into the first turn, drifted out through the turn, raced wide backside, angled in on the final turn cutting
the corner while rallying to the lead and finished willingly to hold well. CITY RAGE prompted the pace from two wide throughout to be always well placed
and was out-finished in the lane. LEAD OFF raced wide through the first turn, tracked from the outside down the backstretch, mounted a five wide rally on
the turn to be prominent and finished evenly having been wide throughout. SHACKLED LOVE set the pace while well rated on a comfortable lead and
weakened in mid-stretch. BAHAMA CHANNEL was caught very wide on the first turn, dropped to near the rear of the field for the run down the backside and
went evenly. JUST NOD AND SMILE chased the pace from the fence for a half and lacked a response when called upon in the final turn. STARDUST
ZIGGY was not a factor. JADE'S DREAM was through early.

INTREPID'S LEGACY saved ground while tracking the leaders into the turn, made a steady advance up the fence on the bend, angled out in mid-stretch
and closed well to be going away late in a confident ride. GREAT KISSER prompted the pace to the top of the lane, assumed comand in upper stretch and
was outkicked late in the drive. GAMBE FORTE sped off to a clear lead into the turn, responded when challenged on the bend but weakened midway down
the lane. BIG TONE C well placed off the pace down the backside, mounted a rally on the turn and failed to sustain the bid coming home. UNCLE CHROME
went evenly failing to menace. COUNT DADDY chased the pace early and lacked a response when called upon. GOLDEN AL hesitated at the start giving
the field several lengths, drifted wide away from the gate giving up more ground to be the distant trailer and showed some interest in the lane. Z RACES
was not a factor.

CHIEF RON stalked the pace from three wide in the turn, rallied to take command midway on the bend, opened a clear lead and went unthreatened through
the stretch. EASY DAY unhurried early to be at the rear of the pack, made a steady advance turning for home and finished well to be second best. OVERLY
CRITICAL hustled away from the gate to press the pace, made a two wide bid on the turn and failed to sustain the rally, after the race was pulled up injured
and vanned off. SILVER STYLE reserved off the pace, made a mild bid from five wide and was grinding theough the lane. GOOD JUJU chased the pace
from the fence down the backside and could not mount a rally. EGO MAN showed speed to take the lead from the fence for three-eighths, lacked a
response when challenged on the turn and weakened coming home.

Footnotes
ALBERTANO tracked the pace from the four path, remained outside rivals while making a bid nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, and
held sway under a steady drive. SPECTRIER, raced off the rail and off the pace down the back stretch, bid four wide leaving the quarter pole, and rallied in
deep stretch to gain the place. IRISH RIVIERA rated off the top pair, found clean pocket up the back stretch, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole,
finished willingly along the inside. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE raced close up around the first turn, took a brief lead racing in the two path down the backside,
came under outside pressure around the second bend, and faded through deep stretch. HE'S A SHOOTER set a pressured pace along the inside, under
pressure around the three eighths pole, gave way. CAPE HEDGE, raced off the pace and along the inside, asked for energy on the second bend, failed to
respond. ALTA FOX slow into stride, raced four wide around the first turn, five wide on the second bend, never threatened.
