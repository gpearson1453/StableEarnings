Footnotes
ALWAYS MIA pressed the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to take over, then drew out in the lane to prove much the best under
strong crop urging. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH was well rated early on the inside, then started a bid leaving the five sixteenths and eased out two wide by the
quarter pole and swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. GOLDEN MOONLIGHT stalked the pace three wide
and then was four wide by the quarter pole and came five wide off the turn and weakened while besting the rest. DOCTOR ABBIE was allowed to settle
early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. NO EASY ANSWER set a pressured pace on the inside and then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
FOXY JUNIOR was rated along on the outside, made a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for command, then forged to the front to be clear by the furlong
marker and maintained a safe margin to the wire. TEXAS TANGIE prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid in between rivals on the turn,
then dueled with the winner to the quarter pole and then could not keep up while running on to be clearly second best. SWAN POINT was allowed to settle
early, advanced three wide by the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and got the nod for the show award while no match to the top two. DATE NIGHT
KISSES set the pace on the inside, then vied for the lead on the inside on the turn and dropped back, angled out in the lane and lost the show award late.
MY THOUGHTS tracked the early pace in between rivals, dropped back by the five eighths marker and then was two wide by the quarter pole and
weakened. LOVING CUP chased the pace on the inside and tired.

RAPID RESPONSE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then was clear by the furlong marker and drew out late to prove
best under mild urging. R GOODTIME CHARLIE set the pace while in the three path, then was headed leaving the turn and proved to be no match for the
winner late while clearly second best. SPOOKY ONE tracked the pace four wide on the turn and swung out five wide leaving the turn and proved to be no
match for ther top two wide besting the rest. KAZ MUNNINGS was settled early on the outside and was five wide on the turn and had no rally. SASSY LAD
was fractious in the gate, bobbled at the start, chased the pace on the inside and had no rally. HASHTAG WINNING was settled back early, saved ground
on the turn and had no rally. CHAIN REACTION was reserved early and was three wide on the turn and never threatened. CACTUS JACK was fractious in
the gate, failed to menace.
