Footnotes
MR NARCISSISTIC vied for the lead in the five path, extended a small advantage while under a nudge between foes from the three path rounding the turn,
tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and drew clear. PACK PLAYS got bumped by an outer foe at the start, chased inside, was cued in the two
path early around the turn, swung out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. ETNICO broke in and bumped an inner foe, pressed
the pace in the six path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, but flattened in the five path down the lane to show. GALIPAN was prompted
along to lead in the three path early, lost the lead while tipping to the rail under a ride entering the turn, and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
HARPOON HARRY set the pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. URANIUM saved ground off the pace, swung four wide nearing the eighth pole
and finished well. MY BOY BLUE saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch but was outkicked. GRAND
JOURNEY led early, rated back two wide and weakened in the lane. COPAZO chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. CITIZEN K failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. TIZ A PRINCE was off slowly, trailed in the two path, angled four wide turning for home and never threatened.
VINTNER played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
FOGGY NOTE tracked in the two path, waited early around the turn before being roused approaching the quarter, bid between foes in the four path at the
top of the lane, and inched ahead in the final sixteenth. PEGGYSUE I LOVE U set the pace in the two path, was cued from just off the rail passing the
quarter, dug in from the two path into the stretch, but was edged out in the final sixteenth by an outer foe to place. THREE GIRLS prompted the pace in the
four path, bid from the three path going into the turn, tipped out to the five path while between foes turning into the lane, drifted out to the eight path passing
the eighth pole, and kept on for show. LITA chased in the four path, floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, and made no impact. TIME TO SALSA
stalked in the five path, was coaxed passing the three-eighths, but faded in the final furlong. SUPER SPIN rated in the six path, angled inwards rounding the
turn, but failed to menace.

Footnotes
XY SPEED prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed along around the turn, bid at the top of the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and
drew clear. MAMBA ON THREE set the pace in the two path, was cued while just off the rail midway around the turn, dug in from the two path entering the
stretch, but lost the lead passing the eight pole, and yielded in the final sixteenth to place. SIGILOSO bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the
three path, was driven in the four path around the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. BOUNCER stalked in the four
path, was coaxed from the three path midway around the turn, but finished evenly in the five path down the stretch. HILARIOUS AFFAIR bumped with an
outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path but did not factor from the four path in the stretch. ALL IN SYNC trailed along the inside and did not
threaten from the three path in the stretch. GRIMES tracked inside, but had to steady going into the turn, and weakened down the lane.

SWAN LAKE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear near the quarter pole and held clear under a drive. UNCLE ARMANDO bumped at the start, saved
ground in range, tipped out near the sixteenth pole and narrowed the gap. CAPTAIN ANTHONY bumped after the start, prompted the winner in the three
path, could not match strides in upper stretch but kept on to hold third. INITFORTHELOVE was bumped at the start, trailed inside early, went three wide
around the far turn and improved position in the lane. MILLENNIUM CONDO failed to menace while racing four wide. VOLTAMOUR bumped soon after the
start, stalked the pace three wide and faded after a half. BURNING MAN played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
OCTANE laid up close in the four path, took command under a nudge going by the three-eighths pole, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and
kicked clear. LOCO ABARRIO chased in the three path, was driven in the four path around the turn, angled out to the seven path entering the stretch, and
chased on for place. SHAQ DIESEL bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, was driven in the five path around the turn,
fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, hung on his left lead, and finished evenly for show. VIVIR CON ALEGRIA (CHI) bumped with an inner foe
at the start, set the pace in the two path, was coaxed into the turn, but lost the lead passing the three-eighths pole, and faded. TICKING tracked in the five
path but weakened in the stretch. COLLABORATE broke out at the start then trailed throughout.

WIN FOR THE MONEY stalked in the four path, was cued to bid early around the far turn, took command at the top of the lane, and kicked clear. ELDON'S
PRINCE steadied at the start, trailed in the four path, was driven around the far turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for
place. ME AND MR. C rated in the four path, was cued into the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. MAIN EVENT
pressed the early pace in the three path, bid going into the far turn, briefly led midway around the far turn, but was quickly overtaken by the outer eventual
winner near the quarter, and faded along the inside in the stretch. MARWAD (GB) chased in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path around the far
turn, but flattened from the five path down the lane. BENVOLIO raced wellback in the three path but never threatened. LOVE ME NOT tracked under a hold
in the two path but weakened between foes at the top of the lane. EYES ON THE KING got sent from the gate to set the pace in the two path turning into
the backstretch but gaveway approaching the quarter.
