BOSS E BOOGS stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, contested the edge through
the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. MOTIVATING raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well to take second later yards. I'LLTAKECAREOFIT took over and moved to the inside to show the way, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the rail approaching the quarter, remained close through the turn but relented toward mid-stretch.
LIEUTENANT BROWN exchanged contact with Personable leaving the gate then raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. ALLEN CAN DO IT rounded the first turn about the five path, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three and four paths on the far turn and passed some rivals in the lane. JUBA'S NOTION raced in the
three path the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. PERSONABLE became a bit
fractious in the gate then exchanged contact with Lieutenant Brown at the break, saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. Sisyphus ran loose in the barn area and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
WHAT'SHERNAME became very fractious in the gate but took an immediate lead and set a pressured pace while tapering to the inside, rounded the turn at
the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. MOONLIT KISS gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and dueled through
the stretch for second. AIM'S REDIRECT gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. SMART
WINDSOR chased and rounded the turn off the rail then flattened leaving the eighth pole. DREAM LEADER gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and
showed little in the lane. SISTER WINNIE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. TRUE BUCKPASSING
chased outside, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the lane. HEART STOPPING became fractious in the gate then gave chase while saving
ground. COUNT THE FLOWERS saved ground. GENEROUS WOMAN raced very wide early and was not a factor.
