Footnotes
TRUE AND READY angled inward to show the way from the inside, cleared the turn and held sway down the lane while in a strong drive. VALDINA
DREAMS pursued the leader from the inside while urging steadily throughout and was no match in the end and held the place position. FANDO saved
ground while racing towards the back of the field, then rallied leaving the bend and got up to third position and held the show prize in the end. JUST
HANGIN RIDGE chased the pace from the inside while in a strong drive then flattened out heading into the stretch. HOLIDAY RUN was allowed to settle at
the back of the pack, bid mildly in the stretch but it was too little too late. TAKE MY MONEY settled back along the inside at the back and was no threat.
CIBOLO ERL was reluctant to load, was unhurried early then moved up to chase the pace briefly while in a mild drive on the turn and lacked bidding in the
late stretch.

Footnotes
EQUUS moved down the backstretch with inner foes to battle for the lead into the turn, gained command at the quarter pole and pulled away in the upper
stretch and was ridden out to the wire to prove best overall. ROYAL LIAISON saved ground in the early furlongs along the rail, then drifted to the three path
leaving the bend and rallied in the early stretch did not have enough to catch the cleared leader and was up for place. GEOMETRIQUE was allowed to
settle while two wide, then menaced leaving the turn but it was not enough and was best for the show prize. MISTY MOOD was allowed to settle along the
inside early, then fanned out four wide leaving the turn to rally mildly in the stretch and came up empty. LADY ATHENA inched up with outer foes vie for the
lead from the inside into the turn, continued to press the emerging leader while in a mild drive then flattened out in the stretch. CALLE REINA chased the
pace from the inside, then bid while four wide on the turn and did not fire in the stretch. CIRCA STAR raced between rivals to battle for the lead leaving the
backstretch, was in a hard drive on the turn, then was used up and tired in the stretch. MORO PRINCESS led the way briefly from the inside, then was
overpowered by outer rivals at the half and lost momentum.

Footnotes
CROSS CLAIM was well rated while pursing the pace from the inside, came out three wide in the upper stretch, dug in gamely to gain command in the final
furlong and held on well to prevail in the end. TOO MUCH DREAMING was reserved close behind the field along the inside in the early furlongs, then
menaced leaving the turn and was closing well in the end. FAST TRACK led the way from the gate, then vied with outer foes into the turn, inched away to
duel from the inside the upper stretch, then was surpassed by an outer rival in the final furlong and held the show prize in the end. THE NEXT BIG BLING
vied for the lead while two wide, then pulled away on the turn to duel with an inner rival in the early stretch, took command briefly at the eighth pole then was
out finished by an outer rival in the end. BLING IT TO ME chased the pace while two wide, was in tight on the turn then steadied slightly, rebid from the
inside in the early stretch and closed willingly in the final yards. RIVER'S END pressed the pace while four wide, was steadily urging on the turn before
giving way in the stretch. BLING ON THE LIGHT vied for the lead while three wide, was in a strong drive but could not gain the lead on the turn and
flattened out in the stretch. LIBBIES BABY was out run and no menace.

ITS MY MONEY TOO moved up from the two path to take command in the late backstretch, then drew clear leaving the turn and held on well in the stretch
to prevail in the end. SUPERCENTS drifted out at the start, then pressed the pace while three deep, was in a hard drive throughout the turn but could not
catch the determined leader in the lane and was second best. WICKED SONG chased the pace while three wide in the back flight of rivals, was in a steady
drive throughout the turn, rallied in the late stretch and was up for third place. POETIC UNION chased the pace while two wide in the second pack of foes,
then rallied on the turn and into the early stretch and came up empty in the end. KOLKATA pressed the pace while four wide, then bid on the turn while in a
mild drive before flattening in the stretch. SING IT BESSIE chased the pace while four wide in the second flight of rivals, then bid on the turn but did not
spark in the stretch. SHEZA HUNK chased the pace from the inside briefly, then settled back and was no threat. GREY HALO emerged to lead the way from
the inside in the early furlongs, was over taken in the late backstretch and faded in the remaining furlongs.

BURNINHUNKOFLOVE vied briefly from the three path before settling back to chase the pace while two wide, then bid in the upper stretch to edge past the
dueling leaders and was up in the final yards to prevail in the end. TIGER DAD vied briefly between rivals, gained command at the half pole, cleared the turn

AFTER FIVE was allowed to settle along the inside, then angled out to the four path leaving the turn, rallied in the stretch and closed well for the show prize.
AMERICAN CODE drifted out and brushed rival, then trailed early, swung five wide leaving the bend to rally mildly in the late stretch to no avail in the end.
SUITABLE vied from the inside then continued to pursue emerging leader while holding second position in the late backstretch, bid gamely leaving the turn
to duel with the pace settler in the early stretch then gave way in the end. MARKS PROMISE was brushed at the start, then chased the pace from the inside

Footnotes
CINNAMON FACE tracked the pace from the inside, was in steady drive throughout the far turn, shifted gears at the top of the stretch to edge past the pace
setter and held sway down the lane to prevail. MY PATRIOTIC GIRL saved ground in the early stages, then improved position on the far turn to bid while
three wide in the upper stretch then closed well for the place prize in the end. CLAUDETTE HEIR set the pace from the inside into the first turn, was in a
long drive heading into the home stretch, then was out finished in the final yards and held onto the show prize. RIOBELLA was allowed to settle along the
rail, then moved up to bid on the far turn while four wide, then rallied in the stretch but it was too little too late. CASHMERE DANCER raced from the inside
between fields of rivals down the back stretch, remained at an even pace throughout the far turn, then rallied mildly in the stretch and came up empty in the
end. HOURGLASS FIGURE was unhurried early, then swung six wide leaving the far turn, to bid in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. ELLE OF
THE BALL raced in the middle pack while two wide, then rallied on the far turn and was no threat. MISSWISH was unhurried early and no menace.
FAYETTE BLUE tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then bid determinedly on the far turn in attempt to over power the pace setter,
lacked the winning bid and flattened out in the stretch. HAILEY'S JEWEL raced mid pack from the inside at a moderate pace throughout and failed to rally in
the end.

Footnotes
BROTHER REID raced mid pack along the rail in the early half, shifted out four wide leaving the far turn while in strong drive, then found the best stride in
the late stretch to be up in time to prevail. PRODIGIOUS BAY set the pace from the inside into the first turn, was in a long drive heading into the home
stretch and almost lasted till the wire but was caught by BROTHER REID in the end. CANATLAN raced mid pack while two wide, then inched up on the far
turn to rally gamely in the stretch and was best for the show prize. SPEIGHTSVILLE was forwardly place while two wide into the first turn, continued to stalk
the leader down the backstretch and into the far turn, was in a hard drive at the top of the stretch then gave way in the final yards. BIG WAVE JAMES
tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn then rallied in the late stretch but it was not enough in
the end. SINGING DIXIE tracked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn before flattening out in the stretch. TAKE
FLIGHT was allowed to settle while two wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn while three wide, angled inward and came up evenly in the late
stretch. EMBOITE (IRE) was allowed to settle towards the back along the rail down the backstretch, then bid mildly on the far turn and came up flat in the
stretch. BAY BE GONE was unhurried early and no factor. TALE TWISTER tracked the pace from the inside in the early stages at a moderate pace then
faded on the far turn.
