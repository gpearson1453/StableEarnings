Footnotes
IAN GLASS made the lead shortly after the start, gave up the advantage past the half mile marker, chased the leader to the quarter pole, regained a narrow
advantage entering the stretch, drifted to the seven path under left handed urging and proved best while fully extended by the narrowest of margins in a
game effort. ROCKSTAR RO vied for the lead three wide, loomed boldly outside the winner nearing the quarter pole, dug in determinedly in the final stages
and just missed. FLIPPING FISH stalked the pace four wide, swung wide and finished with good courage past the middle of the racetrack. CYCLONE saved
ground and went evenly. AUGER rushed up along the rail to make the lead just past the half mile marker, set the pace while getting quick fractions to the
quarter pole, kept on until deep stretch then weakened. TOUCH CODE broke awkwardly and was never close.
