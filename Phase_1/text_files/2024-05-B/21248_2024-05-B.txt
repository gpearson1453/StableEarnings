wide through the final turn, and battled gamely through the stretch while exchanging bumps with her pace rival, and prevailed in the final strides.
DIPLOMATIC away alertly and raced to the lead while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the
final turn. and battled willingly from the inside of MINI MARKET through the lane, while exchanging bumps with that foe, and just failed to last. E Z TONIGHT
broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, tipped three
wide into the lane, and closed determinedly to grab a share, while gaining late. STILETTOS ONLY was bumped in the early strides, but raced into a tracking
trip from along the rail entering the backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the drive while
finishing one out from the rail. SHESBOURBONONICE unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, bided her time at the back of the pack in the
run down the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, shifted three wide for the drive, but failed to mount a late bid. Following the running of this
race, the stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run of the top two finishers. After review there was no change to the original order of finish

BUTTONWOOD TREE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail in the run to the first turn, dictated the pace through the second turn and in
the run down the backside, increased his advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened. SOMTHING ELUSIVE away well and settled
off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, saved ground through the second turn while racing into a
stalking trip, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed five wide in the drive to prove easily second best. GOOD BYE PUTIN was taken in
hand and allowed to settle well off the early pace while racing two wide through the first turn, gained ground through the second turn to take a stalking trip
into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DYNAMITER away alertly and
tracked the pacesetter two wide entering the first turn, continued from a tracking trip through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch,
commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages.

CEREBRO broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of FINDING WAYS, before asserting himself on the lead entering the first turn, controlled
the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, but battled gamely through the lane while racing one out
from the rail to prove second best. SHARPZAN settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, commenced his bid
from along the inside entering the final final turn, and finished determinedly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. WICKED NIGHT away well and

QUAGMIRE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of COUNTRY COWBOY entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the
outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch, disposed of that foe entering the final turn but was quickly tackled by EYE BE SEEING YOU, and was
all out to fend off that determined rival in the closing strides to prevail. EYE BE SEEING YOU away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing out from the rail, launched his bid three wide approaching the final turn, and closed steadily three wide in the drive to just miss. COUNTRY COWBOY
broke sharply, and vied for the lead into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, set a pressured pace from the inside of QUAGMIRE in the run down the
backstretch, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

KNOPFLER broke sharply and tracked the pacesetters while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly one out from the rail
through the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up in time. PADDY D'ORO away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch and continued one out from the rail entering the final turn, took a
narrow lead into the lane, but was unable to fend off KNOPFLER in the closing strides while proving easily second best. VALUE MAX settled off the early
pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, advanced three wide midway down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished
willingly to garner a share. Y VEE R away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of
ANOTHER GUINENESS in the run down the backstretch, maintained his advantage into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. ANOTHER
GUINNESS dueled for the lead from the outside of Y VEE R entering the first turn, continued to force the issue to the final turn, before weakening. JUVEE
TOO unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, but failed to sustain his
bid in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BACK SHACK away well, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, and battled determinedly three wide in the drive to fend off a late surge by BAK TO LIBERTY to prevail. BAK TO LIBERTY tracked the leader into
the first turn while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and closed steadily four wide
in the drive to just miss. GROOVIN' IS BAK away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from just off the rail in the drive to get up for a share. BARBERRY BANDIT
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest two out from
the rail in the drive. I'M ALL SHOOK UP broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. ACCORDINGLY settled off the early pace while racing four wide in the run down the
backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
