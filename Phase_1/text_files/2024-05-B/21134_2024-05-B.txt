Footnotes
MALIBU S S went shoulder to shoulder with an outer rival into the first turn and onto the second, then dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to shake clear
of incoming rivals and lasted to the wire to prevail and claim 1000 career wins for HARRY HERNANDEZ. HEIR TO GREATNESS saved ground in the early
stages, then moved up from the inside on the far turn and into the early stretch, gained second position, lacked the winning bid and bested the rest of the
field for the place prize. FAST TRAFFIC stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn, could not catch the leader
and kept on between rivals in the late stretch to be up for the show prize. DRIVEHAPPY stalked the pace while three wide, then menaced leaving the far
turn but it was not enough in the end and just missed the show prize. ALGEBRA dueled with an inner rival throughout the first three quarters, was in long
drive heading into the home stretch before giving way in the final furlong. ICARUS stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then flattened
out on the far turn while in a urging eagerly and had nothing left in the stretch. QUARTERBACK DAK was no threat. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM was no threat.

MO MOVES stalked the pace from the inside and while being well rated, then dug in gamely leaving the far turn to gain command at the top of the stretch
and held on well to the end. HARD TO COME BY stalked the pace while two wide and in a steady hand drive throughout, then menaced leaving the far
bend while three wide and was closing in on the leader in the final yards and was second best in the end. NORTHWIND emerged leaving the first turn to
duel with an outer rival before gaining command at the half, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, then was challenged by rivals on both sides and
was out finished in the late stretch and was best for third place. TOP COP saved ground well behind the field in the early furlongs, then rallied leaving the far
turn and into the home stretch but it was too little too late in the end. SEND OFF was allowed to settle towards the back along the inside, then came out five
wide leaving the far turn, was bumped by an inner rival and kept on in the late stretch while in a mild drive. MAN IN THE MIDDLE emerged to duel briefly
with an inner rival into the early backstretch, continued to press the established leader on the far turn, then drifted out bumping rival in the early stretch and
gave way in the end. D W STRONG stalked the pace while three wide in the early furlongs, then settled back along the inside down the backstretch and
lacked rallying in the remaining furlongs. KITTER KAT was no factor.

gain command and held on gamely to prevail in the end. WHISKEY NOT WINE chased the pace while two wide, remained well reserved on the far turn,
then rallied in the late stretch to close well for the place prize. COUNTRY CAPER chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, was urging
steadily on the far turn while coming out five, then rallied in the stretch and just missed the place prize in the end. BIZZEE CHANNEL brushed foe at the
start, stalked the pace while two wide and in third position down the backstretch, then menaced leaving the far turn and into the stretch and was out finished
for the show prize in the end. RODEO CHAMP led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, was met by an outer rival
to duel on the fat turn, took command again the upper stretch then was overpowered by rivals on both sides and was out finished in the end.
COTTONWOOD was allowed to settle while three wide at the back of the pack, then came out five wide leaving the far turn and rallied mildly in the stretch
but it was not enough in the end. IBERIAN RUNNER was unhurried early then rallied mildly in the late stretch from the inside and came up empty. ROBO
was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn, then inched up meticulously to duel with the pace setter on the far turn, was used up in the early
stretch and gave way in the end. DON'TASK DON'TTELL was allowed to settle while four wide at the back and was no threat.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFULPATH showed the way from the inside into the turn, felt the pressure from an incoming rival at the quarter pole, then shook clear and held
sway down the lane to prevail in the end. BLUE HEAVENLY stalked the pace while three wide and at a moderate pace, then rallied in the stretch but could
not catch the cleared leader and was up for second place. AVALING was shuffled back at the start, was unhurried early, then bid while three wide on the far
turn and into the stretch and was able to get up to third place while in a gamely rally. SPEAK SOFTLY chased the pace while three wide, then bid on the
turn to menace in the stretch and missed the show prize in the end. ANTIFREEZE chased the pace from the inside early, before settling back, then bid
mildly on the turn and came up flat in the stretch. DULCE AMANECER YG chased the pace while two wide and between rivals, then rallied from the inside
on the turn and into the stretch before giving way in the final furlong. FLYING FIRST CLASS stalked the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive throughout
the turn in attempt to overpower the pace setter, lacked the winning stride and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
STANS HOME RUN saved ground in the early stages, was moving up along the inside on the far turn, angled out to the three path and dug in gamely to go
head to head with an inner rival in the final yards and was up at the wire to prove best. ABSAROKA set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive on the
far turn, was challenged by an inner rival in the upper stretch, cleared that rival then went head to head in the final furlong with STANS HOME RUN and just
missed in the end. LEVY remained well rated between fields of rivals down the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn to duel with the pace setter in the
early stretch then was out finished in the end and held onto the show prize. STELLAR TAP stalked the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive throughout
the far turn, did not have enough to over come the pace setter and gave way in the stretch. YAK stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch,
then settled back on the far turn and lacked rallying in the late stretch. HIT ONE OUT was unhurried early, then bid from the inside on the far turn and came
up flat in the stretch. GIST was unhurried early, was in a mild drive throughout the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) was
allowed to settle along the inside early, bid five wide on the far turn and came up empty. REQUISITION stalked the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive
heading into the far turn then stopped and had no final bid in the stretch. BIG BROTHER trailed early and was no factor. FOREVAMO was no threat.
RESOLVE NOW raced mid pack while two wide, was thru after the half and was no menace.
