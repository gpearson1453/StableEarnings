LEVIOSA settled off the leaders, moved closer inside on the turn, angled out into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter. STARSHIP ROGUE lagged far
behind outside, advanced wide on the turn, swung inside in the stretch and closed strongly. BAHAMA PEARL dueled inside, moved clear at the quarter pole
then weakened. CUP OF LIFE dropped off the pace and lacked a rally. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE saved ground and faded on the turn. KNOCK OUT KID
was urged off the leaders inside and never a factor. THIS ROUND'S MINE prompted the pace outside, drifted out at the top of the stretch and gave way.

CENTURION alternated for lead outside, repelled challenger then edged away in the final furlong. DALTON battled winner along the inside and continued
gamely to the wire. JARLIAN stalked the dueling pacesetters, bid on the final turn then flattened out. SOPHOS urged close up in two path and flattened out
in the stretch. MADISON LUVS DUKE dropped far behind then passed rivals while no threat. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS dropped back early and was never in
contention. MIDNIGHT CHROME chased in midpack and lacked a rally. SHPILKES trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA
lacked speed and was never a factor. SACRED RIDER chased wide, was asked into the far turn but stopped abruptly.

CAUSES TROUBLE quickly moved clear, repelled a strong challenge at the quarter pole then widened again in the final furlong. HE'S INCREDIBLE went
after the winner on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner in a game try. CAPITAL CONQUEST moved close up in the two path then
lacked a solid rally in the stretch. NATURAL HARBOR raced off the pace three wide, moved wider into the stretch and finished willingly. BRONX BOYS
saved ground within striking range then flattened out in the stretch. IN SKY WE TRUST raced very wide down the backstretch and lacked solid rally. TAP IN
FORMATION chased off the pace in the four path, raced six wide on the turn and faded.
