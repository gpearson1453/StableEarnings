WHERE'D THE DAY GO was well rated along the inside, saved ground on the far turn and tipped two wide leaving the turn and made a bid and drew away
in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE tracked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn and ran on to gain the
place award late. BOURBON DELIGHT was four wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace and moved in towards the rail, then came into the lane
on the inside and was headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker and faded losing the place award late. IRISH VALOR was settled early and was four
wide on the backstretch, steadied nearing the seven sixteenths and moved to the inside on the far turn, then moved off the inside in the lane but had no late
kick. PISTOL BOX was void of early speed on the inside, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR tracked the early pace
in between rivals, then dropped back by the half mile marker and got out entering the far turn and was eased, walked off.

TEXAS HOTTIE stalked the early pace and was three wide on the turn, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and went on even terms for
command off the turn, then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. PEGGY'S WAY set the pace on the pace on the inside and was headed off the
turn and dug in thru the lane but could not go with the winner late while staying on for the place award. TRIBEST (ARG) was well placed on the inside, came
off the turn two wide and moved out in the lane but needed more. RESOLUTION was settled early and saved ground on the turn then had a mild rally on the
inside. SWEET SMILA tracked the pace on the outside early, then was three to four wide on the turn and weakened. SHARP ATTACK was off slowly, then
raced three wide and was not a threat. KOLACHE QUEEN was bumped at the start and failed to respond.

CATEGORY TEN was rated early on the inside, then made a early move to duel for command on the inside by the half mile marker, then continued to duel
on the turn and made a bid to shake clear off the turn and drifted out by the furlong marker, then was given a pop right handed to correct and then widened
the margin by the sixteenth marker and then was geared down late to prove best. MCMONEY checked at the start, then was relegated to the back on the
inside, advanced on the turn and came two to three wide off the turn, moved in to be in the two path and split rivals by the furlong marker, then closed well
late but could not get to the winner. PATH TO SUCCESS was settled early, two wide on the turn, moved out in the lane and ran on but needed more.
ITWASTHISBIG set a pressured pace two wide, then dueled to the outside of the winner on the far turn, came three wide off the turn and angled in when the
winner drifted out and faded. CONI'S COUP pressed the early pace and then tracked the pace three wide, then shifted to the inside on the far turn and
weakened. SIR LUMPALOT was four wide into the first turn, reserved three to four wide and was not a threat. STAR KANOO was four wide into the first
turn, tracked the pace four wide and tired.

well clear under a vigorous hand ride to prove much the best. TWIRLING ROSES was rated early, between rivals off the bend and ran on willingly to the
wire to be clearly second best. MAN ON ATTACK steadied on th e inside at the seven sixteenths and then weakened in the drive.

ALVIN was well placed along the inside, then found room and slipped through nearing the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best under a drive.
SKYLANE was allowed to settle early, raced on the inside on the turn and angled out in the lane and finished well to gain the place award. SECRET
HONOR stalked the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn but was outfinished late by the top two.
PRINCE IS MY BOY was reserved early, three to four wide on the far turn, angled out wide leaving the turn and then was bumped by the sixteenth marker
and had a late rally. LATE BLACKSMITH set a pressured pace on the inside, then was two wide leaving the three sixteenths and dug in by the furlong
marker but faded the final sixteenth. PRAEFECTUS URBANUS pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn but weakened in the final
furlong. POND was bumped at the break, then settled back on the inside, angled out in the lane and bumped a foe by the sixteenth marker and had no late
rally. HAY MOON was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four to three wide and then stopped. SMACKOVER LIME was rank and climbing early
and raced wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COACH JIMI D broke outwardly at the start, then settled three to four wide, made a three wide move on the far turn, took over leaving the turn and drew off
to prove much the best under left handed crop urging. WOLF HUNTER was settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn two wide, then rallied well for
the place to be clearly second best while no match to the winner. RAVIN'S TOWN set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the far turn and then
could not go with the winner off the turn, angled off the inside by the furlong marker and weakened while staying on for the show award. REGIMENTAL was
settled back early, moved out to be four to five wide on the far turn and came seven wide into the lane and had a belated rally. ALL ABOUT TONITE
pressed the early pace three wide, then went up to vie for command two wide and then weakened on the far turn. MINING CAMP was five wide into the first
turn, chased the pace four wide and then was three wide on the far turn and tired. COWBOY CAUSE was reserved early on the inside, three wide into the
lane and never threatened. NOT FALLING BACK tracked the early pace on the inside, then pulled hard and had to check by the three quarter marker, finally
settled and then stopped on the far turn. LAST RUN lost irons at the start, raced wide and was pulled up, walked off. WINNING NUMBERS FOR PLACE
