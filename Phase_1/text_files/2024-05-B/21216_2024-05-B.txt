Footnotes
BALTASAR took control from the opening bell, cleared off under mild urging leaving the quarter pole, kept two task through the wire. MY HANDSOME MAN
off a step slow, raced along the inside and off the pace, clear running room opened up when TROPHY ROOM drifted out leaving the quarter pole, took
advantage and finished willingly inside rivals through the stretch. BRIGHT FORECAST stumbled at the start, recovered quickly and chased from an outside
position, bid four wide around the bend, moved into contention in upper stretch, mild rally late. NICKEL NICKEL tracked the pace setter from the start, took
up nice clean three wide position when roused around the bend, loomed a threat leaving the quarter pole, then faded in very deep stretch. TROPHY ROOM
chased along the inside, put in a bid leaving the three eighths pole, drifted off rail leaving the quarter pole, and weakened through the stretch. STARSHIP
GOTHAM slow into stride, raced off the pace and off the inside, called on around the bend, never threatened.
