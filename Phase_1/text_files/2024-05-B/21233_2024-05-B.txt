Footnotes
WINDSOR'S TRACKER broke awkwardly and made contact with Sargent Kobe then stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
dueled to even terms approaching the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game effort of MISSIONSNINETYNINE, who
rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met approaching
the head of the lane and dug in gamely leaving the turn, but missed the nod in the final strides. GOLDEN APPEAL stalked from the three path the first turn,
left the turn outside and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and dueled to clear third later yards.
SARGENT KOBE was bumped at the break then exchanged contact with MASTER THIS a stride later, rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened stride mid-stretch. The latter exchanged contact with Sargent Kobe
leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
WELLING raced in the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid leaving the half mile pole and improved steadily from that point, rounded the far
turn off the rail, eased out leaving the turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and edged clear later yards. MR HOOVER rated the pace inside, came under
pressure toward the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, was met past the eighth pole then weakened in later yards. JUMPSTER saved
early ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out entering the
stretch and came along for third mid-stretch. KRUG rated close toward the inside, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path then flattened in the lane. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled in the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. GRAND
MANNER stalked the early pace in the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the quarter pole and faded in the
three path on the far turn. ZAP MAN settled off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. CALL ME GUSTO stalked the early pace about
the four path, faded leaving the second turn and was eased.

Footnotes
JUDY'S ARMY rated close about the three path the first turn, moved outside into the backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five
path on the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on. LOST WEEKEND was bumped outward and into Thename Of
Thegame leaving the gate then saved ground, started his bid approaching the three eighths pole, angled to the seven path on the far turn and finished well
to take second late yards while gaining on the winner. VERBIER saved ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but was blocked in the four
path approaching the top of the lane, eased out leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. CAJUN JOE rated the early pace off the
rail, was met passing the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, was caught leaving the eighth
pole and weakened mid-stretch. OZONE veered outward and made contact with Lost Weekend leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, took a slim brief lead three wide at the quarter pole and remained a factor through the far turn, but flattened stride mid-stretch.
TREJO raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch. CIRCLE THE MOON stalked the early
pace from the three path, took the lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole and was pressured toward the three eighths, gave up the lead while between horses
at the quarter then weakened in the lane. THENAME OF THEGAME was bumped leaving the gate and never factored.

Footnotes
BARBERS POINT took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, dueled clear at the rail midway on the
far turn and was steadily handled to extend her lead. FOXY SISTA stalked off the rail then challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced close into the far
turn but dropped back midway on the turn and settled for second best. LUCKY BLONDE came away a bit awkwardly then saved ground, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and closed to take third the final strides. SOMEBODY LOVES ME dropped well back
while saving ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled out leaving the turn and finished well outside.
QUEEN NEFERTARI saved ground just off the early pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
JUBASLILBALLERINA raced in the three path the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and
weakened. NO DENYING DENIS rounded the first turn off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SMOKIN LADY took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
held well under steady handling. APPEALING ROAD rated off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail,
eased out leaving the turn and finished well to take second later yards. GLOBAL EMPRESS stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and
raced close off the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. WOODSONG'S CASTLE settled inside on the first turn, gave chase past
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled out into the lane but showed little further. JACKYSINTHECASTLE settled in the three
path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened. LOVE OF GRACE rounded the first
turn about the three path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then weakened. DASHING
LASS was unprepared for the start then reared and lost her rider.
