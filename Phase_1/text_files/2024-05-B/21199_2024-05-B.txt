for the lead on the inside for a half but lacked the late response. PINK HIGGINS had no early speed and showed little. MR. BUTCH WOMBLE went to the

Footnotes
TOOTOO TOURIST went to the front and set all the pace while being unchallenged and drew off in the stretch. PNEUMA stalked the pace from three wide
down the backstretch then moved up on the turn but was not match for the winner. CUPIE CUTIE prompted the pace from two wide to the three furlong
marked and weakened but was able to hold on for the show. SHE'S MO FANCY was shuffled back on the first turn then was allowed to settle near the back
through the final turn and passed tired ones in the stretch. MISS TERRE raced off the pace on the inside while racing evenly and didn't make a bid. MONEY
IS TIME trailed the field around the first turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch but was never a factor. BALITRIX raced in the middle of the pack from
the two path to the half mile marker and dropped back.

Footnotes
TIZ SWEET CANDY sprinted to the lead and slowly inched away to prove best. SMARTY'S ANGEL raced off the pace four wide to the turn then moved in to
two wide on the turn but couldn't catch the winner and proved second best. EUROSTORM was forwardly placed in the three path early then saved ground
on the turn and cut the corner into the stretch to fight gamely in the stretch. ADAYINSPAIN was close up to the pace early then raced in the middle of the
pack on the turn and finished evenly. STEAL ME OVER was off the pace early on the inside then settled in the middle of the pack but was not a factor. RYE
MUNNY was always near the back. STAND BY TIME was bumped on both sides and was pinched back at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RIFEY was last away and steadily advanced down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the turn to make up ground, tipped out to three wide in
upper stretch and drove past the leaders for the win. GOLDEN QUALITY raced near the back early then advanced from two wide going between horses at
the five sixteenths pole and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to make a late rally for the place. RISKY PRIORITY pressed the pace from two wide to
the eighth pole and was outfinished in the stretch but held on for the show. STOMPING HOTROD rushed up the rail to take the lead but was eclipsed at the
eighth pole and tired. MR. TIN MAN broke well and had a brief early lead then settled off the pace and flattened out. MORNING SNOW stalked the pace
from four wide to the turn and retreated. FIELD OF VISION trailed the field and was outrun.

MANNY'S KAT vied from between horses then took command at the half mile marker and inched away on the turn and drew off in the stretch. DARIO raced
off the pace early, moved between horses at the half mile marker and followed the leader around the turn and angled out to three wide in upper stretch but
was tiring and held on for the place. DREAM TIME bumped NOT LIKELY leaving the gate then tracked the leaders down the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and moved out to three wide at the eighth pole for a late run and missed the place. CADILLAC COWBOY vied for the lead from three wide
then fell back on the turn but made a late gain in the stretch and missed the show. ALL SAINTS went to an early pressured lead on the inside then chased
the leader around the turn and gave way. NOT LIKELY was bumped by DREAM TIME leaving the gate, lost action and trailed throughout.
