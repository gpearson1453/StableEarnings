Footnotes
SHIESTY TO CHASE was clear early, drew off at the five-eighths pole, dueled late and dug in for the win. HEAVY HITTER was unrushed early,bid five wide
at the three-eighths pole, dueled through the stretch, poked a head in front late but was outbobbed. ELM STREET stalked the pace inside and lacked a late
bid. LET IT RIDE CLYDE raced in the four path but couldn't gain late. CENTAURO stalked the pace between foes, bid at the quarter pole but then gave
way. WEGOTJACKSBACK saved ground, bid four wide at the quarter pole and improved position late. MR BOBBY BOUCHER was not a factor. SYLVAN
PASS was squeezed back and was checked at the start. FIVE STAR RUN was not a factor while stalking the pace in the three path. BALLYCOTTON BAY
pressed the pace for a half mile in the two path before giving way.

ALWAYS WANTING was quickly over to the rail, taking the lead and lasted under strong urging. MULIMA stalked the early pace in the two path, rallied at
the sixteenth pole but couldn't get to the winner. SHE A BADDIE stalked the pace in the three path with no late bid. REDO stalked the pace between foes,
checked twice at the eighth pole when lacking room and bid belatedly. SPEAK UP stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid. SWANS COVE was
unrushed outside and improved position late inside. RAZZLE RED stalked the pace in the three path with no late bid. RYBAKINA was unrushed early, bid
four wide at the half-mile, was steadied at the eighth pole and faltered in the stretch. UP ON THE EDGE saved ground to no avail.
