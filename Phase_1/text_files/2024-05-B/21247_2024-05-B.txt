Footnotes
LEGAL MANEUVER chased inside, was ridden along the rail around the turn, kicked on up the inside into the final furlong and inched ahead in the final
strides to get the bob. WAR WARRIOR stalked in the four path, was coaxed from the three path into the turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the
lane, and ran on, but was edged out by an inner rival to place. FEAR THE FACTS set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around
the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and kept on, but was edged out by foes on both sides in the final sixteenth to show.

midway around the turn, bid at the top of the lane, but evened out in the final furlong for show. SPANISH GIRL chased in the five path, floated out to the six
path midway around the turn, and made no impact from the eight path in the stretch. IRON SHIELD got bumped by an inner foe at the start, set the pace in

six path in upper stretch, and did not threaten. ALMA PURA broke out and bumped an outer foe, was prompted along from in range in the three path, but
backed up in the two path around the turn. LADY OAKRIDGE got bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path but faded turning into the

FOXY LADY went evenly while racing two wide. KAITIE KAIT was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. PATTY'S HAVING
FUN broke out and bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. WISCO DISCO lost contact, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
FLY THE W rated in the four path, was cued from three wide into the far turn, ranged up to bid from the three path at the top of the lane, and inched ahead
of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. LORD OF WAR set the pace inside, was coaxed early into the far turn, dug in from the two path down the
stretch, but was edged out by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. HOT BLOODED was held up inside of foes turning into the backstretch, tipped out
under rousing midway around the far turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. SIR SAFFER laid up close in the three
path, was coaxed while two wide midway around the far turn, but finished evenly from the four path in the stretch. SWORD ZORRO (IRE) tracked in the two
path, tipped to the rail entering the far turn, but flattened from the three path down the lane. GOLDEN GLIDER raced off the pace in the four path but never
menaced.

Footnotes
R FIREBIRD set the pace in the two path, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and dug in inside foes to just last. SPLURGE prompted the pace
in the four path, dueled outside of the winner through the stretch and lost the headbob in a game try. MISPRINT chased the pace three wide, angled widest
in upper stretch and ran on outside of the top two for the show. KOZEM raced off the pace five wide and had a mild belated rally. RED HOT SPARK chased
the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. MUSICAL JOURNEY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. AVE FENIX played no factor while
racing two and three wide. NIGHTSABER (GB) raced up close at the rail and tired in the drive. TAKING IT ALL pressed the winner in the three path and
faltered in the lane.

DONTMESSWITHTESS brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path early, was roused between foes in the three path going into the far
turn, split rivals with a rush to take command from the four path in upper stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. CABERNET bumped with an inner foe at
the start, laid in range in the four path, was cued into the far turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. TRENDY
brushed with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path, came under right handed encouragement midway around the far turn, floated out to the eight
path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. SINGING SANDRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path, bid from the three path
early into the far turn, stuck his head in front nearing the quarter, but lost the lead while floating out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and flattened in
the final furlong. CLOUD STORAGE rated in the three path, was driven from the two path into the far turn, but made no impact. BEIRA was unhurried from
out in the seven path entering the backstretch, roused from the six path into the far turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, and was no
factor. GROUND STOP tracked in the two path but faded in the stretch. MUSTHAVEBEENLOVE set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead nearing the
quarter, and yielded in the stretch. THANK THE ACADEMY raced off the pace in the two path but never menaced.

Footnotes
URBAN LEGEND laid up close in the four path, bid in hand from the three path midway around the turn, took command passing the quarter, floated out to
the five path while being cued in upper stretch, and kicked away. TRICKY TIGER broke in at the start, chased in the four path, was driven in the two path
around the turn, swung back out to the four path at the top of the stretch, hung on his left lead, and ran on for place. CHEYENNE BRAVE stalked in the four
path, was cued into the far turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. RIVERTRANCE had a slow start, rated in the five path, was
ridden in the two path around the turn, tipped back out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. FOUR BEACH FRIENDS set the pace
in the four path, was coaxed from the two path early around the turn, but lost the lead midway around the turn, and faded. MANHATTAN BOY raced off the
pace in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the turn, but never threatened. DOCTOR'S ORDERS trailed in the six path early and never
menaced. POWER OF JUSTICE tracked in the two path but weakened from the three path in the stretch.
