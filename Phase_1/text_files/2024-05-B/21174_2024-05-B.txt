Footnotes
BORNINASMALLTOWN set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn and held under urging. SHE MYSTERIOUS dropped inside, rallied along the rail on
the turn, bid willingly, couldn't gain on the winner and won the battle for place. EL RAYADO pressed the pace, lacked the needed late response and was
outfinished for second. QUICK TRACK showed good early speed while racing outside, bumped into the turn, fell back and gave way. LIKA DAGGER was
hustled along to press the pace between horses, bumped entering the turn, dropped back and gave way. PANDEMIO was last away, raced wide early,
trailed the field and was not asked.

Footnotes
GOLDEN BAND was never far back, raced inside, bid along the rail on the turn to challenge, dueled for the lead and proved best. GUSHER vied for the
lead, was in tight leaving the turn and again in late stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. POOF HE'S GONE broke through the gate, stalked the
pace, challenged four across on the turn, was in tight entering the stretch, came in late, was steadied and settled for show. MUSICS MY VICE broke
awkwardly to be off slowly, trailed early and finished well. JAZZ TOWN was checked at the start, rallied into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and
closed well. WEALTH N HEALTH was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed rally. BLACK EYED BANDIT swung wide leaving the
turn and lacked a bid. MR. SILVER EXPRESS vied to upper stretch and stopped. ZENFULLY ZESTY saved ground and lacked a stretch response. The
stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference in the stretch. No change was made.

Footnotes
BARBIERE was squeezed after the start, rallied around the second turn, was carried out into the stretch, closed willingly and drew off. BULLAWAY vied to
the second turn, took command, swung wide and was outclosed to finish second best. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was void of early speed, rallied around the
turn, swung wide and finished well to earn show. SILVER DADDY was unhurried early, saved ground, offered a mild bid and was crowded mid stretch.
TEXAS BAD BOY was hustled away from the gate, settled off the pace, came out mid stretch while tiring and crowded his rivals. DOM WAYNE raced mid
pack, was crowded mid stretch and dropped back. BIG MAC DADDY was not a factor. SEXY DEXY set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and
stopped. RYDERS UP was outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry, TEXAS BAD BOY was disqualified and placed sixth for causing interference in the stretch.
PER RULING #2024-RUI-21 FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BROADWAY DISH vied between horses to the turn, assumed command and drew off. RAPPERS THIEF vied inside to the second turn, fell back and
finished second best. BYE BYE BROOKY was never far back, offered a mild bid near the inside and got up for show while no threat to the top two.
ATHENA'S STORM raced close to the pace, angled out on the turn, bid and came up empty. WAY RITE was taken outside and put in an even effort in a
wide trip. ROSE GIRL vied three across to the turn, tired and gave way. SHE HIT A HOMER broke slowly, bid off the rail on the turn and had nothing left.
DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was off slowly, saved ground and lacked a bid. ELDORADO DREAM raced outside and had brief speed only. An objection by the
rider of RAPPERS THIEF against the rider of BROADWAY DISH was not allowed.

PRAY FOR ME RAY saved ground, assumed command along the rail on the turn, drew off and was ridden out. I'MNOTFOREVERYONE set a pressured
pace while racing well off the rail to the second turn, dropped back and finished second best. READY TO STORM moved up along the backstretch to stalk
the pace while racing outside, rallied into the turn to loom a threat, dropped back and held safely for show. ATTILA'S ACE improved position in an even
effort. CHARLIE DYNASTY was slow early, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. JR'S CONFIDENCE was not a factor. COPPER SKY raced
far back and passed tiring rivals. LET EM RIP was through after a half. THIRSTY MOE vied two across, tired into the second turn and stopped.
