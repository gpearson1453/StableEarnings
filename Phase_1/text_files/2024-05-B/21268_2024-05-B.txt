Footnotes
ANOTHERBOTTLE pushed in at the start, settled behind the pace, steered out five wide when advancing exiting the turn, got out a bit in upper stretch, was
straightened, challenged soon after and kicked strongly clear under firm handling. J L PAC MAN broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, got
out a bit to carry a pair of fellow frontrunners out, three path into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the final furlong, came back for the runner up
spot late. MACKAY BOY forwardly placed early in the three path, dropped inside as the three leaders were floating out midway on the turn, brief rail bid
nearing the furlong grounds, also proved no match for the winner, outkicked for the place. SUNNY SASSICAIA pressed the issue for a quarter on the
outside, carried out to be four wide midway on the turn, weakened gradually through the stretch. WELCOMETOARKANSAS reluctant to load, broke in to
affect inner rivals, was quickly straightened to press the pace, vied between foes turn while carried out, weakened in the drive. RITE ON SAM lacked early
foot off the inside, was floated out six wide by the winner tuning for home, lacked a closing kick. WHATTA LIFE restless in the gate, bothered at the start,
failed to menace in remaining back. TWICE AS SASSI also bothered at the start, remained always back as well.

Footnotes
SECOND OF JULY took command from the start, showed the way onto the backstretch, rated into the far turn, called on for run when a pair of rivals came
calling into the stretch, enough left to hold those two off late while along the inside and being fully extended. PACIFICISLANDTIME settled off the pace and
the inside, called on for run when beginning to advance three wide far turn, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, continued to chase past the furlong
marker and was closing the gap late while between horses. KEYS INCLUDED devoid of early foot, rallied four wide into the lane to lose real estate to the
winner as well, was also coming late while widest of the first flight at the wire. WICKED TRICK well back early toward the inside, moved closer from between
horses turning into the stretch, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. SARAH'S VISION reared badly at the start to spot the field several lengths, trailed,
passed tiring rivals while never a threat. INDIMAAJ chased the winner while racing three wide, gave way turning for home. AMERICAN SMOOTH forwardly
placed along the inside for six furlongs, also backed up through the stretch.

BECKY'S TATTOO in the second group while closest to the inside into the turn, steered out for the drive, displayed some late interest to be up for the show,
no threat to the winner. MISS CHARLIE GRAS alternated up front inside the winner, could not match that one in the stretch, caught late for the place.
CHIVE UP in tight, steadied just after the start, moved up to raced in the second flight outside, chased the leaders late turn then went flat through the lane.
GOLDEN SMILES came in just after the start to put CHIVE UP in tight, raced in the second flight between horses, tired in the drive. STARBUCK LUCK

HALF BROTHER in the second early while between horses, went after the early leader into the turn, collared that one and was clear by late in the bend,
maintained a comfortable advantage through the lane under steady handling. MINOR DISCREPANCY in the second flight early four wide, chased the
winner into the lane, could do little with that one the final furlong, clear for the place. MR. B CAUSE kin the second bunch inside the runner up, crept up with
that one late in the turn, also proved no match for the winner to the wire, not enough for the place. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE void of early foot, steered out
around a tiring rival late in the turn, showed some belated interest down the middle of the stretch to improve position. CRIMSON STORM remained back in
lacking a closing response. B MINOR in the second group up the backstretch inside the winner, fell back a bit into the turn, encountered some traffic with a
quarter mile to run, between foes into the lane, went evenly through the stretch. SIR LIAM flashed some early quickness through a lively opening split,
stopped when headed.

Footnotes
MARK THE MOOSE lacked early foot outside, came five to six wide out of the turn, in traffic between horses upper, shifted out widest, late surge to be up at
the wire. COROT back off the pace and the inside, came five wide when advancing into the stretch while inside the winner, challenged soon after, led late,
nailed in the final strides. HEARTTHROB HALO forced out, bumped at the break, moved out when racing back, advanced five wide midturn, fanned seven
wide turning for home, challenged a furlong out, could not match the top two late. VERRAZANO FIRST back off the pace and the inside, four wide out of the
bend, in some traffic midstretch, finished mildly when clear late. GOLD PUNCH broke sharp, soon cleared, set a quick early fraction, maintained daylight
through the turn, began to falter upper stretch, was continuing to tie when he drifted out to impede HOPPERDRIVESTHBOAT in midstretch.
HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT ducked out at the start causing two outer rivals to bump, was straightened and raced off the pace, three wide into the lane,
bothered and put in tight by the early leader, checked up to lose all chance. OUR FREDDIE MAC bumped at the start, trailed much of the way, improved a
bit by passing a couple of tiring rivals. RISKTAKER chased the early leader, began a steady fade after three furlongs. OURPERFECTPRINCE remained
always back.

ROYA closest to the leader, went after that one into the far turn, took over soon after, clear when straightened for home, drifted out and in repeatedly,
responded when confronted by the runner up late, held in the final strides. DASHYNS DREAM back off the pace while toward the inside, moved closer into
the lane, challenged inside the winner late, missed. WORLD WAR lacked early foot, moved closer from between runners late in the final turn, flattened out
in the final furlong to finish up best of the rest. DADDY HEY DADDY forwardly placed while racing outside, had little for the stretch run. CAVE CREEK
devoid of any early speed in trailing most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. AKIANE'S SOLDIER remained
always back in failing to muster a late rally. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN broke alertly from the inside, cleared past the wire the first time, continued to set the
pace onto and up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner when that one came calling far turn then relented and steadily weakened through
the lane.

Footnotes
JESS'S RAINBOW tracked the leader while toward the inside, moved inside and challenged that rival along the rail into the far turn, took over, pulled away
steadily through the lane to win ridden out. ILIMITADA lacked any early sped, continued to trail far turn, rallied five wide out of the final bend, proved
determined for the place position while not a threat to the winner. ROSIE SPRIT settled well off the pace inside, lost some position into the far turn, moved
out and began to move with the runner up inside that one exiting the second turn, outkicked by that same rival for the second spot while also no threat to the
victor. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL five wide into the first turn, off the pace, four wide advance second turn, failed to sustain that bid through the stretch.
SHEZA CAT dwelt at the start to spot the opposition a couple of lengths, raced back and inside, in tight and brushed along the rail upper stretch, finished up
evenly after recovering. REAUX BINA lacked speed, raced off the inside, brushed in some traffic upper, also lacked a closing kick. NICELY UNIFIED
sprinted clear soon after the start, continued show the way up the backstretch just off the inside, allowed the winner the rail into the far turn then began to
falter when headed by that one. DARK SKYER four wide into the first turn, raced in the second flight for a half then gave way.

Footnotes
SASSI D behind the leaders, tipped three wide for the drive, kicked down the two leaders with good late energy to prove best. TACTICAL PRIORITY dueled
up front while off the inside, gained a slightly larger lead before three furlongs, responded when challenged by a second foe entering the straight, outkicked
kicked that rival for the place while unable to match the winner late. THE BOYZ PRIORITY stalked the two leaders from the outside into the turn, advanced
and challenged three wide into the stretch, long drive for the place, outkicked for that position while also proving no match for the winner in the waning
strides. CUSTOM BOBBY'S last to leave, asked early, advanced, moved out, came three wide for the drive, displayed some mild late interest. LE
MONSTRE RAPIDE dueled up front inside the runner up in the early going, began to weaken late in the turn. CHAD'S FLASH remained back and made
little impact. TRIPPLE D RULLER raced in mid pack and outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. FIREINTHESTORM trailed
throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MY SUGAR FIX vied early while between horses, fell back the middle three furlongs, dropped inside, rebid along the rail past the furlong marker, kicked well
clear under confident handling. MALLORY UNBRIDLED back off the early pace and the inside, lodged an early move four wide into the turn, challenged not
long after, dueled into and through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, held the place. COSTA LADY back early, moved up to race in the
second flight while in the two path, shifted out a bit for the drive when under the crop, up late for the show. MALLORY'S OCEAN narrowly set the early pace
off the inside, larger lead into the turn, responded when challenged and dueled into and through upper stretch, weakened a bit late to lose the show in the
final strides. SUGAR CANE GAL last away, advanced four wide through the early part of the turn, got out to be six wide late in the bend then saw that
progress stall to finish up evenly. DR. BOO fell back to trail after the start, improved position while never posing a serious threat. GLORIOUS GEARS in the
second flight early, began a steady fade before a half. KRAFTY TAFFY showed some brief early speed and backed up. CHIMES LAKE in the second flight
early, stopped, jogged in.
