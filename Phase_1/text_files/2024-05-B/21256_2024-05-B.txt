Footnotes
CRAZY CAVALIER hard to load prior to the start, chased the top pair under urging up the backstretch, drew closer around the turn, launched a bid inside
QUINTECENTS in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole, shifted out to bother that rival at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. WITHOUT BORDERS
settled off the rail then moved inside, ran into traffic at the quarter pole, tipped out into the stretch, finished well and got up for second. QUINTECENTS
pressed early then fought on even terms up the backstretch, put away inner rival at the quarter pole, challenged by CRAZY CAVALIER in upper stretch and
clung to a short lead at the eighth pole, was overtaken shortly after while drifting in a bit, steadied when that rival shifted out at the sixteenth pole and got
edged for the place. GAELIC NATION (IRE) chased out of range along the rail into the turn, was making progress under urging from the rail on the bend
then had to pause from the five-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, tipped three wide into the lane and could not offer the needed late kick in the late stages.
CLASSIC ALPHIE coaxed from the gate, traveled near the back then trailed early, saved ground through the turn, moved out approaching the eighth pole
and passed tired rivals. TOMORROWNEVERCOMES sat off the pace, left the backstretch two wide, moved out and came four wide into the lane but
weakened in the stretch. DEVILNTHEBLUEGRAS brushed the gate and came away slow, trailed early then went outside a rival towards the rear, traveled
three wide then angled out and spun five wide into the stretch but could not become a factor. WHEREVER YOU ARE broke alertly and led early under
pressure then dueled with QUINTECENTS, fought along the rail to the five-sixteenths pole, could not kick on with the leader with a quarter mile remaining
and gave way in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CRAZY CAVALIER FROM FIRST TO THIRD FOR SHIFTING
OUT AND CAUSING QUINTECENTS TO STEADY AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE WHICH COST THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
DRAMATIZER tucked inside out of range early, moved into a forward position early on the backstretch, challenged along the fence at the five-sixteenths
pole, kicked clear from SWEET HELLO at the quarter pole, then widened under urging through the lane. SWEET HELLO showed speed outside a rival then
cleared three wide on the clubhouse turn and shifted over to the two path, controlled the pace up the backstretch, tested by DRAMATIZER at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost command shortly after, failed to keep pace with the new leader at the quarter pole, churned on through the lane and secured the
place. VULIN tracked two then three wide early, stalked outside a rival into the far turn, roused three wide at the five-sixteenths pole but could not offer the
needed response to kick on with DRAMATIZER, continued off the rail to the lane and weakened in the final furlong. DE JORIA broke a step slow from
inside, trailed two then three wide on the first turn, passed a rival on the backstretch, remained three wide on the far turn and never threatened. KEEP
YOUR COIL broke well and showed speed inside a rival into the first turn, took a stalking position in the two path around the bend, dropped back on the
backstretch, drifted out at the quarter pole and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
REFOCUS trailed off the inside then moved to the rail for the turn, asked left handed leaving the bend, moved out in upper stretch, closed fast and surged
between rivals late to get up at the wire. SPECIAL CLUB chased the leaders outside a rival in to the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, drew alongside BEER
MONEY and took over at the sixteenth pole but got nailed at the wire. BEER MONEY raced up close three deep early then raced outside the leader into the
turn, put the pressure on around the bend, grabbed the lead in upper stretch but got outkicked in the last sixteenth. IMMELMANN raced up close on the
inside, waited behind the leader on the turn, tipped off the fence at the top of the stretch, altered back to the inside and finished evenly late. DONNIE THE
CHIRO away quickly to take the front, held a short lead over outer rival through the turn, lost command in upper stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth.
THIRSTY THURSDAY broke well then settled outside a rival off the pace, roused two wide past the quarter pole, moved out a bit in the drive and could not
rally. SMOKEM EZ off a length slow to begin, traveled along the inside near the back, cut the corner into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BLAZING BARDOT had speed three deep into the first turn then ceded command around the bend, stalked three deep up the backstretch, bid three then
two wide on the far turn, took over into the lane, put DONITA ROSE away in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. HIGH FLYING GRACIE trailed two
wide early, moved into range on the backstretch, moved over to the rail on the far turn, kept trying through the lane to gain second but could not reach the
winner. DONITA ROSE fought for the lead five wide into the first turn then cleared inner rivals and dove down to the inside, set a pressured pace in the
middle stages, cleared briefly at the five-sixteenths pole before being confronted by BLAZING BARDOT, drifted out a bit at the quarter pole but was quickly
corrected, lost command entering the lane and weakened in the furlong grounds. SKY SAILING vied between rivals early then chased in the two path,
moved up to apply pressure outside the leader on the backstretch, started to lose contact with the leaders midway around the far turn before having to
pause briefly when DONITA ROSE drifted out at the quarter pole, chased off the rail into the lane and faded. R MARILYN LONHRO got put in tight racing up
close along the fence into the first turn, continued to give chase from the rail to the second bend, asked around the far turn and weakened down the lane.
FIAMINA forwardly placed four wide into the first turn then dropped back out of range, trailed three wide into the far turn, two wide into the lane and came up
empty.

Footnotes
HIGHLANDS settled along the rail, angled out on the far turn and loomed four wide entering the lane, drew alongside the leader past the eighth pole and
proved best in the last sixteenth. DENDERA rated behind the leader along the rail, shifted to the two path around the far turn, challenged from outside past
the quarter pole, cleared in upper stretch, confronted by HIGHLANDS in the furlong grounds and got outkicked in deep stretch and held second. QUARIA
THUNDER moved to the inside and was allowed to settle early, went two wide around the far turn, moved into range entering the lane, bid inside the top
pair with a sixteenth remaining and missed second. WARRIOR LADY broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, advanced along the fence on the far turn,
cut the corner into the lane and flattened out. FRAZZLED took control early and showed the way along the inside, challenged from outside past the quarter
pole, lost command at the top of the lane and weakened. SMART KITTEN stalked the pacesetter two wide or outside a rival, chased three deep at the
quarter pole and faded. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
ARROGATES SPIRIT stalked in the two path around the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit while well out of range up the backstretch, made steady
progress under a hand urging on the far turn, took aim two wide into the lane, quickly took over in upper stretch and put away the old leader, met
challengers from outside in the furlong grounds and gamely prevailed. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS broke out and bumped outer rival at the start, tracked
four wide while outside a pair of rivals on the clubhouse turn, continued off the fence up the backstretch, drew closer three then four wide into the stretch,
bumped with inner rival at the top of the lane, challenged between rivals with a furlong remaining, battled through deep stretch but could not get by the
winner. FIREMAN DAN chased between rivals in the two path towards the rear, made some progress in the middle stages, angled out on the far turn and
spun five wide into the lane, fought three deep in the final furlong and got outkicked by the top pair. POTENTIAL SPAM unhurried from inside, moved off the
rail on the backstretch, chased two wide into the second bend moved back inside then came off the rail into the lane, tipped out and bumped with a rival in
upper stretch, lacked space approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. SYNTACTIC bumped with inner rival at the start, trailed four deep
on the first turn, moved inward on the backstretch, traveled along the rail then two wide on the second bend and passed tired rivals. WORSE READ
SANCHEZ got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, reserved three deep in the early going, traveled outside a rival at the back into the far turn, entered
the lane three wide and failed to menace. WINNING BIG tracked three wide on the first turn, ridden along while saving ground on the far turn and weakened
down the lane. THRUST hustled from the gate and cleared early, drew away on the first turn, opened up a large lead on the backstretch, held a diminishing
lead through the far turn, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and gave way.

PORT ELLEN (IRE) stalked along the rail, waited for room behind the leads on the far turn, found a seam and bid between in upper stretch, put a head in
front with a sixteenth remaining and dug in to prevail. PINK WHITNEY rated in the two path outside the leader then moved up on even terms on the
backstretch, fought two wide through the far turn and inched ahead approaching the stretch, battled between rivals in the furlong grounds and got outkicked
by the winner in deep stretch. MARINAS TINA (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, moved into range between rivals past the half-mile pole,
tipped out into the lane, bid outside rivals in upper stretch, fought gamely to the wire but could not find the needed final kick. CAMERON SLOUGH reserved
in the two early on, lagged behind on the backstretch, chased along the rail into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend, angled out widest in
the lane and came with a late run but was too late. WEEMISSGRAMMY stepped to the front and set the tone from inside, dueled past the midway point, lost
command late on the far turn, battled to the eighth pole and folded. NOTIME FOR SQUALLS was a bit rank when trying to rate in the two path, moved
outside the top pair on the backstretch, chased three deep on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ROLL ON BIG JOE brushed inner rival leaving the gate, showed early speed then ceded command and stalked in hand past the half-mile pole, traveled
along the rail around the bend, tipped two wide into the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch, led clear with a sixteenth to go and held gamely in the final
strides. TARANTINO got brushed lightly by the winner in the beginning, tracked four then five wide around the turn, finished well from outside and was
gaining to the wire but ran out of time. ULTIMATE broke well from outside and was forwardly placed early, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three
path around the bend then came back out a bit into the stretch, launched a bid from outside but was turned away in the final sixteenth. PRINCIPE CARLO
stalked early then went up to duel from inside leaving the backstretch, inched clear around the turn, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. MISTER ICEMAN settled inside early, moved into striking range approaching the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. KATAR hit the gate to
break a hair slow, went up to vie for the lead with rivals on both sides then dueled outside PRINCIPE CARLO leaving the backstretch, could not keep up
with that rival approaching the quarter pole, got put in a bit tight three wide between rivals entering the lane and waekened. JOE DON LOONEY stalked off
the inside, rounded the bend three then four wide and weakened when called upon.

Footnotes
UNCLE REG chased from off the pace and steered to the inside, drew closer while easing out around the bend, tipped out to launch a bid at the top of the
stretch, took over outside the eight pole and kicked clear to win going away. QUALITY WINS stalked off the inside, bid three deep at the three-eighths pole,
fought with rivals on both sides in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to secure second. RUSSELLS HUSTLE
brushed on both sides at the start, stalked the pacesetter in range up the backstretch and moved inside, waited behind the leader while saving ground
around the bend, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out in the furlong grounds and finished willingly while unable to obtain second. LEGITIFY (IRE)
cleared and crossed over early, met bids from a pair of challengers at the three-eighths pole, maintained command through the turn, lost command in upper
stretch and weakened. ZAFIRO ANEJO brushed outer rival leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch, altered out at the eighth
pole and improved position. J B STRIKES BACK brushed with inner foe in the beginning, showed speed then ceded command to LEGITIFY (IRE) early, bid
between rivals into the turn, could not keep up in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. SUPREME COAST brushed the gate to lose a step,
chased along the inside towards the rear, angled three wide leaving the turn and failed to menace. ANTIBES chased outside SUPREME COAST near the
back, coaxed along around the turn, spun three wide into the lane and offered no response.
