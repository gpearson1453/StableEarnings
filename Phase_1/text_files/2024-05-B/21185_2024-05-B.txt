Footnotes
TENSAS LU LU emerged to set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn while in a steady hand ride then drew off in the upper stretch and was ridden out
to the wire to prove best. SPOOKY SPICE chased the pace while two wide, then bid on the turn to gain second position in the late stretch but did not have
enough to catch the cleared leader. ART QUEEN was unhurried early, then came out three wide leaving the bend and rallied too little in the stretch. CINCO
GAL stalked the pace while in a determined drive throughout, could not overcome the leader heading into the turn and flattened out in the remaining
furlongs. ELENA MAE chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs then lacked rallying in the second half of the course. QUEEN OF THUNDER
was no factor.

LEA ME BE moved up along the inside to battle for the lead with outer foes into the turn, rallied grudgingly in the early stretch to shake clear and held on
well to the end to prevail. OPTIMAL TRIP was unhurried early, then rallied leaving the bend and was gaining ground in the final yards and was up for the
place position. GOLD BARON stalked the battling trio while three to four wide, continued to urge steadily on the turn, then dug in gamely in the early stretch
and got up for the show prize in the end. CASTILLE veered inwardly and startled rivals then led the way, was met with rivals from the inside to battle on the
turn, was in a gamely rally but could not regain the lead in the early stretch and gave way. COLONEL BARTON was hindered at the start, then moved up to
vie between rivals heading into the turn, was in hard drive heading into the stretch, could not retain bid and gave way in the final yards. CAPTAIN JACK was
pinched back at the start, then chased the pace briefly from the inside and failed to rally in the end. There was an INQUIRY in regards to interference at the
start of the race. After review, no change was made to the order of finish.

bend to confront the pace setter, gained second position in the late stretch but did not have enough to claim victory in the end. RIPSTER moved up to set
the pace from the inside, was challenged by rivals from both sides in the early stretch, was impeded by DARYLS TRUMP CARD from the outside, steadied
slightly then kept on for the show prize. SUMMER HELP pressed the pace while three wide into the turn, then bid mildly at the quarter pole but did not fire in
the lane. TEXAN FARMER chased the pace while three wide, then bid eagerly on the turn before flattening out in the stretch. CASINO MO was no menace.
FLAT OUT PERFECT raced flat throughout while chasing the pace and needed rally in the end. There was an INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION. The
rider of RIPSTER claimed foul against the rider of DARYLS TRUMP CARD for interference in the late stretch. After reviewing the replay, DARYLS TRUMP
card was disqualified from first and placed third for lugging in and hindering rival.

Footnotes
SKYVIEW DRIVE moved between rivals on the first turn to set the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn, then was
challenged by outer foes at the top of the stretch, was in an all out drive while maintaining the lead by head and lasted to the wire to prevail. MADE AN
OFFER broke outwardly and bumped rivals, then moved from the four path into the first turn, stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into
the far turn, then vied between rivals at the top of the stretch and in a hard drive throughout and hung at the wire. UTSIRA was forwardly placed along the
inside to stalk the pace down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, rallied in the early stretch, could not find room, angled outward
and finished gamely for the show prize. COMMANDEERESS raced in the middle of the fields from the inside, was moving up to bid while three wide on the
far turn, battled with inner rivals in the late stretch, lacked the winning bid and missed the show prize in the end. CHARMING LEAH drifted out at the start,
led the way early, then settled back to stalk the pace setter while two wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, angled out to the five path then gave
way while in a mild drive in the lane. KOLLYNS JULIE broke inwardly and bumped rival, was allowed to settle along the inside towards the back, then bid
while three wide on the far turn and came up flat in the stretch. OUR GIRL FLINT was unhurried early and no threat. SO THEY SAY was forced outwardly
by a drifting rival heading into the first turn and failed to menace. ERIA VITTATA was impeded at the start, then bore out seven to eight wide heading into
the first turn and was no factor.

CRESSONS LIL CHARM veered outwardly at the start, then chased the pace while four wide into the turn, then closed belatedly down the lane and was up
in time to prevail. BALI GIRLEE pressed the pace while two wide, then inched up to go shoulder to shoulder with the pace setter leaving the turn, gained
command at the eighth pole then was caught in the final yards and was second best. MIZZ FACTOR broke outwardly then set the pace from the inside, was
met with an outer rival to duel leaving the bend, then was out finished in the late stretch and held the show position. MISS ROSE chased the pace from the
inside, then bid while two wide on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. HI LEE FAVOREDCATS chased the pace while two wide, then bid mildly
between rivals on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. SHE'S SPELLBOUND stalked the pace from the three path and in a hard drive, was used up
on the turn then flattened out along the inside. MARIA'S MOONSHINE was no factor.

Footnotes
CANADA CANDY pursued the pace while three wide into the turn, then dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to edge past the pace setter and was up in
the final strides to prevail. PHUNK led the way while two wide, was in the clear on the turn and into the early stretch, then was out finished by an outer foe in
the final yards. BLACKENED chased the pace while two wide, was in a long drive leaving the turn, lacked the winning bid in the stretch and was best for
third place. MARIAH'S CANDY raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, bid on the turn, then angled out four wide and closed willingly too late. TWO
HANDS FULL was allowed to settle along the inside, then rallied in the late stretch and came up empty in the end. DONNAS FINAL WORD was unhurried
early, rallied in the late stretch while three wide but it was to no avail in the end. WATCH THIS MUNNY settled towards the back of the pack between rivals,
then bid while four wide on the turn and did not fire in the stretch. STAN'S GOLDEN PATH chased the pace from the inside while in steady drive throughout
then lacked rallying in the stretch. GO GO GO was unhurried early and no threat. MY BABYS GONE raced outside of rivals while four wide and lacked
bidding after the turn and was no threat.

Footnotes
EUROROCKSTAR moved up along the inside to take command at the half pole, remained in steady hand ride throughout the turn then pulled away in the
stretch and was ridden out to the end to prove much the best. CAPTAINS COVE saved ground down the backstretch while racing at the back, came out five
wide leaving the turn, gained second position mid stretch but did not have enough to catch the leader. RED DRAW stalked the pace from the inside at a
moderate pace in the early furlongs, then rallied mildly leaving the bend and got up for the show position in the end. TEXAS CLUBMAN stalked the pace
while five wide and outside of rivals, then bid on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. RUSTY GADGET prompted the pace while four wide, then
moved up to vie for the lead briefly at the half, was outbid by an inner foe, continued to press the leader on the turn then gave way in the stretch.
RICHARD'S TX BLING settled at the back, then bid mildly from the inside in the stretch and was no threat. COWTOWN FLYER settled at the back while two
wide and failed to rally. EAGLEFORD led the way early, then vied between rival at the half, lost command then lost momentum on the turn and stopped.
