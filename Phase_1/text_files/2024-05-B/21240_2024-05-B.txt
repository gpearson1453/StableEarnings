turn, battled under a drive while on ever terms for the advantage into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and tired but was clear for the
show. MISTER MONOCLONAL broke awkwardly and was very slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along at the rear, saved ground

advancing to take command at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final
sixteenth. GHOSTLY GIRL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing and yielded the front with three furlongs
to go, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. TRY IT AGAIN
coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. FIRST CLASS CAT chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. MAGGIE chased four then three wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired. TAKE TIME TO DREAM chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the

ST. BENEDICTS PREP chased the solo leader, gained while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn, rallied to the lead into the stretch then
quickly kicked clear, drew away while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and proved much the best under strong urging. IRISH JACKSON raced well
back in the field, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide, came four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. ROMAN
GODDESS was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the strech and lacked the needed response while best of
the rest. DIVINE CROSS was urged along at the rear on the outside, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn and was no factor then was
transported off the track via the equine ambulance. LA GROTTE was hustled from the gate then coaxed along on the inside of foe, came under stronger
encouragement late on the backstretch, raced in the three then four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. CONTROLLED
TEMPER was recalcitrant in the warm-up, quickly sped clear then opened up a sizable advantage, dropped from the three path to the two path on the turn,
was collared into the stretch and tired.

that foe continued inwards, raced along the inside through the first turn detached at the tail of the field, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, made ground on the top trio and swung six wide into upper stretch
before tipping out an additional path or two straightened away and offered up a mild kick. WAKE UP LAUREN broke in at the start bumping and then
squeezing back JITTERBUG against PAST TENSE, advanced and assumed command going three then two wide through the first turn before settling just
off the inside in hand down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under coaxing at the three-eighths as JUST MUSIC advanced
outside, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
MUCHO MAMA MIA was slow into stride and spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the rear, was roused late on the backstretch, went two then
three wide on the turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to make a bid nearing the sixteenth-pole then inched away late under strong
handling. PROPER GRAMMAR broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside of two foes while along the rail on the turn, shook
clear when asked for her best in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. PRACTICAL MISS settled off the pace,
moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide under urging on the turn, came seven wide into the
stretch and got up for the show. JAY'S LOVE settled on the outside, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, made a bid early on the turn, vied in the three
path on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, moved out nearing the sixteenth-pole and tired. LADY FORTUNA was
urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LEADERSHIP ABILITY drifted out while
going to the front, showed the way while well out in the track, moved in late on the backstretch, was asked in the two path while between foes on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch and faded. ALTERINA was reluctant to load, broke out and was off slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field while
taking short strides, went three to four wide on the turn and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
LA BANQUERA dueled three to four paths off the inside with the runner up to his inside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling through to the finish and leaned on GEOPOLITICS a sixteenth from home, dug in
gamely to prevail on the wire. GEOPOLITICS dueled inside of the aforementioned foe coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive headed for command a furlong out, came under a left handed crop and came outwards as LA BANQUERA came in,
got leaned on a stride or two a sixteenth out and fought on game but could never get on near even terms through the final eighth and was bested at the end.
EMPIRE MAGIC broke in brushing the off side stall when away half a beat slow, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. AUNT YOLA coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. NIKKI BRAINBURST fractious in the gate prior to the start, got backed out
and reloaded, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. FOXY FRANCES chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. DANCE ON AIR coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. I'M
KIDDING chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, folded. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into

Footnotes
ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA went to the front, showed the way on the inside while inside of an opponent, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole then was set
down after turning into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until thrown in by the rider outside the eighth-pole, extended the advantage under a strong
hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. BE OF COURAGE was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear, was reserved in the two then three path, came under urging on the final turn, spun four
wide into the stretch, passed foes on the outside before the furlong marker, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole then bothered two rivals and finished with
good courage for the place. BORN DANCER was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final
furlong, was bumped by a foe that was forced in near the sixteenth-pole and secured the show. BAR FOURTEEN prompted the pace on the outside in the
two path, was asked late on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, was forced in near the sixteenth-pole, bumped with a
foe then checked at that juncture and settled for fourth. LET'S GO BIG BLUE was taken under a tight hold early then reserved on the inside, continued to
save ground while roused on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. KING OF
COMEDY moved in early, was rated in the two path, came under urging near the seven-sixteenths pole, brushed with a foe in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. SELL SOMETHING checked in tight between horses leaving the chute, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside but
with the benefit of cover, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CLEVER FOREVER
came out leaving the chute then was taken in hand, raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved on the outside without cover, chased three wide
on the far turn, brushed with an opponent in upper stretch and came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A JOCKEY OBJECTION, BE
OF COURAGE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH-POLE

Footnotes
KRYSTALHEIR broke open the stall door just after ECHO IN ETERNITY broke through the gate prior to the start, chased four to five wide down the
backstretch prompting the leader, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive latched on to the inside of the leader, seized command a sixteenth from home and dug in gamely to prevail. CHASING
DAYLIGHT showed the way in hand six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught at the sixteenth pole, fought on loosely between foes through to the
finish. FOXY CARA stumbled at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was ultimately repelled by the top pair. DUCKPHAT chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to the end. JOEY THE FISH
chased four then two wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. ECHO IN ETERNITY
broke through the gate prior to the start inspiring KRYSTALHEIR to break open her stall door, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, tipped five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MOONAGE DAYDREAM settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead into the final
furlong, kicked clear outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. SOLIB moved in while settling off the pace, shifted from the rail to the two path
on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong and finished fast but was too late while clear for the place. MZ BIG BUCKS was well
placed just off the pace on the inside, chased on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, made a bid outside the furlong marker but was out-kicked
while able to get the show. SOLOSHOT settled just off the pace, was asked three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid
before the furlong marker but was also out-kicked. SPOOKY LADY stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the turn, spun
three wide into the stretch, battled between foes from the furlong marker to the sixteenth-pole and weakened. CALDWELL LUVS GOLD leaned out at the
start, was urged along on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. AUTUMN GLORY settled off the pace, was roused in the
two to three path on the turn and lacked the needed response. TRUE EMPRESS broke out and was off a step slow, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor. CONCERTI set the pace under some pressure, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. SNOWY EVENING settled
towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor. RIBOT'S VALENTINE settled on the inside, saved ground
on the turn and failed to respond. DREAM CENTRAL broke a step slow, angled in at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn and trailed.
