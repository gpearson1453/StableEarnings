Footnotes
FRAC RIGHT took command from the onset, put away the early speed foe that was applying mild pressure on the outside by mid-turn and drew away
convincingly when asked at the furlong pole. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN broke out, bumping outside rival to almost dislodge his rider on the start, recovered
to track the front duo outside in the second flight down the back straight and closed belatedly in the three path down the lane to be a distant second with a
good effort, nonetheless. NAMEOFTHEGAME was bumped by the inside rival on the brake, recouped quickly to prompt the pace outside down the back
straight, had little left to give when repelled by the winner, easily, at the quarter pole and faded with a furlong remaining to hold for the show money. PLAY
THE DOTS stalked near the rear having only one beaten down the backside, closed the gap on the challengers by the quarter pole, shifted outside in the
five path for the drive, had to alter course to the outside when behind a weaving rival at the furlong pole and mildly finished up to settle on the fringes.
MAGIC RUSH tracked the engaged leaders on the rail in the early going, was roused for more three eighths out travelling on the fence, could not quicken
with rivals through the turn and was one paced in the stretch. GRAN ADONIS settled all alone in mid-pack down the backstretch, made a strong move
circling three wide around foes at the five sixteenths marker, loomed in the four path at the top of the lane, lugged in even though urged left-handed in the
stretch and wilted in the final eighth. J M R TURF ALY broke outwards on the start, was under a vigorous ride along the backside trying to catch the field,
lost touch around the bend and was never involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LOIS LEN shadowed the pacesetter in the early going, was smartly reined back, watching the front pair through the turn, maintained position when nudged
for more, inside a rival making a move with five sixteenths remaining and rallied in the three path between horses to wear down the frontrunner the final
seventy yards. SILENT GUROO assumed command from the start, dictated the pace on the turn with only mild pressure on her outside, opened up mildly
straightening out for home and gave way grudgingly to the winner in deep stretch. HARD TO CAPTURE travelled in mid-division three deep outside of
horses at the half, started a good rally three wide outside foes by mid-turn, loomed the threat in the five path in upper stretch, could not sustain the run and
stalled in the final furlong to be a clear third. BLAZING SKY stalked outside foes ahead of one rival at the half mile marker, began to pick off runners three
wide with five sixteenths from home, shifted out to the five path for the stretch run and ran on willingly to garner a minor share in the end. ANTIGONE settled
on the rail tracking the front duo down the backside, saved ground but could not make any progress on the turn and finished up only evenly in the stretch
drive. SYSTEMATIC reared up at the start almost dislodging the rider, trailing early, shifted outside four deep making a premature move down the backside
passing rivals, chased the pacesetter on the turn, was still in with a chance for a share in the four path at the top of the lane but emptied out with a sixteenth
left to run. ENGLISH BISCUIT could see the field with five furlongs to go, made no impact going around the oval and found some late energy to pass weary
foes driving to the finish line. VALLEY GIRL tracked the front two outside in the beginning, was asked for more with three furlongs to go, offered little
response on the turn, mildly re-rallied for a moment turning for home but could not be a menace running to the wire. GABBY SQUARED stalked on the
fence near the back of the pack in the early going, could not get interested on the rail around the bend and was not a factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
DIXIERIBSY emerged from the pack with a clear lead at the five furlong marker going quite comfortably on the front end, opened up with a quarter left to go
and was kept to the task down the lane to hold safe for the victory. SMILES FOR DAVID prompted the pace outside down the back straight, chased the
winner through the turn, continued to not give in, still trying to reel in the frontrunner leader in the stretch and stayed on stubbornly to bested the rest at the
finish line. KRYPTO GAINS co-trailed on the outside at the half, began to smartly pick up horses three wide at the quarter pole, angled out with momentum
in the four path turning for home and finished up with good energy to just miss out closing in for the place share at the wire. HOT OMELET was situated
three deep outside horses in mid-division down the backside, began to close in three wide under right-handed encouragement with five sixteenths from the
wire, was in the hunt three wide at the top of the stretch dueling for the place share, could not find more late and faded between rivals with a sixteenth left to
run. ROOKIE COURT settled in midfield on the rail, lost positions hugging the fence throughout the turn and picked up one runner through the lane.
FOREVER DANISH travelled between runners in the two path in mid-pack in the beginning, offered a brief turn of foot two wide with five sixteenths left to
run, could not find more at the top of the lane and wilted in mid-stretch. MORE GELATO was unhurried to co-trail on the inside down the back straight, could
not match strides with fellow rivals around the bend and passed a tired foe in deep stretch.

Footnotes
BIRCH BARK exchanged light contact with a rival at the start and soon after, settled in behind the leader on the first turn content to track that one from off
the rail, moved a bit nearer the rail saving some ground on the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch drawing nearer and with aim, took the lead a
furlong out and forged clear under steady handling. IRON PRINCESS quickly moved to the lead, shifted in on the first turn and was geared down rating at
the front-end while dictating terms, extended the margin continuing to set the tempo up the backstretch, was clear to the top of the stretch when asked,
collared a furlong out and no match for the winner but second best. RUMOURS FLY stalked from outside mostly three to four wide through the turns and
mid-pack, was encouraged along outside the quarter pole but failed to rally while continuing one-paced. SILENT DIVA exchanged light bumps at the start
and just after, stalked from between foes early, continued the pursuit from inside on the far turn into upper stretch but could only go on evenly. SIX FOR A
NINE was taken back and switched out off the rail heading into the first turn, steadied on heels about the six- and one-half, was hard to control in behind
runners for the next sixteenth and steadying again, settled down heading up the backstretch then made a swift advance between foes to regain contact
chasing mid-pack, could not sustain the effort and weakened thereafter. SAKE AND SUSHI bumped with a rival lightly at the start, steadied when in tight
entering the first turn, continued racing in tight quarters along the inside on that bend, steadied again near the four- and one-half dropping back to last, came
out turning for home, finished up tired while not persevered with late.

BRIDGE TO NOWHERE was allowed to settle at the rear inside down the back straight, caught up to the pack on the rail by mid-turn, began to extend her
stride angling out at the quarter pole, was six abreast outside with clear running room straightening out to the wire and was going the best late to draw off in
the final seventy yards. KANTBACKOFF stalked near the rear inside in the early going, got to the outside of challengers by the half, rallied smartly three
wide at the quarter pole, battled five wide in the thick of things at the top of the stretch and determinedly fought on between horses at the furlong marker to
be a game runner up at the wire. O WOW travelled in mid-pack on the outside in the second tier down the backstretch, took closer order by the half,
pounced three wide going in hand outside foes at the quarter pole, drifted out in the stretch running under left handed urging trying to switch leads and
stalled in the final sixteenth to settle for third money. TEMPORA settled on the rail in the second flight down the backside, improved on the fence to sit just
behind the frontrunner through the turn, waiting to move, shifted off the rail to be in the four path threatening in upper stretch, lost its path when the inside
rival drifted out through the stretch drive, shifted inwards for the final furlong but could not regroup late finishing one paced in deep stretch. BIG GINGER
forced the pace early on inside, was taken back at the half, re-engaged on the outside of the pacesetter around the bend, bid with rivals on either side in the
two path turning for home, could not find more late and yielded with an eighth left to run. SWIRLING DANCER took command from the outside down the
backstretch, set the pace while hounded on the outside throughout the turn, was clinging up front on the fence at the top of the lane, had little left for the
finish and retreated on the rail at the furlong pole.STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 TEMPORA AGAINST #5 O WOW THROUGH

Footnotes
MITOLE POWER tracked from inside mid-pack racing in the two path, moved nearer the rail cutting the corner inside a foe past the quarter pole, angled
three to four wide at the top of the stretch with aim on the leader, wore that one down and edged past late. SPECTACULAR FORCE settled off the leaders
inside, saved ground on the turn, fanned out a few paths leaving that bend before drifting back nearer the rail, angled out five wide in mid- to late-stretch,
was gaining late. WHISKEY N ICE set the pace from early on, moved clear up the backstretch shifting in a bit but still off the rail, dictated terms till
mid-stretch, was overtaken and no match for the winner, lost place late. SAVE THE DATE broke a step slowly, lacked speed at the rear despite
encouragement, advanced late on the turn angling six to seven wide turning into upper stretch, made a steady bid late but fell short. DESTIN NIGHT
bumped a rival at the start, tracked from inside just off the leader, came out three then four wide turning for home, chased then was in tight and steadied
near the sixteenth pole and faded after. FRAC AMOUR was within range early, pursued the leader three then four wide on the turn, drifted five to six deep
leaving that bend, was in tight and steadied near the sixteenth pole while weakening. SILENT PASSION was bumped at the start, chased from between
runners, failed to rally. MRS. HOT SHOT stalked from outside mid-pack, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RED ELEANOR tracked the front trio down the backstretch outside of horses, slowly was gaining in the two path at the quarter pole, started to edge closer
finding a seam in the three path with a furlong to go and while not switching leads down the lane still got up in the final few strides for the score. SUPER
SICILY had a slim lead three wide on the outside with five eighths remaining, opened up by mid-turn, was headed inside by mid-stretch, repelled that foe to
still maintain the lead with a sixteenth to run but could not hold off the winner closing in just before the wire. ROCKET RILEY had one foe beaten down the
backside, caught up to the pack circling four wide outside at the quarter pole, posed a threat widest in lane five at the top of the stretch and finished with
intent to get up and be a clear third when crossing the finish line. TAVALINE was brushed inside at the start, settled in the mix up front just between and just
behind the lead pair down the backside, moved out chasing the leader with three furlongs to go, was in range in the four path turning for home but finished
up evenly to settle on the fringes in the end. HOME FOR A REST was brushed outside to begin, pressed the pace down the back straight on the inside, was
nudged on with three eighths to go but could not go on with the frontrunner, re-rallied on the fence in upper stretch, could not find another gear late and
stalled at the sixteenth pole. NORMA NO tracked the front trio rating on the inside down the backstretch, kept pace with the leaders going around the bend
but had little finish to offer on the fence in the lane. SECRET GIZMO was void of early speed to trail along the backside, lost contact even though asked
through the turn and was never a factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
NIKITA'S GEM prompted the pace outside in the first turn, kept a close eye on the frontrunner, sitting just outside down the backstretch, bid for the lead with
runners on both sides at the three eighths marker, had a slim advantage being scrubbed on inside in the final turn, lost the lead with an eighth remaining but
found more late and came back to prevail. GATHER sat outside close to the front two horses measuring the leaders down the backstretch, moved easily to
the contesting twosome while three wide on the outside three furlongs out, poked her head in front on the outside at the furlong pole, battled to the wire but
was repelled by the resurgent winner on the fence in deep stretch. EMPIRE'S TREAT was nestled on the fence behind the top two in the beginning, kept
pace watching the leaders down the back straight, was in the hunt behind the embattled leaders two furlongs from the prize, could not match strides with the
top pair down the lane but fought on determinedly to win the duel for show. INDIANA ROAD was unprepared at the start, recovered to track on the fence in
mid-field through the first turn, loped along on the rail down the backstretch, moved in closing three wide at the quarter pole but was outbattled for third
place in the stretch. WILD QUEENIE stalked near the rear on the rail down the backside, put in a mild turn of foot on the fence midway on the far turn,
angled out to the four path turning for home, shifted inwards at the eighth pole and finished up willingly on the rail in the final sixteenth. ANNIA CORNIFICIA
F travelled on the outside in mid-pack on the first turn, status was unchanged down the back straight, was roused three furlongs out, offered little rally and
picked up a tired runner at the wire. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER had the lead on the rail in the first turn, dictated the pace up top along the backstretch, was
collared outside at the three eighths marker and backed out of contention on the fence by the quarter pole. BRIT missed the start then was checked soon
after the break to trail in the early going, passed one rival along the backside on the outside but could not make any impression on the final turn and
throughout the stretch running. LANEY GRACE tossed her head a couple of times at the start, plus the rider lost his irons at the beginning, had the other
poor starter beaten going into the first turn, trailed by the half, put in a mild run in the far turn but could not be a factor in the stretch drive.
