Footnotes
BETTY'S SECRET was kept close just outside HIGHTAILING IT, went for the lead into the lane and gradually edged ahead the last furlong. HIGHTAILING
IT was hustled to a clear lead, saved ground, slowly wore down for the drive but proved easily second best. PRIMITY raced in contention just outside
BETTY'S SECRET for a three and a half furlongs, had no rally for the stretch run but was unchallenged for third. BEE A WINNER broke outward, was
forwardly placed along the rail on the backstretch but faded on the bend. HER NAME WAS LOLA hesitated then made a small leap from the gate and was
never a factor in a wide trip. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY also hesitated then made a leap from the gate, chased from paths two or three and showed little.

Footnotes
STUD LOVIN was sent to set a pressured pace inside rivals, allowed to relax on the bend, responded to mild urging in the lane and steadily drew off.
INSIDE THE CIRCLE was hustled to prompt the pace from outside, went for the lead just outside STUD LOVIN on the turn, was no match for that one when
set down for the drive but was unchallenged for second. IMMORAL forwardly placed from inside, moved clear for third on the bend, lacked a serious stretch
bid and could only hold his position late. DRAGGING MAIN chased from off the rail, lost considerable ground widest through the turn, passed outside tired
ones in the stretch and narrowly missed the show. LORD SHAFTESBURY prominent between rivals on the backstretch, began to fade three wide on the
bend. LATENT SHADOW chased from outside, angled in on the turn, came off the rail some for a clear path into the stretch but had no serious bid.
KRUELESS chased from between horses, moved to the rail leaving the bend then gave way for the drive. ANUNKA just off the inside on the backstretch,
swung out to path four into the stretch and gave way.

SUNDAY SPEIGHT bumped at the break, edged ahead for the early lead, was just off the rail on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch, was
challenged from inside, all out in the late going and held sway. WILDWOOD GHALY bumped SUNDAY SPEIGHT at the start, advanced between rivals,
took over second along the rail on the turn, fought for the lead from inside through the lane but had to settle for second best. SERENDIPITY COCO raced in
contention from outside, lost ground five wide through the bend and rallied belatedly deep stretch. HALLIE'S RAINBOW forwardly placed between foes, was
four wide on the turn, drifted out some leaving the bend and found best stride too late six wide. MISS MIA was away slowly, three wide on the turn, angled
out seven wide upper stretch and showed a willingness to run in the late going. LORI ATTACK pressed the early pace, was three then four wide through the
bend and began to wear down the final furlong. CAT TALE BREEZE chased from off the rail, saved ground taking the turn, lacked a rail rally and was
steadied briefly when her path narrowed inside the last eighth. SANGFROID was just off the inside through the bend and lacked a significant stretch bid.

FREE LOVE was kept close behind the early speed, had the rail through the turn, rallied inside LICHITA in the stretch and gradually drew off inside the final
furlong. LICHITA was sent to a clear lead, gradually angled in, was just off the inside taking the bend, challenged from inside in the lane, did not have
enough left the last eighth but proved clearly second best. AWESOME SUNDAY angled out early on, did not keep up from path three on the turn, angled
outside THINK BLUE upper stretch, started drifting out approaching the furlong marker, kept a straight path the final sixteenth and edged ahead for third.
THINK BLUE pressed the early speed from just outside, drifted out some leaving the bend and flattened out for the drive. HOT DAME also angled to the
outside early on, was four then five wide taking the turn and had no late bid.

TALIS PARK GRAD rated off the inside, closed the gap from path three on the turn, lost ground staying outside LATINO CASINO entering the lane, edged
ahead midstretch, moved to a clear lead inside the last furlong, was all out between rivals and held on. GOLD SMOKE bumped twice with LATIN CASINO
leaving the chute, was settled, just off the rail taking the bend, swung out to path five for the drive and rallied belatedly between horses.
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY hesitated at the break, was settled well back and inside, picked up his pace on the turn, came off the rail some into the stretch, made
a strong move, was forced to weave around traffic inside the final eighth and got up for third near the wire. CHEEKERS unruly in the gate, chased in
midpack toward the outside, lost ground fanning outside TALIS PARK GRAD into the stretch, fought for third as he closed the gap in the late going but was
outfinished. LATIN CASINO bumped a couple of times with GOLD SMOKE leaving the chute, raced closest to the early speed from outside, went for the
lead just outside FASTNFURIOUS on the bend, was carried out to path five by the latter entering the lane, vied for the lead between rivals upper stretch,
could not stay with TALIS PARK GRAD inside the final furlong and began to wear down between foes in the waning yards. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS void
of early speed, lost considerable ground widest through the turn but showed a willingness to run the through the stretch. RUNNINGFORCASH fractious in
the gate, chased in midpack from inside, rallied leaving the turn to threaten with a furlong left but leveled off instead. FASTNFURIOUS sprinted clear of the
rest early on, was challenged from outside leaving the bend, drifted out to path four into the stretch and soon gave way.

quarter mile, came into contention just off the rail on the bend, fanned widest for the stretch run, battled for the lead inside the last furlong and edged ahead

Footnotes
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY forwardly placed from the beginning, was three to five wide through the turn, rallied to engage DANZA TAXI with a sixteenth left
and edged ahead in time. DANZA TAXI hustled early to vie for the lead from inside, did not keep up into the bend, angled out some on the turn, came again
from path three leaving the bend, moved clear upper stretch, slowly drifted out inside the last furlong and had to settle for second best. ST. LOUIE LOUIE
chased in midpack toward the outside, was three wide on the turn, angled out five wide for a clear path upper stretch and rallied belatedly the final eighth.
LONESOME DREAM broke a step slow, was steadied back from crowding, altered in, just off the rail through the bend, angled out four wide upper stretch,
rallied inside ST. LOUIE LOUIE the rest of the way and was outfinished for third. LAYTON THE DAY prominent just off the inside on the backstretch, did not
keep up along the rail on the turn, came again two wide in the stretch but began to wear down in the late going. MAC PANDOWDY broke somewhat
awkwardly, chased from inside, moved out six wide at the top of the lane and made up minor ground the final eighth. CRANKSHAFT shared the early lead
outside DANZA TAXI, moved clear into the bend, took the rail then gave way through the stretch. PAYNT BY LETTERS reluctant to load in the gate, failed
to menace in a wide trip. LAWMAKER broke a step slow and outward, was checked and always outrun.
