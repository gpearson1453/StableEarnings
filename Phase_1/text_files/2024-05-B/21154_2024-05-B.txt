Footnotes
VIVA VIOLENCE hesitated then was steadied behind ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE at the break, advanced from outside, came four wide into the lane,
gradually altered out upper stretch as BEIRUT BEAUTY came close, rallied the last furlong and got up in time. LIFE OF SATURDAYS stalked the early
speed from inside, came off the rail some entering the stretch, drew clear, began to wear down inside the last eighth, drifted out under left-handed pressure
with a sixteenth to go, continued to float out in the waning yards and was outfinished. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE without early speed, saved ground through
the bend, rallied inside the final eighth, began to alter out for a clear path with a sixteenth left then altered in when LIFE OF SATURDAYS took her path fifty
yards out. A REAL HERO was soon well back, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn, fanned out behind LIFE OF SATURDAYS entering the stretch,
made a strong move between horses the last furlong but was too late. BEIRUT BEAUTY set a pressured pace just outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS, floated
out some into the lane then began to drift out upper stretch, held a straight path the final eighth but yielded between foes. PRINCESS MANDII was an early
factor between horses but faded two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
SUPER SILVER boxed in early, progressed between rivals on the bend, altered out four wide upper stretch, engaged ALYANAABI inside the last furlong,
edged ahead with a sixteenth left and kept the latter at bay. ALYANAABI shared the lead between rivals, was three wide through the turn, edged ahead
upper stretch, moved clear and angled in slightly inside the final eighth, was again challenged from both sides approaching the sixteenth marker, lost the
advantage, dug in through the waning yards, did not have enough but drew away for the place. REAL NEWS vied for the early lead from outside, moved
clear briefly into the bend, angled in some, was challenged again from both sides nearing the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane, began to yield
approaching the furlong marker, was checked and altered in when his path narrowed inside the last eighth, came again soon after that to vie briefly
approaching the sixteenth marker but began to flatten in the waning yards. EURO SUPRISE altered to the outside early on, was three wide on the turn,
gained a clear path five wide between horses at the top of the stretch then improved position between horses without a serious rally. AVENGING WARRIOR
raced in contention just off the inside, had to alter out widest for a clear path at the top of the lane then made up minor ground deep stretch. FEROCITY
displayed early speed from inside, also began to yield just inside the eighth pole, was checked when crowded by REAL NEWS approaching the sixteenth
marker and gradually faded. DEVIL'S RULE helped prompt the pace from outside for a half mile, came six wide into the stretch and gave way. There was a
stewards' inquiry into REAL NEWS' and FEROCITY'S loss of action inside the final furlong but no action was taken after their review.

BLUE EVEN SCORE in the second flight early from outside, progressed four wide on the turn, fanned out further entering the lane, rallied the last eighth and
got up in time. LIQUOR CAT quickly recovered from a stumbled at the break to vie for the lead from outside, angled in beside STARSOVERPARADISE on
the bend, had a narrow advantage over that one through the stretch but was outfinished. STARSOVERPARADISE soon contested the pace between rivals,
edged ahead nearing the bend, was headed on the turn, fought along the rail through the drive and did not have enough left in the late going. SCRAPPY
PATCH trailed from inside, commenced her bid after a two furlongs, swung out nearing the quarter pole, came into the lane behind DRAGON FLY KISSES,
altered inside that one upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late between rivals. DRAGONFLY KISSES was hustled to dispute the pace between
horses but gradually began to fade three wide on the turn. BUNNY SHINE displayed early speed from inside then gave way along the rail into the bend. TU
ROYAL in contention early between horses, bore out on the turn, was allowed to gallop to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
STANCE moved clear of the rest after the first sixteenth, showed the way in hand, lengthened command upper stretch when let out, received some urging
inside the last furlong and continued to draw away. PONTUS raced in the second flight from outside, moved clear for second on the bend, was no match for
STANCE when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for the place. OSCAR NOMINEE also in the second flight early, was steadied slightly and
altered out when the loose ZEE FIRE came up from inside nearing the turn, stayed in path three through the turn and could only hold his position late. CHEF
RAY WILEY was steadied behind traffic leaving the chute, altered in, checked when the loose horse came close nearing the seven-sixteenths marker then
raced evenly along the rail the rest of the way. BEST MAN SPEECH chased from outside, improved position just off the rail on the bend, swung out widest
for the stretch run and only made up minor ground late. TAPIT IN faded from inside on the turn. ZEE FIRE bucked when the gate opened then lost his rear
footing another stride out and lost his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into ZEE FIRE'S start. It was determined he was prepared to break with the rest of
the field when the gate opened but acted up instead.

Footnotes
YOU'RE IN COREY prominent just off the inside, waited for room on the second bend, got through three wide leaving that turn, gradually angled out to stay
clear of TROY OUNCE upper stretch, took the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and drifted out under left-handed pressure as he drew off in the late going.
TROY OUNCE pressed the early leader from just outside, took over two wide on the second turn, began to drift out upper stretch, straightened his path
inside the last eighth, could not hold back YOU'RE IN COREY but stayed clear for the place. IRISH DECLARATION was pinched between rivals shortly
after the break, settled inside, progressed just off the rail on the second bend, altered out seven wide for a clear path at the top of the lane, lodged a mild bid
and caught AHEADOFTHEGAME for third. AHEADOFTHEGAME bumped with IRISH DECLARATION a few strides from the gate, chased from inside,
reached contention on the second turn, angled out some to advance midway on that bend, took over third three wide upper stretch, had a striking position
with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. TONYS MORNING LINE chased from inside, lodged his bid just off the inside into the lane, advanced to
midstretch then also leveled off. SEMINOLE BEACH hustled early, raced in contention for five furlongs then began to fade four wide on the second turn.
DUST DANCER also bumped with IRISH DECLARATION shortly after the start, soon had the lead and the inside but began to yield before finishing six
furlongs. TRY TRY AGAIN failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. ONE WAY HOME five wide on the first bend, raced forwardly from outside, was three to
five wide taking the second turn then gave way for the drive. MKAR THE FAST was away somewhat slowly, stayed off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
JACK SPRAT rated off the early speed, commenced his bid three wide on the bend, engaged KEEP ATTACKING in the lane then gradually opened up
inside the last furlong. EMPTY HOLSTER chased from between horses, was two wide on the turn, altered in for a clear path upper stretch and caught KEEP
ATTACKING for second late. KEEP ATTACKING set a pressured pace just outside RHODIUMS PRIDE, moved clear and took the inside after two furlongs,
had the rail on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch, was overtaken inside the final eighth and angled outside JACK SPRAT with a sixteenth left.
FAST CROSS TRAFFIC raced in contention from outside, was four wide through the turn then flattened the final furlong. RHODIUMS PRIDE hustled along
early, vied for the lead briefly from inside, angled outside KEEP ATTACKING after a quarter mile, was just off the rail on the bend, continued to yield in the
stretch, angled out five wide with a furlong to go and gradually faded. ON THE MONEY RED forwardly placed from inside on the backstretch began to fade
before finishing a half mile. HIGHLY PERFECT crowded midway on the backstretch, altered to the rail, angled out six wide for a clear path upper stretch but
had little to offer. BRIANS WAY showed little.

Footnotes
D' YANK rated from inside, began to angle out to make his bid on the turn, came six wide into the lane, took the advantage inside the final sixteenth and
began to draw off. SNOOZER hustled from the gate, was soon steadied behind traffic, taken to the outside, advanced four wide through the turn, rallied
belatedly deep stretch but caught SWISS GUARD for second. SWISS GUARD well placed inside from the early going, gained a narrow and brief lead
nearing the sixteenth pole but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. READTHETRANSCRIPT in the second flight from outside, improved position
two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and slowly yielded. TAPIT SAM chased while toward the outside, was just off the inside taking the
turn, showed a willingness to run late, was caught in tight quarters three wide inside the last sixteenth and brushed with JACK VAN BERG seventy yards
out. BERNIE LOMAX prominent just off the inside on the backstretch, failed to keep up three wide on the bend, swung out five wide for the stretch run and
only made up minor ground late. JACK VAN BERG broke on top, moved clear of the others midway on the backstretch, began to flatten out between horses
the final eighth, was drifting out inside the last sixteenth and brushed with TAPIT SAM. SLAM DUNK SERMON chased from between horses, quit on the
bend, was eased through the stretch and walked off.
