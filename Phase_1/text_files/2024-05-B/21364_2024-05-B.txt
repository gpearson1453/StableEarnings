place. HIGH ROCKY MOUNTAIN dismounted the rider while loading, broke awkwardly, showed good inside speed and weakened in the late stages. HEZA
PERFECT DASHER lacked running room early, and gave best late. JETSUP was outkicked. SPLASH MOUNTAIN MIA lacked early foot, and lacked a kick.
ZIVAS ELVIS lacked solid bid. HIJA DEL HUESOS failed to fire. FIRST OLAF drifted in after the break and was in close quarters.

GO MAMA broke outward, stalked the pacesetter while three to four wide, gained the lead entering the stretch, and was ridden out. CHATTY GAL quickly
went to the front then crossed over to the rail in the backstretch, was overtaken at the head of the stretch, was no match for the winner and held on for
place. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY trailed the field early, and closed well late. ANAAMY tracked four wide, and came up empty in the drive. ENTITLED STAR

TRAPEZE crowded leaving, sat in striking range while five wide, moved up alongside KISS ME HELLO to challenge the lead, came under urging through
the stretch and edged clear late. KISS ME HELLO contested the early pace while inside, responded gamely to a challenge from TRAPEZE, and gave way
grudgingly in the final sixteenth. CASSANO contended the early pace, was unable to move on with rivals nearing the quarter pole, and yielded. DO YOU NO
WHO I AM sat in range and chased to no avail. JOKERSRWILD AGAIN passed tiring rival. SPEEDY PIEDY flashed early speed and stopped.

Footnotes
DECOY unhurried early, raced five wide into the far turn, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, closed steadily and was along in time.
UNCHARACTERISTIC tracked inside, tipped out to the four path at the head of the lane, rallied gamely inside of DECOY, and got by late to prove second
best. KAUAI DAN stalked four wide, gained a short advantage and was rundown. GLAVA rated well off the pace while five wide, and passed tiring rivals.
TORIADOR hopped leaving then set the early pace, was overtaken and yielded. ASYOUBELIEVE was outsprinted to the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
SIR BREGOVIC broke alertly to take command, responded gamely to a challenge from SMART PLAY, and won going away. SMART PLAY was unhurried
early while wide through the backstretch, took closer order into the far turn, and moved up alongside SIR BREGOVIC at the quarter pole, but lacked the rally
needed in the stretch. DRINKING AGAIN sat in striking range while five wide, dropped back through the far turn, was roused on the final turn, and closed to
earn show honors. RAILWAY sat just off the pace, rallied between foes into the stretch, and flattened deep stretch. SAXON SAGA saved ground inside, and
was outkicked. ATTENZIONE was gapped early, and showed interest late. IT'S A FACT offered little.

Footnotes
MISSCZECH settled in stride from the two path, emerged as the leader leaving the backstretch, responded gamely to a threat from PRETTY ARIA, and
drew away under a strong hand ride. FORCE TO REKN WITH sat mid pack, was asked to quicken nearing the final turn, shifted out to the four path and
closed steadily outside to get up for place. PRETTY ARIA contested the early pace outside but was outsprinted into the opening turn, launched an all out bid
nearing the quarter pole but was unable to stall the winner, flattened out through the stretch and was run down late. BURROW DOWN unhurried early,
lodged a bid at the quarter pole and evened out. KNOWING GLANCE reluctant to load, raced four wide leaving the backstretch, and came up empty in the
drive. SINGING BELL chased the early pacesetters, swung out to the four path, and failed to menace in the stretch. FLORAL stalked while five wide, and
faded steadily. MINE ME was not a factor.

Footnotes
DON'T LET ME DOWN shifted out early to the five path, shifted outside at the head of the lane while in traffic, lugged in and won driving. ZOFFA raced wide
in second flight, angled down to the four path leaving the backstretch, waited in traffic nearing the quarter pole, grabbed an advantage at the head of the
stretch and was outfinished. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS saved ground inside, lacked running room on the rail in the final turn, and lacked the closing
response that was needed. GABBYSONHOLIDAY was gapped early, circled the field leaving the final turn, and closed well late. SIMPLY WICKED attended
the pace from the four path, dueled outside BRATTON in the final turn, and wilted. COMMON KNOWLEDGE prompted the pace from outside, dropped back
and offered a mild late bid. BRATTON set a pressured pace, dueled through the far turn inside of SIMPLY WICKED, and gave way in the stretch.
PERDITION flashed early speed from between foes, fanned three wide, and tired. FROSTEDBIRD attended the pace, fanned four wide, and yielded in
stretch. LANNY MAC offered little and was eased.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC OOPS stalked the early pace, drove four wide at the head of the lane, rallied outside and edged clear. THRILL OF THE NITE broke alertly then
sped to the front at once, quickly angled down to the three path, was joined nearing the quarter pole, rallied between into the stretch and was outfinished.
AFTER A FEW stumbled hard leaving, chased from the rail, closed gamely to earn show. QUICK DIAL broke awkwardly, was under a strong hold while in
close quarters in the far turn, rallied inside through the stretch and bested late. JELLI trailed the field, swung outside and closed well late. BEAUTIFUL
MESS tracked five wide, and bid evenly. STEVIE WONDER GIRL reserved off the early pacesetter, was in tight into the far turn then clipped heels with
QUICK DIAL, lodged a bid into the stretch and weakened. TELLTALE bumped leaving, and was outrun. ECHO CREEK stumbled hard leaving, chased wide
through the backstretch, and failed to menace. SOFIA D 'AMORE chased to no avail. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the
far turn involving STEVIE WONDER GIRL and QUICK DIAL. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of STEVIE WONDER GIRL against
the rider of QUICK DIAL alleging interference in the far turn was upheld. QUICK DIAL was disqualified and placed seventh for interference to STEVIE
WONDER GIRL.
