PARTY AT JAYS broke inward and bumped MYMANROWEN leaving the gate, settled near the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at
the half mile marker and moved up around the turn, kept on to run down the leader and was up in the final jumps. MYMANROWEN was bumped on both
sides leaving the starting gate then was hustled to a clear lead around the turn and kept on but was caught in the final jumps but was clearly second best.
ZONG'S FAVOR saved ground throughout, cut the corner into the stretch and made a bid on the inside to be up for the show. MY STORY pressed the pace
from two wide to midway through the turn and weakened. LUCKY IS MY NAME was close up to the pace early from between horses to the turn and slowly
faded.

went to the front to a pressured lead from the inside down the backstretch then inched away on the turn but was collared in the final furlong and held on for
the place. UNIFIED LOVE vied for the lead from three wide down the backstretch, moved to challenge leader into the final turn but couldn't match strides

near the back down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn while moving up but flattened out in the drive. I DONT KNOW EITHER was
unhurried through the final turn and made a rail bid to pass tiring rivals in the stretch. SUPER ET raced in the middle of the pack from four wide down the

ZONG TOUGH rushed up to press the pace from the inside on the backstretch but fell back on the turn and slipped through in the stretch drive to draw clear
late. CRYPTOZONIC was within striking distance from four wide down the backstretch, tipped in to three wide on the turn and engaged the leader at the
eighth pole but was outfinished by outside closer. ANDIAMO GIACOMO raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail through the turn then moved out to
five wide in upper stretch for a rally and finished strong. CARLOS PUNCH went to the front to set the pace from two wide and had a clear lead going into the
stretch but was collared at the eighth pole and weakened. HOT LE ROY raced off the pace from three wide and made a mild bid on the run but lacked the
late response. RUN ROCKET trailed the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAPELLA RED popped open gate prestart, then was unhurried down the backstretch, and moved up from three wide on the final turn and challenged the
leader in mid stretch to be up in the final yards. SIGNING rubbed the gate as she was leaving, then trailed the field around the first turn and steadily
advanced down the backstretch, challenged the leader around the final turn to take the lead into the stretch but was nailed in the final yards but was second
best. ADAMANTLY pressed the pace from two wide down the backstretch and took a brief narrow lead into the final turn and battled from inside to the top of
the stretch where she was overtaken but kept on for the show. ARIEL M D raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then hustled along to be off
the pace down the backstretch while moving between horses on the turn but failed to sustain that bid. CATCHYALATER saved ground around the first turn
and down the backstretch angled out nearing the top of the stretch but failed to menace. MITOLEMYBELLE went to the early lead under pressure down the
backstretch then was eclipsed going into the final turn and dropped back. THAT'S ABOUT IT was always back.
