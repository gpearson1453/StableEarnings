Footnotes
GRAVITY HILL raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, commenced a rally racing a bit greenly, then closed
willingly outside in deep stretch and was up late to win going away. AIR MASQUE chased inside, chased on the turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, put
a head in front, dueled past the furlong marker, dug in gamely to the finish and got second. LITTLE LIA pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid two
wide on the turn, dueled between rivals into the stretch and dug in gamely through the final furlong. KATE'S LOVE chased on the inside, chased on the turn
and finished evenly inside in the lane. MILDOON was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, then lacked a rally. ONE
FINE WINE showed good speed to set the pace, then dueled inside and tired. BABY CAKES chased two wide and faded. HONEY BLONDE was off a bit
slow and outrun.

MIA'S CRUSADE stalked close up between rivals, bid three wide on the turn, hooked up with BEL PENSIERO passing the furlong marker, battled heads
apart with that rival and prevailed determinedly late. BEL PENSIERO vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, then battled heads apart with the winner
past the furlong marker and dug in gamely inside of that rival to the finish. SADIE BABY vied outside for the lead, dueled on the turn, weakened in the lane
and just held on for the show spot. GIRL TROUBLE stalked three wide, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane, angled in, closed mildly and just
missed for third. I CAN RUN was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly on the rail. D' TIGER LILY tracked on the inside, chased
inside on the turn and weakened. ODDSONDUSTYMILLER raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.
