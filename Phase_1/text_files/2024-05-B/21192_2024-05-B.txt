Footnotes
ANMER HALL stalked outside a rival, took aim two to three wide on the turn, collared the leader in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole and drove
clear. PLAYER B pressed briefly from outside then fought on even terms up the backstretch, inched clear around the bend, challenged by ANMER HALL in
upper stretch, relinquished the lead midstretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. INCREDIBLE SHOT sat off the pace outside a rival, rounded the bend in
the two path, tipped out into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and got up for third. KID AZTECA moved to the inside stalking the leaders, chased two wide
into the lane, moved back inside late and lost the show. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) fractious in the gate, showed good early speed from inside then dueled with
PLAYER B, failed to keep up with that rival with a quarter mile left to run and weakened in the furlong grounds. MY RANSOM reserved in the early going
and moved inside, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. J D'S RUDE BOY unhurried in the beginning then lightly coaxed along at the back,
ridden along while saving ground around the bend, steered out in the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LYELL'S SONG chased the leader for a bit then went up to press the pace between rivals, moved up on even terms around the bend, put a head in front at
the quarter pole, put away inner rival entering the stretch, confronted by HAPPY SPRINTER with a sixteenth remaining, drifted out slightly under the left
hand and prevailed. HAPPY SPRINTER hesitated and spotted the field a few lengths to begin, climbed a bit trailing early then settled into stride, chased in
range four wide around the bend, drew alongside LYELL'S SONG entering deep stretch, got floated out slightly late and missed. BROADWAY UNIONS
stalked the top pair from outside, took the turn three wide and weakened in the final furlong. SIZE LORD sped clear early then set the pace under pressure
at the half-mile pole, dueled with LYELL'S SONG around the bend, yielded to the new leader entering the stretch and gave way. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN THE TOP TWO FINISHERS. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED LYELL'S SONG FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND FORCING HAPPY SPRINTER OFF HIS PATH, COSTING THAT
RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
RED CROSS KNIGHT took control and moved to the rail, showed the way under pressure up the backstretch, could not shake loose from DONT FIGHT
THE FED early on the far turn, lost command late on that bend, fought back gamely from inside and dug in late to edge the runner-up. DONT FIGHT THE
FED stalked the pace from the two path, moved up to apply pressure from outside in the middle stages, headed RED CROSS KNIGHT with a quarter mile
remaining, took over late on the bend, lugged inward in upper stretch, got straightened out, fought into deep stretch and got outkicked. MCGREGOR LAKE
bumped with outer rival early, chased two wide into the first turn, bumped with outer rival and got squeezed back when put in tight, moved to the inside,
saved ground through the far turn and cut the corner into the stretch, lacked the needed late punch in the furlong grounds but saved the show. FLY THE
SKY brushed with outer rival shortly after the start, bumped with inner rival three deep early on the first turn then moved into the two path, continued two
wide on the second bend, angled to the inside in upper stretch and missed third. BIG GEORGE broke out, quickly moved inside trailing the field, angled out
on the far turn and spun four wide into the stretch, kept trying down the lane but failed to threaten. SPEED GRAZY got bumped and squeezed back between
rivals early, chased along the rail, eased out to the two path and was under a drive entering the lane, moved out in the stretch but weakened in the final
furlong. BERT'S PROSPECT chased four then three deep on the clubhouse turn, exited the backstretch two wide, eased out around the far turn and came
four wide into the stretch but faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BRIGHT LEAF stalked near the inside, drew closer under coaxing on the far turn, waited for room behind the leaders two wide into the lane, found a seam
and split rivals in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole and held safely. BRAZENLY stalked three deep or four wide on the first turn, ridden along in
the three path on the second bend, bid four deep and took over in upper stretch, lost command past the furlong marker and stayed on to the wire.
LAMBEAU stumbled leaving the gate, had good early speed along the rail, set the pace under pressure into the backstretch, dueled at the midway point,
lost command late on the turn, fought to the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. DEPARTURE stalked from the two path around the first turn then
applied pressure into the backstretch, headed the leader at the half-mile pole, battled around the far turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, lost command
shortly after and weakened in the furlong grounds. BIG BUZZ unhurried in the beginning and steered down to the rail, continued at the back into the far turn,
eased out to the four path around that bend and was never a factor. TIZ TOK stalked between foes then in the three path on the clubhouse turn, chased two
to three wide on the second bend and came up empty when asked.

Footnotes
KING OF GOSFORD (GB) broke well then ceded command to ALL THAT GLORY early, stalked two wide into the turn, put the pressure on from outside
around the turn, dueled through the lane and dug in the final sixteenth to prove best. ALL THAT GLORY showed early speed outside KING OF GOSFORD
(GB) then cleared that rival and crossed over to the inside, confronted by that rival on the turn, responded to the challenge and maintained a short lead to
the stretch, battled down the lane and yielded grudgingly in the deep stretch. GUY NAMED JOE stalked the pace through the early going, saved ground on
the fence down the hill, roused crossing over the dirt, moved out in the lane and finished willingly for a clear third. SORRENTO SKY (IRE) tracked in the two
path around the turn, chased outside a rival into the lane, asked left handed in upper stretch and failed to respond. RASTAMAN VIBE settled at the back,
moved inside to save ground, continued to trail crossing the dirt and passed a tired rival in the lane. WYNSTOCK raced in range three deep early, remained
three wide through the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ROMAN EMPRESS tracked the pace from off the rail, raced five wide early on the turn, moved down to the three path, moved out widest in upper stretch,
chased within striking distance in the final furlong, surged late and got up at the wire to dead-heat with BELLA RENELLA. BELLA RENELLA stalked the
speed outside rivals, bid three then two wide on the turn, asked right handed past the quarter pole, put a head in front in upper stretch, held a short lead
over WOODBINE WAY into the final sixteenth and was able to hold on to share the victory. WOODBINE WAY showed good early speed from inside, set the
pace up the backstretch, pressured by BELLA RENELLA on the turn, carried a narrow lead into the stretch, lost command outside the eighth pole. TAPIT
DOUX forwardly placed in the early going, paused briefly leaving the backstretch behind the leader, moved to the rail on the turn then back to the two path
late on the bend, moved out further in the lane and finished willingly for a minor award. AWESOME TAYLOR stumbled leaving the gate, trailed up the
backstretch, gained along the rail through the turn, chased within range at the furlong marker but flattened out in deep stretch. VELLA raced up close
outside a rival, lost ground three then two wide on the turn, trailed into the stretch and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
CALM SEA set the pace inside a pair of rivals first time through the stretch, held a short lead over ONE OF THESE DAYS (IRE) on the clubhouse turn,
cleared in the middle stages, spurted away in upper stretch and held safely to the line. ZALAMO (FR) broke a bit slow, unhurried at the back and moved into
the two path, chased three deep on the far turn, brushed with inner rival at the quarter pole, moved into the two path shortly after, steered out in the lane and
showed late effort to get up for second. ONE OF THESE DAYS (IRE) pressed the pace between rivals then outside the leader on the clubhouse turn, lost
touch with the pacesetter on the backstretch but remained up close to the outside, remained in the two path while roused on the far turn, chased within
striking distance through the lane but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch and got edged for second. BIG HAT WILLIE attended the pace three
deep early, tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, saved ground to the stretch, asked right handed in the lane and weakened. MOODY JIM (IRE) broke a step
slow, settled along the rail, roused on the far turn but got put in tight and steadied at the quarter pole, tipped out into the stretch and never threatened.
KERRY GOLD taken in hand early, moved into the two path, chased between rivals on the far turn, brushed with outer rival at the quarter pole, moved to the
inside immediately after and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
CLOONEY broke a step slow, chased three wide near the back on the first turn, angled in for the far turn, steered back out past the five-sixteenths pole,
spun five wide into the lane, rallied to head the leader at the eighth pole and drew clear. JOHN DUNBAR bobbled a bit at the start, tucked inside early at the
back, advanced in hand up the backstretch, asked on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied along the fence and got up for second. SOUL OF
MIDNIGHT vied for the lead from inside, dueled with AMERICAN CAT past the quarter pole, clung to narrow lead at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead
shortly after and got edged for second. MONTANA came away a step slow on the outside, traveled four wide into the first turn then angled to the inside
trailing around the first turn, advanced from inside on the second bend, tipped out into the lane and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta.
AMERICAN CAT vied four then three deep on the clubhouse turn, continued three deep into the second bend, dueled three wide into the lane and
weakened in the furlong grounds. STOP AND A TRES vied between rivals into the first turn then ceded command and stalked in the two path, eased over to
the three path on the far turn, tipped four wide into the lane and flattened. THE BIG WAM broke a step slow, raced wide through the first turn towards the
rear, stayed off the rail on the backstretch, rounded the far turn three wide and could not make an impact. FIFTY CINCO vied three then two wide between
rivals on the first turn, fought between up the backstretch and around the far turn, lost touch with the leaders past the quarter pole and gave way. EREBUS
close up early, stalked four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, remained wide to the stretch and tired. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) had early speed
between rivals and got crowded into the first turn, climbed around the bend, raced mid-pack off the rail on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn,
eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
BALDORO pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn, inched ahead in upper stretch, put away inner rival approaching the sixteenth pole,
then had to content with LEGITIMATE TARGE (GB) in deep stretch and held over a surging BIG JUANITO at the wire. BIG JUANITO moved right before the
gates opened and came away last, trailed on the inside then went outside a rival on the backstretch, had two beat racing a bit off the rail into the stretch,
came out to bother a pair of rivals at the eighth pole, surged late and missed. LEGITIMATE TARGET (GB) bumped on both sides leaving the gate, took a
stalking position along the rail, tipped out at the top of the stretch, drew alongside the leader with a sixteenth left to run and could not get by. EMPIRE'S
CLASSIC settled along the inside then moved out to the two path while pulling on the clubhouse turn, drew closer on the far turn, came out and bumped
rival into the stretch, got forced out by BIG JUANITO past the eighth pole and finished well despite trouble. DEALERS SPECIAL stalked in hand between
rivals, remained between foes on the second bend, under a ride entering the lane, moved out in upper stretch, kept on determinedly by was outkicked in the
late stages. WHEN HEROES FLY brushed leaving the gate, grabbed the early lead with company to the outside, dueled around the far turn, gave up the
lead in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TRACKER bobbled and bumped in the beginning, traveled near the back on the inside, eased out to
the three path on the final turn and failed to menace. DADDY JUSTIFY unhurried in the opening stages and moved inside, was rank early tossing his head
along the rail, remained inside through the far turn and could not make an impact. CHASING RAIN raced in range three deep, went four wide then three
wide on the far turn, got bumped and forced out approaching the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. SHOT OF COURAGE stumbled leaving the
gate, stalked outside rivals early, moved outside the top pair leaving the backstretch, chased three deep into the lane, steadied when BIG JUANITO came
out at the eighth pole and was not persevered with after. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BIG JUANITO FROM SECOND TO
FOURTH FOR DRIFTING OUT AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO EMPIRE'S CLASSIC IN MIDSTRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A
BETTER PLACING.
