Footnotes
MISS ANTIETAM broke a bit awkwardly then saved ground into the first turn, eased out leaving the turn and bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
improved steadily and took aim in the four path entering the stretch, then dug in determinedly to inch clear late. TRAVEL SMART saved ground on the first
turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in to take second the final stride. CLEARLY
VISIBLE angled in and raced with the pace two deep, dueled leaving the half mile pole and took the nod two deep at the quarter pole, was met entering the
stretch and contested even terms to the deep going before flattening stride. BRAVO ZULU raced in the five path the opening turn, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY stalked inside on the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. DORITA'S HEART rated a slim lead inside, dueled at mostly even terms leaving
the half mile pole, gave up the lead at the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened.

SISYPHUS stalked inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, drifted into the lane but dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and dueled clear late yards. ROCK ANNA ROLL angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole,
was met past the quarter, dueled to clear second inside the sixteenth pole but was outfinished for the win. PROSPECTIVE LOVE stalked two deep then
challenged toward the five sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving the quarter pole but relented in the duel through the stretch. STOP BEING GREEDY raced
in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. CUCHULAIN
saved ground. NICO LUCKY raced well off the pace off the rail the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response. ALDARIGHTTRICKS settled in
the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn.
