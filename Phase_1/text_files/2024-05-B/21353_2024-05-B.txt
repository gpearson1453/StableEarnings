Footnotes
BUBBA CAN DANCE forwardly placed off the inside, crept closer second turn, challenged between horses entering the stretch, drifted out just inside the
furlong marker, was straightened, found more late to prove best. SILENT POWER back off the early pace and the inside, advanced into contention four wide
through the final turn, challenged into the lane, put a head in front upper stretch as the winner began to drift out, outkicked by that rival in the late going.
FLASHING ANGELBABY broke on top, set a moderate pace while in hand and along the inside, responded briefly when the top two came calling turning for
home, weakened a bit but managed to comfortably save the show. TALK TO TOKEY four wide into the first turn, raced within striking distance the middle
half mile while remaining off the inside, came up empty for the stretch run. SMOKY TOPAZ void of speed for six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while not a serious threat. BIG POWER RED off a step slow, moved out and advanced five wide into the first turn, continued well out in the strip, began to
tire midway on the final turn. SILVER N LAI in mid pack for six furlongs, tired in the drive. DEALIN' STELEN devoid of any early speed, swung five wide into
the stretch, did not fire.

Footnotes
FIRST CLASS HARLOW in mid pack in the early going, fell back in the far turn, swung out widest for the drive and closed full of run to win going away at the
end. CHECK ME OUT prompted the early leader, continued to apply pressure backstretch, appeared to shy from a good into the far turn to slightly bother
DUSTIN THE DIAMOND, was quickly righted, moved to engage the leader soon after dueled into and through most of the stretch, led late, could not contain
the winner while narrowly saving the place. OVERANALYTICAL back off the pace while out in the course, in some traffic when creeping closer into the far
turn, evenly paced through upper straight, displayed some late interest to be gaining for the second spot, narrowly missed. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND settled
off the early pace and the inside, in some traffic into first turn, closer four wide into the far turn, bothered slightly when the runner up came out, one paced
through the final turn and most of the stretch. DR. SNYDER broke on top, showed the way along the inside into the first turn, continued to show the way
onto and up the backstretch while lightly restrained, responded when challenged in the second turn, dueled through upper stretch, weakened late to lose
position. COCAL within striking distance for six furlongs, came up empty for the stretch run. HOWARD'S GRIT lacked speed, remained back in lacking a
closing kick. WESTERN STAR was finished after a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FAR TURN, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
IMMA MADI TUE broke with the field, quickly moved up, sprinted well clear out of the chute and onto the main track, continued to hold a sizable advantage
into and through the turn, stayed on well through the lane to win by daylight under steady handling. SUM CHARM chased the winner in vain throughout,
held sway for the runner up spot. NICE LIKE MICHELLE broke back to be last away, lacked speed for over a half, advanced three wide out of the turn,
angled in and finished willingly to be closing the gap on the runner up. CAT B CAUSE broke well from the outside, three wide through the turn, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing response. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, went one paced while racing toward
the inside. BEAT THE DOUBLE remained back in failing to menace. ARCTIC GUITAR fell back to trail after the start, never a threat.

Footnotes
CATALINA DAY closest to the leader, backstretch, continued to chase turn, finally collared that foe late and kicked clear under steady handling. GUS'S
DREAM WORLD broke well, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the turn, offered little resistance late when
overtaken by the winner, clearly second best. GRAY DANE settled in mid pack early, staged a mild rally late through some traffic to gain the show, no match
for the top two. TAUREAN also raced back off the early, pace, improved position through the lane, not enough for the place. CAT DADDY'S CAT chased the
top two while out in the strip, had little left for the drive to lose position. IT'S A SECRET last away, lacked speed for a half, came five wide out of turn,
displayed some mild interest to improve position down the middle of the strip. LONE STAR LAW in mid pack early, improved into lane, faltered in the run to
the wire. CAUGHTUPNDAMOMENT in the main group for three furlongs, faded through the lane. PLENNIE LAFAYETTE void of speed, remained back in
lacking a rally. REACH FOR THE ACES was finished early.

Footnotes
NORTHERNREFLECTION broke in good order from the rail, dueled inside, put that rival away midway second turn, joined by a second foe soon after,
repelled that rival to remain clear the final furlong. UNFATHOMED in the second flight while off the inside, advanced on the winner three wide late in the
final turn, dueled briefly then could not match the winner the final eighth. HAMMERIN AAMER last away moved up into the second flight while inside the
runner up along the inside just before a half, patiently handled second turn, stayed inside, finished up best of the rest. ARCTIC ROSE away with the leaders,
dueled outside the winner onto and up the backstretch, first to blink second turn, gradually weakened through the lane. NATE'S ATTACK went one paced
throughout while lacking a closing kick along the inside. STATE OF THE UNION was finished after a half. GALLANT STAR trailed throughout, never
menaced.

Footnotes
VALTESSE pressed up front while three wide, continued to do battle into the lane, long drive between horses, headed late, displayed good resolve to battle
back between horses to narrowly prevail in game fashion. BIND ON EARTH with the pace while between foes, showed the way into the lane, led late,
outkicked by the winner late while narrowly holding the place. DRE ME LESS in the second flight toward but not on the inside, in some traffic into the lane,
shifted out bit, late surge to be rapidly getting to the top two late. FASTED back off the pace and the inside, closer five wide into the lane, went flat late in
lacking a winning response. BETISON in the second flight while outside, closer then challenged four wide into the lane, hung in the run to the wire. BITSY C
C LIL GIRL lacked speed, never menaced. MSCHITCHATTOUR broke out then checked up at the start to be sluggish early, remained always back. BE A
BANDIT moved up along the inside to contest the pace along the inside, checked out late in the turn while remaining inside. LACIS JEWEL fell back after
the start and was not involved.

Footnotes
ORLEANS TOURIST popped stall doors, broke sharp, cleared, set all the pace off the inside, extended advantage a bit into the lane, held the runner up
safe late. JOSAN settled off the pace inside, continued to track into the far turn, tipped out for the drive, closed the gap on the winner a bit past the furlong
marker, lugged in late and could not get to that same rival in the waning strides. CATCHIN DRAMA last to leave, remained devoid of speed up the
backstretch and into the far turn, steered out turning into the stretch, managed a mild rally to finish clear for the show. VEGA STAR one paced behind the
winner, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive. TUSSLING CHARLIE chased the winner from along the inside, gave way in the final turn.

Footnotes
ADIAMONDINTHESTORM away in good order, vied up front between foes for three furlongs, kicked clear stretch under steady handling. KAT'S PRINCESS
fractious loading, forwardly placed, four wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive while prevailing for the place. MIDNIGHT
CIGARETTE settled off the early pace, moved a bit closer into the lane, long drive for the place, outkicked. PENNIES FOR PAULLA forced in, bothered at
the break, raced far back for three furlongs, widest in the drive, finished full of run while too late. GRACE'S VISION evenly paced, improved position a bit off
the inside while not proving a serious threat. IDO SOLEMNLY SWEAR with the pace while closest to the inside for three furlongs, weakened in the drive.
PRINCESS MOCCASINS unruly prestart, went evenly throughout in lacking a closing kick. ZIPPY SEASON fractious while loading, broke in good order,
raced with the pace for three furlongs and gave way through the stretch. KRAZY KATIE steadily faded while racing outside. DAY STORM balked loading,
veered in at the break to bother PENNIES FOR PAULA, raced far back, jogged in. LONG LEGGED LADY in some early traffic, clipped heels, unseated
rider.
