Footnotes
COLEYVILLE was nestled on the rail on the first turn in mid-division, rated kindly on the fence watching the front duo down the backside, patiently waited to
move behind the frontrunner on the far turn, shifted just outside in the two path between runners turning for home and went on by, keeping to the task in the
final furlong to win going away at the finish for the classy veteran. NATIVE PRINCE took command from the onset, clearing to the rail, dictated a soft pace
with little pressure down the backstretch, continued going easily up front in the last turn, was collared by the winner with an eighth left to go, could not match
strides with the winner late but comfortably bested the rest at the wire. STOP THE HUMBUG was unhurried trailing on the fence in the first turn, continued
to see the pack but was in range of the leaders down the back straight, saved ground improving on the rail throughout the far turn and closed in on the fence
to capture third money. MAMBOINTHEFOREST was content to track behind the frontrunner on the first turn, closed the gap, prompting the lackluster pace
down the backside, was scrubbed on with runners on either side to go after the leader midpoint on the final bend, was in the mix three wide outside in upper
stretch but had little left late and stalled in the final furlong for a minor share. OCTOBER FROST travelled four wide into the first turn, improved to be in
mid-pack between rivals in the two path at the half, could not quicken with others making a move with five sixteenths to the wire, was shuffled back to trail
on the far turn and could not get involved running in the stretch. PRIVATE LAKE settled in midfield two wide outside foes into the first turn, watched the front
two three deep outside horses in the tracking flight along the backside, was hard ridden three wide midway on the final bend to offer a mild run for a moment
but could not find more in the stretch drive and emptied out outside foes in the four path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY IN CHILE stalked in the third flight on the rail down the backstretch, made a bold move circling four wide around the leaders at the quarter pole,
was full of run in the five path entering the stretch and drew off late for the impressive score. HIGHLAND ROCKY tracked the speed in the two path with
horses on both sides along the backstretch, began to inch closer through the turn, posed a threat in the three path between foes in upper stretch and stayed
on stubbornly to the wire for the place share. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER settled near the rear outside horses in the beginning, made a smart move,
improving on the rail three furlongs from the wire, shifted out to the two path at the quarter pole, had nowhere to go at the top of the lane, found a seam four
wide at the furlong pole and finished up willingly to get up late for third money. HAAHEE tracked the loose pacesetter on the rail down the back straight,
began to edge closer running around the bend sitting just behind the leader, had no room losing its path two wide in upper stretch, was checked inside to be
on the rail at the eighth pole, shifted out off the retreating early leader in deep stretch to be a troubled fourth at the finish line. TALL BOY JOEL had a loose
lead leaving the chute, was alone setting the fractions down the backstretch, continued up front unopposed through the turn, could not find more for the
drive and was engulfed by runners while drifting at the furlong pole. SING DIXIE tracked the pace three wide outside with his ears pricked down the
backside, chased the pacesetter three wide around the bend, was in range if good enough in the four path turning for home but yielded in the final furlong.
QURBAAN'S KINGDOM settled all alone in mid-pack down the backstretch, was asked for more three wide on the turn but was going in the wrong direction
and had little to show in the stretch running. SAILINGTHEISLANDS was off slowly to trail in the beginning, made no improvement inside down the back
straight, caught up to a rival by the quarter pole but could not be a factor driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
LOOKIN TO CONQUER took command on the fence right at the break, was in hand cantering on the front down the backstretch, was let out a notch when
the field was closing in at the quarter pole and was well rated on the lead to have something left in reserve for the drive to hold safe at the wire. DIXIE
TIMBER travelled on the fence in mid-field on the first turn, settled nicely on the rail down the backstretch, waited to move with horse, saving ground at the
quarter pole, shifted off the fence just outside for clear running room at the eighth pole but could not close in on the winner who had more in the tank.
MAJESTIC APPEAL stalked near the rear in the beginning, co-trailed on the inside four furlongs remaining, began to extend her stride three wide midway
on the final bend, carried her momentum in the four path at the top of the stretch and finished up with intent to be a clear third in the end. TIPSY'S EMPIRE
was under a snug hold tracking the pacesetter in the first turn, settled on the rail, was content to sit just behind the frontrunner along the backside, closed in
to loom in the two path straightening out for home, could not find more late and was out finished in the final furlong. DAISYCREST could see the pack into
the first turn, co-trailed on the outside at the half, offered a brief run three wide outside rivals three eighths from the prize, was in the mix between foes in the
three path at the top of the lane, could not continue its run and wilted in deep stretch. FIREBOLT prompted the pace three wide fighting the riders restraint
going into the first turn, saddled slipped around the first bend, backed away on the outside down the backstretch and galloped across the finish line.

Footnotes
PALIO angled in early, stalked in behind the leaders, came out four wide leaving the turn then another couple paths once in upper stretch and under urging,
took aim, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and drove clear while being kept to the task. MAD DOG N JOE soon led, set the pace from off the rail in
the two path into and on the turn, came out a bit further for the drive, was challenged by an outside rival in upper stretch, overtaken in mid- to late-stretch by
a different foe but kept on to preserve the place. DOWNY BOY got away well then settled just off the leader stalking from outside three wide into the turn,
floated out a bit leaving that bend commencing a mild bid in upper stretch, couldn't get past the leader and kept on one-paced late. LAPOCHKA got away
slowly, settled at the back near the rail, came out seven wide in upper- to mid-stretch, finished up with mild late gain. FAST BOAT TO SKYE was within
range inside but only went evenly in the stretch. MIDNIGHT ARKLE wasn't far off the leaders racing outside foes, came into the stretch six deep, failed to
rally. MUSICAL STRIDE stalked from between foes into the turn, faded.

Footnotes
YOUR VALENTINO had a slim lead between rivals down the backside, gave way momentarily up front midpoint on the turn running on the rail, resurged on
the fence in upper stretch and was game to the wire to just hold off the fast approaching rival for the win. DIALING ARAGORN was unhurried to settle near
the rear in the beginning, shifted outside three wide, three furlongs from the prize, was reaching for more ground swinging out five wide straightening out for
the drive and closed with a rush to just miss for the win at the finish line. CAIRO CAPER was reined back on the fence to track the front duo at the half, was
nudged on the turn, keeping position and pace just behind the contesting leaders and determinedly kept on going behind horses in the stretch to rally late to
get the nod in a photo for third at the wire. ADMIRAL NELSON pressed the issue on the outside down the backstretch, pulled the rider to the lead poking his
head in front with five sixteenth left to go, was clinging onto the lead with runners on both sides turning for home and faded in the final seventy yards to
settle on the fringes. COMMANDER WORSLEY improved down the backstretch to track on the outside in the second flight by the half, was roused three
wide midway on the turn, just off the front two outside, had a chance in the four path outside rivals at the top of the lane but retreated while urged
left-handed at the furlong pole. ISAAC LEO was void of early speed to trail down the back straight, shifted outside to travel four wide at the three furlong
pole, was in range in the six path at the top of the lane but could not offer a finish in the drive to the wire.

MY MUNNINGS MODEL was bumped at the start, settled mid-pack, went two wide through the turn edging closer, rallied inside the leader to get up late.
MISTER HOLDEN pressed the pacesetter early while under a tight hold, was allowed to go on nearing the half and took charge, moved clear two deep on
the turn into upper stretch, was caught late. CAUGHT SPEEDING was kept quite wide in the early going, entered the turn four deep stalking just off the
leaders, was asked for run at the quarter pole but needed more late. FOREST FLASH settled outside, went three then four then five wide on the turn, ran on
in the stretch. LONHRO'S GAMBLE settled at the rear, swung six wide turning for home, showed with mild late interest. I'VE DECIDED broke awkwardly
bumping a rival and lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch bumping with a rival a couple times, failed to threaten. ROCK
IT RED lacked early speed despite encouragement, raced outside a foe two deep through the turn coming out wider for the drive, was bumped then
exchanged more contact in upper stretch, failed to rally. PANYARD TAP was urged from the break, set the pace inside facing pressure, came up empty.

Footnotes
PEGGY tracked the leader between horses in the first turn, was then throttled back to have an ideal set up all alone watching the engaged pair down the
backstretch, moved to bid for the lead three wide at the quarter pole, battled outside through the stretch and began to draw clear in the last sixteenth.
DUVAL STREET was nestled on the rail near the rear down the back straight, waited for running room patiently sitting behind the contesting trio at the
quarter pole, found a seam in the three path with an eighth to run, drifted out under left-handed encouragement driving to the finish and closed late to garner
the pace share in the end. PRIVACY SETTING (FR) tracked three wide into the first turn outside rivals, prompted the slow pace outside down the
backstretch, poked her head in front with five sixteenths from home, was asking for the wire when rivals were on each side in upper stretch and faded
nearing the wire to save the show money. RYO AMAZING travelled outside in the two path near the back in the early stages, moved four wide closing the
gap smartly at the quarter pole, loomed a threat in the five path at the top of the lane and finished up willingly for a minor share in the end. DESIGN DIVA
broke inwards, checked at the start to trail the field, continued at the rear down the backside, started to gather momentum making a run on the far turn, tried
to split runners with a late rally in the four path at the furlong pole, was in tight quarters, had to be steadied, clipping heels, was then shifted outside but
could not recover to be involved at the finish. ARCTIC BLONDE seized the lead getting to the rail on the first turn, was hounded outside while setting a tepid
pace along the backside, gave way up front midway on the final turn inside, stubbornly battled on the fence through the lane until the sixteenth pole but
could not go on late and folded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ had a slim lead after the break, dueled outside with a pesky foe along the backside, put away the early challenger to open up
midway on the turn and was kept to the task to the wire to hold safe comfortably at the finish line. RIVER OF BABYLON was part of the tracking group three
wide between horses down the back straight, kept pace with the leaders on the turn and offered a good stretch rally with his late run to hold for the place
share in the end. BILL NEEDLE was allowed to settle near the rear in the early stages, began to pick up runners travelling outside by the quarter pole,
angled out widest in the seven path for the drive and closed in the stretch to just get up for third in a tight photo. BET N WIN tracked between rivals in the
two path at the half, was hard ridden on the fence midturn keeping pace with the front group, had a chance for a share inside at the top of the stretch, drifted
out when asked left-handed at the sixteenth pole and finished up mildly for a small piece of the prize in the end. MOMENT OF ZEN forced the pace on the
inside in the early going, bobbed heads for the lead down the backstretch, could not go on with the winner with five sixteenths from the wire, tried to keep
going in upper stretch, had little left to offer and gave way at the seventy-yard pole. GOOD SOLDIER broke out on the start, stalked on the fence near the
back of the pack in the backstretch, made little headway saving ground on the oval, was checked mildly losing his path nearing the sixteenth pole and could
not be a factor late. BENLION watched the dueling pair while four deep on the outside of rivals down the backstretch, took closer order chasing the twosome
around the bend, could not gain on the front pair turning for home and flattened out between foes in deep stretch. SNOOKERED was brushed inside on the
start, trailed the field by the half, could not get involved running around the bend and showed some late interest on the fence in the last sixteenth.
PREETZAH'S STAR hopped on the break to trail after the start, made an early move four deep passing rivals down the backstretch, tracked the front trio
four wide on the turn, could not sustain the run in the five path at the top of the stretch and tired with an eighth remaining. COLLABORATIVE tracked on the
rail at the half mile marker, could not accelerate three furlongs from home with rivals making a move and was not a presence in the stretch drive.
