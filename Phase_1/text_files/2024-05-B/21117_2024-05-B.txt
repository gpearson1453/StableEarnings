Footnotes
KIP THE DISTANCE broke out and bumped an outer foe, laid up close along the inside but had to steady approaching the turn, was coaxed along the rail
midway around the turn, but steadied again at the top of the lane, managed to kick on up the rail to bid passing the sixteenth, and drew past the outer
pacesetter in the final strides. BREEZEY Z set the pace inside, waited from just off the rail rounding the turn, was cued from the two path into the stretch,
dug in down the stretch into the final furlong, but was edged out by an inner foe in the closing stages. CHINA BLUE got fractious in the gate, chased in the
four path, came under coaxing while two wide midway around the turn, and kept on from the three path down the lane for show. GLORY GLORY got
bumped by an inner foe at the start, pressed in the three path, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, but flattened on her left lead. CLASS PLAY
prompted the pace in the five path but faded in the stretch. CAJUN PRIME trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BRYCE CANYON settled off the pace four wide, advanced four deep rounding the far turn, took over in midstretch and drove clear. EL SOCIO set the pace
in the two path, led to midstretch and held clear of the rest. BRINGER OF RAIN prompted the pace in the three path, was urged along around the far turn,
angled to the rail near the quarter pole, was no match for the top two but held third. COACH ABERNATHY chased the pace three and four wide and lacked
the needed rally. POUND GREEN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CHAPALU raced up close inside and faded through the lane.
GUILLAUME played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
POWER HUMOR bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close in the four path, bid two wide midway around the turn, took the lead while being cued
and floating out to the four path at the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. SCAR chased inside, was driven in the three path around the
turn, bid while angling out to the five path turning into the stretch, but hung on his left lead for place. THE SKIPPER TOO stalked in the six path, was ridden
from the four path into the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. FLOAT ON bumped with an inner foe at
the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside early around the turn, but faded in the final furlong. NOBLE DRAMA trailed in the three
path early and never threatened. MACLIN bumped with foes on both sides at the start, rated in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front in midstretch and edged clear under a
drive. MY ROYAL VOW was hard to handle between foes around the first turn, checked late on that bend, raced in range three and four wide and ran on for
the place. LADY AZTECA raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied for the show. OKAY FINE was pushed five wide early on the first turn, advanced
outside around that bend, pressed in the three path down the backstretch and around the far turn and was outfinished. DIAMONDS FOR LILY chased the
pace inside and lacked a closing bid. VAL'S GAL set the pace in the two path nd faltered in the final furlong. ANDIE ONE failed to menace while racing four
wide.

Footnotes
CAP FERRAT showed the way in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, faced an outer challenger while swinging out to the three path turning
into the lane, and dug in gamely to hold off an outer foe. VINCEY GIRL chased in the four path, ranged up passing the quarter, bid from the four path
entering the stretch, and ran on to sustain that bid to the wire, but was denied by the inner pacesetter to settle with place. TINKI ABARRIO trailed in the two
path, moved up along the rail rounding the turn, was cued passing the quarter, tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, but was one paced for show.
SECRET REVENGE rated inside, had to steady passing the half mile marker, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, angled out to the eight
path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. RIDE ON CUPID tracked in the five path, was ridden between foes from the two path around the turn, but
weakened down the lane. SPICY GUACAMOLE prompted the early pace from the four path but backed up between foes around the turn. LAURIE BLUE
stalked in the five path but gaveway entering the turn, and was eased through the stretch.

BLUEFIELD pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, dueled outside through the lane and prevailed. COUSIN KRISTI bumped with
ROSIE'S HALO at the start, set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of the winner through the lane and just missed in a game try. STARSHIP NALA
stalked the pace inside, angled three wide in upper stretch and was one-paced to maintain the show. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU was off a step slow,
advanced inside down the backstretch, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, had aim in upper stretch but lacked the needed rally. ROSIE'S
HALO bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and faded. SHE'S OUTTA HERE trailed while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
GABAGOOL set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. KATRIEL saved ground in midpack and ran on at the rail to be a clear second without
threatening the winner. FRISSON raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and was just up for the show. YEAGER stalked the pace
four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. WINE EMPIRE failed to menace while racing four and five wide. DROPKICK MURPHY
pressed the winner in the three path and faltered in the lane. DOWN IN THE VALLEY threw his head at the start and was away very slowly then trailed
inside. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.
