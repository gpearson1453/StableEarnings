DISCLOSURE trailed for nearly a half, circled his field four wide through the far turn to make the lead before the quarter pole, shook clear inside the furlong
marker and lasted under strong handling. R CARDINAL PRINCE never far back, surged in the seven path through the final sixteenth of a mile and was
steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU chased the early pace, loomed boldly between horses before a half, battled into
the stretch then was outfinished while finishing on even terms with MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU at the wire . NIGHT TIME RULER sprinted to a clear lead
soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for a little over a half mile, kept on but was outfinished. CENTSOFWANDER failed to menace. BLESS
THE KITTEN offered a mild bid three wide before a half, had speed through the far turn then came up empty.

IT'SGOODTOBESEEN broke sharply, set a pressured pace along the rail into the stretch, was headed before the furlong marker, dug in gamely under left
handed urging and got back up in time. WETZEL stalked the early pace, rallied two wide through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch, battled to the wire
but was denied. STARS N SPACE drifted in bumping BAD BOY BOOGIE at the start, improved position in the five path into the stretch then leveled off.
GIFT OF OAK saved ground and went evenly. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER failed to menace. RED HOT POWER pressed the pace two wide and was
through after a half. DASH OF FIRE had brief speed. TAMMY'S TOY was always outrun. BAD BOY BOOGIE bobbled, bumped then was squeezed at the
start and was never a threat.

MISS SHADY broke sharply, dueled for the lead two wide into the turn then along the inside through the stretch and proved best under right handed urging
by a narrow margin in a game effort. EPICUREAN hopped at the start, settled along the rail, shifted three wide past the half mile marker, surged to the front
midway on the turn, matched strides to the wire and finished second best. ROSY APPLE went evenly. CONSTITUTIONALIST contested the lead along the
rail into the turn then gradually weakened.

Footnotes
STAY THIRSTY AMIGO never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch and got up in the final strides. K P SILVER BULLET dueled for the
lead along the inside into the stretch, edged clear near the furlong marker then just missed hanging on. SAHM TEQUILA dueled for the lead two wide into
the stretch then was outfinished between horses in a game effort. BAD LITTLE BEAST had good early speed along the inside, dropped back while shifted
out five wide at the top of the stretch then came on again late. IT'S FATE failed to menace. BUSTIN THE RULES battled for the early lead four wide, was
righted entering the turn, kept on into the stretch then weakened. LOST IN MANHATTAN was hustled from the gate, on even terms for the lead three wide
the opening quarter, checked nearing the turn and dropped back.
