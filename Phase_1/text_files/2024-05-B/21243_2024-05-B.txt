Footnotes
TIGERITO raced in tight quarters nearing the opening turn, shifted out to the two path, rallied determinedly between foes entering the stretch, and prevailed
under a drive. MONEY MUNCHER raced four wide leaving the back, rallied outside through the stretch, and was out finished. LIL ZAPPER crossed over to
the rail to set the pace, and lacked the rally needed. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH stalked the pace, steadied in the turn, and offered a mild bid. SMART CAT
failed to menace. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of INDEPENDENCE NEIGH against the rider of TIGERITO alleging interference
into the opening turn was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

FIRECRACKER STAND quickly cleared the field, saved ground in the final turn, and drew off under a strong hand ride. SMASH FACTOR fanned three wide
leaving the backstretch, launched an all-out bid into the stretch from the rail but was no match for the winner. JERSEY SHADOW was reserved off the
pacesetter, and passed tiring foe late. MOONSHINE NOW saved ground inside, and came up empty in the drive.

QUEEN RHONDA raced in the back of the pack, swung out to the five path at the head of the lane, closed steadily and got up in time. MILITARY SASS took
control early, saved ground through the far turn, came under urging to the stretch, and was narrowly denied. GOLDIE SOCKS stalked the pace from the rail,
lodged a bid into the stretch and improved in the final yards. ROCK CHALK raced from the four path, chased the leader in the final turn, and weakened late.
NIGHTFALL chased between rivals entering the first turn, and gave way.
