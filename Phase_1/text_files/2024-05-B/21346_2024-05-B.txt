BACK FORTY prompted the early pace four to three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, then drew clear
leaving the turn and drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best while being ridden out. WARRIOR'S DEFENSE set a pressured pace on the inside
and then proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for the place award. FILTERED LIGHT chased the pace on the outside, four wide on the turn
and came five wide off the bend and finished well for the show award to best the rest. MAYDAY MAYHEM pressed the pace in the three to two path and in
between rivals, then swung out four wide leaving the bend and weakened. LADY AHAVA broke in and bumped with a foe at the start, settled two wide and
had no rally. ROCK N REWARD tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. LEO'S PISCES was bumped at the break, reserved and raced two wide on
the turn and failed to respond.

GURT'S WARRIOR set the pace on the inside and shook clear on the turn, then came two wide off the turn and drifted out nearing the sixteenth marker and
then was corrected and held on late to prove best, driving. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn, then rallied well
on the outside to just miss. NECCO pressed the pace two wide, then fell off the leader on the turn while being ridden along to keep up, came three wide off
the turn and ran on but needed more late. GRUMPY BROOKSIE chased the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. COWBOY JIM chased the pace
and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. NOTORIOUS REY was settled early, came wide into the lane and was not a threat. Jockey of number two
NECCO claimed foul against the winner for interference in the stretch, after the Stewards reviewed the replays the OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED and
the race made official as is.

Footnotes
SAPONARA pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and was clear by the quarter pole and dropped to the inside and then drew
off to prove much the best while being ridden out. SCREEN STAR tracked the pace four to three wide and then kept on to be second best while no match to
the winner. I ONCE STOOD ALONE was well placed on the inside and faded in the drive while staying on for the show award. SANTO hit the gate breaking
from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, came five wide off the bend and improved late. AGAINST THE ODDS chased the pace and was three wide
on the turn and weakened. GET DOWN BROWN set a pressured pace on the inside, then was two wide off the bend and weakened. FIRE DOWN BELOW
was settled and two wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and was not a threat.
