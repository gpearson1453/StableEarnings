Footnotes
CASH'S CAT set the pressured pace while two-wide, responded when asked and proved best under strong handling. MONGOLIAN SPRING was off a step
slow then moved up along the inside nearing the turn to prompt the issue but was unable to get by the winner in a game effort. THE GOLDEN EGG disputed
the pace while three-wide and held on well for the show. SPORT COAT was unhurried early, rallied along the inside into the stretch and went evenly late.
ARIZONA DAVIN was prominent early while racing four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. ELUSIVE GOLD hopped at the start then
was forwardly placed to the stretch while three-wide and weakened. GOTHAM'S FINALE was unhurried early while four-wide, came six-wide into the stretch
and failed to seriously threaten.

ALEX'S GIRL saved ground setting the pace under pressure from FRISCO FRILLS, responded when headed by the one nearing the quarter pole and came
back along the inside to prevail narrowly. FRISCO FRILLS prompted ALEX'S GIRL from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter
pole but was unable to resist her late in a game effort. CLASSIC LEAH saved ground chasing the top-two but lacked the needed late response in a steady
effort. MISCHIEF MAMA hopped at the start then was allowed to settle, was two-wide nearing the quarter pole and went evenly. SQUARE FOOTAGE was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide and weakened. CONFIDENCE BUILDER was unhurried early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole but
failed to seriously threaten.

Footnotes
TAINO HOUSE prompted UPPER ROOM from along the outside, took the lead from that one entering the stretch and gradually drew clear. CLAYTON
DELANEY was off a step slow, worked his way forward racing two-wide on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished fast. WEAR THE
CROWN was reserved off the early pace while racing four-wide and finished in a mild rally. UPPER ROOM was forwardly placed while racing three-wide
and finished well in a steady effort. SINGLE MERIT saved ground setting the pressured pace to the stretch and weakened slightly. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN
saved ground racing in the middle of the field but lacked a rally. BRONY BOY was unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
HYDROGEN dropped back while racing five-wide on the turn and was not a factor. ANNA'S IRON MAN showed brief speed while racing four-wide and gave
way.
