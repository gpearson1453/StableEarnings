Footnotes
NOVINOPHOBIA was crowded at the start and broke a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, guided two to three wide into the turn and gained
ground at the quarter marker, roused two to three wide into the stretch, loomed four wide at the furlong marker, overtook his stablemate into the final
sixteenth and held in a drive to prevail. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM broke out at the start, bothered a neighboring rival and was off a step slowly, was allowed to
settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and advanced approaching the quarter pole, swung widest for the stretch drive and continued his rally
at the furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and got up in the final strides to secure the place
honors. FORMIDABLE THREAT hustled away from the start, assumed early command and sped to a clear lead heading to the half-mile marker, set solid
fractions while clear into the turn, led into the stretch and kept foes at bay approaching the furlong marker, was overtaken by his stablemate into the final
sixteenth, was tagged for second in the final strides and was clear at the finish for third. ST BOADIN away in good order, tracked the solid early pace and
was well positioned approaching the turn, chased FORMIDABLE THREAT to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit two to three wide into the stretch and gained
ground at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response into the final sixteenth and was outkicked. BIG BET was bothered at the start by a
neighboring rival then in turn crowded NOVINOPHOBIA , recovered to track the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and was well
placed nearing the quarter pole, shifted to the two path into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final
sixteenth and flattened out. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MOBOU prominent away from the start, attended to the early pace while outside of ROBIE, prompted that rival through modest fractions along the
backstretch run, was roused into the far turn and drew to even terms with the pacesetter approaching the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch
and was set down for the drive, shook free nearing the furlong marker, kept to task into the final sixteenth and held in a drive at the finish. HONOS MAN was
a bit slow away from the start, unhurried in the early going while never far back, was well positioned approaching the half-mile marker, was roused into the
far turn and gained ground two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, loomed while widest at mid-stretch,
was outfinished by MOBOU into the final sixteenth and was second best. ROBIE sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and showed the way
into the first turn while off of the rail, set modest fractions while prompted into the backstretch run, was confronted by MOBOU along the far turn and met
that rival's bid nearing the quarter pole, lost the lead into the stretch and chased MOBOU heading to the furlong marker, gave way in the final sixteenth and
was clear at the finish for third. ECOLOGIST tracked the early pace from the outside, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace
nearing the half-mile marker, was guided three to four wide into the far turn and chased to the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and could not muster
a late response. TABLE FOR TEN stalked the early pace from the inside, raced close up to the modest pace while saving ground approaching the half-mile
marker, was outrun into the second turn, trailed into the stretch and was not persevered with in the final stages. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

CLASSY broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, dictated terms into the first turn, drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run and set a
modest pace nearing the half-mile, maintained a clear lead into the far turn and held sway approaching the quarter pole, kept to task while clear into the
stretch, felt a bit of late pressure from the oncoming runner-up and held safely in a drive at the finish. LOOKOUT PASS was crowded at the break and was
off slowly, settled five wide into the first turn, shifted to the two to three path into the backstretch run and gained ground at the half-mile marker, continued to
advance while two to three wide into the far turn, chased three to four wide into the stretch, sustained her rally at the furlong marker and closed well into the
final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was clear in the end for second. HANG ON broke out and crowded a neighboring rival at the
start, settled off of the early pace and was guided three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and made a middle move
to reach contention at the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit of CLASSY into the far turn, chased two wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker,
weakened in the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish. MISS PERU was unhurried in the early going, trailed into the first turn and lagged into the
backstretch run, was guided three wide into the far turn and improved position at the quarter pole, chased three to four wide into the stretch, was gaining in
the final furlong and just missed for third on the wire. ADJUST THE HEAT was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide into the first
turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and stalked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, was outrun into the second turn and gave way
in the stretch drive. CARLSBADGAL stumbled at the start and was away slowly, settled in the four path into the first turn, shifted to the inside entering the
backstretch run and saved ground while not far back approaching the half-mile marker, maintained an inside path into the far turn, could not keep pace
approaching the quarter marker and lacked a response in the stretch drive. LADY PROUD prominent away from the start, tracked the early pace from an
inside position and was well placed into the backstretch run, tracked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased the pace into the far turn,
was outrun to the quarter pole, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power. This race was originally hand

Footnotes
GIANT KID raced on the outside of the tracking group in the five path, was a little slow to get into a good rhythm but was soon tracking close up but wide,
continued that path through the turn while advancing on the lone pacesetter, went to challenge turning into the stretch, gradually cut into the margin for the
whole of the stretch run, gained the advantage inside the sixteenth and held to the wire. SMILING MOLLY broke well, cleared off and led the field through
solid fractions under some restraint, continued to lead the way through the turn then had something left when challenged by GIANT KID at the top of the
stretch, kept that foe at bay to deep stretch but gave way inside the last sixteenth in a good effort. PERSUASIVE LIPS tracked close up between horses
through the early stages, was having to be ridden near the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground then found a second wind turning for home as BREVE was
trying to make a move on the outside, rallied under strong handling and right handed urging and was able to gain the third spot. BREVE was off slowly and
spotted the field a head start, moved out to the three path, raced at the back of the compact field not far from the front, went into a drive before the three
furlong marker but was unable to improve until passing one in the late stages. READY TO GIG broke well and stalked a length or two behind SMILING
MOLLY through the early stages, loomed a threat passing the quarter pole but could not keep up with the top two in the stretch, lacked any late kick and
was outfinished in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ANISETTE bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, rushed up and was well placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace heading to the
half-mile marker, chased into the far turn and was roused two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch, took command and
kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and was ridden out in the late stages to be much the best. SANGER STYLE broke
out at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early running, content to trail approaching the half-mile, saved ground into the far turn and improved
position nearing the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch, could not impact the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished SMILINGATTHEMOON to
earn place honors. SMILINGATTHEMOON got squeezed at the break but was away in good order and was prominent in the early going, stalked the pace
from a three wide path along the first turn, prompted the moderate pace into the backstretch run, vied between rivals into the far turn and took a narrow lead
at the quarter pole, was overtaken by ANISETTE inside of the three-sixteenths, chased the winner to mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was
outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. RIVER MARKET hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first
turn while off of the rail, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, came under pressure into the far turn and lost the lead at the
quarter pole, chased from the inside into the stretch, could not find more into the final furlong and faded. AFTER MY OWN HEART allowed to settle while
never far back in the early stages, was guided four wide into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the
half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn and was outkicked at the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final
furlong. GEEJAYTEE allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, guided two wide into
the second turn, was outrun into the stretch and failed to threaten. VIOLET THUNDER tracked the early pace three wide and from between rivals, was well
placed into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace approaching the half-mile, chased from the three path entering the second turn, was outrun
to the quarter pole, trailed into the stretch and could not muster a late response. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CLOVISCONNECTION broke best but was content to cede the lead to TALBOT BAY early, sat just off that one while always traveling well, moved to
challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, met some resistance in upper stretch but took command with a furlong to go and pulled away to a dominating win
despite wandering a bit in the final yards. TALBOT BAY broke a bit slowly then was hustled forward, gained the lead then moved out to the middle of the
track, was left alone to set the pace with CLOVISCONNECTION stalking from a length or two back, was challenged at the quarter pole by that foe to the
outside and by LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF to the inside, fought back between those horses in upper stretch then altered course to the outside for clear run,
kept on under strong handling and won the place in a good effort while no match for the winner. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF tracked close up through the
initial stages then steadied slightly when TALBOT BAY took the path near the half-mile pole, stayed to the inside of the field about two paths away from the
rail, responded when set down near the quarter pole, was inside of three across the track at the top of the stretch battling for the lead, could not match
strides with the winner but dueled with TALBOT BAY for the second spot, was outfinished by that one late but was well clear of the next horse. TOP
HARBOR broke a step slow then tracked widest of all in the five path down the backstretch, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths pole, made a
menacing move through the turn, came five wide into the lane then flattened out in upper stretch while drifting in the rest of the trip. SHARONA'S WILD BOY
broke well but had to be ridden some to keep up with the pace early on, made a mild bid from the three furlong marker, remained in a drive to the wire but
was outrun. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

STYLISH DRESS prominent away from the start, stalked the decent early pace from between rivals, was well placed approaching the turn, chased from the
inside heading to the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the stretch drive and confronted SHADOWED THOUGHTS nearing the furlong marker, battled the
game runner-up into the final sixteenth, wore down SHADOWED THOUGHTS in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final strides for a determined win.
SHADOWED THOUGHTS sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a pressured pace nearing the half-mile, carved out decent fractions
into the turn, set the pace while off of the rail and shook free nearing the quarter pole, was confronted into upper stretch by STYLISH DRESS, met that
rival's bid at the furlong marker and battled into the final sixteenth, was bested the determined winner in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for
second. LEEDSTHESKY forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent early pace from between runners and was well placed approaching the
turn, chased the leaders from the two path heading to the quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, could not impact
the leading pair into deep stretch and was clear of the rest for third. JUNIORS KITTY broke a bit awkwardly but was away in decent order, took back off of
the decent early pace, was guided three wide into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, could not threaten the leaders into the stretch
and passed tiring rivals in the late stages. ZIPPIDY DU DAD broke a step slowly away from the gate, rushed up and chased the early pace from the outside,
ran in pursuit four wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, was a bit green while traveling on the left lead
past mid-stretch and faded in the late stages. DADDY'S HONEY broke alertly, contested the early pace while between rivals, pressed the decent pace into
the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. INTRUSIVE away in good order, got
caught in tight a bit away from the start and was shuffled back in the early stages, trailed to the half-mile marker, was guided four wide into the turn and
trailed heading to the quarter pole, lacked a response in the stretch and did not factor. BRONZE'S FLOWER chased the decent early pace from the inside,
saved ground into the turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and came up empty in the final furlong. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
