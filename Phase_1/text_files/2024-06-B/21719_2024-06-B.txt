Footnotes
BOBBIE SOX showed the way along the inside, met an outer challenge nearing the lane, repelled that bidder in upper stretch, shook clear and held sway.
CHANISA broke out multiple paths at the start, tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, ranged up to attempt a bid nearing the lane, but was
turned away in upper stretch, kept on in pursuit through the final furlong but was kept at bay. ICED MOCHA pressed outside of the leader and from the three
path, but failed to sustain pressure while chasing between horses into the turn, then yielded to the top pair entering upper stretch. MISS SAIPAN leaned in
at the start, raced at the rear of the short field in the three to four path, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and failed to factor. GATITA SUAVE chased
along the inside into the turn and tired.

CHRYSO ALOGO rushed to the front early on, showed the way in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure around the turn, inched free of that one in
upper stretch and held sway. STINGY broke out many paths at the start, pressed the eventual winner from the three path around the turn, but failed to
sustain pressure in upper stretch and chased the leader home. BARNABY chased in the four path under urging into the turn, then ran on to be best of the
rest. QUENCIO stalked close up inside of the leaders, but faded through the lane. PATRIARCHAL trailed in the two path and made little impact.

pressure, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, vied with his outer counterpart around the far turn, sparred through upper stretch, but was headed nearing

OWEN ALMIGHTY broke a beat slow, stalked in the five to four path moving forward outside of rivals approaching the turn, bid outside of the leader and in
the three path entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear in the final sixteenth with good
energy. BOB'S CARROT showed the way in the two path while under constant coaxing into and around the turn, met the eventual winner's challenge
entering the lane, dueled while getting headed in midstretch and was second best. ART FAIR raced forwardly in the four path and between horses, was
roused in the three path into the turn, vied for show with inner bidders in upper stretch and secured that position while no match for the top pair. I GOT
GAME stuttered half a step and bumped an inner rival at the start, then bumped with rivals on both sides and steadied back early, laid off of the pace along
the inside, advanced in the three path and between horses turning for home, shifted across a rival's path and brushed that one before splitting foes passing
the three sixteenths pole, offered an inside bid for show in the aftermath but was kept at bay. GIOCOSO broke slowly, trailed in the five path, advanced
outside of rivals turning for home then leveled off. STATES' RIGHTS broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the four to five path, advanced into the turn,
chased turning for home, but yielded between horses in upper stretch. INNOVATOR bumped with an inner rival while put to tight quarters among foes early
on, laid off of the pace two wide and between horse, altered course to the four path to maneuver around faltering foes nearing the three furlong pole, but
was blocked and took contact from an inner rival when that one shifted across his path in upper stretch, then failed to menace. BOSS OF ALL BOSSES
raced forwardly two wide and between horses but gave way into the turn. DREAM ON bumped with an outer rival at the start, took contact to his hind
quarters from an outer rival early on, stalked along the inside, chased into the lane and faded. MAYBE EYE'LL CALL chased forwardly three wide and
between horses but faded into the turn.

the final furlong, bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past late. REGAL REY vied two wide, led in the four path in upper stretch, drove clear but was collared
by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and got bested. QUARRYMEN saved ground trailing around the turn, rallied inside of rivals to edge show passing
the furlong grounds and held that position late. ARTWELL stalked behind the leaders and in the two path, brushed an outer rival to shift to the four path
entering the lane, then only managed to chase between horses thereafter. ICEATUDE laid off of the pace in the four to five path, shifted out to the seven
path entering midstretch, ran on with a belated kick and missed fourth at the wire. RANSOMWARE chased forwardly in the three path under urging into the
turn, but was floated to the five to six path by an inner rival entering the lane and faded between horses. EE YAH vied for the lead with an outer rival around

Footnotes
PAPILIO (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked in the two path around the far turn, moved between horses while bumping an outer rival
entering the lane, tipped to the four path to take aim outside of the leaders in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, drove clear and held sway.
GLITTERING LIGHTS (GB) pursued from midpack two wide, then in the three path around the far turn, swung out to the six path entering upper stretch,
rallied to take aim on the newly clear leader in the late stages, but was kept at bay. PAINT ME PERFECT took contact from an outer rival at the start, laid
well back along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, rallied with a belated kick and reached show late.
ZAWISH vied for the lead two wide, then between horses turning for home as an outer rival offered a bid, held sway through upper stretch, but was caught
by an outer challenger passing the furlong grounds and yielded. CALLIE'S GRIT bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked behind the leaders and from the
two path, ranged up outside of them to bid three wide turning for home, but failed to sustain her bid while between horses in upper stretch and gave way.
LADY EMILY KATHRYN steadied back when pinched between rivals at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane and
failed to menace. QUEENS COMMAND (IRE) lacked speed along the inside, shifted out entering upper stretch but never got involved. TITUBA tracked two
wide, got floated four wide while inching closer around the far turn, took contact from an inner rival entering the lane and faded between horses. INFINITE
DIAMOND vied along the inside, but yielded entering the lane and weakened. FLATTER ME SILLY broke a step slow, trailed along the inside and got
outrun.
