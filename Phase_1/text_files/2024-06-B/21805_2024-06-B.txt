MDA SENORITA RUN stalked the top dueling pair, advanced three wide through the far turn and finished well to draw clear under strong handling.
DISCREET DEAL dueled near the rail, kept on but was no match for the winner. ON THE MONEY LUV dueled for the early lead from the inside outside of
rival and weakened through the drive. SWEET MARIN was off a step slow, hard ridden three wide through the far turn, was five deep into the upper stretch
and was even with no closing run. ABBEY CAKES was off slowly, trailed early, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

between deep stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. PREFERITO DA BARBI stalked the pace, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole and faltered
the final eighth of a mile. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, saved ground through the far turn, raced
from inside into the upper stretch, angled out through the drive and had no late rally. ALL TOGETHER settled off the early going and failed to respond.
