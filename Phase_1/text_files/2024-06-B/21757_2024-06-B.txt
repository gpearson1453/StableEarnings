finished in a mild rally. KERRYGOLD LADY was allowed to settle, moved closer nearing the quarter pole while two-wide but lacked a rally when asked.

CLASSIC AMERICAN saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off to win as much the best. BUMPING RIVER saved ground chasing CLASSIC
AMERICAN but was unable to threaten that one while finishing well for second. COASTAL GIRL was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. LEAH'S LUTE saved ground while being reserved off the pace but lacked a rally. GROOVY GRAY GAL was forwardly placed to the
srtetch while racing three-wide and tired.

of the field while racing four-wide but failed to seriously threaten. BEAU MISCHIEF was allowed to settle while racing three-wide on the turn, angled out to
be five-wide entering and failed to menace. SMOOTH PAPA dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch but failed to be a factor. MOJAVE was

Footnotes
SCATALICIOUS was allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught the leaders nearing the eighth pole gradually edged clear
late. BIG JOLT broke out to bump INFINITE LOVE then saved ground chasing the dueling leaders, angled out 3-w nearing the quarter pole, took a slight
lead nearing the eighth pole but wasn't quite good enough. INFINITE LOVE was bumped from both sides at the start then dropped back while saving
ground, slipped through during the drive and closed strongly. METEOR SHOWER was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch but
lacked the needed late response. RAINBOW STEW broke in to bump INFINITE LOVE then vied for the lead with FOREST ACCLAMATION to the stretch
and weakened. FOREST ACCLAMATION vied with RAINBOW STEW for the lead to the stretch from along the outside and tired.
