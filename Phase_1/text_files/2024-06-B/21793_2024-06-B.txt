remained strong to the line. GETEMDUSTY stalked outside a rival then between foes, had to take a brief hold when boxed in leaving the turn, tipped out into
the clear and finished willingly for a clear second. INDIAN ARROW hard to load behind the gate, grabbed the early lead and set the pace outside

Footnotes
SUGAR SUGAR stalked the leading pair from outside, took aim three wide around the bend, got floated out by the leader into the stretch, collared
TROUBLE N PARADISE in upper stretch, battled through the lane and dug in to best the runner-up. TROUBLE N PARADISE dueled from outside to the
turn, cleared inner rival approaching the five-sixteenths pole, drifted into the stretch, met the bid from SUGAR SUGAR at the top of the lane, battled from
inside to the wire but had to settle for second best. DALLAS ALICE chased two wide into the turn, angled out into the lane, flattened in the late stages but
finished clear of the next rival for third. LA CHIQUIS broke a step slow, chased between and got crowded twice up the backstretch, went three wide into the
turn before angling to the inside to save ground, steered out at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. CHOLLIMA tracked from outside, came six wide into the
lane and weakened. MS PARKSIDE dueled from inside to the turn, failed to keep up with outer rival approaching the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the
stretch run.

TIZ TOK chased along the rail into the first turn then angled out to the three path around the bend, traveled between runners around second bend, spun
three wide into the drive, drew alongside MIKE OPERATOR a furlong out and dug in late for the victory. MIKE OPERATOR sped to the front in the two path,
coaxed along up the backstretch, remained clear two then three wide into the stretch, met the bid from TIZ TOK at the eighth pole and yielded grudgingly in
the end. IMPOSSIBLE TASK stalked three then four wide around clubhouse turn, chased outside a rival then three deep up the backstretch, came four wide
into the lane and weakened. GRANADA FLAVOR stalked in the two path then angled over to the rail early, saved ground on the far turn and weakened
down the lane. DOS VICIOS broke out, tracked four to five wide on the clubhouse turn, continued off the rail in range to the far turn, entered the lane five
wide and also weakened.

JOURNEY D' ORO set the pace inside a rival to the turn, cleared while easing to the two path around the bend, then widened through the lane under hand
urging. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN chased outside PAISLEES PROMIES and bumped with that rival approaching the half-mile pole, shifted in and impeded
that rival entering the turn, rounded the bend in the two path and kept on for a clear second. NOTCH drifted out steadily chasing up the backstretch,
rounded the bend two to three wide and churned on down the lane to gain third. I WILL BE KING pressed the pace from outside, could not keep up with the
leader on the turn and chased past the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the lane and faded. TOO WILD TO TAME off slow to begin, chased at the
back then outside a rival, clipped fallen rider early on the turn, remained wide into the lane and could not make an impact. PAISLEES PROMISE fractious in
the post-parade, chased inside a rival off the rail, bumped approaching the half-mile pole, lost his path and clipped heels losing the rider in the process at
the seven-sixteenths pole, was caught by the outrider following the race and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM UNPLACED FOR CAUSING PAISLEES PROMISE TO CLIP HEELS AND UNSEAT HIS
RIDER AT THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE.

RELATABLE settled in the early going, traveled along the rail then tipped two wide past the five-sixteenths pole, moved out further at the top of the lane,
closed in steadily and finally latched onto the leader with a sixteenth remaining, then drove past in the closing moments. VIBEZ chased two wide into the
turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane, surged clear in upper stretch, showed the way unchallenged into the final furlong, confronted by
RELATABLE to the inside in deep stretch and could not fend off the winner. SWEET GEM tracked widest early on then steered into the two path for the turn,
asked right handed three wide leaving the bend, bid between foes in upper stretch but was no match for the top pair. BLISSTERINTHESUN hit the gate then
stumbled and broke out, recovered and went up to clear the field from outside, showed the way along the rail then two wide into the drive, offered no
resistance to VIBEZ in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ONE SUMMER DAY stalked off the rail then angled in for the turn, saved ground to
the stretch and faded in the lane. BEADS coaxed along outside a rival at the back, trailed two then three wide on the turn and came up empty.

RYDER'S CANDY took control early then dueled outside DANZING CAT, drifted out a bit approaching the stretch, put away inner rival in upper stretch,
tested by the runner-up in the final sixteenth and held gamely. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY chased between rivals into the turn, rounded the bend two then
three wide, challenged the leader from inside with a sixteenth remaining but could not get by. SABRES chased four deep into the turn, exited the bend six
wide, chased in tandem with SWEET LIL' DARLIN in the final furlong and edged that rival for third. SWEET LIL' DARLIN raced up close from outside then
gave chase three deep into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and got edged for the show honors. DANZING CAT came in at the start to lose a length,
moved up into contention quickly then dueled with RYDER'S CANDY for command up the backstretch, inched ahead briefly on the turn but was head again
by outer rival, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST broke in, chased along the rail inside a trio of rivals
entering the turn, trailed into the stretch and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
YO TIME brushed leaving the gate, chased outside a rival then three deep into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, bid midstretch and overhauled the
runner-up in deep stretch. SAULS CALL took control early outside a rival then cleared at the half-mile pole, led two then three wide on the turn, challenged
by YO TIME midstretch and yielded late. SO I'M TOLD brushed YO TIME leaving the gate, chased four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and
lacked a bid. FINAL STORM hit the gate then lost his path shortly after, trailed up the backstretch, traveled along the rail then angled out into the stretch and
passed tired rivals. AMERICAN CAT tracked widest up the backstretch, took the turn five, six, then seven wide and weakened down the lane. RACHEL'S
COACH pressed briefly from inside then chased the leader past the half-mile pole, shifted and checked entering the turn, saved ground along the rail to the
stretch and weakened in the drive. BELLY UP stalked off the rail then between rivals entering the turn, raced three wide turning for home and faded.
