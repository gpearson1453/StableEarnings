Footnotes
DJANGO stuttered a step leaving the gates, settled at the rear along the inside, advanced inside of rail-vacating rivals with five furlongs to go to prompt
inside of the leader by the nine sixteenths, sustained pressure around the far turn, took contact while slipping through tight rail quarters to bid inside of the
leader passing the three sixteenths pole, sparked a duel with his outer co-bidding stable-mate entering midstretch, battled neck-and-neck with that one
through the final furlong and prevailed. ELKO COUNTY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, shifted out to the five path with five furlongs to go before
launching an advance outside of rivals passing the half mile pole, progressed to press outside of the leader and in the four path at the three furlong pole,
vied entering the lane, sustained a duel with his inner bidding counterpart through the final furlong but was denied. SIX KINGS tracked in the two to four
path around the first turn, sustained pursuit between horses into the far turn, jostled with an inner rival at the three furlong pole, gave way turning for home,
yet kept on to surpass a tiring rival and gain show at the wire. TAPIT FOR THE WIN showed the way unchallenged in the three path around the first turn, led
between pressers in the two path around the far turn, brushed his inner challenger while getting headed between rivals at the three sixteenths pole, yielded
through the final furlong and lost show at the wire. CAT ON TIME was brushed by an inner rival soon after the start, stalked along the inside, moved out to
the three path pursuing the leader into the backstretch, took contact from an inner rival while chasing between horses leaving the nine sixteenths pole, then
jostled with an outer rival and steadied back from among rivals at the three furlong pole and tired. ASK ARTHUR brushed an outer rival in the opening
stages, laid off of the pace in the two path, advanced along with an inner rival before bumping an outer foe leaving the nine sixteenths pole, dropped back to
trail approaching the turn, then was outrun in the four to six path entering the lane.

Footnotes
XTRA EXTRAORDINARY set the pace outside of a vying rival, drew off entering the lane and kicked away under a drive. LADY ROBO vied for the lead
inside of the eventual winner, proved no match for that one entering the lane and lasted for place. GOLDYS LOCK bumped an outer rival at the start,
pursued forwardly in the two to three path, but only managed to chase through the lane and needed more to bid for place. CRAFTY GAL broke poorly and
spotted the rest multiple lengths at the start, trailed along the inside, advanced shifting to the four path and between horses entering the lane, tipped
inwardly in upper stretch and ran on willingly. CASINO ANNIE laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced past outer rivals at the three furlong pole whlie
shifting out, fanned to the five path entering the lane, but flattened out without reaching contention. LADLE pursued from the five to six path and failed to
factor. MAUI MISTRESS stalked along the inside and weakened entering the lane. TAN PAM broke a step slow and was bumped by an inner rival at the
start, chased in the four path and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
CLOUDWALKER laid off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride shifting from the three path to the five path entering midstretch, then rallied with a
good kick to bid in the final sixteenth and edged past late. MOON SPUN prompted along the inside before chasing an outer rival into the turn, pursued from
the two to three path around the bend, ranged up to bid leaving the furlong grounds, led into the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder in the
closing stages. FOOLISH stalked along the inside, chased in range of the leaders in upper stretch, altered course two wide in the final furlong before getting
outkicked by an outer rival in the late stages, kept on to edge show in the shadow of the wire. CABERNEIGH led two wide before clearing her inner
counterpart approaching the turn, bumped her margin around the turn, held sway into midstretch, but was caught at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. NIKI
NINE DOORS tracked two wide and between horses under snug restraint approaching the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, ran on willingly into the
final furlong, altered course three wide while sustaining progress in the closing stages and missed show late. PELICAN LANE broke a beat slow, raced at
the rear along the inside, trailed in the two path around the turn, swung to the six path entering the lane before floating wider in upper stretch, then rallied
belatedly but too late for a minor share. TWIRLING GOOD TIME tracked tucking from the four to three path into the turn, entered the lane two wide and
between horses and failed to menace. ANTIQUE SILVER bumped with an inner rival, stalked in the three path, got floated to the four path entering the lane,
chased before getting outkicked in the final furlong and faded. PRINCESA CELINA saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. HIDDEN CLASS broke a
step slow, raced towards the rear in the two to three path and between horses and made little impact. TIPSY RUNNER lacked speed in the four to seven
path and failed to factor. MISS PEABODY bumped with an outer rival, got rank, and steadied between horses at the start, pursued off of the pace in the five
to four path and faded.

Footnotes
J T'S IMAGINATION broke a touch outwardly at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, shifted out four wide entering the backstretch, ranged up into the
far turn to offer a bold bid turning for home, led into the lane and drove clear. GAMETIME GLADIATOR leaned out and was taken in hand for correction at
the start, laid off of the pace three wide, was urged along in the four path and among foes around the far turn, progressed entering the lane in the five path,
edged place at the furlong grounds and chased from there. CASHMEUP stuttered a step leaving the gates then steadied hard when put to crowded quarters
at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, trailed awaiting racing room in the three path around teh far turn, swung to the six path entering the lane,
then stayed on willingly for show. WRITE OFF JERRY pursued from midpack along the inside, pulled forward at the pace slowed entering the backstretch,
steadied while resenting restraint from the three quarter pole to the eleven sixteenths, settled and awaited racing room saving ground around the far turn,
split foes two wide entering the lane, shifted to the five path in midstretch and ran on between rivals. WASHINGTON'S UNION bumped an inner rival at the
start, stalked two wide before pressing between horses into the backstretch, forged an advantage as an outer rival loomed boldly passing the three furlong
pole, proved no match for that one entering the lane and gave way. YORK TAVERN broke inwardly hindering an inner rival, stalked three wide, was roused
within striking range between horses at the three furlong pole, but lacked a bid and faded entering the lane. NOTORIOUS SIXOHTWO set the pace along
the inside, got headed by a pair of bidders leaving the three furlong pole and faded turning for home. PATROLMAN broke a beat slow and was bumped by
an outer rival at the start, lagged behind early on, moved out of last in the five path around the far turn, but fanned to the six to seven path into upper stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
OUR PRETTY WOMAN stalked in the three path before moving outside of the leaders and to the five path entering the backstretch, advanced into the far
turn to press outside of the leader and from the three path, bid entering the lane, gained control at the three sixteenths pole, drove clear and held sway.
INTRICATE trailed along the inside early on, tracked two wide and between horses around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch to take aim on the clear
leader from the five path entering midstretch, but was left with too much to do and needed more to reel in the leader. BAND OF GOLD laid off of the pace in
the four path, tucked two wide into the backstretch, pursued between horse before trailing into the far turn, took that turn in the three to four path before
entering the lane in the five path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and ran on willingly. MERASOL SUGAR pressed the leader from the three path into the
first turn, steadied to the four path when briefly rank as the pace slowed approaching the backstretch, gained an advantage in the two path into the far turn,
led from an outer presser turning for home, but was headed by that one at the three sixteenths pole and faded. LUCKY SPEECH set the pace in the two
path as an outer rival applied pressure, got headed entering the far turn and faded turning for home.

FORESEEN stalked along the inside, tracked two wide around the far turn, took aim three wide entering the lane, chased the clearing leader in upper
stretch, ranged up while getting herded out in the final furlong, bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past. LETSTALKABOUTME tracked two wide, bid inside
of the leader entering the far turn, led as that one applied pressure around that bend, drew clear in upper stretch as an outer rival took aim, drifted out in
upper stretch, continued to drift as that one closed in in the final furlong, met that one's challenge at the sixteenth pole and got bested late. HEART
HEADED WOMAN pressed the leader from the three path, forged an advantage from that one entering the backstretch, but remained wide and got headed
by an inner bidder entering the far turn, sustained pressure around that bend, but faded between horses entering upper stretch. HAPPY HAPPY was last
away, trailed in the three path early on, advanced outside of rivals with five furlongs to go, stalked within striking range into the far turn, but chased under
urging turning for home and faded fanning to the five path entering the lane. FLAWLESS QUALITY was antsy behind the gate, set the pace along the
inside, got headed by an outer presser entering the backstretch, chased then faded into the far turn. QUEEN OF THE RODEO laid off of the pace in the two
path, came under urging while trailing in the three path around teh far turn, then failed to menace between horses.

Footnotes
WEBSLINGER settled well back along the inside, launched a rally in the two to three path and between horses around the far turn, shfited four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove past. SUGOI pressed two wide, stalked before bidding turning for home, led
entering the lane, held sway through midstretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole but was bested late. BOLD ACT (IRE) broke a step
slow while last away, trailed two wide, gained following the eventual winner's advance turning for home, swung five wide into upper stretch, sustained
progress to reach show in the final sixteenth and needed more late. ANGLOPHILE tracked two wide, shifted three wide into upper stretch, closed in slowly
but was outkicked by outer rivals in the final furlong and inched fourth in the shadow of the wire. STONE AGE (IRE) set the pace along the inside, got
headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and yielded with a sixteenth to go. RED RUN steadied from cramped quarters among foes early on, laid off of
the pace in the two path, shifted out to the three path at the half mile pole, got floated six wide into upper stretch and faded. WINNING SPIRIT (GER)
tracked along the inside and weakened around the final turn.

Footnotes
TIWANAKU stalked from the three path, ranged up to bid outside of the leader turning for home, led in upper stretch and drove clear. AMERICAN BLAZE
showed the way in the two path, met an outer challenge turning for home, got bested by that one in upper stretch and held place. YONO laid off of the pace
along the inside, shfited out to the five path in upper stretch and offered a late kick to miss place. OUTLIER tracked in the four path, chased around the far
turn, sustained pursuit into deep stretch but lost show late. TEXAS RED HOT bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three path,
then in the four to five path around the far turn before fanning to the six path into the lane, and stayed on mildly. TAPSASIONAL stalked along the inside,
chased in the two to three path through midstretch, but lacked a bid behind a rival and yielded late. FROSTY THE SOLDIER laid off of the pace two wide,
shifted to the five path into upper stretch and failed to factor. SYSTEMIC CHANGE was bumped by an outer rival at the start, lost touch with the rest of the
field entering the first turn, was pulled up entering the backstretch and taken off of the track in an equine ambulance.

GENEROUS LOVER bumped with an outer rival into the first turn, tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn before tipping to
the five path entering the lane, sustained grinding progress to bid in the final furlong and drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole. YO PUEDO broke a
beat slow and brushed an outer rival at the start, then brushed with an inner rival while forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the leader from the three
path, bid at the three furlong pole, forged an advantage in the four path in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer bidder late. BIRDIE ROSE took light
contact from an inner rival at the start, inched clear under restraint in the three to two path around the first turn, met an outer challenge at the three furlong
pole, got headed by that one in upper stretch and kept on. WITS AND WAGERS lacked speed along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, chased
in the five path and between horses around the far turn, tipped to the seven path entering the lane and ran on willingly. LOW COUNTRY MAGIC laid off of
the pace in the three path and failed to factor. MIDNIGHT TANGO stalked in teh four path, moved to press the top pair into the far turn, got floated to the six
path into upper stretch and gave way. ELLIPTIC broke a beat slow, trailed two wide while steadying behind rivals around the first turn, shfited out to the five
path entering the backstretch, improved in the six path and outside of rivals around the far turn, but fanned to the eight path into the lane and tired. BEST

Footnotes
HEART SPIN laid off of the pace three to two wide, rallied to bid inside of the leaders in the final furlong, led leaving the sixteenth pole and held late. JUST
THE SKY broke a step slow, settled towards the rear along the inside, swung from the three path to the eight path entering the lane, rallied with a good kick
while shifting inwardly in the final sixteenth, closed in quickly on the new leader late but missed. ADRASTEIA lacked speed two wide, then in the three to
four path around the far turn, swung to the seven path into the lane, rallied along with an outer rival in the final furlong, got herded inwardly by that one in the
final sixteenth and needed more. ON COMMAND set the pace along the inside, resisted an outer challenge entering the lane, held through midstretch, but
was bested by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole and yielded between horses. RESTLESS DREAMER pressed two wide, bid entering the lane, vied
before flopping back to her left lead at the furlong ground, got outkicked between horses and yielded. MOONLIGHT GAMBLER pursued two to three wide,
shifted to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. KISS BLUE stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but only managed to
chase before fading. KIMBER SPICE lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. TIZ SWEET EMOTION laid off of the pace along the inside, awaited
racing room entering the lane in the two path and failed to menace. APPELLATE broke a step slow, trailed around both turns and made little impact. LUZ
DIVINA stalked three wide, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and weakened between horses. BIG DIG tracked along the inside and faded.
