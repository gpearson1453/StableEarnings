Footnotes
TINA TINA TINA chased off the rail, moved up between runners nearing the lane, shifted out to be four to five wide, made a grinding run under a drive and
just got up outside a trio to her inside. AT FIRST SIGHT , bumped from both sides at the break, saved ground under coaxing while off the pace, eased out
mid turn, closed gamely between runners and just missed. BALI HAI vied outside FAITH AND LIBERTY before clearing off and setting the pace towards the
inside, kicked away under a solid drive while off the rail past the three sixteenths, remained well clear inside the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly.
MO TRAFFIC , away alertly, chased to the outside of a rival, made steady progress inside the sixteenth marker but was out kicked between rivals.
MAJESTY'S FREEDOM , flashed speed then was lightly shuffled back from between runners leaving the five eighths, dropped back and raced between
runners leaving the far turn, saved ground into the lane, altered outward with run near the sixteenth pole and churned on with interest. GOOD STORY ,
bumped at the break, raced off the pace, swung seven wide and made a run leaving mid stretch then flattened out very late. FAITH AND LIBERTY showed
speed and vied for the early lead, saw the leader clear off then stayed on to pursue to the inside of MO TRAFFIC, raced two wide and in range to mid
stretch and faded late. SHORT OF DINERO saved ground and came up empty. JUST THE THING chased three deep, swung out five to six wide for the
drive and weakened. FLITTER , three wide with an advance mid turn, shifted out wider for the drive and tired. JOB'S NOT FINISHED drifted in at the break
and bumped with AT FIRST SIGHT, lagged off the pace, swung seven wide in upper stretch, failed to kick on and was eased late.

horses and narrowly prevailed. GIN GIN'S APPROVAL chased the pace in the two path around the turn, challenged for the lead between horses near the
eighth pole and was out finished. LANDOFHOPEANDREAMS lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail to mid stretch, angled
out near the sixteenth pole and rallied. SPLASH OF JACK raced in mid pack on the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and rallied mildly. SHARED
AUTHORITY bore in sharply leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way in the drive. NO MORE KISSES ,
checked after being bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, swung to the five path in upper stretch and finished gamely. PINK PEONIES (IRE)

Footnotes
CONFLUENCE LASSIE came in at the break impeding ANY FOOLS GOLD, corrected and edged up between rivals, joined PAPERBACK EDITION from
her outside entering the turn, sparred under confident handling, was roused clear in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong
and held sway. SKIP THRU DA FIRE , shoved along saving ground pursuing the embattled leaders, eased out a bit in upper stretch then kept on gamely to
the inside of the winner to bridge the gap and gain the place. STORMY IRISH LASS , forced out at the break, regrouped and was pushed along five wide
with pursuit, shifted out a bit wider for the drive, advanced outside runners leaving mid stretch and continued on willingly to gain. ANY FOOLS GOLD ,
impeded by the winner at the break, steadied then regrouped off the inside, edged up between foes past the three eighths, angled out into the lane, shifted
back in some then came up empty in the final seventy yards. PEACHESSWEETNOTION , between foes advancing mid turn, angled five wide into the
stretch, remained in touch to mid stretch then flattened out. SHIRLEY KNOT , rated off the pace, edged up between runners into the stretch, lacked room
near the three sixteenths, altered well out in the track in the final furlong and finished with ihterest. PAPERBACK EDITION sped to the command inside, was
joined from her outside nearing the turn, dueled under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly past mid stretch then weakened. NEVER
MORE VALOR broke slowly, saved ground and lacked a response. A P M NOTION broke outward, corrected and moved up four wide outside foes, chased
three wide mid turn then tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BEL AMI broke alertly and moved out to a clear lead early on, set the pace under a light hold while towards the rail, moved away without much asking
around the final turn, was put to a ride soon into the lane, responded to a couple of right handed asks inside the furlong grounds and held firm. STOW ON
THE WOLD , bumped at the break, edged up soon after and secured the inside while under some rating, eased off the inside through the backstretch run
then angled out to commence a run leaving the far turn, advanced four wide outside rivals approaching the stretch, shifted in a bit before being righted past
the three sixteenths then closed well through the final furlong. MORTAL SIN was steadied soon after the break, settled well off the pace, angled out near the
three eighths, circled five wide into the stretch and churned on. LONGWORTH , three deep early on, moved up into the far turn, chased between rivals in
mid stretch then went evenly late. IF I WERE YOU , four wide to contention, dropped in for the backstretch run, remained inside with pursuit into the stretch,
eased out briefly then failed to generate a serious finish. SUPER CHUNK , inside foes through the backstretch, angled out nearing the lane, moved up a bit
in mid stretch then flattened out. IJAMSVILLE , the closest pursuer while towards the inside, was put to a hustling ride leaving the far turn, remained a
presence towards the rail entering the lane then weakened nearing the sixteenth marker. ROCK BULLET settled off the pace while saving ground, came out
a bit leaving mid stretch but failed to rally. SHIP MASTER broke a step slow, steadied when in close leaving the seven eighths, made a three wide move into
the far turn, chased to the quarter pole then faded. SCORESTOSETTLE , four wide, failed to menace. HEART OF FIRE was squeezed back from between
horses nearing the first turn, secured the rail after recovering but came up empty. TORTOLA , bumped at the break, moved up early, chased between
runners past the five eighths then faltered before going six furlongs.

Footnotes
REMEMBERING WILBUR assumed the early lead and was taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace in hand, responded to urging leaving
the far turn and was under the whip the final furlong. GALATIANS brushed with EKATI'S VERVE leaving the starting gate, raced outside the winner and
gamely chased that one. WALK AWAY JOE , always inside horses, raced evenly. SOUTHERN DISTRICT , three wide both turns, lacked the necessary rally
in an even effort. UNCAPTURED STORM ,, snugly in hand along the rail the first turn to avoid running up on the winner's heels, was not a late factor.
EKATI'S VERVE brushed with GALATIANS at the start, swung four wide leaving the far turn and came up empty. TATE bobbled and broke awkwardly then
trailed.

mid stretch and drew clear under pressure. CASINO TRICKS sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in mid stretch and finished
willingly. GABRIEL SEVEN prompted the pace outside CASINO TRICKS, gave way inside the eighth pole and lugged in near the sixteenth pole.
HAZEDNCONFUSED , no factor, swung four wide entering the stretch. BALI'S SHADE , lightly bumped by the winner near the five eighths pole, saved
ground on the turn and gave way. CHICA CHUCK lacked speed and faded through the stretch.
