Footnotes
SHE'S SOLID SILVER was forwardly placed in opening stages, took over the lead leaving the backstretch, vied briefly with SHESGOTSPIRIT at the quarter
pole then shook free at the head of the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. SHESGOTSPIRIT tracked the early pace, moved up mid-way
around the turn, vied for the lead with SHES SOLID SILVER at the quarter pole, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the lane, but
sustained a solid bid and finished clearly second best. TENNESSEE GRACE raced in range in the early going, chased three wide around the turn, came
two paths wide into upper stretch, angled inside and churned on for a share. SHE'S MY KINDAGIRL was void of speed and trailed the field, saved ground
around the turn, showed interest at the head of the lane and passed tiring rivals. CANADIAN JANE raced in range along the inside in early stages then
weakened around the turn. BACKSEAT BABY hustled up and led the way in early stages, got collared by the winner entering the turn, chased along the rail
then gave waay.

SEVENTEEN BLACK led the way under pressure around the first turn, edged ahead to clearer command mid-way up the backstretch, widened to a
commanding lead still in hand around the turn, saved ground into the lane and continued to extend the margin of victory while ridden out.
PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL rated off the clear leader up the backstretch, picked up the tempo mid-way around the turn, came three wide into the lane, was
no match for clear winner but ran on and finished clearly second best. CINCO DE MO settled and saved ground up the backstretch, hustled up along the rail
around the far turn, sustained a bid just off the inside and held show. A BRUSH OF LUCK raced off the pace, saved ground then shifted out at the quarter
pole, ran on and just missed show. SPANISH KISS applied pace pressure to SEVENTEEN BLACK around the first turn, then remained forwardly placed up
the backstretch, could not keep pace and retreated around the turn.

MY KINDA TROUBLE moved up just after opening stages and vied for the lead, continued to battle with MARITIME MILLIE into upper stretch, shook free at
the furlong marker and kept to task. FRIENDLY SPIRIT tracked the early pace, chased two to three wide around the turn, sustained response into the lane
and finished with good response. MARITIME MILLIE quickly took command in opening strides then took on rivals soon after, vied around the turn, battled on
into upper stretch, could not match strides at the furlong marker and flattened out. GOLDEN BONITA moved up after opening stages and vied for the lead,
could not match strides late on the turn and faded in the lane. ESKENFORARAISE hustled up out of the gate and raced in close contention along the rail,
was forced to be taken up sharply entering the turn, dropped back and never recovered. TRACIANA raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and
never threatened. MORA HOPPERTUNITY was not too far back in early stages, chased three wide then weakened around the turn and continued to tire in
the drive. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

IRON LOTUS pressed the top pair in early stages then edged up and vied three deep entering the turn, continued to battle outside of DODGEBALL into
upper stretch, took a slim lead a furlong out, edged ahead under firm handling, dug in gamely and held late. SHANIAH tracked the top trio into the turn,
made a four wide move near the quarter pole, raced in striking range in the final furlong, steadily edged up closer nearing the wire and failed to get by the
winner in time. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC tracked the top flight entering the turn, launched a four wide bid turning for home, sustained response into the lane
and finished willingly. DODGEBALL vied inside of rivals for the early lead, battled on with IRON LOTUS into upper stretch, could not move on with eventual
winner past the eighth pole and weakened. TRIBAL SPIRIT lacked speed and trailed the field, swung wide entering the lane and gained some ground in
final stages. AWESOME VIEW vied two wide early in early stages, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive.

FLEETWOOD SMACK vied outside of SPIRITED DREAM in early stages, shook free around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more,
responded and kicked clear. BOBULINSKI tracked the early pace, hustled up two to three wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane, was no
match for clear winner but dug in to capture place. BAD BOY BRAWNY raced in range along the inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, hustled along
two wide into stretch run and got edged late for place. GLOME trailed the field, raced wide out of the turn and never threatened. SPIRITED DREAM vied
inside of the eventual winner in early stages, chased along the inside around the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
JIMMY SLICE tracked the pace along the inside, sat patiently along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner entering top stretch and took command,
sustained a steady bid and held clear. THE HOOF was forwardly placed through early stages, moved up in striking distance at the quarter pole, swung five
paths wide into upper stretch, ran on with good response and edged closer in final stages. GOLD MEMBER tracked the early leaders, chased three wide
around the turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch and ran on with response. MUSEUM QUALITY raced up close two wide into the turn, ran on in
close range past the quarter pole then gave way. CODE ONE lacked speed, trailed in the back and raced wide into the lane. ELUSIVE POWER set a
pressured pace from the onset, fought on around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
RUN FIRE RUN tracked the clear top pair up the backstretch, edged a bit closer late on the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, kicked in
gamely, finished strongly along the outside and got up in time. GOLDEN LUNA dueled inside of ORE MINE from the onset racing clear over the rest, battled
on into the drive, held a slight edge past the furlong marker, kept on gamely and got edged in final stride. ORE MINE dueled outside of GOLDEN LUNA for
the lead up the backstretch, raced well clear over the others and battled on around the turn, continued in striking distance in the final furlong and lacked the
needed kick to get by. I'M AN OAK raced well off the early pace, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and gained some ground. SUCCESSION raced
in the back, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally.
