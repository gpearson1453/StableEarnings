Footnotes
MUSICAL MISCHIEF tracked behind the top pair and from the two path, tipped outside of them approaching the far turn, loomed a danger ranging up
turning for home, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch and inched ahead under a drive. FLASHY LASS brushed an outer rival early
on, set the pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed while vying with that one and a wider challenger turning for home, yet fought on through the lane and
held place late. LEXA laid off of the pace in the four path, crept closer tracking in the three path turning for home, shifted back four wide in upper stretch, ran
on to gain show at the sixteenth pole, closed in on place late but needed more. SULTRY LASS leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, prompted two
wide, vied into the far turn, then between horses as the eventual winner bid nearing the lane, but gave way in upper stretch. LUNA MOTH took light contact
from an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, chased from the four path around the far turn then faded entering the lane in the five path.
CATMINT was brushed between horses early on, laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. CHIQUITA MOSCA brushed with an inner rival
early on, trailed two wide and got outrun.

JUSTIFREAK set the pace inside of a pair of pressers into the turn, dueled with only UNCLE WILLIAM turning for home, gamely clung to an advantage
through midstretch and shook free late. UNCLE WILLIAM was tough to load, pressed two wide and between horses, sparred with his inner counterpart
turning for home, battled through midstretch but was turned away lat. BANNED FOR LIFE stalked outside of the top pair, chased them while failing to
sustain pressure turning for home, then kept on willingly through the lane. BOURBON'S FAULT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the
inside, shifted off of the rail whlie pursuing turning for home, then chased while one paced through the lane. THINK BIG was off slowly, spotted the leaders
multiple lengths and shifted in at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced shifting out to the four path around the bend, swung out to the
seven path entering the lane, shifted in and stayed on. MONDOGETSBUCKETS took light contact from an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack in
the four to five path, floated wider in midstretch and failed to menace. ACCIDENT broke a step slow and steadied between horses at the start, trailed in the
three to two path, then improved up the rail through the lane. HANDSOME HERB broke slowly and got floated inwardly while last away, pursued from off of
the pace two wide and between horses, and failed to factor. NEON NIGHTS transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, laid off of the
pace two wide, got floated to the five path around the turn and failed to factor. MISCHIEVOUS M pursued from midpack along the inside, checked in
cramped quarters into the turn, chased ground, chased into midstretch and tired late. SHOW MASTER broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four to three
path and made little impact. STINGER BEE was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path and between
horses, then weakened.

Footnotes
DOUBLE CLUTCH came in at the start, stalked two wide, moved to press around the far turn, failed to sustain pressure and chased the leader in upper
stretch, kept on while brushing with an outer co-pursuer, rebid along with that one at the sixteenth pole, battled while taking contact late and narrowly
prevailed. DEMOLITION DUKE tracked along the inside, tipped three wide and between horses into upper stretch, gradually closed in while brushing with
an inner rival in midstretch, bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, but shifted in and bumped his inner counterpart while battling in the late stages and missed.
DECANTED set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from an outer rival around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, maintained a margin through
midstretch, but was collared by an outer pair of bidders at the sixteenth pole, got herded in and was bested late. IDRATHERBEBLESSED stalked three
wide, got floated four wide into upper stretch, chased while failing to keep pace with the leaders into the final furlong, yet sustained pursuit and regained
fourth at the wire. UNLEASH THE POWER saved ground in midpack, gradually closed in to take aim inside of the leader in teh final furlong, but lacked rail
racing room and steadied when his rail seam closed at the sixteenth pole, then failed to recover and lost fourth at the wire. FUNNYFLAME laid off of the
pace in the three path and chased evenly through the lane. THREE ON THE TREE was off slow, rated at the rear two wide, then between horses around
the far turn, shifted out to the five then seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. TIVERTON (GB) broke out and bumped with an outer rival at the
start, pursued from midpack two wide, chased under urging in the four path turning for home, then tired while hanging on his left lead. CARCANO lacked
speed in the four path, entered the lane in the six path and made little impact. MAGIC HEART broke in and soundly bumped with an inner rival at the start,
laid well back along the inside and never got involved. NIGHT OUT was pinched back between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, then three wide
around the far turn and was outrun. SINGLE DOT YAHT saved ground off of the pace an tired.

Footnotes
VODKA WITH A TWIST set a clear pace while well in hand around the turn, was set down to widen her margin entering upper stretch, then was driven to
safely hold sway from a pursuer through the final furlong. SO THERE SHE WAS chased closest to the clear leader from the three to two path along with an
outer rival into the turn, failed to keep pace with the leader and proved no match entering the lane, yet ran on while hanging on her left lead to draw away
from the rest. FORTUNA MIA laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn, was roused outside of the leading trio turning
for home, claimed show entering the lane, then leveled off whlie hanging on her left lead. GLEE broke in while off slow, lacked speed in the three to two
path, then moved up between horses to reach fourth at the wire. ADEERA broke a step slow, tracked in the three path before tucking to the inside pursuing
into the turn, chased through upper stretch and gave way. DAISY DUKE trailed in the three to four path before moving to the six path into upper stretch, but
failed to factor. LA MARINERA chased forwardly in the four to three path, lost show to an outer bidder entering the lane and weakened between horses
whlie hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
GULFPORT broke out multiple paths at the start, stalked three deep, got floated four wide creeping closer entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, drove clear
entering the final furlong and held sway. TWO EAGLES RIVER chased from midpack in the three path, shifted four wide and between horses nearing
midstretch, ran on to edge place while flopping back to his left lead in the final sixteenth and narrowly lasted at the wire. W W CANDY dropped back quickly
between horses after breaking towards the front, trailed while hung in the five path around the turn, swung out eight wide into upper stretch, then rallied
belatedly to miss place at the wire. CYCLONE MISCHIEF broke a step slow, lacked speed in the tow path, shifted out to the four path before steadying once
blocked behind rivals leaving upper stretch, yet ran on between horses in the late stages and missed show. BLUE KENTUCKY was floated outwardly by an
inner rival at the start, laid well back in the four to three path, swung out seven wide entering the lane, rallied along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth,
but got outkicked and missed fourth. MUFASA (CHI) tracked behind the leaders and just off of the inside, took aim up a vacated rail entering the lane,
gained place in the furlong grounds after the eventual winner got a jump, but failed to sustain a bid and yielded late. SQUIRE CREEK set the pace along the
inside, dug in shifting to the two path entering the lane, but was bested by bidders on either side nearing the furlong grounds and gave way.
IMPLEMENTATION broke a step slow, pursued from midpack in the four path, shifted five wide entering the lane but lacked a rally. WAKE SURF laid off of
the pace in the four to six path, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead. LUDWIG pressed two wide, bid in the three path entering the lane but
weakened between horses shortly after.

RAGING TORRENT dictated terms in the two path via an uncontested advantage, came under urging as chasers inched closer entering the lane, then held
sway under a drive. OTTO THE CONQUEROR stalked two wide, chased the clear leader around the turn, vied for place with an inner rival through the lane
and prevailed. WORLD RECORD tracked along the inside, chased around the turn, vied for place with an outer foe through the lane but was bested.
CARBONE pursued three wide and failed to menace. HOLD MY BOURBON brushed the inner half of the starting gate while breaking a step slow, trailed
four wide into the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
ELEPHANTS EAR bobbled at the start, tracked from midpack in the two path around the first turn, then from the four path around the far turn, rallied
entering the lane, reeled in the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. WHO'S THE KING bumped an outer rival at the start, pressed outside of the
leader, gained an advantage passing the three furlong pole in the three path, drew clear shortly after, came under a drive in upper stretch, but was collared
by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, yielded yet safely lasted for place. LAT LONG laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the four path in upper stretch
to advance between horses, gained show nearing the final sixteenth and ran on to sustain gradual progress. CAROLO RAPIDO trailed along the inside,
came under urging in the four path around the far turn, swung seven wide into the lane and rallied to reach fourth late. CORNISHMAN was bumped by an
inner rival at the start, laid well back three wide, then in the four path around the far turn, moved forward entering the lane in the five path, then ran on mildly
but failed to threaten. INDY MAGIC lacked speed in the two to three path, shifted to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace. WILL TAKE IT
tracked three wide, chased the top pair around the far turn, gained place entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and faded.
GUN PARTY pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in the two path into the far turn and gave way. HOUSE UNITED stalked along the inside and
faded turning for home. FROSTY INDULGENCE showed the way along the inside, got headed by an outer presser passing the three furlong pole, gave way
and stopped.

Footnotes
WALKATHON showed the way two wide before clearing around the first turn, led well in hand in the two path as an outer rival attempted to apply pressure
around the far turn, maintained a margin remaining on her own power in upper stretch, came under rousing entering the final furlong and held sway from an
outer pursuer. FOREVER AFTER ALL tracked three wide, shifted to the four path into the turn, sustained gradual progress to close in on the clear leader in
the final sixteenth, attempted a late bid but was kept at bay. HEAVENLY SUNDAY prompted inside of the pace setter before backing off to stalk around the
first turn, pursued two wide down the backstretch, crept closer to press in the three path into the far turn, came under urging to sustain pressure turning for
home, but failed to do so in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole and held show. BE MY SUNSHINE
settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path before shifting to the five path entering upper stretch, then ran on willingly. PERSONAL
BEST tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, but lacked a bid and faded. EMBRACE ME saved ground off of the pace and
failed to factor. TOWER BRIDGE trailed in the two to three path early on, then in the four path around the far turn and was outrun thereafter.

POLITICALLYCORRECT broke a step slow, trailed down the backstretch, launched a six wide sweeping advance around the turn to complete a bid entering
the lane, then kicked away readily. SMOKEN WICKED was reluctant to load, then leaned out at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, yielded position
between horses around the bend before having a hind heel clipped by a trailing rival coming to the five sixteenths pole, recovered swinging seven wide into
the lane, then rallied to gain place in midstretch and was second best. IVAN THE GREAT pursued from midpack along the inside, was roused chasing in the
two path turning for home, bid for place in the three path along with an outer rival in midstretch but got outkicked. MO HAIR SAM rated well back two wide,
split foes three wide in midstretch and edged fourth. CONQUERING CAT leaned out and jostled an outer rival at the start, saved ground well back,
advanced inside of rivals entering teh lane, then flattened out between horses in the final furlong. BODACIOUS vied along the inside, offered no resistance
to a wide bidder in upper stretch and weakened. SPIRALIZER broke a beat slow, rushed forward to stalk along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair
turning for home, got floated four wide into the lane, chased and lacked a bid. WAR TAX was jostled between horses at the start, gained five wide around
the turn, but got outkicked by an outer rival while stalling out entering the lane and tired. ENDURING SPIRIT vied two wide, but faltered three wide and
between horses in upper stretch. MONEYLINE tracked two wide and between horses, chased in the three path turning for home and tired. HAPPYFLYER
chased forwardly three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. HEAT jostled an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path,
clipped the hind heels of a rival and stumbled approaching the five sixteenths pole, then was eased thereafter.

HERCHEE tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader to take aim entering the lane, bid and wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, then
drove clear. REMARKABLE MO showed the way in the two path, but was bested by an outer bidder in midstretch and held place. AHANDFULOFCANDY
tracked two to three wide, crept to within striking range in the four path entering the lane, but only managed to chase, lacked a bid and secured show.
TENNESSEE LAMB laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the five path into upper stretch, wandered about then edged fourth. J J'S RANGER stalked
two wide, chased between horses around the far turn and gave way. BOLT ACTION tracked three wide, yielded before chasing two wide and between
horses around the far turn, and faded. ROCK N ROLL BOLT saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. VARVATOS was outrun along the inside. HARD
TO SAY lacked speed two wide and never got involved.
