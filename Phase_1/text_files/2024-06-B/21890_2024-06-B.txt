ANNA AFTER MIDNITE sped to the lead quickly from the gate to be on a clear lead, maintained that advantage throughout and was never challenged in a
no doubt performance. BABAS GAL reserved well off the pace through the turn, angled five wide in the lane and closed well belatedly. SWEET SMILA
tracked the pacesetter, cut the corner turning for home and mounted a mild rail rally. MISS MADALINE was the distant trailer coming for home and passed
tiring rivals in the lane. BLUESUP GREENSDOWN went one-paced while never threatening. LOST SUNSET stumbled badly at the start when the ground
broke out from under her, rushed up to stalk the clear pacesetter to the top of the stretch and gave way in the lane.

duel to upper stretch and pulled clear in the drive. GOD GUNS N GUTS stalked the pace through the turn, tipped out turning for home and finished willingly
to gain the place. JOE THE TAILOR was a bit off balance leaving the gate, sped to a contested lead, dueled through the turn and finished evenly in the
drive. VERRAZANOINTHESKY slow early to be the trailer and made a steady gain passed weaker rivals coming home. RHODIUMS PRIDE contended
early from between rivals, dropped back on the turn and finished as a non-threat. DASH TO THE CASH made a brief bid from four wide into the turn and

C F V BULLET prompted the pace for five-eighths, moved to engage the pacesetter on the turn, took command in upper stretch and pulled clear to the wire.
EXECUTIVE ACTION rated off the pace along the fence, steadily gained on the far turn while saving ground, cut the corner turning for home and finished
well to be second best. CATEGORY TEN stalked the pace down the backside from four wide while well held, crept up on the bend and lacked a closing
response when called upon. BOURBON LIFE trailed most of the way as a non-threat. STORM'S REFLECTION set a pressured pace for three-quarters and
weakened in the lane. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TWIRLING ROSES stalked the leaders from three wide through the turn, took command in upper stretch and pulled away convincingly. GOOD APPLE
tracked the leaders throught the turn, rallied from five wide in the lane and chased the winner home as second best. FAMILY TRADITION trailed to the top
of the lane and closed well belatedly splitting rivals in the stretch. LUNDBERG reserved off the leaders for a half mile and showed good energy to be gaining
in the lane. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR rated off the pace to midway on the turn, made a steady gain to mid-stretch and finished evenly unable to sustain the
rally. STRANGE ARRANGE set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened in the stretch. GIMME THE CANDY was not a threat. CHAMPAGNE MIKE
pressed the pace from the fence for the first quarter and was through early.

CONGRATS ON FIFTY set a pressured pace for half mile, drew clear when called upon turning for home and finished convincingly having been
unchallenged in the lane. RAVIN'S TOWN stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied to threaten nearing the quarter pole, could not go with the winner
and kept-on willingly as second best. LARRY THE POET tracked the leaders to upper stretch and rallied mildly in the lane to be along for the show.
SPANISH WELLS pressed the early pace and steadily gave ground coming home. ARTHURIAN went evenly without posing a threat. DASTARDLY DEEDS

MCQUEEN stalked the pace down the backside, rallied at the five-eighths pole while angling slightly in from the three path, took command turning for home
and drew off through the lane whilke being geared down late. PILKINGTON tracked the leaders through the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place.
WOLF HUNTER slow early to be the distant trailer and closed well late in the lane to be along for the show. LICENSE TO STEAL set a pressured pace
through the first turn, continued to lead under pressure down the backside, was steadied at the five-eighths pole when crowded by the outside rivals, settled
back into stride to come on again to mid-stretch and flattened out late. RICKY'S BEST dropped to the rear of the field around the far turn and finished with a
mild, non-threatening rally passed weaker rivals in the lane. LA PERFECT BEE pressed the pace for the first five-eighths, was crowded a bit between rivals
into the turn causing inside rival to be steadied, continued on to press the new leader on the bend and tired in the stretch. CHARBON failed to menace. THE
RIDER OF LA PERFECT BEE CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER NEAR THE FIVE-EIGHTHS POLE, UPON REVIEW THE
