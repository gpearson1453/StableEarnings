Footnotes
AMEN AND AMEN dueled inside in the two path and drove clear in midstretch. TITAN stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, bid three between
foes entering the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, vied outside of the winner to midstretch and was no match in the final furlong while
holding clear of the rest. RAPSCALLION saved ground in midpack, steadied midway around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole, continued
on the left lead in the lane and finished evenly to maintain the show. BUILDER JAK raced in range at the rail, made progress inside around the far turn but
needed more in the stretch. NAMELESS bumped HIGHLAND PEAK at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide early on the far turn and
improved position. HIGHLAND PEAK was squeezed back at the start, raced well back two wide and was never a threat. SVAR failed to menace while racing
four wide. DECISIVE PRIDE bumped with BROMISTA not long after the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. HOLLYWOOD HERO saved
ground off the early pace, went four wide around the far turn and was never involved. ICONIC ROCK chased the pace three wide and retreated after six
furlongs. BROMISTA bumped at the start and again soon after, raced two wide and made little further impact. BLAME DENNIS dueled outside of the winner
for a half and stopped around the far turn.

Footnotes
RIDE ON CUPID bumped on both sides and got pinched at the start, rated in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, took aim while floating out
to the seven path in upper stretch, and kicked clear of an inner pair in the final sixteenth. ELLAGIO prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a ride in
the four path midway around the turn, inched ahead to lead from the five path passing the eighth pole, but hung on her left lead, and was caught before the
sixteenth by an outer foe to place. WHITE CLAW WOMAN (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, came under right
handed urging in the five path midway around the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and kept on while on her left lead to get up for show. BOHO
LADY showed the way in the two path, was nudged along in the three path around the turn, came under a drive passing the quarter, but lost the lead in
upper stretch, and faded. THREE TIMES broke out and bumped an outer foe, chased in the three path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn,
but weakened down the lane. STARSHIP OBSESSION trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SOMBRERO stalked in the five path, bid under a ride in the three path midway around the turn, took command at the top of the lane, and drew
clear. IM STILL BRAVE rated in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, but got stymied passing the quarter, angled out to the
five path turning into the stretch, and chased on for place. BREATH DEEPLY was prompted while in range from the four path, was driven between foes
around the turn, and was one paced from the four path down the lane for show. PERFORMANTE got sent to set the pace in the two path early, came under
a drive along the inside just before the three-eighths pole, but lost the lead at the top of the stretch, and faded. FOURTY FOUR laid up close in the three
path, lost ground and came under a ride early around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but flattened. UZZIAH turned his head as
the gates opened and had to steady at the start, trailed along the inside and was no factor. AMAZING JETT broke in at the start, raced off the pace in the
four path and did not threaten. WINE GOGGLES chased in the six path but was no menace.

THE HONEYMAN raced in range two wide between foes, angled four wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and
powered clear. TEAM CAPTAIN raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied widest to gain the place late. MAGICSHADOW set the pace along the

pole and improved position inside. HEATHCLIFF pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the drive. LOMACHENKO chased the pace three wide and
lacked a closing bid. SILENT AND VIOLENT saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
WORLDLY BEAUTY tracked in the two path, moved up under rousing from the rail to take command entering the far turn, and dug in from the two path
down the lane to hold off an outer foe. GOODBETTERBEST laid up close in the four path, bid under a ride in the three path midway around the far turn, ran
on from the four path to sustain that bid down the stretch, but was denied by the inner pacesetter to place. BEIRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid
off the pace in the two path, came under a ride entering the far turn but had to check around the three-eighths mark, split foes passing the quarter, and
finished evenly from the three path down the lane for show. CLOUD STORAGE bumped at the start with an inner foe, trailed in the three path, was driven in
the five path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. TRENDY bumped with an outer foe at the start,
rated in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, but flattened from the five path down the lane. CABERNET bumped at the start
with an inner foe, chased in the four path but failed to bid from the six path in the stretch. PLANKTON got very fractious in the gate which delayed the start,
broke well to set the pace in the three path but yielded around the far turn.

PRIVATE THOUGHTS pressed the pace in the three path, took a narrow lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied outside of a stubborn ADIOS COLE from
there to the wire and held firm. ADIOS COLE set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths marker, battled on inside of
that foe to the wire and missed in a game try. SPEED CONTROL raced in range two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. BATI KING raced
off the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. GUAIO failed to menace while racing two wide. FOXTROT HARRY chased the pace from the
rail and faded after six furlongs. EHSAAN was off slow and trailed throughout.

BLUEFIELD tracked in the two path, was roused from the rail midway around the turn, angled out to the six path to take aim at the top of the lane, and drew
clear of an inner pair in the final sixteenth. COUSIN KRISTI bumped between foes at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid under coaxing
midway around the turn, led passing the quarter, dug in from the three path in upper stretch, was overtaken by the outer eventual winner before the
sixteenth, but held place. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the five path, bid from the four path turning into the lane,
but flattened in the final furlong to show. IMONRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the six path, was driven in the five path around
the turn, but failed to bid. ANATOMY chased between foes in the four path but faded in the stretch. MOJAVE DESERT set the pace inside, was ridden in the

Footnotes
MILLENNIUM CONDO set a clear pace along the rail, tipped off the rail in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and held clear. KARTANO settled off the
pace while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. BRYCE CANYON raced off the early pace four wide, advanced outside
down the backstretch, gave chase four wide around the far turn, loomed outside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out and lost second late.
BRINGER OF RAIN raced off the pace four and five wide and rallied belatedly. BURNING MAN saved ground and failed to menace. SWAN LAKE chased
the pace three wide and faded in the drive. NIGHT JUMPER was rated in the three path around the first turn, prompted the pace two wide around the far
turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and weakened. CHAPALU played no factor while racing two and three wide.
