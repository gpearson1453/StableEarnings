Footnotes
ETRETAT was rated along on the inside, moved out and came four wide into the lane and closed well to get on even terms with the leader by the sixteenth
marker and got up late to prove best under a drive. RUSSIAN HAMMER was off a half a beat slow, then rushed up on the outside to stalk the pace by the
seven sixteenths and then made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command on the outside and then shook clear by the quarter pole, then was headed
by the sixteenth marker and could not jhold off the winner in a game effort. NET WORTH bumped at the start, chased the early pace and was three to four
wide on the turn and then had a mild late kick to gain the show award. WOW WISH was away alertly to set a pressured pace two wide, then vied for the
lead in between rivals on the turn and faded in the lane losing the show award late. I HAD ENOUGH pressed the pace on the inside and faded in the lane.
ON JET HEIR tracked the pace in between rivals and weakened. WILD ALEX was outrun and never factored.

Footnotes
RUGBY ROAD was well rated along the inside, moved out and made a three wide bid off the turn, then went on even terms by the furlong marker and drew
clear to prove best under a drive. ART HANDLER was reserved early three to two wide, then advanced two wide on the far turn and came two wide off the
bend and finished well, second best. P J'S SONG was settled back early on the inside, then advanced and was two wide on the far turn, swung out seven
wide leaving the turn and had a late rally on the far outside and got the show award. ICANDOTHAT was settled early three to two wide, came five wide off
the bend and made a bid to loom boldly but needed more late while hanging, lost show award late. THIRTY WEST vied for the lead on the inside and made
a bid to gain a short lead to set a pressured pace and then was headed off the turn but faded in the final furlong. FACTUM LOVE STYLE was reserved early
on the inside, made a inside bid off the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. SOUTHERN PASS TIME vied for the lead three to two wide, came four wide
off the turn and weakened. SAISIR LE JOUR was settled back two to three wide and was not a threat. ST PETE'S PASSION was off slowly, then raced
three to four wide in the back and never factored. GALT'S PROMISE chased the pace two to three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
GRAN RUNNER stalked the pace from the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn and took over leaving the quarter pole and then drew off to prove much
the best under crop urging. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY was squeezed back at the start, settled early, advanced five wide on the turn and came widest into the
lane and rallied well for the place award while no match to the winner, second best. RED DEVOLUTION tracked the early pace from between rivals, two
wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and held the show award late. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE chased the early pace, then was three to four
wide on the turn and came five wide off the bend but had no kick, missed show award. CLASSY SOLUTION stalked the early pace four wide and between
rivals, then was shuffled back three wide on the turn and weakened. TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE set a pressured pace while in the three path, then was
headed by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. RAHMER pressed the pace on the inside and weakened. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was off a step
slow and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TIKI BAR set the early pace on the inside and was well handled throughout, then was sent down off the turn and dug in gamely to hold well to prove best.
MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT was well rated on the inside, tipped out two wide leaving the turn to make a bid but could not get to the winner while being clearly
second best. BLONDE SAMARITAN stalked the early pace three wide under a hard hold, then was two wide on the turn and came three wide off the bend
but faded, held show award. BEACHGRASS was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn but had no kick
while missing the show award. DIVINE GRACE broke in the air at the start, then was reserved early two wide, cut the corner leaving the turn angled out
leaving the gap in mid stretch but had no rally. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was five wide into the first turn, settled on the outside and came wide into the lane
and had no rally. NEXT EPISODE was reserved on the inside and had no response. MEMENTO MI was taken back early and never factored. No fractions
available for the quarter and half mile due to a timer error. Times will be available pending a review.

turn and then was sent down to kick away and then was geared down late to prove best. WILLOW CREEK ROAD was rated along the inside, eased off the
rail by the quarter pole and then steadied in upper stretch and then finished well on the inside to be clearly second best. NEUSCHWANSTEIN vied for the
lead four wide, then was three wide on the turn and faded in the drive, bested rest. CAJUN DREAM bobbled slightly at the start, pressed the pace from
between rivals four wide by the half mild marker then weakened on the turn. PERFECT EDGE broke outwardly at the start, prompted the pace on the
outside and then was five to four wide on the turn and weakened. LITTLE SKIPPY vied for the lead on the inside and faltered.

Footnotes
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY stalked the leader from the outside, racing in the four to five path down the backside, sent after the leader nearing the quarter pole,
inched clear under a steady drive leaving the furlong marker, held safe late driving. GOODLUCKCHUCK set the tempo around the first turn, and down the
backside, racing well off the rail maintained the advantage into the turn, caught by outside rival leaving the quarter pole, rebid late along the inside, finished
gamely to the wire. HEY PORTER raced off the pace around the first turn, ridden along down the backside, bid between rivals leaving the quarter pole,
flattened out to the wire. SUPER JOHN under steady urging from the opening bell, always under a ride down the backside, came up empty late. THE
COLORA KID tracked the pace around the first turn, under steady urging around the second bend, was outrun to the wire. DEEP FAITH slow into stride,
never threatened.
