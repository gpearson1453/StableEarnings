DETERMINED FIRST steadied at the start, trailed the field with a ground saving trip, came two wide into the lane, rallied inside, closed willingly in the final
furlong and edged away from the runner up. CATALYZED (FR) was well placed close up on the rail, tracked inside on the far turn, split rivals decisively at
the quarter pole, rallied to a short lead, then drifted out sharply at the furlong marker bothering a rival, continued willingly to the finish. JILLAROO raced off
the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide at the half mile marker, made a five wide run on the far turn, rallied outside into the stretch, then was bothered and
forced to check at the eighth pole, weakened after that. SHAKREVENGE pulled early on, vied inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and weakened.
QUEEN ROCKET raced three wide early, vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn and tired. ON MOONLIGHT BAY stalked two then three wide,
chased three wide on the far turn, steadied at the quarter pole and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection, CATALYZED (FR) was
disqualified and placed third for interference at the furlong marker.
