Footnotes
UNBRIDLED VIOLET prompted LADY MORMNONT while racing three-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and quickly drew clear. LADY MORMONT
set the early pace racing removed from the rail with the rider less horse inside of her, angled in nearing the quarter pole when that one got clear then drifted
out but was unable to match strides with the winner during the drive. VANDULIE was prominent early while three-wide, angled in nearing the three-eighths
pole and finished well in a steady effort. POCKET KNIFE was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. TIA SUZI
steadied early when the rider less horse took her path then dropped well back while saving ground but was unable to recover the lost ground. HARBOR
LASS unseated her rider at the start and was walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER
VIEWING THE FILMS RULED THAT HARBOR LASS GOT A FAIR START AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

FRISCO FRILLS set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter pole and increased her advantage from that point.
NAN ELIZABETH was allowed to settle early, moved up strongly nearing the three-eighths pole to offer a bid, could not reach the winner but was clearly
second best. STEIN'S GIRL was unhurried early, rallied four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. LEMON DROP LADY was forwardly
placed while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. MS FLASHY HARBOR prompted the early pace from along the inside and tired. PER THE HORSE RACING
INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, FRISCO FRILLS HAS BEEN DQ'D FROM 1ST TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

ARMA D'ORO was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly nearing the quarter pole while three-wide, took command entering the stretch and quickly
drew clear. COASTAL JAZZ saved ground setting the pace to the stretch, was no match for the winner but held on well for the place. MUNCEY dropped
back early, moved up two-wide on the turn, came in slightly nearing the quarter pole then angled out to be four-wide in the stretch and rallied late. FALSELY
ACCUSED saved ground while being allowed to settle early but lacked a rally when asked. JIN TONG was unhurried early, moved forward on the far turn,
steadied in tight nearing the quarter pole and then finished willingly when clear. MR LOVE MUFFIN was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the
stretch and failed to seriously threaten. OVERLY FAST was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT FURY settled in the
middle of the field early while three-wide and weakened. MISTER MAFIOSO chased COASTAL JAZZ early while racing two-wide and tired THE RIDER OF

THE QUARTER POLE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS FOUND INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION..

Footnotes
MINER LEAGUE saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, slipped through during the drive and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away.
POWERIZED hopped in the air at the start then rushed up to vie with CONRAD MEADOWS for the early lead while racing two-wide, responded when asked
but was unable to resist the winner in a game effort. TOUGHERTHANTHEREST prompted the issue while four-wide on the turn and finished well for third in
a steady effort. FREIGHTLINE was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. CONRAD MEADOWS vied for the lead
to the stretch while three-wide and weakened. RUNDOFT hopped at the start then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously
threaten.

close-up racing along the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole lacking room slipped through nearing the quarter pole then angled out for the drive

drive to earn the show. VALIDATE dropped back early, came six-wide into the stretch and was making up some ground late. NORTHERN BLEND was
allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. AUDACE was forwardly placed into the stretch while racing four-wide
and weakened late. HOT MEMORIES was unhurried early, came seven-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor. AUTISM WARRIOR vied for the lead
