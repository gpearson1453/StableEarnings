Footnotes
STOP THE HUMBUG bobbled slightly after the start, was ahead of only one foe down the backstretch, made a sharp move passing rivals inside three
furlongs out while in hand, was coming up to the leaders quickly on the rail by the quarter pole, shifted outside for the stretch drive having momentum and
determinedly won the battle down the entire stretch for the win. NATIVE PRINCE prompted the pace outside on the break, was throttled down in the first
turn to watch the top two horses down the backstretch, assumed the lead slipping up the fence at the five sixteenths marker and fought gamely inside, never
giving in but lost the nod at the wire. KIDDIE HOLIDAY travelled three wide into the first turn, was situated in the second flight three deep down the back
straight, picked up the bit gaining three wide on the far turn, loomed in the four path at the top of the stretch, could not go on with the top pair at the furlong
marker and finished up to be a clear third at the finish line. MAMBOINTHEFOREST travelled on the rail in mid-pack down the backstretch, closed the gap
when the leader was backing up on the final turn and finished up with some interest to capture a small piece of the prize in the end. SOCIETY JOE
prompted the pace outside going into the first turn, was content to let the lone speed go down the backstretch, closed in between horses at the three eighths
marker to be in the hunt up front three wide with rivals on both sides turning for home, could not continue on and faded in deep stretch. NONNO'S LITTLE
BOY stalked outside in the first turn, settled outside near the back off the pack travelling down the back straight, was roused three wide at the three furlong
pole, made little progress on the far turn, shifted out widest in the six path for the run to the wire but could not be a factor down the lane. OCTOBER FROST
was allowed to settle at the back into the first turn, continued to see the strung out field down the backstretch, could not make any impression on the final
bend and passed the used up early leader in upper stretch. KING ALFREDO took command inside from the start, was loose on the lead setting a torrid pace
spreading out the field along the backside, began to get leg weary at the three eighths marker, was getting out on the final turn when engulfed by runners at
the quarter pole and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
BLUE MAX had a sluggish start to begin, stalked on the rail down the back straight, under a snug hold waited to move around the bend, weaved through
horses three furlongs from the wire, finally found a seam in the three path with three sixteenths to go, quickly burst on by and was full of run, clearing off at
the finish line for the win. MIDNIGHT ARKLE tracked the leaders in the three path inside rivals down the backside, travelled alone in midfield by the half
going comfortably, rallied four wide to be in the mix by upper stretch, dueled for the lead at the furlong marker but was out finished by the winner late.
TIMESKIP settled near the rear with runners on either side down the backstretch, co-trailed in the three path inside the other foe through the turn, shifted out
to be five wide straightening out for home and put in a good rally late to close in and capture the show award in the end. RACE FOR PINKS tracked four
deep outside horses in the early stages, closed in two wide outside rivals at the quarter pole, bid in the three path to poke his head in front briefly between
challengers at the three sixteenths marker, could not sustain the run and faded by the eighth pole. GRAND ALLIANCE broke towards on the break to trail
three deep along the backside, co-trailed four wide outside foes on the turn, swung out widest in the six path for the drive but failed to fire with a furlong
remaining. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ forced the issue inside at the start, was relegated to a chasing role on the fence with a half mile to run, had nowhere
to run behind a wall of horses turning for home, had a clear path by the furlong marker but offered no finish in deep stretch. HICKSY had a slim advantage
outside in the beginning, opened up by the half, was collared outside at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and tired in the final furlong on the rail.

Footnotes
HE SHOOTS HE WINS caught a flyer from the start for an easy lead to begin, was unopposed travelling around the bend and had more in reserve when
asked in mid-stretch to draw away down the lane. DADDY SEND MONEY was away poorly to begin, recovered smartly to track three deep outside by the
half, chased in vain through the turn, continued to try down the stretch and finished up besting the rest comfortably in the end. GLORIOUS REVENGE
tracked on the rail down the backside, could not match strides with the top two rivals in the turn and ran on willingly inside to hold on saving third money at
the wire. MATICULANT settled on the outside three wide near the rear in the early going, travelled three wide outside foes on the turn making some
progress, shifted out to be five wide for the drive and was one paced to the finish to settle on the fringes in the end. CONTINUE APACE (IRE) stalked in the
third flight with horses on both sides down the backstretch, made a brief run two wide between runners three furlongs out, dueled for third and fourth money
in upper stretch but was outkicked by others in the final furlong. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN stalked on the fence in the third flight with four furlongs
remaining, saved ground but made little headway around the oval and could not get involved driving to the finish line. HARD RELOAD tracked between
horses in the two path down the back straight, was roused for more three furlongs from home, had no response and backed away through the field on the

Footnotes
GATHER rated in behind the leaders tracking inside and biding time under a hold, came out in upper stretch while advancing on the leader causing an
outside rival to clip heels, bid about the furlong marker, drew clear. VILLI OLENTO broke outwardly but was quick to lead, set the pace inside, was no match
for the winner. PORT RENFREW broke inwardly bothering a rival, moved forward outside stalking the leader never far off that one, began to lose some
ground turning into upper stretch, clipped heels as a rival came out and lost an iron almost losing the rider about the furlong grounds, recovered and ran on.
BLACKDIAMOND DINNY was bothered and steadied at the start, settled outside at the rear about three wide, began to advance four wide and under urging
about the five-sixteenths, tapped on the brakes just slightly altering inward to avoid an incident in mid-stretch then ran on evenly. PENNYJET bobbled just
slightly while in tight at the start, settled at the back inside a foe just off the rail, steadied on heels slightly at the three-eighths, swung out turning for home
and ran on mildly. CALADIUM pursued from between runners mid-pack early, failed to menace. IT'S ME chased from outside three to four wide, shifted in
midway on the far turn still mid-pack, failed to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INOT BOTH THE START AND STRETCH AS WELL AS AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PORT RENFREW AGAINST GATHER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
BET N WIN hopped slightly on the break, tracked on the rail in the early going, was content to sit back and watch the pacesetter down the back straight, was
nudged on the far turn closing in on the leader, bid outside at the top of the lane and wore down the frontrunner who had little left in the final furlong.
BASKETBALL JONES seized the lead from the onset, was alone, uncontested setting the fractions down the backstretch, continued to lead but by a
diminishing margin with many runners closing in on the far turn, was collared outside by the winner at the furlong pole, offered little resistance and finished
up to hold for the place share at the wire. MOMENT OF ZEN tracked outside going into the beginning oval, was in hand galloping along in mid-division down
the backstretch, settled nicely on the fence behind the leaders with five sixteenths left to run under a good hold, shifted out looming boldly three wide for the
drive to the wire but could not offer a strong stretch kick to threaten the top two in the final furlong. BILL NEEDLE stalked two wide entering the first bend,
improved on the fence down the backside with four furlongs remaining, shifted out for clear running room in lane four turning for home and offered a late run
to get up to be a fringe player in the end. GOOD SOLDIER broke outwards on the start, travelled near the back ahead of one rival in the first of two turns,
stalked, improving outside closing the gap by the half, was roused for more midway on the final turn to be in the hunt four wide at the top of the stretch,
could not carry the momentum and stalled at the furlong marker. HOLIDAY IN CHILE was void of early speed to trail in the first turn, continued see the pack
along the backstretch, closed the gap to be in the fray in a compact bunch with a quarter left to run, angled outside in the five path for the drive but lacked a
rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER COMMANDER broke outwardly a bit, stalked from outside the second flight going three to four wide on the turn, struck the lead past the quarter
pole, edged clear and held. FRACEN MACHO stalked from between runners two to three wide in the second flight, came out seeking room in mid-stretch,
kept on late steadily gaining but needed more. QUIET KNIGHT dueled inside a foe early, took a narrow lead at the top of the stretch, was overtaken soon
thereafter, kept on gamely but was outkicked. PHILLIP MY WINE settled at the back off the inside, shifted in on the turn, raced near the inside into the
stretch passing a foe two deep, came out four wide in late stretch and finished up well but too late. FAST FRIENDS settled into stride shifting in, saved
ground near the rail on the turn, swung out at the top of the stretch, steadied slightly while five wide near the eighth pole a rival came out, kept on.
POPWEISER moved forward to be mid-pack off the inside in the three to four path on the turn, floated out five to six wide for the drive, was one-paced.
FROST BITTEN chased from inside, was in a bit tight in upper stretch, faded. AURELIAN FLAME dueled outside, began to weaken by the top of the stretch,
was forced out a bit in mid-stretch, faded. DESROCHERS broke a step slowly, was outside at the back going four to five wide on the turn, was not a threat.

Footnotes
LADY IN RED was nudged early to have the lead just off the fence heading into the first turn, slowed the pace down while still having no pressure applied
down the backstretch, was headed outside straightening out for home and had more in reserve running on the rail to prevail in a gutsy stretch duel.
EMERALD LAKE tracked four wide on the first turn, closed in down the back straight, forced the pace outside three furlongs from the finish, dueled outside
at the top of the stretch and gamely fought to the finish but was denied by the frontrunner who had something left for the drive. WICKED MIAH travelled on
the fence near the back, shifted three wide between horses at the half, rallied four wide around the far turn picking up runners and had good energy down
the lane to be a clear third crossing the line. ITS A BIRDIE tracked three wide early on, chased the pace along the backside, could not match strides with the
front pair on the far turn and finished up evenly on the rail to hold for a minor share in the end. ENDORPHIN RUSH had a good position by herself on the
fence watching the front three down the backstretch, kept pace saving ground on the final turn, could not find another gear in the lane and was one paced to
the wire. ERASMO'S GIRL travelled near the rear having one foe beaten around the first bend, closed the gap improving outside down the backside, was
urged three eighths out, offered little run and could not reach contention in the stretch drive. BUTTERED TOAST was unhurried to trail in the early going,
shifted outside down the back straight, moved five wide trying to circle runners three furlongs to go, was in the hunt five wide at the top of the lane, could not
sustain the run and flattened out at the furlong pole. LITTLE FIRE settled in mid-pack alone on the rail in the first turn, made no progress down the
backstretch, could not quicken with others making a move at the three eighths marker and had nothing to show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
THIS KATZ FOR REAL hopped slightly on the break, at the half running on the rail had only the stablemate beaten down the backside, kept pace at the
back through the turn, had nowhere to go behind a wall of runners at the top of the stretch, angled out to the nine path at the furlong pole and flew home
under right handed encouragement for the eye catching victory. FASCINATION STREET had the early lead after the start, chased the leaders on the rail
throughout the turn, shifted outside coming to the dueling front pair at the furlong marker, was moving to the lead nearing the wire but was caught by the
winner who was flying on the outside for the score. ASHUKA had runners on both sides tracking the lead foursome along the backstretch, was nudged for
more midturn, began to gain on the front two at the quarter pole, posed a threat in the four path at the furlong marker, kept on coming but in the end it was
not enough and had to settle for third money. NAMEOFTHEGAME pressed the pace three wide between horses in the beginning, pulled the rider up front by
the half, set the pace while hounded outside through the turn, battled inside clinging to the lead down the stretch and gave way grudgingly late with a valiant
try on the front end. SING DIXIE travelled on the rail in the second flight behind the front four down the backside, was checked mildly between runners
seven sixteenths out, began to rally three wide at the quarter pole, encountered traffic problems again in the five path in upper stretch and was gaining with
every stride when having clear run in the final sixteenth of a mile. QUANDALE prompted the pace outside four deep along the backside, closed in to bid just
outside at the quarter pole, dueled to the wire, could not get by the stubborn pacesetter through the lane and faded late to be on the losing end of a six
horse blanket finish at the wire. YODDHA was part of the quartet up front in the early going travelling on the rail, lacked room inside at the seven sixteenths
marker and was shuffled back entering the turn, waited on the fence around the bend and lacked a rally down the lane. ROCK IT RED broke inwards on the
start, stalked near the rear between horses at the half, took closer order three wide with three eighths remaining, came under a ride at the quarter pole but
failed to menace in the stretch drive. LEFT IN MY DUST trailed by many having a slow start to begin, made a very sharp move five wide going around rivals
midturn, angled out with momentum widest in the eight path straightening out for home, could not sustain the run and yielded with runners on both sides in
mid-stretch. CANADIAN DADDY settled three deep outside horses in midfield at the half, moved in three wide at the three eighths pole, was in with a
chance three wide in upper stretch, needed more late and wilted in the final sixteenth. HAAHEE was at the back ahead of only the poor starter down the
backstretch, made a brief rally four wide entering the turn going around foes, was in the hunt in the five path between rivals at the top of the lane but gave
way at the furlong marker.
