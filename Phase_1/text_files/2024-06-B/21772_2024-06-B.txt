gamely inside in the stretch run, could not stay with the winner, then held on for second. HARD SPUN FANTASY raced off the pace inside, moved up inside
on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside and could not get second. FESTINATE tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn
and weakened in the stretch. EQUALJUSTICEFORALL bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, steadied a bit at the half mile marker, made a five
