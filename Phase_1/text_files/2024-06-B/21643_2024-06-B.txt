Footnotes
SOUL COAXING shadowed the leader from outside, bid at the three-sixteenths pole drawing even, was turned away but kept on under steady handling to
come again late and just get up. SAILING SOLO was quick to lead, set the pace inside, was challenged in upper stretch, appeared to turn back that rival by
mid-stretch but was nailed at the wire. MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY shifted in saving ground mid-pack along the inside, came out past the quarter pole and
kept on in the stretch. EDEN PARADISE exchanged a minor bump at the start, settled at the back inside saving ground throughout and improved position.
SIR LUMPALOT was between runners two to three wide mid-pack early, needed more. DYNABLUE settled stalking just off the leading pair and off the rail,
swung out six to seven deep for the drive, failed to rally. BLOW TORCH was caught outside three to four wide early, failed to rally. LAND MARK DEAL
exchanged a light bump at the start, raced outside a foe at the back early, was asked for more nearing the quarter pole but had no response. This race had
a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
IRISH VALOR settled outside three to four wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, drifted in a bit about the three-sixteenths challenging for the lead,
edged past and just prevailed over closing foes. MISTER CHARMING pressed the pace three wide, lost ground turning into upper stretch, altered outside
foes past the three-sixteenths, kept on well late to gain from between foes but missed. CARTE BLANCHE settled off the leaders about three wide, came out
five wide in the stretch, was closing best of all to surge outside but was too late. BLURT set the pace from off the rail, drifted out just a bit in upper stretch
then back in, yielded late. FLASHY RICHIE moved forward inside up the backstretch tracking the leaders and within range, failed to rally. PISTOL BOX was
outpaced early and never a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

KAELY'S SISTER was forced out at the break, stalked from inside a foe then in behind, moved out from three to four wide on the turn, bid past the
three-sixteenths, was going away late. PURR SEA stalked from outside then moved four to three wide taking the lead outside the three-eighths, was
overtaken in the stretch and no match for the winner but second best. KANT BELIEVE IT broke outwardly, was thereupon urged, dueled early outside two
wide, had a brief lead early on the turn, was no match for the top pair. CAT ATTACK dueled inside to the seven-sixteenths, was in just a hair tight and
dropped back losing ground, ran on evenly thereafter.

TIME HEIST stalked from outside four to five wide, bid coming into upper stretch, took command about the three-sixteenths, drew clear late. LUCKY SHOT
pulled forward inside fighting a strong rider's restraint up the backstretch, finally settled on the turn, made a mild rail bid at the three-sixteenths but was no
match for the winner. RISKY BOY stalked racing three wide between foes on the turn, was no match for the top pair and held show honors. TONYS
MORNING LINE settled off the pace outside traveling four to five wide on the turn, swung out seven wide for the drive, finished well but too little too late.
FIRST MASAMUNE settled at the back, went three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit further for the drive, was not a threat. GALLANT BUCK sped
clear, set the pace from off the rail in the two path, gave way. MKAR THE FAST was at the back early racing inside and never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
A P BLAZING GREEN pressed from inside in the early going then eased back off the leader content to track and bide time, angled three wide coming to the
quarter pole, struck the lead in mid-stretch under urging, drew clear and held sway. PONCHO ATTACK settled off the leaders mid-pack, went four to five
wide on the turn coming out five to six deep for the drive, was gaining late and got the nod for second. CANYON SHADOWS moved forward stalking from
outside three to four wide, kept on late but lost the nod for place. LONE RETURN settled off the pace, advanced inside on then just off the rail, evened out
late. PONTUS was forced out a bit at the start, coaxed forward chasing from off the inside, raced mostly three to five wide throughout and kept on evenly.
TIGGER ATTACK broke out a bit, shifted in, failed to menace. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY set the pace from off the inside, moved clear heading up the
backstretch, gave way in the lane. JAKES CHANNEL broke in the air and outwardly, raced between foes two to three wide into the turn, failed to rally.
COLLIE WRAYS KITTY was in just a bit tight at the start, shifted in, was never near enough to threaten.

LOOKIN FOR REVENGE pressed from outside, floated out a bit leaving the far turn, bid coming to the three-sixteenths putting a head in front, found a
stubborn foe but held that one under moderate hand urging. FLYING SAMURAI sped clear and shifted in, set the pace inside shadowed by the eventual
winner, was overtaken by that one in upper stretch but fought on gamely. CHICKS FOR FREE settled mid-pack inside saving ground, swung five wide into
upper stretch, kept on to gain late but was no real threat to the top pair. PERFUMER was forced four to five wide into the first turn, shifted in leaving the
backstretch and saved ground on the far turn, came into upper stretch inside, ran on evenly. JIM AND JIM stalked from outside two to three wide and
mid-pack, swung seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. FUTURE VISION was in tight steadying heading into the first turn, raced toward the back and
off the inside, was never near enough to threaten.

SADE PURSE settled at the back inside, switched out, fanned five wide into the stretch, engaged the leader past mid-stretch and edged by late. ALL
ABOUT ME sped clear and shifted in setting the pace, was asked for run at the top of the stretch, was challenged nearing late stretch and simply
outfinished. DESSERT FIRST settled mid-pack inside in the early stages, was on or just off the rail, went evenly. TOP LOOK switched outside the leader
leaving the first turn to stalk up the backstretch, could not kick on and was outfinished for show. LOTTA ROSES advanced outside in the early going in
pursuit of the leader up the backstretch into the far turn, faltered and faded. NIFF settled outside a runner off the leaders, was never near enough to
threaten.

Footnotes
LADY ATLANTIC settled into stride well back of the leaders inside, came out four wide in upper stretch, drifted out late while making a bid between foes,
prevailed. SUPORB stalked from outside going three wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch, just missed. TIMELESS GLORY raced off the inside in the
three path into the turn near mid-pack, floated five wide for the drive, kept on strongly while being carried out a bit late. HEAVENLY HASH tracked from
inside, came out a path to gain between foes, was game in defeat in a blanket finish. STYLE was unhurried early bringing up the rear, swung ten wide
turning for home, gained late. NO NANNETTE NO pursued from outside four to six wide throughout and needed more late. ESSENTIAL BELLA switched
out early racing four to five wide on the turn toward the rear, came out further for the drive and was not a threat. HELEN MAE'S SONG sped clear, set the
pace on or just off the rail, faltered and faded. PLACE PICK 8 WINNING NUMBERS: 1/4-5/6-3/5-2/5/8-1/9-2/3/6/8-1/2/7/8/9-3/7

Footnotes
OFF THE LAM settled off the leaders inside, moved out four wide about the three-eighths, came out further in upper stretch, was flying late while drifting in
just a bit and bumping with a foe near the wire, got up in time. CROSSANNA shifted in two wide racing outside a foe early off the pace, saved ground on the
far turn, bid up the rail in the stretch, was lightly bumped past the sixteenth pole and just outfinished. DEAL'EM AND WEEP settled mid-pack inside, saved
ground, advanced two wide in the stretch making a bid between runners, bumped a rival then lugged out and bumped a different foe in deep stretch before
being taken hold of when in tight nearing the wire. ARGAN moved clear early, set the pace from off the rail, was challenged and put to urging about the
five-sixteenths, floated out a bit turning for home, gave way late. POSSESSION stalked from outside, advanced three to four wide up the backstretch, made
a mild bid at the five-sixteenths, faltered in the stretch. ROAR OF SILENCE settled at the back racing off the inside, failed to threaten. REALISTIC GOAL
was unable to threaten racing well back and off the inside. BLUESUP GREENSDOWN pressed from inside very early then eased back and switched out,
was within range of the leader two to three wide, faltered and faded.
