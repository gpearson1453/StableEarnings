Footnotes
JAGMAN AA chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, rallied to take command then drew off in upper stretch and was kept to task in the end. RB
DOUGLAS was settled then raced three wide on the turn, made a bid but was no match for the winner. WMA TORCH LIGHT was unhurried early then
rallied and was three wide in the stretch but was no menace. BASEQANATOR was sent along the inside to set the early pace, was sued up then gave way
in the stretch. WMA NASH RAMBLER chased the early pace while inside, was used up and faltered. MADJOR TOM trailed throughout. This race had a
timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
