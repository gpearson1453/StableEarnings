MY JANNET well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, lugged in, straightened under left
hand urging, then dueled with CUPID MISSED, edged ahead of that one and held. CUPID MISSED unhurried, moved up while angling out through the turn,
came widest into the stretch, dueled with the winner and was outfinished. BOTITA hopped at the start, was bumped by a rival, looped three wide and drew
off through the turn, then drifted out and weakened late. HOPE SHE COMES tracked the pace, lost some position through the turn, angled four wide into the
stretch and got up for a share. BLAH BLAH WORLD vied for the early lead on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came through
inside and flattened the final furlong. ASHERAH'S RUN set the pace inside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
ISOLA (IRE) rated nicely on the lead, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. KAGERO unhurried, moved up on the two path
through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then angled out further finding a clear path and closed the gap on the winner late. WOK DON'T RUN
mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, then closed well and was outfinished for the place. CLOUD IN
THE WIND stalked the pace rating on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. GOOD TO BE TRUGE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
evened out late. MAIDEN LANE mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and faded the final furlong.

WOODCHUCK well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch gaining a short lead, then
held under steady pressure. CHEWING GUM tracked the pace well back, moved up through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then was no match
for the winner and held the place. THE SINNER IS YOU unhurried, moved to position three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had
a mild late gain for the show. GENERAL WINSTON unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened
the final furlong. THE BLACK STRAT vied for the early lead on the outside, gained a short lead on the two path through the turn, then drifted in into the
stretch and faded. OLAZABAL sent from the gate, set the pace inside, steadied for racing room into the stretch and faded.
