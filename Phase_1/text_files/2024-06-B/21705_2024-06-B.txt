Footnotes
KILLY START tracked inside, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, dueled with MISS BETTY and wore down that rival in deep
stretch to prevail. MISS BETTY vied four wide for the early lead, dueled three wide on the turn, led into the lane, dug in gamely in the final furlong and
yielded grudgingly. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD vied two wide for the lead, dueled inside on the turn, dropped back, then angled out and came again for third.
YOU'RE THE ONE vied three wide for the lead, dueled between rivals on the turn and finished evenly inside. SEA ART vied inside for the lead, was shuffled
back nearing the turn, then checked and stumbled off heels, chased on the turn and lacked a bid. BAND SWEETHEART stumbled at the start, raced off the
pace inside and did not factor. GOLDEN EFFECT raced off the pace, went four wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
SHEZA NASTY GIRL chased three wide into the turn, remained outside rivals in upper stretch, gained momentum leaving the furlong marker, and kicked
clear late. NUCCI set a pressured pace into the turn, repelled out side challengers around the bend, fought on gamely inside the winner. SURVIVAL ROSE
pressed the pace from between runners into the turn, angled inside in upper, unable to switch leads through the stretch, came home evenly late. LA
MACCHINA ROSSA slow away from the gate, bid along the rail around the bend, out kicked through the stretch. MY JO JO very slow away from the gate,
never threatened. EXAGERADORA chased the pace from the four path, bid four wide leaving the quarter pole, no response late.
