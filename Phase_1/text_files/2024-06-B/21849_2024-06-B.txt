Footnotes
AMPERSAND prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn to duel for command, then had a long drive and prevailed late to prove best.
HERE'S WALDO set the pace on the inside and then was headed by the winner by the five sixteenths and dueled with that runner to the wire but was
out-kicked late in a game effort. ECLIPTICALS BEAR steadied on the inside by the seven furlong marker on the first turn, then was well placed on the inside
and eased out by the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane but came up empty, bested the rest. TWIXTER was rated along two to three wide and
fell back on the turn and tired. PURPLE SHIRT was reserved on the inside and failed to respond. TEXTPECTATION was five wide into the first turn,
reserved three wide and came four wide into the lane and was eased in the final furlong and walked off

Footnotes
PUT A ROCK ON IT was allowed to settle early on the inside, then ranged up and came four wide into the lane to make a bid and drew away in the furlong
grounds to prove much the best under a drive. BULLITINA tracked the pace three wide, then two wide on the far turn and then ranged up and made a three
wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead but could not go with the winner while being clearly second best. ALLOVERNOW BABYBLU set the early pace on
the inside and then opened up on the backstretch, was headed leaving the three sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong, stayed on for the show
award. MIDNIGHT PROWLER was reserved three to two wide, then dropped to the inside on the far turn but lacked a rally. ELUSIVE EMPRESS was
reserved on the inside and had no rally. FOXEY G was four wide into the first turn, then reserved early and in between rivals by the half mile marker and
was not a threat. TIME OF OUR LIVES showed little.

MORNING MARCH was well placed on the inside, eased out nearing the upper stretch and made a two wide bid to take over by the furlong marker and then
held well to prove best under a strong drive. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER was settled back early two wide, then moved out and made a five wide move
nearing the quarter pole and then loomed boldly but needed more late. CHUCK ADAMS was well rated along the inside, then moved out and made a mild
four wide bid by the quarter pole, came five wide off the bend and finished willingly to gain the show award. J R JONE Z set a fast pace on the inside and
faded in the final furlong. HYPER INFLATION was settled early three wide, then was carried wide by the loose horse by the five eighths marker and then
moved in and lacked a rally. MISCHIEF WARRIOR prompted the pace three wide and weakened. GUCCI MAN failed to menace. CITIZEN MACK was
reserved early on the inside and failed to respond. RIVERBOAT BANDIT was fractious in the gate and unprepared for the start and lost the rider at the start,
walked off.

Footnotes
CARDINAL WAR CRY was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, was well handled on the turn and then was sent down and drew clear leaving
the turn and then drew out to prove best under a drive. TOOTALOO KANGAROO was bumped at the start, then was well placed on the inside behind the
pacesetter, waited to the turn and tipped out three wide and finished willingly to be clearly second best. DANCING CHIME was settled back early, came five
wide into the lane and had a belated rally. GRAN PATRONA was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the turn and came four wide off the bend
and weakened in the drive. SWAN broke out at the start bumping TOOTALOO KANGAROO, then chased the pace on the inside and weakened. PHONE
EATS FIRST prompted the pace two to three wide and then came up empty in the drive. ROSALIE K was off a step slow and never factored.

BOSS HOLIDAY was away alertly to set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed and dueled for the lead by the quarter pole, then had a long drive
and prevailed late to prove best under a drive. SUNSHINE HARRY prompted the pace on the outside, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to duel for
command, then had a long drive with the winner but was out gamed to just miss. EMPTY MY POUCH pressed the early pace in between rivals, then fell
back by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the furlong marker and was gaining late. RAGING BEAR tracked the pace on the inside, eased out and came
four wide off the turn and had a mild kick but needed more. ABBY'S SPIRIT chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. HARVEY SPECTER
chased the pace three wide and then was empty in the lane. BRONX TALE chased the pace in between rivals and stopped.
