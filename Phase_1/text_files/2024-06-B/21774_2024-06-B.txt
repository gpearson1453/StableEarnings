AL'S ROMEO took a slim lead soon after the start and set a pressured pace, vied inside a duo around then turn, shook free two wide entering the head of
the lane, widened to a commanding lead and finished ridden out in late stages. MONTEREY PENINSULA broke on top then conceded position to ALS
ROMEO and pressed the early pace, vied between rivals around the turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch, could not move on with the winner but
sustained a steady bid and finished second best. AMERICAN WARRIOR tracked the early pace, saved ground on the rail around the turn, cut the corner
and launched an inside bid at the head of the lane, kept on and prevailed for a share. VALE reared in the air at the start and lost ground, then quickly
advanced into contention, vied three deep around the turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch and flattened out. KOSELIO raced in the back saving
ground, angled two wide for the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. BIG BOSS BEN raced four wide in contention off the top trio around the turn, came
five paths into the lane and gave way. STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START LOOKING INTO THE ACTIONS OF VALE, AFTER

DRIFTER vied between rivals around the first turn, then dueled inside of CASPER JUSTICE mid-way up the backstretch, shook clear entering the turn,
saved ground into upper stretch, fended off the challenge of I'M CRENSHAW in the lane and finished clear. I'M CRENSHAW was allowed to settle off the
embattled trio around the first turn, picked up the pace late on the backstretch, advanced to race in striking distance of DRIFTER near the quarter pole,
sustained a two wide bid through the lane and finished clearly second best. CHARMING CHARLIE vied for the lead around the first turn, weakened off the
top pair mid-way up the backstretch and continued to tire in the drive. PROMISING SHOES was well reserved and trailed in the back, saved ground and
hustled up around the far turn but had no response. CASPER JUSTICE vied for the lead around the first turn, battled on up the backstretch, could not move
on with eventual winner entering the far turn and retreated.

vied around the turn, took over the lead in upper stretch, sustained a steady effort on top, took on the late challenge of MISTER LESTER, dueled gamely
along the inside and prevailed. MISTER LESTER tracked the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, steadily edged up
closer on NICE ONE JULIO, reached outside of rival mid-stretch, raced heads apart approaching the wire, fought on gamely and got outnodded. GOD'S
GIFT TO US got carried out at the start and raced near the back around the first turn, remained unhurried then picked up the pace late on the backstretch,
hustled along three wide into upper stretch and secured a share. IRISH COAST hustled up at the start and led the way into the backstretch, came under
pressure from NICE ONE JULIO near the half mile marker, vied for the lead around the far turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and faded in the
final furlong. DEVIL'S SHADOW raced off the clear top trio up the backstretch, failed to advance when called upon and steadily faded. TALL TALE veered

DAY MONEY was well placed sitting just off the embattled trio, picked up the pace around the turn and came five paths wide into upper stretch, vied for the
lead a furlong out then drew clear under a driving finish. A JUST CAUSE was forwardly placed in opening stages then dueled three wide for the early lead,
continued to battle into the final furlong, could not move on with the winner late but dug in gamely to capture place. MC COUGAR vied for the early lead
racing two wide, continued to battle for command into the final furlong then failed to kick on with the winner and got nipped for place. LEADING THE CAUSE
raced off the early pace, saved ground then launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, roused forward to duel for the lead at the eighth pole then flattened
out. EYE OF THE PANTHOR lagged behind the field, hustled up along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and showed interest in final
stages. PAPA JOJO rated off the embattled top trio in the opening quarter, hustled up four wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no
kick. RAYS BIG DREAM vied for the lead up the backstretch, battled on into the lane then came up empty in the final furlong.

MILLIGANMIKEANDME vied three wide for the early lead, shook free to a slight edge at the head of the lane, fought back determinedly trying to fend off
INDY AGAIN, dug in late and just lasted. INDY AGAIN tracked the early pace, picked up the pace near the quarter pole, raced in striking distance of the
leader into final stages, dug in gamely under firm handling, was inching up closer and just missed. JERI DAWN raced in the back and saved ground, hustled
up at the quarter pole, gained closer contention, sustained a three wide bid down the lane and cleared the rest. NORTHERN GEM vied inside up the
backstretch, could not match strides approaching the quarter pole and steadily faded. MOCHA KISS vied for the lead around the first turn and up the
backstretch then came up empty late on the turn. SHE'S A BIG STAR raced in range up the backstretch, weakened when called upon late on the far turn
and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
WILDATLANTICSTORM broke on top then conceded position to OUR LAST CHANCE and pressed the early pace, moved up on equal terms entering the
turn, held a slim advantage a furlong out then edged ahead under firm handling, battled on gamely and held sway. OUR LAST CHANCE took a slim lead
soon after the start and raced on top under pressure from WILDATLANTICSTORM, matched strides with rival entering the turn and battled on into upper
stretch, remained in striking distance and fought on stubbornly to the end. BIG LUKE rated off the top trio up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the
turn, given cue three to four wide at the head of the lane and finished willingly. TIME GOES ON stalked the top pair up the backstretch, raced three wide
around the turn, came under right handed pressure in upper stretch, steadily edged closer and got outnodded for show. MINECRAFT MANIAC was
unhurried through early stages, rode the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, moved up closer then ran on evenly. FINISH UP raced in the
back, came five wide into the lane and never menaced.

furlong out then pulled away. LEAPIN TY MAN raced off the early pace, saved ground and edged closer along the rail on the turn, cut the corner then had to
wait for a clear path, tipped two wide then moved to the inside and got up for place. ELIOT NESS was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, continued in
close range two wide late on the turn, sustained bid into stretch run, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on three wide and just missed place.
COLORFUL NATIVE vied for the early lead, shook free and held clear around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued to lead the way then got
collared by the winner a furlong out and weakened. STAR OF MINE raced off the early pace, swung three wide into the stretch and improved position
without threatening. FREEDOM TO SPEED vied for the lead up the backstretch then chased around the turn, and tired in the drive. I AM LOWKEY broke on
top then weakened, raced off the pace along the outside and never menaced. KISSED A CADET raced along the outside and had no response.
