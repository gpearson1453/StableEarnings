came four wide into the stretch and gained mildly for fourth. KATERINA RISTOVA raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GROOMS ALL BIZNESS tracked close up on the inside, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside of SOUPER QUEST, dueled with that rival, took
over and drew clear late. SOUPER QUEST showed good early speed, set the pace on the inside, responded when challenged, dug in gamely inside and
came up second best. EAMONN was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside and finished well for third.
OUR SHOT chased three wide, three wide on the turn, rallied between rivals in the two path and got fourth. SMITHWICK'S SPICE chased three wide, then
four wide on the turn and rallied mildly. SMOOTH B chased two wide and rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. CHARGING chased close up inside,
steadied nearing the turn, saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. YES AND YES was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace and did not
factor. AXTHELM chased four wide, continued four wide on the turn and faded. FAYATHAAN (IRE) chased between rivals, two wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MUNDO MIX stalked the leader in the early stages, moved up two wide to challenge on the turn, quickly took over, responded when roused and pulled away
under urging. MOTION TO STRIKE chased outside, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied and dug in for the place award. BIG SAVE raced off the pace
inside, advanced between rivals on the turn and finished evenly. VIKRAM was outrun early, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NOTION TO
TAPIT was outrun early and did not factor. HE IS BONAFIDE showed good early speed inside, set the pace and gave way on the turn.
