Footnotes
ROCKALL was well placed from three wide down the backstretch, moved out to four wide at the half mile marker and engaged the leader at the top of the
stretch and matched strides outside of COUNTRY CUT to deep stretch, edged away in final jumps to prove best. COUNTRY CUT pressed the pace from
two wide around the first turn then took the lead going into the backstretch and held that position to the top of the stretch when headed by ROCKALL and
matched strides to deep stretch but gave way grudgingly. CONTRABANDISTA stalked the pace from two wide down the backstretch then fell back on the
final turn, angled out to four wide in upper stretch and made the late gain. CLASSIC RUNNER raced off the pace on the inside down the backstretch then
fell back on the turn but made a late bid and passed tiring rivals. ROYAL DE BE was allowed to settle to the final turn then moved out to three wide to make
a mild bid and improved position. LITTLE WARRIOR went to the front to set the early pace around the first turn then vied for the lead to the top of the stretch
and gave way. SKINNY BOBBY was always back. PER RULING 25511 FROM THE LOUISIANA HORSE RACING COMMISSION COUNTRY CUT WAS
DQD FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

MONEY WELL SPENT sprinted to the early lead around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, slipped through entering the final turn
and won going away. OUR AMEN stalked the pace from the inside through the final turn then slipped up the rail for the late rally to be second best.
MIDNIGHT TRIP rushed to contention from three wide and held that position to deep stretch but was outkicked late. KENYA STRIKE was unhurried around
the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the final turn but hung. MO CLASSY saved ground and
was not a factor. SCRAPBOOK rushed up from two wide to take the lead going into the backstretch, was overtaken going into the final turn and tired.

CHROME BABY was within striking distance on the inside then moved up from two wide at the half mile marker and engaged the leader at the quarter pole,
drew clear and held on. RIGHTANDJUST prompted the pace from two wide to the half mile marker and fell back slightly, moved out to four wide on the final
turn and made the late run but couldn't catch the leader but held on for the place. ALEX JOON raced in the middle of the pack then moved up on the turn
from two wide and angled in at the sixteenth pole for a late gain but missed the place. DRIED PEPPER went to the front to set most of the pace but was
headed at the quarter pole and was empty. CHIEF CHEETAH raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground throughout but failed to menace. ASSET
BASIS tracked the leaders from three wide to the half mile marker and weakened. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF was unhurried and remained back. AFFABLE

SAINT ISABEL prompted the pace from two wide through the turn then tipped out to three wide in upper stretch to run down the leader and draw clear.
SCAMPERING MA'AM sprinted to a clear lead but floated out at the top of the stretch and was headed at the sixteenth pole while fighting gamely to the
wire. SHORT STACK was bumped at the start then rushed up to be in contention while saving ground, slipped through at the tip of the stretch and
maintained position. AND CHANGE raced in the middle of the pack from three wide, made a mild four wide bid in the upper stretch to improve position.
QUART HIGH chased the leaders from three wide then tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response. MRS. MACOMBER raced in
the middle of the pack and was not involved. STRUMMIN MARY broke out and bumped off stride and remained back. SHELLEY'S ROSE saved ground
while racing near the back, was steadied going into the turn but was never a threat.
