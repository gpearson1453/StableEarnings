Footnotes
HE'S ALL EARS within striking distance early inside, steered out and advanced to lodge an early challenge in the two path in the first turn, dueled early
backstretch, shook clear far turn, opened that advantage up a bit entering the stretch, geared down late to prove clearly best. DAKOTA MARVIN showed the
way early inside, dueled with the winner onto and up the backstretch, lost contact with that rival in the second turn while continuing to save ground, briefly
lost some position in the second flight midway on that bend then battled back to earn the second spot. DIAMONDS R LUCKY four wide first turn, lodged a
bid for the second spot in the final turn, outkicked. TAKING ENERGY fell back to trail after breaking with the field, moved closer after a half, also challenged
for the runner up position late in the final turn, weakened through the stretch. STORMSACOMIN finished early, fell back to trail, well back at the end. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

EURA NORTHERN SKY off slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved outside, remained back in failing to rally,. LADY ZEPHYR fell back to trail not
long after the start, always outrun. HANGXIETY in the second flight inside, moved closer while saving ground through the turn, made no further progress
regarding the winner through the lane, held sway for the second spot. LOW EURO CAT in the second flight while outside the runner up, outkicked through
the stretch for the second spot. SEXY BROWN broke sharp, set a pressured pace early, edged clear late in the turn, not threatened in the run to the wire.
SECRET PASS pressed the winner for just over a quarter from the outside and began to weaken. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
C B'S FLAT OUT took command soon after the start, rated in the run up the backstretch the first time, continued in hand the middle half while in the two
path, drew out steadily the final quarter, while being kept to task. SLEW'S LIAISON chased the while while racing off the inside, proved no match for that
one the final two furlongs, lasted the place. FATHER PATRICK fell back to trail after the start while racing well off the rail, asked along exiting the final turn,
staged a mild rally to be getting to the runner up late, no threat to the winner. GOSPEL BUZZ broke on top, settled, in the second flight closest to the inside,
continued to chase onto the backstretch the second time, came under the whip into the far turn, no response, tired in the run to the wire. TRUE DOMINUS
restless in the gate, lacked speed while saving ground, faded. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NOISE COMPLAINT broke out, closest to the early leader, shifted out and went after that one in the turn, put a head in front with a furlong to run, edged
away under steady handling. MAGNA PUNCH broke on top, set the pace while clearing toward the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner when that
one came alongside late in the turn then could not match strides, clearly second best. I'M ALIVE floated in slightly just after the start by the runner up,
settled off that one and the winner in the three path, had little for that pair in the drive, just lasted for the show. CAPTAIN DOZER in tight, jostled at the
break, moved up to mid pack, four wide into the stretch, staged a rally down the middle of the strip to narrowly miss the show spot. JEANO broke out to help
tighten up outer rivals, was righted and went one pace to make little other impact. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME floated out and bumped with CAPTAIN DOZER
at the break, remained back. MR SEEKER squeezed back at the break, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
HEY ROXY asked a bit leaving to maintain inside position, dueled, larger lead when straightened for home, rated then was roused midway on the final bend,
clear, enough left to just last. COZZOLANI off leaders while along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, steered out for the drive, finished up
willingly to miss. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT forwardly placed while off the inside, asked along late backstretch, fell back in some traffic second turn, dropped
inside and came back to earn the show, no threat to the top two. FACESTER dueled up front early outside the winner, fell back a bit off that one while still
applying pressure the middle three furlongs, faded through the stretch, missed the show while between horses at the wire. EXCETERA last away, trailed
early, came four wide for the drive, displayed a modest amount of late energy while widest of the second flight, not enough for the show. This race had a
timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

larger lead midstretch, lasted late. JACKS SPRING BREAK in the second flight while off the inside, moved out a bit onto the backstretch for the second
time, closer from between horses far turn, stalled a bit into the lane then mounted one last late charge to be getting to the winner. TWO WORLDS last to
leave, trailed much of the way, displayed some late interest to be closing the gap on the top two while up in time for the show. UNITED PATRIOT within
striking distance while saving ground, early bid rail second turn, vied, led, weakened stretch. INCORRIGIBLE broke alertly, pressed the winner early in the
three path, remained within striking distance, began to give way with a quarter to run, continued to fade through the lane. This race had a timing discrepancy

Footnotes
RUN DOTTIE RUN ducked out at the break, tracked the pace from along the inside, crept closer far turn, squeezed through a narrow opening along the rail
to cut the corner into the lane, put a head in front soon after, edging away late in a determined effort. LOOKIN LUCKY AGAIN raced back off the early pace,
began a steady advance when asked after a quarter, continued to come on the outside into the lane, closed with continued resolve to be up for the place at
the wire. IMPUDENT prompted the pace from the outside, challenged three wide into the lane, put a head in front, briefly raced on equal terms with the
winner upper stretch then could not match strides, nipped at the wire for the runner up position. BOSS ON THE RUN broke on top, set the pace toward the
inside, allowed the winner the inside exiting the final turn, gave way from between horses soon after. SWEETASLIFECANBE settled in mid pack, went one
paced throughout in lacking a closing response. RICKELLE unruly exiting the paddock and just prior to the start, stumbled at the start and was never
involved. GERTIE off slow then was bothered to trail past the wire the first time, five wide into the first turn, continued to trail and was never involved. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
E D'ORO broke back then was asked to take command out of the chute, set all the pace along the inside, light restraint, stayed clear stretch. CLINTON
QUARINTINO last away, moved up to press the winner early from the two path, chased that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, could do little with
that same foe through the lane, clearly second best. ABES DAY lacked early foot, staged a mild rally to earn the show, not a serious threat to the top two.
TAPIT TWICE void of speed, improved position the middle quarter off the inside, then came up empty for the drive. QUIET JOURNEY pressed the issue up
front between the top two early, fell back before a half, continued to fade to trail home well beaten. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
