throughout and continued gamely while unable to match strides with the winner. AZ SHARP chased off the pace then continued well to gain the show.
CRAIGH NA DUN dropped back early then offered some late energy. STANDPOINT showed brief bid outside on the turn then faltered. OMAHA EIGHT
raced wide and failed to respond. BRINDANO displayed poor action from outset and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
ON THE SHORTLIST saved ground close up, bid to the front in the stretch then held rivals safe in a long drive. NATURE'S CANDY set a clear pace for
three quarters, lost the advantage then gamely came again in the stretch. COLOR CRUSH trailed early, swung very wide on the final turn and into the lane
and rallied. OUR STRONG VOWS settled inside, bid into the stretch loomed a threat but could not get by. A CASE OF YOU dropped well behind, advanced
inside and continued well. CONFIRMED STAR settled off the leaders inside, bid into the stretch then flattened out. FLASHY TOO dropped back outside and
lacked a rally. VOLATILITY was urged close up briefly then weakened steadily. SEEYOUATTHEHOP prompted the pace for half a mile then gave way
readily.
