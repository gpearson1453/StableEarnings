Footnotes
AZUSA STREET broke on top, set a pressured early pace in hand, rated past the wire the first time and into the second turn, continued to show the way in
hand backstretch, edged clear third turn and held a daylight advantage to the wire under clever handling. SCANDALOUS back off the early pace inside,
moved closer three wide after a quarter, chased the winner up the backstretch and into the far turn, could do little with that one through the stretch,
remained clear of the others. SNOWBIRD pressed the winner early off the inside, fell back the second quarter, went evenly thereafter to earn the show while
not a serious threat to the top two. GOSPEL TIZ SOSWEET fell back to trail shortly after the start, never menaced. SWEET THELMA JEAN in the second
flight early outside the runner up, moved forward with that one while four wide into the second turn, began to give way after five furlongs, continued to stop
and finished well back at the end. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
ALWAYS A KING last away, settled behind the busy first flight in the run up the backstretch, crept a bit closer by late in the turn, waited in some traffic into
the lane, shifted out a bit when straightened for home, launched a late surge from between horses to be up at the wire in a well timed ride. IMPOVERISHED
with the pace from the start, vied in the two path and between horses for three furlongs, edged away when straightened for home, nailed at the wire when
unable to contain the winner. MAJESTIC FLASH away in good order, raced with the pace along the inside, continued to duel into the lane closest to the
inside, weakened gradually, lasted for the show. OLD TOBY forced the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle four wide through the
turn, had little left for the stretch run. LEGEND'S JOURNEY broke on top, vied up front three and and between foes, lost some ground to the inside speed
out of the turn, appeared to be weakening a bit with a sixteenth to run when bothered by the winner when that one shifted out, continued to falter to the wire.
KHAN RUN dropped back to trail after the start, was never involved. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LIMBO'S PROMISE in a bit tight at the break, dueled past the wire the first time in the two path, continued to alternate up front for the next three furlongs,
shook clear far turn, had enough left late to narrowly last. BREAD WINNER dueled up front inside the winner, fell back off that one with just under a quarter
to run, asked to run with firm handling soon after, moved outside, was coming again late to miss. HOODOO BROWN went one paced throughout behind the
top two, lacked a closing response. GOSPEL BUZZ raced in the second flight along the inside, set down for the drive, also was found lacking when the real
running began at the head of the lane. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
THAROLITE allowed the leader to go early, pulled early inside, continued to stalk that one down the stretch the first time, moved to engage that one
between horses up the backstretch, shook clear in the final turn, maintained daylight to the wire to win ridden out at the end. FREYAS CATZ last away,
unhurried off the inside, continued back while four wide through the second turn, asked along backstretch, rallied four wide into the stretch, finished willingly
to earn the place, no threat to the winner. GOSPEL FREELY void of early foot while saving ground, continued inside into the far turn, split foes into the lane
when staging a mild rally, along for the show. LADY YELLOWSTONE prompted the pace while three wide, continued closest to the leader the middle half
mile, lodged a brief bid outside the inner backstretch only to come up empty for the drive. GOSPEL FAITH broke on top, soon clear, showed the way inside,
rated the opening six furlongs, offered brief resistance to the winner when headed by that one with less than a quarter remaining, gave way in full the final
furlong. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time. THAROLITE was
disqualified from first and placed last for post race test per 2024-FMT-028.

Footnotes
PAULA M took command at the start, rated the first half mile, asked along when clear far turn, not threatened through the stretch under token
encouragement to win ridden out. REALITY CHECK bumped at the break, within striking distance while three wide, roused just just over a quarter
remaining, proved no match for the winner to the wire, held sway for the place. RAINBOW SMILES lacked early foot, continued to lag the middle three
furlongs, displayed some mild late interest up the rail to be closing the gap on the runner up. DENISES DOLLY pressured the winner off the inside for three
furlongs and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RIGHT CIDER allowed the winner to go early, moved closest to that one into the far turn, chased through that bend, late bid, could not get by. SON OF
PREACHERMAN unhurried for a half while in the two path, came three wide for the drive when moving closer, not enough late for the top two while
managing to close the gap a bit, well clear of the others. PRECIOUS CARGO restless in the gate, broke slowly, continued devoid of any speed and failed to
menace. PRINCE PIERRE broke outward and greenly, devoid of early foot, remained well back to be outrun. BROWN RESERVE restless in the gate, broke
well, set the early pace, clear before a half, continued to show the way into the lane, responded when confronted late, dug in to narrowly prevail. TAKING
ENERGY chased the winner off the inside, gave way in the far turn. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MISTER WAYSIDE was clear in hand down the stretch the first time, continued to rate onto the backstretch, appeared to quicken far turn when along with
the runner up separated from the field, found more through the stretch to hold that rival safe. FLY TO THE BANK chased the winner while also lightly
restrained early, moved with that one away from the others early in the final turn, could do little with the victor the final sixteenth, remained clearly second
best. HE SAID WAIT in the second flight for a half while inside the runner up, fell back off the top two through the final turn, could not get back to that pair in
going evenly through the stretch. TOMMYHAWK fell back to trail just after the start, continued to lag the middle three furlongs, lacked a serious closing
response to finish up evenly. GUINESSEY broke back, was finished early in trailing most of the way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
AUTO BE A STAR within striking distance, four wide into the first turn, tracked up the backstretch, bid, kicked clear through the stretch.
FREELOADINGSISTAH prompted leader off the inside, challenged between horses and inside the winner midway up the backstretch, could not match
strides with that one through the final turn and through the stretch, fully extended to save the place. LADY RASHEN settled off the pace, remained one
paced while getting to the runner up late. DIAMOND GAL also turned in an even effort, lacked a closing punch. HOLY AMA last to leave, trailed most of the
way while saving ground, never menaced. O S U BUDKE moved up to show the way out of the chute inside, continued to set the pace inside, vied inside a
pair of rivals up the backstretch, was appearing to tire when shuffled back into the far turn, continued to back up. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF O S U BUDKE AGASINT THE RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE FAR TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
