Footnotes
CHI TOWN HUSTLER was sent to the front to an unchallenged lead while racing from three to six wide down the backstretch then moved in to three or four
wide around the turn and kept on to draw off in the stretch. DEEP STATE tracked the leaders from five wide down the backstretch, tipped in to three wide
around the turn but was no match for the winner. JULIA'S WARRIOR chased the leaders down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn
for a bid at the leaders but hung. TEXAS TURBINE saved ground while racing off the pace but was never a threat. STAR READY trailed the field and didn't
make a rally.

engaged by inside rival late and held on. RUN ROCKET was allowed to settle while saving ground through the final turn then made a late rail bid in the
stretch but was too late. ANDIAMO GIACOMO stalked the pace from three wide around the first turn then moved up down the backstretch and pressed the
pace around the final turn, headed the leader at the eighth pole but couldn't collar and was outfinished by inside closer. SMARTY ALEX was unhurried
through the final turn then made a late rally through traffic in the stretch to close willingly. GUITARTUITION PLZZ tracked the leaders while saving ground to
the final turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch and was gaining late. SABER RUN raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then steadily
advanced from three wide through the final turn but failed to sustain the bid. FAST VERDICT prompted the pace to the half mile marker and faded.

Footnotes
LOUDTHUNDRHEVYRAIN pressed the pace from two wide then moved up to engage the leader and took the lead at the quarter pole, drew off and was
much the best. LEISURELY sprinted to a early clear lead but was collared midway through the turn and couldn't match strides but held on for the place.
ZAPAWAY showed no early speed, but made a four wide bid at the three furlong marker to rally and missed the place. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW raced
near the back through the turn then moved between horses near the sixteenth pole to improve position. FRIEND'S DO CARE vied for the early lead from
three wide to the turn then fell back but didn't make a late bid. COOL RIDE saved ground throughout but was not a factor. MUCHO BUENO was not
involved.

Footnotes
IRONIT went to the front to set an unchallenged pace throughout and just lasted. FORT POLK stalked the pace from the inside around the first turn then
advanced from three wide through the final turn and gave the late kick but was not enough. DADDY HEY DADDY raced off the pace throughout, showed the
late kick in the stretch but was outfinished by outside closer and proved best of the rest. MIA ANTONIA raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail and
passed tiring rival in the stretch. MISS KENNEDY tracked the leaders from the inside to the final turn and weakened. HOT PATOOTIE saved ground
through the final turn then moved out to three wide and finished evenly. TRIPLE FOUR was unhurried around the first turn then made a middle inside move
but flattened out. I DONT KNOW EITHER raced in the middle of the pace around the first turn then made a mild three wide bid on the backstretch but was
never a threat. LOVERS NEVER SAY was allowed to settle around the first turn, dropped back on the backstretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
MIZ JAMESON showed no early speed but gained momentum and moved between horses at the five furlong marker, shed kept on and engaged the leader
at the eighth pole and matched strides outside of SISTER SAINT and won the nod. SISTER SAINT stalked the early pace then moved up from three wide at
the half mile marker and took the lead near the quarter pole but was headed at the eighth pole and matched strides with MIZ JAMESON but lost the photo.
BROADWAY PEARL saved ground to the turn then angled out to two wide around the turn and made a late bid to be up for show. MARK WITH AN E raced
near the back down the backstretch then circled the field around the turn but only passed tired one. BENT HALO hustled to the front to a pressured pace
then edged away into the turn but was collared mid turn and weakened. TOOTOO TOURIST sprinted to press the pace from the inside to the seven
sixteenths and gave way.
