clear lead nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. DREAM TIME was allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide on the turn, came
six-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. WE GOT SWAG saved ground chasing the dueling leaders and finished in a mild rally. HATAGASAL dueled
with WINANYWAYUCAN from along the outside, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to be five-wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late
response. POCO DIABLO ROJO was unhurried early, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and was gaining slightly late. ALLANTE was allowed
to settle, rallied three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. RED MEMORYS saved ground racing in the middle of the field early and tired.

OAT MILK LATTE prompted RAFANELLI from along the outside, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and quickly drew clear then was pulled up following
the race and vanned off. LEMON DROP LADY saved ground stalking the early pace, angled out three-wide nearing the stretch to offer a bid but was unable
to reach the winner while proved to be clearly second pace. RAFANELLI saved ground setting the pace to near the quarter pole and held on fairly well for
third when headed. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. LUCY L saved ground while
being reserved off the pace and failed to seriously threaten. LAKER JET was allowed to settle while three-wide and gave way during the drive.

A VIEW FROM ABOVE set the pressured pace racing slightly removed from the rail, opened a clear lead entering the stretch and maintained a safe
advantage. CLUB MESQUITE was close-up from the beginning racing two-wide and finished well for second in a steady effort. HANDR'SDREAM was off a
step slow then rushed up three-wide to prompt the pace into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. HORSE DOCTOR was forwardly placed while
racing four-wide and went evenly. D K'S CROWN was allowed to settle, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole but failed to seriously threaten. THIRD
WHEEL was unhurried early, swung out to be six-wide entering the stretch but failed to menace. TRIBAL IMPACT vied for the early lead from along the
inside, steadied in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and tired. THE TRAINER OF TRIBAL IMPACT LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAIN CLUB
MESQUITE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WAS INSUFFICIENCT INTERFERENCE TO MERIT A CHANGE IN
THE ORDER OF FINISH.

SON OF THUNDER was reserved off the early pace, moved up two-wide on the turn, steadied lacking room nearing the five-sixteenths pole then swung out
entering the stretch to be four-wide and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. GYPSY GUN saved ground setting the pace, responded when
asked and held on gamely during the drive. A SKIP IN THE PARK was unhurried early, moved up strongly along the inside on the turn, came out for room
nearing the three-sixteenths pole bumping IT;S TURBO and finished well for third BUT WAS DISQUALIFED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR
INTERFERENCE NEARING THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE. IT'S TURBO saved ground stalking GYPSY GUN, moved up two-wide to offer his bid
nearing the quarter pole, was bumped by A SKIP IN THE PARK nearing the three-sixteenths pole then finished willingly and was PLACED THIRD VIA THE
DISQUALIFICATION OF A SKIP IN THE PARK FOR THE INCIDENT NEARING THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE.. ITS KRAKEN TIME was forwardly

entering the stretch and missed narrowly in a game effort. ROCKIT A DAY vied for the lead into the stretch while two-wide, was unable to stay with the top
two late but continued on well for third. LAPUSH bobbled at the start then came in to bump GREASE MISSLE, vied for the lead from along the inside into

Footnotes
NEIMAN prompted PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY from along the outside, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was
unhurried early, angled to the outside nearing the quarter pole, came six-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY saved ground
setting the pressured pace to the eighth pole, was unable to match strides with the winner late but held on well for the shoiw. MONGOLIAN MEMORY saved
ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be two-wide nearing the eighth pole and was gaining late. COASTAL KID was reserved off the early
pace, came tree-wide into the stretch and improved his position during the drive. PRISONER was forwardly placed while racing four-wide on the turn but
lacked a rally. COOL PAPA G moved up five-wide on the turn to be prominently place and weakened during the drive. COMPANY'S DREAM showed brief
speed while racing three-wide and tired. PERFECT DUDE raced in the middle of the field on the turn while three-wide and gave way during the drive.
