Footnotes
ROSES R BLUE was unhurried from the break, started to advance heading in to the turn, made a sweeping move around the field four wide under a drive,
came five wide into the stretch and produced a strong rally to win going away. BACALAR broke alertly, cleared the field and angled to the two path from the
outside, opened up a two length lead on the field, held sway through the turn, responded when set down at the quarter pole, pulled ahead in the stretch but
could not hold off a late challenge from ROSES R BLUE while finishing well clear of the next horse. LITTLE LILIANA was inside of three horses across
tracking mid-pack before the turn, came under an early ride to keep pace but lost ground and dropped back to last, went into a stiff drive before the three
furlong pole, swung six wide for the stretch run, found a second wind and rallied into third under steady handling. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR raced between
horses mid-pack through the first quarter mile, was a bit late to launch a rally and came into the stretch behind horses, had to angle out into the clear in
upper stretch, gained some ground late was much too late. LION'S LAIR raced outside of a trio of horses mid-pack through the early stages, went on ahead
through the turn, came into the stretch in the three to four path wide aim on BACALAR on the lead but could not sustain the bid and was passed late for a
minor award. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA broke in a bit at the start, then rushed up into stalking position behind the pacesetter BACALAR angled out to the
three path before the turn, loomed a threat near the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch and faded to last in the late stages. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUGAR BEETS was allowed to settle near the rear of the pack through the early stages while racing in the three to four path, launched a bid with three
furlongs to run, came four wide into the lane, exchanged bumps with J.T.'S WATCH at the top of the stretch, continued to run on well under strong handling
and intermittent urging, got a head in front in the final yards and just held on to prevail in a solid effort. BRONZE WARRIOR was hustled from the gate and
won the race to the first turn, slowed the pace down and dictated very slow fractions with the rest in close pursuit, responded when challenged near the
three furlong marker, ran on willingly under steady handling and intermittent urging, was passed mid-stretch by SEA OF LIBERTY but came back on in deep
stretch and gained the place in a gritty effort. SEA OF LIBERTY was always close while racing two to three paths wide, loomed boldly from the
five-sixteenths marker, drifted out a bit into the stretch putting J.T.'S WATCH in tight, rider lost the crop near the furlong pole but continued to run on well
down the stretch under a strong hand ride but was out-gamed for the place. J T'S WATCH pulled the rider up close while racing in the three path, was
making a bid from the quarter pole then got squeezed between horses at the three sixteenths, taking a bump from SUGAR BEETS, lost momentum and
could not recover. PLAYBOY STYLE was a little slow into stride out of the gate, then pushed to get forward position, saved ground while racing close up to
the far turn, was within a length of the leader passing the half mile marker, came under a drive approaching the three furlong marker, checked slightly
behind horses and lost momentum before the quarter pole, tried to swing five wide into the clear but could not make any headway in the stretch. LOOKOUT
POINT was last into the first turn, lagged well behind the field continued to lose ground through the far turn, came under a drive but could do no better than
chase the field home. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BLEVYS TIGER inherited the early lead without being asked, set moderate fractions well in hand to the stretch, had plenty left when set down in the stretch
and held sway to the wire despite drifting out through the stretch. KRISTIN LEE broke sharply but veered outward, opted to stalk BLEVYS TIGER just off the
flank to the outside but never put much pressure on that one, seemingly comfortable with the pace, tried to challenge approaching the quarter pole but was
rebuffed, battled on gamely but was outkicked by the winner. ROSE OF JERICHO tracked behind the top pair, tried to rally from the three furlong marker,
was unable to improve then was hard pressed but just managed to hold on to the third spot. BROOKYS GAL lagged well behind the tepid pace, launched a
bid from the five-sixteenths pole, made a frantic late bid to gain the third position but just came up short. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CLICKING broke alertly and assumed early command, was well handled while setting modest fractions into the backstretch run, set a prompted pace to the
half-mile marker and was pressured into the far turn by FRESNO CHILE, shook free of that rival into the stretch, kicked clear at the furlong marker and drew
away in the final sixteenth. HELLO BABY tracked the early pace from an outside position, was guided three to four wide along the first turn, raced widest
while well placed nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, could not impact the winner in the stretch drive and outfinished the rest to
secure place honors. FRESNO CHILE prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace from a two to three wide path along the first turn, prompted the
modest pace along the backstretch run, pressed CLICKING into the far turn, could not match strides with the winner into the stretch, weakened in the drive
and just held for third. ACHROMATIC stumbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, guided two to three wide along the first
turn, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, improved position two to three wide along the far turn, offered a mild rally in the stretch run and just missed
for third on the wire. IMA KEEN ICE took back off of the early pace, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, maintained
an inside path into the far turn, made a mild rally into the stretch run but needed more in the final stages. NO BEACHES allowed to settle while never far
back in the early running, raced three to four wide into the first turn, tracked the modest pace through the backstretch run, made a steady advance into the
far turn and was well placed while four wide at the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and could not muster the needed response in the late stages.
CALIGRAPHY settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, chased from a two wide path
into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch drive and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ALMOST GOT LUCKY was a bit slow into stride away from the start, allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, was roused at the
three-eighths and loomed four wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied widest into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, drew to even terms
with ICY MISCHIEF past mid-stretch and battled that game rival into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and held in a drive to
determinedly prevail at the finish. ICY MISCHIEF stumbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up and pressed the moderate early pace from the
inside, saved ground into the turn and chased the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, gained command into upper stretch and led approaching the
furlong pole, met the bid of ALMOST GOT LUCKY into the final sixteenth, gamely battled into deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while clear of
the rest for second. SUSIE CRU prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace then advanced to press the pace from the outside entering the turn,
pressured the moderate pace two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into upper stretch and got caught a bit in tight nearing the furlong
pole, stayed on into the final sixteenth, could not impact the top pair into deep stretch and outfinished EMERALD FLASH to earn third. EMERALD FLASH
hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, carved out moderate fractions while
pressed into the turn, was overtaken into upper stretch, battled to the furlong marker, gave way in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for show honors.
CONNECT THE DROPS forwardly placed in the early stages, raced outside of rivals into the turn and gained ground five wide nearing the quarter marker,
shifted inside into upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and could not muster a late response. MAMARANDO took back off of the moderate
early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and did not threaten in the stretch drive. TRIPLE SLIPPER lacked early speed and was outrun. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NOT MY RODEO broke sharply, quickly opened up a clear lead on the field, held through the turn, drifted outward down the stretch, was shortening strides
in the final furlong and lasted for the win at the finish. DRINKS AT THE CLUB was off a bit slowly then hustled up the rail to get into a tracking position, was
kept under a drive throughout, saved all the ground through the turn and managed a nice rally to just miss despite racing on the wrong lead through the
stretch. NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK was allowed to settle from the break then was pushed along to go forward after about a furlong, made up some ground going
three wide through the turn, was gaining on NOT MY RODEO then had to alter course to the inside in mid-stretch, continued to run on but came up short. I
AM AMADEO got roughed up a bit at the start and was last down the backstretch, went into a drive from the three furlong marker, came four wide into the
stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. NOW THEN broke well but not asked for
speed early, lagged near the rear of the field while racing wide, had only one beaten at the top of the stretch but produced a mild rally, showed some late
interest and passed a few in the final furlong. BOOMING BERNARDO allowed to settle into stride from the break, raced mid-pack to the turn, came under a
ride from the three furlong pole, came into the stretch in the two path then looked to move to the outside but was tiring at that point and failed to threaten in
the final sixteenth. MONSIEUR broke alertly and got forward position, chased NOT MY RODEO through the turn, came under pressure passing the quarter
pole then faltered in the stretch. G G GILLEY got pinballed slightly at the break then showed brief speed for a quarter mile, began to drop back through the
field and had nothing to offer in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
