RED ROMANCE vied outside of DONTDRINKANDDRIVE into the turn, continued to match strides into upper stretch, shook free to a slim lead leaving the
eighth pole and held sway. DONTDRINKANDDRIVE dueled inside of RED ROMANCE soon after the start, vied around the turn and into the upper stretch,
could not match strides with eventual winner past the furlong marker but stayed on gamely. MEEKER raced off the pace in opening stages, edged closer
three wide late late on the turn, sustained a two wide bid through the lane and cleared the rest. GENERAL PICKETT chased in range along the rail, saved
ground entering upper stretch and flattened out. GOLD JERRY raced in contention sitting just off the embattled pair around the turn, failed to keep pace and
weakened in the lane. HELADO lacked speed and raced in the back, came two wide into upper stretch and had no response. THE RIDER OF
DONTDRINKANDDRIVE VCLAIMED FOUL AGAINST RED ROMANCE FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN

Footnotes
CUPIDS SWEETY tracked the top trio late on the backstretch, launched a two wide bid in upper stretch, steadily edged up closer, gained between foes in
final stages and prevailed. S C SKYLARS EMPIRE was forwardly placed in early stages then moved up in tandem with MY FIRING LINE entering the turn,
vied for the lead into upper stretch, fought back along the inside, held a slim lead then got overtaken late. MY FIRING LINE raced up close from the onset
then moved up with SC SKYLARS EMPIRE to challenge for the lead entering the turn, vied ingto upper stretch, held a slight edge then lost the lead and
yielded late. NATUSIA raced off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved. AMERICAN SUE raced in the back, saved ground around
the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and needed more for impact. CAN'T MAKE ME set the early pace, got collared by outside duo three furlongs from
home and steadily faded. ANCHORS AND SPURS chased two wide near midpack around the turn then retreated in the drive.

Footnotes
LITTLE TAP DANCER sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace then widened to a clear advantage around the turn, saved ground turning for home,
roused for more, responded willingly, drew off and finished ridden out. BIG TIPPA rated under slight restraint sitting off the early pace, saved ground along
the rail, picked up the tempo leaving the backstretch, edged closer racing between foes mid-way around the turn, came four paths wide in upper stretch, set
down for the drive, was no match for clear leader but ran on with response and cleared second best. YOU HAVE NO IDEA raced in range along the inside,
waited briefly mid-way around the turn, got clear and hustled along the inside into upper stretch, got collared for place and just lasted for show. KANTIRUN
hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, chased three paths wide around the turn, stayed on two wide into the lane and got nipped for show. RUN A FIRE
raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. LITTLEDABWILLDOO was the closest pursuer of the
leader in early stages, sustained a two wide bid around the turn then retreated in the lane. LADY RAZORBACK was not too far back along the outside,
failed to progress under urging around the turn then tired in the drive. THE FIVE EIGHTHS WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIME MALFUCTION
