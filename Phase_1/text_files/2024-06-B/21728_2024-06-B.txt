Footnotes
NORMA NO watched the front duo down the backside, was nestled on the rail behind the leader at the half, waited patiently for room on the fence around
the bend, had no seam to through in the three path at the quarter pole, continued to lack running room in upper stretch, dove down to the rail for the final
eighth and got up in the final stride for the win. CASTLETON prompted the pace outside at the start, tracked the leader when reined back at the five eighths
marker, re-engaged outside three furlongs out, vied with runners on each side throughout the turn, fought back to take command at the furlong marker and
stubbornly battled to the finish line just losing the nod on the last jump. MY ASSISTANT stalked in hand between foes in the two path down the backside ,
kept pace two wide outside horses through the turn, was nudged on at the quarter pole narrowing the margin to loom four wide on the outside at the top of
the lane, was gaining late on the top two but could not pose a threat at the wire. SMILES FOR DAVID was unhurried to trail down the back straight, started
to commence a run picking up rivals three furlongs from home and finished up with purpose down the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. DIFFERENT
DRUM travelled three deep stalking near the back of the pack, made an early move with seven sixteenths from home closing the gap down the backstretch,
circled three wide around horses to lead with two furlongs to run, could not sustain the rally by upper stretch and flattened out in the four path at the furlong
marker. SISTER COUSIN broke sharply for the lead, opened up mildly by mid-backstretch, was pressed outside dueling for the lead three furlongs out,
could not quicken with outside rivals at the quarter pole and retreated on the rail turning for home. WAR'S END KISS stalked near the back on the fence
along the backside, could not get involved taking the shortest route around the bend and had nothing to offer in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LADY EVA emerged from the early scramble for the lead to seize control at the five eighths marker, maintained a slim advantage inside through the turn,
opened up mildly straightening out for home and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish line. ALBERTA BE MINE prompted the pace four wide in the
early going, kept even with the leaders going four wide around the bend, was in the hunt for a share at the top of the stretch and finished up strongly,
chasing the frontrunning winner down the lane to best the rest. ADDENDUM travelled in mid-division down the backside, nudged closer on the rail through
the turn, was in range of the frontrunning winner at the top of the lane but needed more late to pose a threat at the wire. HOLIDAY WITH AMY broke
inwards to begin, stalked in the four path with horses on either side, began to pick up the bit four wide by the quarter pole, was gaining momentum in the five
path turning for home and finished up willingly for a minor share in the end. UMNEYAAT was void of early speed to trail in the early stages, caught up to the
field by the three eighths marker, found a seam in the three path with an eighth to run and showed some late energy in deep stretch. SWEET SERENADE
was brushed outside to begin, stalked three wide inside down the backstretch, was roused for more in the third flight mid-point on the oval, offered little
response and dug in to offer a mild rally on the rail at the furlong marker. DELPHIA stalked five deep outside runners down the back straight, made little
progression travelling five wide around horses on the bend, was fanned out to the six path, widest of rivals at the top of the lane and failed to menace in the
stretch drive. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY pressed the issue in the two path with runners on either side in the early going, shadowed the pace outside
throughout the turn, could not maintain position with a quarter mile to run and folded in the three path between foes at the furlong marker.
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN pressed the pace three wide between foes along the backside, came under a ride chasing the front two on by mid-turn, could not
go on and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DIAL A CLICHE watched the front duo after the break, pulled the rider to bid outside at the five eighths marker, moved in on the frontrunner outside midway
on the turn, bid for the lead by the quarter pole to poke her head in front between runners straightening out to the wire and gamely prevailed up front winning
in a tight photo at the finish line. SILENT PASSION pressed the pace at the start, was reined back on the rail at the five furlong marker to track the top two,
closed in around the turn inside, clipped the pacesetters heels nearing the quarter pole, stumbled momentarily, angled outside three wide for the drive
posing the main threat and battled down the stretch but could not get by the stubborn winner at the wire. IRON PYRITE under a tight rein assumed
command down the back straight, spurted away from the eventual winner at the half, maintained a short lead inside going around the bend, was collared
outside by the quarter pole, stayed on determinedly through the stretch but faded in the final seventy yards to hold for the show money. TAPROOM was
content to track this compact field along the backside, made no headway through the turn, shifted out for the drive but could not get into contention driving to
the finish line.

Footnotes
FLIP FLOPPIN FAST settled into stride off the leader, made a rapid advance on the turn sweeping to the lead coming to the quarter pole, drifted out a bit
leaving the turn, forged clear in mid-stretch and held safe. DADDY'S DAISY settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch,
rallied to get up for place late. DESTIN NIGHT was bumped lightly at the break, sped clear to dictate terms, was asked when challenged at the quarter pole,
had no extra for late stretch. TEXENSIS began to advance someone three to four wide on the turn, angled in two deep at the top of the stretch, rallied mildly
inside but missed place. DAISYCREST shifted in and steadily advanced inside up the backstretch, was guided out three wide past the five-sixteenths,
evened out. IMPECCABLE TIMING was off the pace two to three wide, moved nearer the rail for the stretch run, failed to rally. MADAM GWEN broke
outwardly lightly bumping a rival, chased from outside, dropped back was not a late threat. LOOKHOWPRETTY failed to threaten after saving ground.
VIRGINIA'S LEGACY chased briefly then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
GREYSTONE was content to track inside on the first bend, hounded the pace outside down the backstretch, turned up the pressure, moving in to bid at the
quarter pole outside, slugged it out with the determined early leader down the lane and began to edge away in deep stretch. PHANTOM JEWEL loped to the
lead, getting to the rail into the first turn, set the comfortable pace by a narrow margin down the backside, was collared outside at the quarter pole, fought
hard on the rail down the entire stretch but could not get up at the wire. CALUSA DONNIE stalked on the fence in the third flight in the early going, shifted
outside in the three path at the half, closed the gap smartly going around horses three wide on the far turn, had a chance if good enough in the four path
straightening out for home, could not threaten the top pair who were in a match race down the lane but did win the secondary battle for the show award.
KINGSCOTE broke out but was quickly straightened up to stalk in the third flight on the outside into the first turn, was allowed to settle trailing the compact
bunch down the back straight, rallied between foes at the quarter pole, shifted to the three path right behind the winner at the top of the lane and could not
get the best of the other rival dueling for the show award to the wire. GHOSTLY SPITFIRE tracked outside in the two path to start, settled alone in mid-pack
along the backside, was roused on the fence but was losing position on the final bend and emptied out inside at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
TOERIS stalked the early leader, advanced on that one to bid for the lead near the five-sixteenths, moved clear in upper stretch, was kept busy to the wire
and just lasted. SHE MAKES A POINT was quick to the lead, set the pace inside, was overtaken and switched outside the new leader at the top of the
stretch, kept on and came again but just missed. BEDAZZLE ME was lightly bumped at the break, settled off the pace, began to pick it up from between
runners at the quarter pole, came out four to five wide for the stretch run, gained steadily but slowly to be best of the rest. RED ELEANOR broke a bit
awkwardly and a step slowly, raced well back near the inside on the turn, came out in upper stretch, finished up well but needed more. DOMER ALLURE
was outpaced early racing at the back, saved ground on the turn, swung out leaving that bend, passed tired foes. WEEHAWKEN bumped a rival lightly at
the start, chased while saving ground inside mid-pack, asked to keep up at the five-sixteenths, failed to rally. ROYAL BLUSH chased close up from outside,
faded.

Footnotes
NOW YOU SEE ME patiently sat behind the front trio, rating kindly in the four path down the backstretch, pounced quickly four wide three furlongs from
home, gained control by the top pf the stretch and was kept to the task to win comfortably in the end. POWAQA had a nice spot tucked in behind horses
down the backstretch, waited to move, watching the embattled quartet three eighths from the finish line, was asked for more run midpoint on the turn and
shifted out with a good rally five wide turning for home, kept on coming to the wire but was second best on this day. MOTORIN' MAGGIE broke out on the
start, vied with rivals on either side down the backstretch, was no match for the top two who were separating themselves with five sixteenths to go and
showed grit to re-rally at the furlong marker to capture third place inside when crossing the line. SPEED LOADER settled in midfield in the early going, was
roused three wide in midturn, rallied, extended her stride six wide at the top of the lane and just missed surging late between foes for the show award at the
wire. HYPERYA veered out on the break, co-trailed on the outside with four furlongs left to run, showed little while seeing the field around the bend, angled
out widest in the six path for the drive to the wire and found her best stride late gaining on rivals in deep stretch. CALM COOL pressed three wide outside
foes down the backside, tried to match strides with the winner making a run outside three furlongs remaining, chased the leader in upper stretch but could
not find more late and yielded in the two path between horses at the sixteenth pole. CLASSIC GLORY co-trailed on the inside at the half, closed the gap
making a brief run at the quarter pole, was in the mix to be a fringe player behind the leader at the top of the lane but lacked a finish through the stretch.
SHES A DARLING was engaged on the rail for the lead down the back straight, could not go on with the outside rivals making a move midway on the turn
and backed away on the fence by upper stretch.

Footnotes
GUNNAWIN broke inwards on the break, settled between horses in mid-pack to begin, travelled outside rivals in the third flight down the backside, darted
through runners three furlongs out commencing a run, bid three wide by upper stretch, dueled outside down the lane and wore down the leader nearing the
wire for the score. IRON PRINCESS watched the frontrunner in the first turn, forced the pace between horses by the half, took over control outside three
furlongs out, opened up under a drive by the quarter pole, battled in the stretch inside but could not hold off the winner late. GHOSTLY PERFECTION
settled on the fence in midfield in the early stages, shifted out finding another gear three wide midway on the final bend, angled with momentum in the four
path at the top of the stretch and kept on trying to the wire to close in for the show money in the end. WILD QUEENIE was fractious prior to the start, in tight
on the break, had one foe beaten early who was the other poor starter, trailed down the back straight, began to smartly reach for more ground on the fence
in the far turn, shifted outside with run three wide at the quarter pole and finished with interest in the five path to capture a minor share at the wire. BRIT had
a poor start, bearing out and had to be steadied sharply, trailing by many passing the wire for the first turn, began to pick up rivals outside by the three
quarters marker, improved position four wide along the backside, stalked three wide in the third flight on the far turn, angled widest in the six path for the
drive, was one paced in the stretch but all things considered a solid try nonetheless. SILENT DIVA travelled on the fence in the third tier in the early parts on
the race, began to rally with the eventual winner on her outside three furlongs from the prize, fought on dueling for the show share in upper stretch but faded
at the furlong marker. LANEY GRACE tracked three wide outside rivals on the first turn, took closer order along the backside, prompted the pace three deep
at the half, was scrubbed on being passed by horses on the outside leaving the quarter pole and no little finish to offer down the lane. ZODIAC BEACH
stalked outside in midfield on the first turn, could not maintain forward position even though ridden between foes at the half, was urged for more
right-handed three eighths out but could not be presence in the stretch drive. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER settled three wide near the rear in the first turn,
closed the gap between foes in the three path at the five eighths marker, was hard ridden while last, three eighths from home and could only pass the early
pacesetter who was leg weary in deep stretch. SILENT PRINCESS broke out on the start, led this field travelling on the rail in the first turn, set the pace
while mildly pressed outside at the half, was collared outside three furlongs from the wire, offered no resistance and folded on the fence by mid-stretch.
