Footnotes
L'IMPERATOR (FR) settled tracking the front along the inside from mid pack, jumped well to maintain his position and ground throughout, came under
urging once clear of the final flight and chased the top pair through the final turn along the inside before tipping out three deep at the head of the stretch,
rallied to collar those rivals just outside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. RAMPOLDI PLAN coaxed just outside the first fence,
showed the way in hand along the inside under the watchful eye of ZIGGLE POPS in closer order, jumped well to keep his advantage under little pressure
until nearing fence seven, came under threat by that nearest foe and was headed at that station and bobbled when urged at that fence, widened away in
head to head combat gap dueling briefly through that fourth turn, took back the front straightened away into the backstretch the final time and cleared fence
eight well, came under urging and cleared the final flight, dug in dueling with ZIGGLE POPS through the final turn, got collared in tandem a furlong out by
the top one and fought on to the finish to preserve the place honors by a head. ZIGGLE POPS (GB) tracked the pace of the leader along the inside at times
in the pocket trip in closest aim but applying little pressure early on, began to intensify that pressure and tipped to the two path to tackle the leader at fence
seven, took narrow command and dueled through that turn before being headed once more into the backstretch nearing fence eight, came under urging at
the final flight, knocked heads through the final turn holding slim command, got collared in concert with his main foe by the top one just outside the eighth
pole, then battled on to the finish well clear for the show honors. JIMMY P settled tracking just off the pace along the inside, jumped well to maintain position
and came under urging at fence eight, went just off the inside through the final turn, kept on to the finish. AWAKENED four then three wide in pursuit from
near the rear, jumped early and struck fence three, came under urging at fence eight, tucked to the two path through the final turn and improved position in
the flat through the stretch. FREDDY FLINTSHIRE settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, jumped well until jumping late and was awkward over
fence eight, came under urging at the final flight and weakened in the flat. WEST NEWTON (GB) three wide in pursuit from mid pack, jumped well
throughout, tucked to the two path through the final two turns, tired in the flat and was eased home through the final furlong. GORDON'S JET (IRE) jumped
well saving ground near the tail of the field, tired in the flat, then got eased home through the stretch to the finish.

Footnotes
MO PLEX was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, drew off under a
drive until near the sixteenth-pole then was kept to task under a mild-hand ride while much the best. CHASING COLTON was hustled from the gate, chased
the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while able to secure the
place. OUT ON BAIL was bumped hard at the start and forced in, chased the pace, moved from the rail to the two path in the later part of the turn, pursued
the winner into upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. MAN FROM MALTA was hustled to the front, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied
in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the inside, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and weakened. VAMONOS VAMONOS was
bumped at the start and forced in, dropped well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to threaten. CLASSIC RUBY
bumped hard with an opponent at the start, was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and came up empty. SKY MASTERSON
broke in then was sluggish into stride along the rail, climbed some while dropping back early, fell well behind the rest of the field, leveled out and found his
best stride in the stretch but trailed.

had that rival apply pressure through the latter portion of the turn and remained on hold swinging four wide into upper stretch, got set down straightened
away, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in getting directed out to see the late pair threatening and held safe to prevail. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE coaxed
from the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, pressed through the latter portion of the turn and went five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish coming out a bit late and brushing RACING COLORS near the wire. RACING COLORS four wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. KRYSTALHEIR five paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked steadily to the inside near the seven-sixteenths placed to coaxing, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMITY

Footnotes
JUSTDENY was reserved while racing in the two to three path, came under encouragement while moving closer on the final turn, made a bid in the four
path into upper stretch, took a short lead outside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. PAST TENSE was reserved while inside to the
two path, came under urging on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch then moved out more and finished willingly to just get the place. QUEENS
FABLE (IRE) was reserved on the inside, moved to the two path under urging late on the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch, paused behind horses
inside the three-sixteenths pole then was roused, chased behind foes into the final sixteenth, found clear space in front late and also finished willingly but
just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. JITTERBUG stalked the pace on the outside while racing in the two path on the turns, was asked
on the final bend, battled between foes under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the trifecta. MIZOULA (IRE) went to the
front, showed the way on the inside, was given her cue on the final turn, fought on under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong
marker and tired. CAPO DONNA was well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the final turn, was asked in the two
path at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. JUST MARYANN was reserved in the two path, went two to three wide
under urging on the final turn and lacked the needed response. MALIBU'S DYNAMITE brushed the outside of the gate and broke near the back, went three
wide on the first turn, was reserved near the rear, traveled around the second turn in the two path, continued towards the rear, saved ground under urging
on the final turn and failed to rally. MS SEDONA brushed with a rival at the start then dropped back while slow into stride, lagged at the rear while inside to
the two path on the turns, came out into upper stretch and trailed.

five-sixteenths as that pressure grew into a threat, spun three then two wide into upper stretch displaced from command, ran on to chase the winner home
clear of the rest and along second best. FOXY CARA chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BROOKLYN DANTZ coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and

near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail.
LAUREL VALLEY grew a bit fractious in the gate and inspired the aforementioned foe to do the same, showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught in the final strides to the wire. EZ ROLL
broke out at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to secure the show honors. SLAPINTHEFACE coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside into the far turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. THETHRILLOFVICTORY chased along the inside under
coaxing from three furlongs out, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SONIC SPEED three wide through the first turn,
tucked briefly to the two path down the backstretch, got bumped by THE PADDOCK PASTOR outwards and had that rival pull on the bit eager inside and
was bumped again in the hind end and spun out at the nine-sixteenths, remained three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. GEM MINT TEN just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FINANCIAL DISTRICT settled just off the inside
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PROVISION chased
along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. THE
PADDOCK PASTOR pulled on the bit keen early on just off the inside between foes, settled a bit better behind the cover of SONIC SPEED down the
backstretch, had that rival tip out slightly and began pulling eager once losing the cover of that rival, bumped that foe once and then again soon after in the
hind end at the nine-sixteenths, continued just off the inside through the far turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and tired. SHINSUN hesitated at the start getting away a beat slower than the field, crossed directly to chase along the inside, came under coaxing tipped to
the two path at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered little.
