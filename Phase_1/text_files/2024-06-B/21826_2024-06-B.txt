Footnotes
STREET ROCKIN steadied on the first turn, then tracked close up on the inside, rallied two wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside of COUNTRY
CHARLIE in the final furlong and wore down that rival in the final yards to prevail. COUNTRY CHARLIE moved up entering the first turn, set the pace on the
inside, dug in gamely in the stretch run and yielded grudgingly nearing the finish. HENDRICKSON steadied on the first turn, settled off the pace inside and
rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. DIAMOND MESSA bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied
mildly outside. HOLLA AT YOUR BOY raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane, made a mild bid and was outkicked. LET IT RIDENESS
stalked two wide, chased between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BATTUTA D'ORO trailed on the inside and did not
factor. BALI ROLLING TIDE raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and faded. A Jockey Objection by
the rider of LET IT RIDENESS against the winner was dismissed.

ALEXA'S DREAM raced off the pace inside, moved up inside passing the furlong marker, commenced a late rally, closed well between rivals in deep stretch
and was up in time. PRINCIPIA rated the pace while racing in the two path, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused past the quarter pole,
dug in gamely in the stretch run and was caught late. CARROLL GIRL tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, closed late
outside and missed for second. BROWN SUGA BABE raced off the pace inside, then between rivals, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane
and gained mildly outside. DIVINE EXCHANGE raced three wide early, stalked outside, chased on the far turn and weakened. MAKEMEBELIEVE raced
three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
MURUMBI stalked the pace from the inside, rail bid leaving the three eighths pole, held on through deep stretch under a drive. NURSE RACHETT pace
setter from the three path down the backside, lost the lead to inside rival leaving the far turn, fought on through the final furlong, held on for second. SHE SO
COOL raced off the pace and along the inside, bid along the rail from the eight pole, finished willingly inside. PARTY MONSTER tracked from off the pace
and off the rail, shifted out widest through the stretch, was out kicked to the wire. LUCKY LORRAINE slow into stride, raced towards the rear of the field into
the far turn, called upon leaving the three eighths pole, never threatened. LIL ANNIE ROSE saved ground around the first turn, shifted out between runners
when under urging nearing the quarter pole, no late gain. DIA DE SOL tracked the pace from the three path, in range outside the leader leaving the quarter
pole, gave way through the stretch.
