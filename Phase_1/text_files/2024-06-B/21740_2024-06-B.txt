CLASS CODE stalked the leader while saving ground through the stretch the first time, continued to save ground through the second turn to gain a tracking
trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and quickly drew clear to prove
best. WANDALITA away well and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, gained a tracking trip three wide
in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. HOAX
rushed up to take the lead entering the first turn while dropping to the rail, continued to set the pace through the second turn and in the run down the
backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and had little left for the drive. LUCY TREASURE away alertly and
stalked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, dropped back to trail a compact field in the run down the backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the lane while unable to mount a serious late bid. NO PEOPLE broke sharply and
tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained her position into the backstretch, but dropped back while
weakening entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

LUCKY COWBOY away well, and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to get up in time.
ASKMENOQUESTIONS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into
the final turn, held the narrowest of leads into the lane, and just failed to last. DON W broke sharply and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive in an even effort. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT stalked the early pace while saving ground at
the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to
mount a serious late bid. CHAMPIOSA stalked the leader in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. CRYPTO MUNNY unhurried early while trailing the field into the backside, rallied one out
from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact.

Footnotes
FAMILY BIZ settled at the back of the field while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued with a ground saving trip through the
second turn, launched a four wide bid entering the final turn, and closed with a rush three wide in the lane to be up in time. FORT LANGLEY away well, and
stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn and quickly opened up a clear advantage and just failed to last. MY COLLEGE FUND settled off the battling
leaders while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backside, rallied two out from the
rail entering the final turn, finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. DEPUTY'S DANCER stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch
the first time, maintained a striking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest seven wide in
the drive. SOMTHING ELUSIVE away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the
backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more in the drive. DYNAMITER broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of Y
VEE R through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong. Y VEE R vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside from the inside of
DYNAMITER, was unable to keep tabs on that rival approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. BROOKYS TAPIT was squeezed in the
early going and settled well off the early pace in the run to the first turn, trailed the field in the run down the backstretch and failed to respond when called
upon. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of SOMTHING ELUSIVE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of
FORT LANGLEY for alleged interference on the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of
finish

Footnotes
ENGLISH BAY TEDDY broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of BABY GRAND entering the backstretch, took a narrow advantage from the
outside of that rival entering the final turn, and inside clear late while holding off a late surge by EYE BE SEEING YOU. EYE BE SEEING YOU away well
and stalked the battling leaders two wide into the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for
the place. BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail in the run to the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ENGLISH
BAY TEDDY in the run down the backstretch and through final turn, and fought on bravely from along the rail in the drive but was outfinished late. SELF
SERVING settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn,
and finished full of run late while gaining three wide in deep stretch. RING OF KERRY settled off the contested early pace while racing two wide in the run
down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. MORETHANSOULTITLE tracked the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
but was outfinished in the late going. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to menace.
ANOTHER GUINNESS stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while steadying off heels in the run to the first turn, continued to save ground
into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

BUTTONWOOD TREE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to control the pace I the run down
the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished gamely from along the rail in the drive to keep a stubborn NEIGHBOR safely at bay.
NEIGHBOR broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the pacesetter in
the run down the backstretch and into the final turn while mounting a two wide bid, and finished willingly one out from the rail to prove clearly second best.
STAY FANTASTIC stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but finished evenly from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. BROKE AN BROKEN settled off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the
drive to just miss the show position. WISELY PLAYED away well and stalked the early pace while being hung three wide through the lane the first time,
continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and was unable to muster a late bid while finishing three wide in the drive.
ROOKIE YEAR unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, bided his time at the back of the pack in
the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. SLOOP
JOHN B settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

FRANKIE MACHINE lagged well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, picked his way between rivals in the
run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and close determinedly four wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. PADDY
D'ORO away well and was allowed to settle off the early speed while racing just out from the rail through the stretch the first time, held a tracking trip two
wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, angled to the rail leaving the turn to assume command entering the lane, and just failed to last.
READY HERO settled off the early pace while racing two wide through the lane the first time, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn,
took up sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail leaving the turn, and closed with determination one out from the rail in deep stretch to just miss the
place. GOOD BYE PUTIN lagged well back early while saving ground along the inside through the stretch the first time, launched his bid three wide entering
the final turn, lost a bit of momentum leaving the turn, when a rival drifted into his path, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. JOCK TALK
settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the lane the first time, commenced his bid six wide entering the final turn, and improved
his position late while finishing five out from the rail in the drive. COUNTRY COWBOY away alertly and stalked the early pace from along the inside through
the stretch the first time, mounted a strong three wide bid leaving the final turn to loom a danger, but hung in the stretch drive. YOU DON'T OWN ME
tracked the leader three wide entering the stretch the first time before racing to the lead from along the rail entering the second turn, set a pressured pace in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished late. BARNEY GOOGLE hit the side of the gate at the start to get away poorly, and
trailed the field into the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive, but was
unable to overcome his early trouble. VALUE MAX raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, before surrendering the lead
passing the wire the first time, engaged from the outside of YOU DON'T OWN ME to force the issue in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn,
drifted out entering the lane, causing GOOD BYE PUTIN to alter course, and weakened in the drive. DEALERS HAND broke sharply and tracked the leader
three wide into the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside, struggled to keep pace nearing the final turn, and weakened
over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry, as well as a jockey's claim of foul. The stewards inquiry was into
the start of the race. The jockey's claim of foul was the rider of READY HERO lodging a claim of foul against the rider of PADDY D'ORO for alleged
interference leaving the final turn. After review, the stewards deemed all horses received a fair start, but in regards to the jockey's claim of foul, that was
upheld, and PADDY D'ORO was disqualified from second and placed third.
