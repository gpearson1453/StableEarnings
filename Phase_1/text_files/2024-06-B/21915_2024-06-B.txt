Footnotes
TIGERS 'N BEARS was reserved down the backstretch towards the rear and along the rail, was encouraged at the top of the turn came out threee wide and
was steadily gaining on the leader down the lane and was up at the wire to prevail. BUBBA'S RECKLESS was brushed at the start, then established the
pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the turn while never being threatened, then almost lasted down the lane but was caught at the wire. WINGS
FOR ENO raced along the inside between the fields of rivals, then fanned out four wide leaving the bend to rally bid but it was not enough. POSEIDONS
WAVE was unhurried early, then rallied bid while two wide on the turn, came out four wide in the upper stretch and kept on while in a mild drive to no
success. MY FAVORITE SONG was brushed at the start, then tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch and throughout their turn while maintaining
second position, then lacked the needed response in the lane and gave way. TEXAS GOLD RUSH was no factor.

Footnotes
NEXT REVOLT angle inwards to lead the way into the first turn, established the pace down the backstretch, was in a steady drive on the far turn while being
pressed by an outer foe, set down in the upper stretch and drew clear in the final yards to prevail wire to wire. MYSTERY MO tracked the pace from the
inside while being well rated down the backstretch, came under coaxing leaving the far bend, rallied bid to gain second position in the late stretch, could not
catch the leader and held the place prize. NAUTICAL MOON pursued the pace while two wide and between rivals in the early stages, then rallied bid on the
far turn and kept on down the lane while in a mild drive to get up for the show winnings. MALIBU S S stalked the leader from the two path into the first turn
and down the backstretch, moved up to press on the far turn, then was asked at the quarter pole in attempt to take over the lead, lacked the overcoming bid
and gave way. GREATHEART chased the pace down the backstretch and between rivals, then rallied gamely on the far turn and into the stretch but lacked
the needed response. CATDADDY chased the pace while four wide and outside of rivals in the early furlongs, was in a hard drive leaving the backstretch,
was used up on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch.

NEUTRALIZE battled with two outer counterparts early, continued to duel with BALI GIRLEE on the turn, while being pressed by LET HER BUCK, assumed
command in the upper stretch, then held on determinedly to prove best. LET HER BUCK vied for the lead while three wide, continued to press the leading
pair throughout the turn, dug in gamely in the upper stretch, gained second position but could not catch the cleared NEUTRALIZE and was second best.
COURAGEOUS CAPPEN broke outwardly and bumped foe, was reserved between rival in the back trio, then rallied bid on the turn, angled out five wide in
the upper stretch and kept on to get up for the show position. SPEAK SOFTLY chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn, bid in
the upper stretch to no avail and gave way. IZE A BLAST was allowed to settle along the rail with the trailing trio, then rallied mild bid on the turn and never
threatened in the stretch. BALI GIRLEE was bumped at the start, then vied for the lead between rivals, continued to duel with an inner foe on the turn, was
used up and tired in the stretch. FELLA'S SISTER settled back in the rear trio while three wide, then bid on the turn and was no menace.

Footnotes
CATAMOUNT showed the way while three wide, angled in to maintain command throughout the turn from the inside, then drew off in the stretch while in a
strong drive to prove best. THE CHALK was unprepared at the start, was hustled at the rear while three wide, was steadily gaining leaving the turn while in a
gamely bid and was able to get up for the place prize besting the rest of the field. BOOZEINTHEBLENDER pressed the pace from the inside into the turn,
was under steady coaxing while continuing press the leader from the two path, rallied in the upper stretch, lacked the winning bid and gave way while
drifting out and missed the place prize. BROOKLYN ALLEY CAT hit gate at the start, was unhurried early, then bid while two wide on the turn, drifted
outward in the upper stretch then kept on while in a mild drive to no avail. MULTIPLE OPINIONS tucked along the inside towards the rear and never
threatened. KENTUCKY DREAMIN broke slightly inward, then stalked the pace from the inside while maintaining third position into the turn, lacked rallying
in the stretch and gave way. CHEROKEE SUNRISE reared up prior to the start, then lunged out of the gate and had no chance.

Footnotes
WEC KEAH emerged from the field to establish the front, maintained the pace while in an easy hand ride throughout the turn, set down in the upper stretch
to draw clear and last to the wire and prevail. RUBIA chased the pace while three to four wide early, moved up to the two path and remained well rated on
the turn, rallied bid in the early stretch and was improving and was up for the place winnings. CHANGE IT UP was reserved early along the inside towards
the back, came out two wide leaving the bend and closed belatedly down the lane just missing the place position. CANTHANDLETHEGHOST was
unhurried early, then rallied bid on the turn from the inside then closed well down the lane while passing outer rivals. STACY'S RARE FIND pressed the
pace from the two path into the turn, was in a long drive heading into the stretch, could not over power the leader while rallying bid and gave way. SO
JACKSANN chased the pace from the inside, was in a mild drive throughout the turn, bid in the upper stretch and lacked the needed response. COUNTY
SLUGGER chased the pace while two wide and between rivals, then flattened out heading into the turn and had no final bid. WARRIOR'S RETURN chased
the pace briefly while three wide, then dropped back heading into the turn and did not rally in the stretch. NEW WEST was no factor.

Footnotes
RELEASE MCCRAKEN veered outwardly, was reserved towards the back early, came out six wide leaving the bend, found the best stride to edge past the
field and duel with an outer foe in the late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. MIDNIGHT PRANKS saved ground while at the tail of the field, then
swung seven wide, dug in gamely to surpass the field and spar with RELEASE MCCRAKEN in the final sixteenth and hung at the wire. SUMMER IN
MALIBU pressed the pace while four wide into the turn, rallied bid at the quarter pole to vie while five wide in the early stretch, was out finished by outer foes
and held onto the show place. RUGGS pressed the pace from the inside, then inched up to go shoulder to shoulder with the pacesetter, was met with more
outer rivals then vie gamely in the upper stretch while two wide then gave way. SPEIGHT AND MALICE was bumped at the start, then laid off the pace
while three to four wide, moved along the rail to urge steadily on the turn, bid in the upper stretch to contend for the lead and lacked the needed response.
WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) set the pace from the two path and while being pressured from both sides, dueled briefly with an inner foe on the turn, was
challenged by outer counterparts at the top of the stretch to battle while three deep, was used up and gave way. EMPERADOR pressed the pace while
three wide, was encouraged on the turn to vie between rivals in the upper stretch, could not retain bid and gave way. IT MAKES SENSE broke inwardly and
bumped foe then chased the pace while four wide at a moderate pace throughout the early furlongs, came out five wide in the upper stretch, rallied bid but
did not spark.

Footnotes
SUPERCENTS led the way from the inside into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, maintained a steady hand ride while being pressed by an
outer foe on the far turn, responded well to left handed encouragement leaving the bend and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best. SUMMEROSA
was allowed to settle while two wide in the back trio in the early furlongs, was advancing on the far turn while three wide, rallied bid in the early stretch,
gained second position in the final sixteenth but did not have enough to catch the cleared leader. KOLKATA pressed the pace from the two path down the
backstretch, continued to stalk the leader from the inside throughout the turn while in third position, rallied a mild bid in the early stretch and was able to
retain the show winnings in the end. MISCHIEF ANGEL pressed the pace while three wide in the early stages, let up to stalk the leader into the far turn, was
roused at the top of the bend to contest for the lead briefly, could not overpower the leader and flattened out in the late stretch. CAT TALE SKY was allowed
to settle at the back along the rail, rallied a mild bid leaving the far bend and never threatened. TEXAS TWINKIES raced mid pack along the rail in the early
furlongs, was urging on the far turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. POETIC UNION was hindered at the start, was unhurried early and failed to rally.
HAILEY'S JEWEL broke outwardly, then raced mid pack while two wide down the backstretch, faded on the far turn and was no menace.

Footnotes
PRODIGIOUS BAY set the pace from the inside early, was challenged by an outer foe leaving the first half, inched away from said foe to assume command
on the far turn, then drew clear in the late stretch to prevail in hand. GO SPEED RACER GO stalked the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive on the
far turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch was no match for the leader and held the place position. R DOC laid off the pace while four wide in the early stages,
came under coaxing leaving the far turn while two wide, rallied a mild bid in the early stretch, could never catch the leader and was up for third place.
TRULY DANZIG raced while three wide towards the rear, came under coaxing heading into the far turn while two wide, rallied a mild bid in the upper stretch
but it was not enough. VARSITY drifted out and bumped foe, was allowed to settle towards the back while two wide, rallied a mild bid two to three wide on
the far turn and never threatened . MANOR BORN was in tight on the first turn, regained stride to bid between rivals leaving the five furlong marker,
contended with the pace setter briefly from the two path before pressing on the far turn in a strong drive, then flattened out in the late stretch. FEDERAL
HILL never threatened. WITT'S TAQUITO raced from the inside mid pack at an even pace throughout the first three quarters and did not fire in the home
stretch . WIN WORTHY was off very slowly and was no factor. GLENDALE was bumped and no menace. BLUE BOON raced while three wide into the first
turn, steadied in the late backstretch, regained stride and was in a mild drive, then pulled up on the far turn, did not finish and was vanned off.
