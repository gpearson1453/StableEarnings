Footnotes
JOLIE RULER stalked the pacesetter through the turn, rallied three wide turning for home and closed well to be going away late. SWEET CRYSTAL sped
away from the field early to open a clear advantage, maintained that lead to mid-stretch and could not last while clearly second best. LOONA LUV unhurried
in the early going to trail, commenced a steady advance on the turn and found best stride late to be along for the show with late interest. SHEZA HOOT
went evenly without posing a threat. LUNARCHY stumbed a step out of the gate, recovered stride to rush up into contention and flattened out in the lane.
RARE ACTION ATTACK was not a factor.

CAIRO SUMMER stalked the pace down the backside, rallied four wide on the final turn to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and cleared off late.
EMITYAAZ prompted the pace to the final bend, ralied from two wide between rivals to challenge for the lead turning for home, took a brief lead in the
stretch and was out-finished in the drive. DIXIE LOVING slow in the early going to be the trailer, made up ground on the far turn while saving ground and
rallied mildly in the lane. MAIDEN ROCK reserved off the pace down the backside and passed tiring rivals while going evenly. JOCELYN set a pressured
pace to upper stretch and gave way in mid-stretch. ZENCHUA SKY tracked the leaders for a half mile and lacked a response when called upon tiring in the
lane.

EYE ON RY set the pace on a well rated, clear lead, responded when called upon turning for home and went unchallenged a convincing winner in a well
handled ride. TOUGH LITTLE NUT reserved off the pace along the fence down the backside and found best stride in the lane to rally up the rail to be
second best. STORM'S REFLECTION well placed stalking the pacesetters through the far turn, cut the corner turning for home, drifted out in upper stretch
and finished willingly to be best of the rest. C'EST MAGNIFIQUE prompted the winner down the backside, chased that one in the final bend and lacked a
closing kick. SENDERO tracked the leaders from two wide to the quarter pole and had no response when called upon. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) raced wide
through the first turn, settled at the rear of the field and was never a threat. DAPPER DUDE went one-paced and was not a factor. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

DREAM NAP pressed the pace from two wide to midway on the turn, assumed command nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and
finished convincingly without threat. REBA ATTACK tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied three wide splitting rivals in upper stretch, was held up
midway down the lane while searching for racing room, angled in off the winners heels and surged late to gain the place. RUMBRANDT reserved off the
early pace, rallied five wide on the turn to loom in upper stretch and kept-on willingly through the lane. DEVIL well placed stalking the pace from the fence
through the turn and rallied up the rail in the lane just missing the show. BOYCE'S BANDITA flashed speed to set the early pace, came under pressure on
the turn and was empty when turning for home. COWGIRL FRANKIE dwelt at the start and lost all chance. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

KATIE M'LADY reluctant to load, broke alertly, opened a clear advantage on a well rated pace, continued on a well measured lead to midway on the far
turn, repelled the challenge of the runner-up turning for home and widened in the lane while kept to task. OEUVRE stalked the pacesetter throughout, made
a threatening bid nearing the quarter pole, was easily repelled and continued on through the lane to just hold the place. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD tracked the
pace to the head of the stretch and rallied well up the rail through the lane to just miss the place in a good effort. JOURNEYIST was well placed within
striking distance of the top pair and lacked a closing kick when called upon finishing evenly. WHITE LIES failed to menace. KINGSBURY DREAM trailed
throughout as a non-factor.

convincingly. SAND MOUNTAIN tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied from four wide turning for home and finished willingly as second best.
BASEBALL POLITICS unhurried early and rallied well belatedly in the lane to gain the show. MCVICKER pressed the pace from three wide to the top of the

Footnotes
RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM broke alertly, settled in hand to be mid-pack, rallied on the turn from four wide, was steered to angle in at the quarter pole when
the pacesetter drifted out in a well handled ride to find a clear path and close best of all to prevail. BLACK RUSSIAN reserved off the pace along the rail to
the turn, angled to the clear in upper stretch and surged late to gain the place. LEGENDARY PHANTOM prompted the pace to the turn, rallied to take
command at the quarter pole, kept-on through the lane and was out-finished late in the drive. ALL ABOUT TONITE pressed the pace from three wide
through the turn, was carried out by the tiring pacesetter turning for home and finished evenly through the lane. WILLIE BIRD brushed by inside rival leaving
the gate, tracked the pace into the turn and lacked a closing bid. RED RIZZLER trailed to the top of the lane, circled wide and showed some late interest.
LUCKY PAL set a pressured pace through the turn, lugged out turning for home carrying rival with him while tiring. UNCLE CHUCKLE raced misdpack and
lacked a closing response fading through the stretch. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO MALFUNCTION. Winning numbers for Place Pick 8 are
2/4/5-1/4-4/5-1/2/5/9-4/6/7-2/5-1/7-4/9.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONER GULCH stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, rallied on the bend to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and pulled clear
inside the final sixteenth. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN set a pressured pace for three-quarters, dug-in to take command in upper stretch and kept-on gamely
while unable to hold off the winner. CALISUE tracked the leaders from the rail through the final bend, angled out in upper stretch and made a late gain to be
closing in deep stretch. FOURFIFTYSEVEN unhurried to be near the rear of the field to the far turn and made a belated mild bid through the lane. MO
SMOKING prompted the pace for five-eighths, rallied to take a brief lead nearing the quarter pole and weakened through the stretch run. JULYNNE was not
a threat. SIGNATURE STREET well placed racing in contention down the backside and faded coming home.

Footnotes
WANDA STRONG set the pace on a well rated, well measured lead to the top of the lane, responded when called upon and dug-in through the drive to hold
sway in a well handled ride. R KATIEBUG stalked the winner throuhgout, rallied down the lane willingly but was unable to reel in the winner.
GRACELEADSUSHOME tracked the leaders the entire trip and finished evenly unable to gain on the top pair. STEPHANIE'S CHARM reserved off the pace
to the backstretch, made a four wide move up the backstretch to gain a striking position and failed to sustain the bid. EMPIRICAL VIEW unhurried early to
be near the rear of the field and passed weaker rivals down the lane without impact. VISIONISTA failed to menace. I'M BOX OFFICE stumbled at the start
to be at the back of the pack while pulling against restraint down the lane the first time, settled on the turn and showed no interest after the bad start.
SENSE OF SELF was well palced along the rail for the first half mile, lost position headed to the turn, was in tight entering the turn dropping back and came
up empty from there.
