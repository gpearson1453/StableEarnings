Footnotes
GOLD OAK overcame a solid bump at the break to soon gain the lead between horses, moved clear, took the rail into the bend, was roused on the turn then
maintained full control under urging through the stretch. TU ROYAL advanced three wide on the turn, dueled for second in the lane, drifted out under
left-handed pressure inside the last furlong, was corrected, moved clear for the place and held her position. SCRAPPY PATCH chased from just off the
inside, came three wide into the lane, angled out widest upper stretch, altered out as TU ROYAL came out inside the final furlong, could not get past that
one in the late going but was clearly best of the others. DRAGONFLY KISSES well placed from inside, began to gradually yield before finishing a half mile.
STARSOVERPARADISE broke inward, bumping solidly with GOLD OAK, pressed that one from just outside then wore down the last eighth.

Footnotes
WICKED GUS settled toward the outside, commenced his bid after a half mile, took over three wide on the second bend then drew off as much the best
through the lane. ZEE FIRE hesitated at the start, gradually advanced between horses to gain a striking position just off the rail on the second turn, angled
out some leaving that bend, moved clear for second upper stretch, was no match for WICKED GUS but proved easily best of the rest. SOLOMON VANDY
soon trailed, moved to the outside early on, was widest taking the second turn, lodged a mild bid and got up for third late. GONE AGAIN shared the early
lead from inside, could not stay with WICKED GUS leaving the second bend and gradually wore down for the drive. BRAHMS JR. raced just outside GONE
AGAIN from the early going and also weakened through the lane. DANCIN' MOLLY was hustled to race in the second flight from inside for a half mile, gave
way, distanced himself through the stretch and was walked off.

DEVIL'S RULE rated on the front end between horses, was two wide on the second turn, moved clear when asked leaving that bend then steadily
lengthened command under urging through the lane. LASTFORTINOFAMILY prominent just outside DEVIL'S RULE, took over second three wide upper
stretch then could only hold his position late. KEEN RESPONSE settled outside, picked up his pace after a half mile, lost ground widest taking the second
turn and passed outside tired ones in the lane to move clear for third late. CHARM THE LADIES raced in contention between rivals, threatened two wide on
the second bend, fanned out to path four into the stretch then leveled off. ARGYBARGY BUCK vied for the lead inside rivals for six furlongs then began to
yield just off the rail the last two furlongs. WARNING LABEL forwardly placed from inside, found himself boxed in upper stretch, his rider lost his crop shortly
after entering the final furlong, gained a clear path from inside shortly after that but lacked a rally. COPPER CROSSING chased just off the inside, angled to
the outside upper stretch and steadily gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

BLAME TERI forwardly placed outside, went for the lead two wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. CANTOO
raced in contention from paths two or three from the beginning, rallied belatedly between rivals inside the last furlong but edged ahead for the place with a
sixteenth left. GHAALEB'S CITY inattentive in the gate, broke somewhat awkwardly from the gate, advanced from inside, angled out through the bend,
moved ahead to gain second four wide upper stretch then finished evenly. WILDWOOD POSSE chased from just off the rail, closed the gap from inside on
the turn, gradually angled to the outside upper stretch and made up minor ground the last furlong. FREE LOVE took the early lead from inside, was
overtaken midway on the bend then faded for the drive. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC was a step slow at the start, taken out widest early on and showed little. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TAPIT SAM stalked the early speed from just off the inside, angled out three wide into the bend, was let out, moved clear upper stretch then widened
command under a mild drive the last eighth. CRANKSHAFT soon had a clear lead, saved ground taking the turn, was overtaken upper stretch, began to
wear down in the late going but lasted for the place. MODAZZLE hesitated then appeared to have brief trouble getting his footing leaving the gate, was
settled outside, lost ground four then five wide through the turn but showed a willingness to run late. PEACOCK MAN chased in midpack between rivals,
advanced along the rail on the bend, came off the inside some for the stretch run, moved clear for third, had a striking position with a furlong to go but
leveled off instead. AVENGING WARRIOR soon trailed, had the rail on the turn, began to fan out leaving the bend, lost ground moving out seven wide at
the top of the lane but showed late interest. STOSH chased from well off the inside, was widest through the turn then failed to have a significant stretch bid.
NOT AGAIN JACKIE chased from midpack while toward the outside, progressed three wide on the bend then flattened for the drive. WINDIGO SPIRIT
chased from off the rail then faded from inside on the turn. READY MADE prominent from inside, angled outside CRANKSHAFT nearing the turn and gave
way just off the rail the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
EMPTY HOLSTER rated from inside, picked up his pace on the bend, altered out four wide upper stretch for a clear path and got up in the waning yards.
ON THE MONEY RED gradually progressed three wide to gain the advantage upper stretch, never gained a clear lead and lugged in under right-handed
pressure nearing the wire. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC took a clear lead from inside on the backstretch but did not have enough left for the stretch run. HIGHLY
PERFECT without early speed, was two then three wide taking the bend, rallied between horses in the lane, lost his path to ON THE MONEY RED deep
stretch and had to alter out nearing the wire. AFTER MY BROTHER prominent just outside FAST CROSS TRAFFIC, went for the lead leaving the turn and
also lacked the extra needed in the late going. MAMAS FIRE lost ground widest through the turn but showed a willingness to run the last furlong. J J'S
SOLUTION stumbled at the break, stayed well off the inside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA MOON crowded leaving the chute, progressed between horses on the backstretch, split rivals two wide in a swift move to gain the lead on the
turn then steadily drew away as much the best in the stretch. JUSTICEONEMORETIME forwardly placed just off the rail on the backstretch, did not keep up
three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, took over second deep stretch and began to draw off nearing the wire. INSIDE THE CIRCLE bumped
with BRUCE ATTACK at the start, set a pressured pace between rivals, moved clear and took the rail nearing the turn, was overtaken midway on the bend,
no match for MINNESOTA MOON when set down for the drive and began to wear down in the late going. ANUNKA prominent from outside on the
backstretch, retreated widest on the turn then only passed tired ones the last eighth. BRUCE ATTACK bumped with INSIDE THE CIRCLE at the break, was
forced inward, recovered well to press the pace from just off the inside but began to fade two wide before finishing a half mile. TOWN CRIER helped press
the early speed from between horses, was three wide taking the bend, began to yield leaving the turn, his rider lost her crop upper stretch and he continued
to fade. MOCOWBELL was a contender from inside for two furlongs then began to fade. CHARTED began taking bad steps nearing the end of the first
eighth, was pulled up and walked off.
