Footnotes
MODAROSA set the pace on the inside, shook clear and drew off through the turn, then increased her margin in the lane and was kept to the task. FLEUR
DELACOUR well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then was no threat to the winner,
while clearly best of the rest. SHEZ UNTAPPABLE mid pack, moved up three wide angling in through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch
and flattened the final furlong. REIGERT GIRLS allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then lost some
ground while holding a share. HOPE SHE COMES tracked the pace back, lost some ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch
and improved her position. SHE'S GOT RHYTHM ran evenly for a half and had no rally. R PENELOPE led in the early going, stalked the leader to the turn,
then faded. SISTER EVE was never involved.

Footnotes
PRETTY FLATTERING mid pack and inside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and drove clear late. ELSA'S ROCKET mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out widest
late and edged up for the place in the final strides. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through on the two path into the
stretch, angled out and lacked the needed kick to hold the place. STARSHIP MACYS set the pace on the inside, drew off down the backstretch and through
the second turn, then weakened in the final yards and held a share. ENCHANTED MELODY tracked the pace well back, moved up on the two path through
the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. LIGHTNING ROUND allowed to settle, looped three wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. SWITCHRATTLENROLL was never involved. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC well placed and
outside, faded through the second turn.
