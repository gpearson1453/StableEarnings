GOLD BUCKLE raced five wide entering the first turn, angled in to save ground, raced three path on the far turn, was blocked at the quarter pole, then bid
late in the three path and was clear under a strong hand ride. LOADEMUPJUSTICE pressed the pace outside of the leader, then couldn't hold off the closer.
VICTOR'S DEAL stalked the pace in the five path and bid belatedly. RANDELLO stalked the pace inside, was bumped in early stretch and gave way. I WILL
STAND led inside and gave way at the eighth pole. GHOST BIKE stalked the pace in the four path and gave way late. JOB SECURITY was bumped at the
start, then was not a factor. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

path at the quarter pole but couldn't close in the final yards. MIDNIGHT TIL DAWN saved ground to no avail. ELM STREET was clear early, dueled inside
and gave way at the eighth pole. LOLAS BEAU raced well back, bid 5p1/4, but faltered. LET IT RIDE CLYDE raced well back inside with no bid.
WEGOTJACKSBACK raced evenly. HILTON HEAD stalked the pace between rivals and faded in the stretch. BOXSTER stalked the early pace inside and

three path, dueled, then couldn't hold off the closers. MENDEE vied between rivals and gave way at the five-sixteenths pole. PHRASE was through early.
