settled while saving ground, crept closer leaving the five sixteenths, responded when given her cue into the lane, forged through along the rail to take over a
furlong out, spurted clear near the sixteenth pole then held firm under steady handling. MAVILUS drifted in at the break bumping SOCIAL LADY, corrected
and edged up into the backstretch to stalk about two wide, gained three wide past the three eighths, was under a ride chasing the leaders past the five
sixteenths, shifted out five wide and made a grinding run to gain the place. ALWAYS LAUGHING hopped outward at the break and was away last, corrected
and pulled her way three deep to contention, dropped in after clearing into the backstretch, set a rated pace while saving ground, took pressure from the
three eighths, dueled then drifted out a path allowing the winner room into the lane, fought on past mid stretch then faded late. SOCIAL LADY , bumped
from both sides at the break then was pinched back, eased back off of a rival soon into the backstretch, lost ground three to four wide when moving up past
the three and a half furlong marker, was under a hearty ride pursuing into the stretch then churned on. PEYTON ELIZABETH , bumped at the break, vied
between foes into the first turn, prompted the pace outside ALWAYS LAUGHING through the backstretch and into the far turn, applied more pressure soon
after, sparred in the three path into the lane, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
MAJOR HOULIHAN broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and edged up early and stalked the pace, moved up to engage the leader from her
outside entering the far turn, dueled, shook clear when roused into the lane, opened up a bit past the three sixteenths, kept on under strong handling and
dug in late to deny BELIEVE IN FREEDOM. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM , taken to rate while saving ground, took closer order into the far turn, sat patiently then
eased out to work between runners into the stretch, emerged as the closest pursuer in mid stretch, continued on willingly but was kept at bay. MARY
KATHERINE , taken to rate three wide, picked things up under a ride outside rivals past the five sixteenths, shifted out five wide and closed steadily.
FIVECOMMATWO , three to four wide early, secured the inside through the backstretch and moved up to the inside of rivals nearing the far turn, steadied
briefly then took up sharply when in tight approaching the five sixteenths, regrouped to saved some ground into the stretch, worked outward through the final
furlong and came back on. ROMANTIC STORY , between runners into the first turn, advanced three wide into the far turn, gave hard chase three deep past
the five sixteenths, came four wide four the drive but was empty through the final furlong. SATISFIED , bumped at the break, raced between runners
through the backstretch, gained to have aim leaving the far turn, pursued to mid stretch then flattened out. LA TACHE , bumped and pinched back at the
break, regrouped and found herself far back, swung out very wide for the drive and had belated action. BOSSY BOOTS , two wide between foes into the far
turn, chased to the inside of rivals past the five sixteenths, eased out in the lane but lacked a solid finish. FUNZALO settled in the clear, altered outward
when FIVECOMMATWO checked sharply near the five sixteenths, regrouped to chase but lacked a bid. ARROGATES DREAM sped clear early, set the
pace inside, was joined into the far turn, battled inside the winner to the quarter pole then weakened through the lane. FLINNY TIN TIN , three wide between
foes nearing the far turn, weakened.

BAY STREET , three wide down the backstretch chasing the pace, put her head in front near the three eighths pole, remained well off the inner rail and
gradually edged away while kept to her business in the drive. DAZZY showed speed inside the winner and game chased that one through the stretch.
THENCOMEMORNING , four wide into the turn, lacked the needed rally in an even effort. KILO ROAD , shuffled back along the inner rail leaving the
backstretch, weakened in the stretch while on her left lead. HONOR THE TRUTH outrun, saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch
and passed tired horses. RIBBONSINHERHAIR , outrun, swung wide turning for home. SOCIETY BALL , between horses around the turn, gave way and
drifted out near the sixteenth pole.

SWEETERTHANWHISKEY settled off the rail, responded when given her cue and commenced a run mid turn, boldly ranged up five wide soon into the lane,
forged clear a furlong out, kept on under repeated right handed asks and held sway. ANGEL ART , taken to rate early on, dropped in and was patiently
handled around the turn and into the lane, eased out leaving the three sixteenths to work between rivals, finished with good energy and earned the place.
TOUISSET took control soon after the break, set a rated pace off the inside, came under a ride leaving the three sixteenths, failed to contain the winner but
kept on with good effort through the final furlong. CHICKAHOMINY rated off the pace while saving ground, eased out and edged up a bit between runners
mid turn, swung out five to six wide in upper stretch and steadily gained. CLOUDS OF WHITE broke a step slow, recovered and moved up near the half
then dropped in, eased back out to gain between runners into the stretch, chased to mid stretch then faded. SULTRY SALLY H had speed then rated back
off the leader while saving ground, steadied briefly into the turn, regrouped to remain a presence to about mid stretch then faded. DETERMINED SAIL

TOUPIE , away well, relaxed four wide tracking the leaders, lugged in despite left handed asks while advancing on her left lead past the three sixteenths,
switched over to her correct lead when taking over a furlong out, eagerly spurted away then held firm while kept to task. PAROLA SICURA rated close up
while saving ground, eased out for room and exchanged contact with SHUANGXI (IRE) near mid stretch, kept on willingly and saved the place. CAP
CLASSIQUE drafted well back off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and into the lane, came off the inside and moved up between runners
leaving mid stretch, worked further out in the course for the final sixteenth and closed strongly. DISCREET OPS edged up early and gained a stalking spot
inside foes, eased out and gained nearing mid stretch, had a seam close up then shifted back in a bit nearing the sixteenth marker and finished well. EL
TERRENO sped up to take the early lead, set the pace two wide into the lane, ceded to the winner a furlong out, stayed on to pursue past the sixteenth pole
then weakened very late. AMIDST WAVES stalked between rivals, eased out a bit and edged up nearing the furlong grounds, gave hard chase from there
but lacked a legitimate finish. SHUANGXI (IRE) bumped with ROANAN GODDESS at the break, stalked the pace outside the leader, was bumped and in
close near mid stretch, faded late then checked when in tight late. MISS HARRIETT shied inward a bit and bumped soundly with CONCERTI soon after the
start, settled back off the pace, saved ground into and through the lane and offered a mild response. ROANAN GODDESS , bumped at the start, was taken
to rate while saving ground, worked outward through the final furlong and churned on. CARMELINA edged up outside rivals heading to the turn, chased four
to five wide around the turn and into the stretch then faded through the final furlong. LOW MILEAGE , rated back off the pace, came four wide for the drive
and lacked a bid. CONCERTI , soundly bumped soon after the break, raced three wide between foes then steadied back out of tight spot heading to the
half, recovered to make some progress three wide mid turn, chased into the lane then gave way. MY GIRL GINGER , off the pace, was under coaxing three
wide mid turn then failed to drum up a response.
