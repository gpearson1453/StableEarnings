Footnotes
POPSTYLE vied for the lead with an outer foe in the two path, took a narrow advantage under a nudge while just off the rail midway around the turn, was
roused at the top of the lane, and drew clear. IT'S WITCHCRAFT chased in the two path, was driven into the turn, angled out to the five path while hanging
on her left lead in upper stretch, switched passing the eighth pole, and rallied to get up for place late. EPISODE dueled for the lead in the four path, was
roused while losing her short advantage midway around the turn, swung from the three path into the lane, and evened out in the final furlong to show. YOU
DECIDE broke in and bumped an inner foe, prompted the pace in the five path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, angled to the rail turning
into the stretch, but was one paced. GOSHAKI GOSHAKI got bumped by an outer foe at the start, rated in the five path, came under right handed urging
midway around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. BELLE MIA hopped at the start, raced in midpack in the
three path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, but flattened. CLASS PLAY raced off the pace in
the six path and failed to bid. MISS TAPATIA trailed inside early and never threatened. ABBEY THEATRE raced wellback in the three path early and never
menaced.

CELESTIAL GLAZE settled off the early pace inside, angled out late on the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn, closed outside and was up on
the wire. PAY ZONE set a clear pace inside, drifted out in the stretch and led until the final strides. AVANT GLORY tracked the pace three wide and was
one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. ABSOLUTE GRIT saved ground of the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally.
SAN COSTANTINO failed to menace while racing four wide. SOUTHERN DREAM was outrun while racing three wide. LUNI SIMA was off slowly, raced two
and three wide and never threatened. HIGH STRIKE prompted the pace two wide and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOWARD WOLOWITZ set the pace in the two path, opened slightly under confident handling approaching the quarter, received a right handed cue while
floating out to the six path in upper stretch, and kicked away. TRICKY TIGER tracked in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the turn,
and kept on from the three path down the lane for place. FREGON bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace inside, was coaxed along in the two
path rounding the turn, angled out to the eight path passing the eighth pole, and chased on to get up for show. FASTEST pressed the winning pacesetter in
the three path early, swung from the four path turning into the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong. LAMCARO raced in midpack from the four path,
was coaxed along around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but failed to bid. NANDO was prompted along while in range from the
four path, ridden around the turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. OURS FOR SURE bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three
path but did not threaten. GLASWEIGIAN rated inside but faded in the stretch. HANGIN IN THERE bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in
the two path early but never menaced. DIKEMBE bumped between foes at the start, then always trailed around the four path.

Footnotes
AMOR Y CONTROL dueled inside of DOVE IN CHARGE, shook clear in upper stretch and held firm. MACASSA stalked the pace from the rail, rallied inside
and was second best late. IDEAL BREEZE raced in range two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and had a mild rally to gain the show.
DOVE IN CHARGE dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch and weakened. DRINKS ON ME bumped with BARBARA at the start, raced off the pace
three wide and was no threat in the lane. BARBARA was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. FOXY LADY
prompted the pace three wide and faltered in the drive.

PERSONAL CHOICE laid up close inside, took command passing the half, was cued approaching the quarter, and kicked away in the two path down the
stretch under a drive. PRINCESS MISS EMIL trailed along the inside, was driven around the turn, and rallied up the rail for place. A TOUCH OF HAIL set
the pace in the two path early, but lost the lead passing the half, was roused into the turn, floated out to the four path at the top of the stretch, hung on her
left lead, and faded to show. MOBAY PRINCESS tracked in the three path, was coaxed along the inside around the turn, but flattened.
BIGBOUQUETOFROSES raced off the pace in the six path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane,
but failed to bid. SARAH'S DREAM stalked in the four path but weakened in the five path down the lane. GOULDIAN raced wellback out in the seven path
and never threatened. BIANKA HEART dropped back in the four path early and never menaced.

AWESOME WIND raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up and clear late. GRAND BEY was bumped
at the start, raced well back five wide, swung wider turning for home and finished well to gain the place. MIRACLE TRIP raced off the pace three wide,
angled five wide near the quarter pole and rallied between foes for the show. LUNA WARRIOR had his head turned at the start and was away last, moved
up between foes down the backstretch, chased the pace three wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane. BANNEKER broke in and bumped foes at
the start, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, drew well clear late on the turn, held clear to the sixteenth pole and tired. SERGEANT SINATRA
raced greenly inside down the backstretch, saved ground in midpack around most of the turn, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked the
needed rally. BREEZER was bumped between foes at the start, raced four wide and was no threat. EL DE JOSUE chased the pace inside and came up
empty in the lane. RED'S REVENGE was outrun while racing two wide. IMAPEPPA played no factor while racing two wide. GALIPAN had early speed two

Footnotes
HOLIDAY FANTASY chased in the two path, was ridden along the inside around the turn, angled out to the five path to bid at the top of the lane, took
command passing the eighth pole, drew clear passing the sixteenth, and held sway. BELTS 'N BROOKS broke on top to prompt the pace in the four path,
was ridden between foes in the three path going into the turn, drifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. BOLDNESS bumped
between foes at the start, moved up after the opening the quarter to set the pace in the three path, was cued from the two path into the turn, tipped back out
to the three path entering the stretch, lost the lead before the eighth pole, but chased on for show. GUILLAUME stalked in the five path, was roused from the
four path into the turn, but got carried out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and flattened. BIG BUCKSALOT bumped with an inner foe at the start,
raced off the pace inside but never factored. CAMPTOWN RACES dropped back to last while in the six path early and never threatened. STORM BRAVE
bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the five path and never menaced.

POSITIVE REVIEW prompted the pace in the six path, was roused to bid in the four path midway around the turn, kicked on to sustain that bid in the five
path down the lane, took the lead before the sixteenth, and inched ahead. SHAQ DIESEL set the pace in the five path early, came under a ride between
foes while losing the lead in the three path early around the turn, but fought on from the four path down the stretch to hold place. BLACK BELT vied for the
lead in the three path, led under a nudge in the two path rounding the turn, came under right handed urging in the three path turning into the lane, but was
edged out by an outer pair to show. LORD MILES raced wellback out in the eight path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, but made no impact.
LOVE ME NOT chased in the six path, was roused between foes in the two path around the turn, but flattened. COPPERMASTER trailed in the two path
and never threatened. SIR SAFFER tracked out in the eight path, was driven in the five path around the turn, but weakened. TICKING threw his head at the
start, raced off the pace in the four path, but pulled up leaving the turn, and walked off.

BATUCADA saved ground off the pace, advanced between foes rounding the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and surged clear. JAN'S GIRL raced
off the early pace four wide, advanced six wide around the far turn, bid near the quarter pole, vied to midstretch, was no match for the winner and held on
the place. ANGEL NADESHIKO raced in range three wide, bid between foes rounding the far turn, briefly led, vied to midstretch and held on for the show.
CHICK'S SHADOW raced off the pace four wide, circled seven wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. NO VALLA was bumped between foes
at the start, chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed stretch rally. FRIENDLYPERSUASION was in tight at the start, saved ground off the
pace and never threatened. TOWSER bumped at the start, raced three wide in midpack around the first turn, launched a five wide bid around the far turn,
led near the five-sixteenths marker but came up empty in the lane. SWOONATRA vied inside around the first turn, settled back late on the bend, re-bid two
wide around the far turn but faltered nearing the lane. EMPRESS ELLIE was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane.
WIDE WEST (IRE) dueled two wide around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, vied inside around most of the far turn, stopped and was eased
in the lane. NAPA CANDY broke in a tangle, pulled up entering the first turn and walked off.
