Footnotes
MACH TWO pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane. RYNOTOGRACE raced
in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and improved position between horses in the stretch.
JACKSON ACTION chased the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, challenged the front runner nearing the quarter pole and
could not go with the winner in the lane but kept on to the finish. BER CHER led the way on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around
the bend and faded in the final furlong. MY BOY BOMBER hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in
the two path and showed no kick. CATRICK trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and made no bid. MAKE IT BURN
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
GYPSY WIFE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the
far turn still in the three path and gained ground late to get up for the win in the final stride. BADGER KITTEN saved ground early, led the way up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and dug in in the lane to just miss. SHABAM saved ground around the first turn, stalked the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and chased on in the stretch. HURRICAIN HUNTER raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position in the lane. FALL MOON raced
in the three path early, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch.
TALES OF MAKENNA saved ground around the first bend, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second
turn and never threatened. CHAPARRITA raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far
bend still in the two path and faded from there. MERLIN'S SISTER raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the

HONORABLE MISCHIEF dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and held her margin to the wire.
CALL'EM ALL stalked the leader on the outside early, navigated the turn from the four path and gained ground steadily to the finish. GHOST OF
GENEVIEVE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and weakened in the lane. AMARETTO DI AMORE tracked the
leader on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and was outkicked in the stretch. HAUTE CHARLOTTE reared up leaving
the gate, continued to throw a fit in the opening strides, settled and trailed far behind the field throughout and never factored. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE
INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SIX, HAUTE CHARLOTTE, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

around the far bend and dug in gamely in late stretch, battling back to edge clear for the win. DA GHOST saved ground early, tracked the leaders on the
inside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the second turn, dueled gamely the length of the stretch and gave way late, the best of
the rest. GENERAL CROOK raced in the three path around the first bend, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path
around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. MR. COUGAR raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came
around the second bend in the two path and never threatened. COLOR ME LEGENDARY raced in the four path early, dueled on the outside up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
