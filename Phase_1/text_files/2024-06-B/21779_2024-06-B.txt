Footnotes
CARMEN'S CANDY JAR came in a bit at the start, was coaxed to show speed then taken in hand behind the leader near the half-mile pole, stalked that foe
while hugging the rail on the turn, moved out while roused in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong then was given one pop of a right-handed crop,
closed well to get the advantage inside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her inside lead late and proved best under good handling. SASSY
SHENANIGANS broke well and went straight to the front, moved in while hustled, went around most of the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail outside
the quarter-pole, was roused into the stretch, shied out briefly when flagged with a left-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, was straightened by the
rider then put to a left-handed crop, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the place. ROUTE SENSATION ducked in at the start and
was off slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, angled out at the rear, gained leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the four then three path on the turn,
chased the winner into the final furlong and tired. TRIPLE SWEET showed some speed, moved outside the leader near the half-mile pole, dropped back
three then four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BIG EVEREST (GB) moved up after the start to take lead, was well rated on the inside while in hand, extended the advantage under his own power near the
quarter-pole, responded well when asked inside the three-sixteenths pole and held under a strong hand-ride. MAJOR DUDE settled in the two path, was
coaxed along late on the backstretch, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch,
gained on that foe late but missed while clear for the place. ATONE was hustled from the gate, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, pursued the
winner under a drive in the stretch and willingly earned the show. STEADY ON came away well and led early then was eased back off the pace, saved
ground while well placed just behind the leader, came under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the winner in the drive and
lacked the needed kick. RUNNINGWSCISSORS tugged on the bit under restraint into the first turn, went around that bend in the four path, settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. KALIK went three then two wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
moved closer while three then four wide on the far turn then was roused, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed
to rally. CURBSTONE lagged at the rear while inside to the two path on the turns, came out into the stretch and was no factor. SO HIGH (GB) established
forward position early, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, chased on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
DOT'S DOLLAR was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in
the two path, rallied to make a bid outside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. POPPY'S PRIDE was hustled to the front, showed the
way down the backstretch, vied in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the rail, came under the crop in upper stretch, led into the final furlong
then was overtaken by the winner but held the place. LOST IN ROME was urged off the pace, moved out outside the five-eighths pole, chased in the four
path on the turn, pursued the top two while looming a threat on the outside into the final furlong but was out-kicked while able to get the show. FLINT RIDGE
dropped back while urged along, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. NOTABLE BOB (CHI) was urged along
off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. KUPP stumbled at the start but broke with the field then was hustled, pressed the pace on the
outside of the leader, chased in the three path on the turn and tired. JOKING WAY was urged along on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch,
chased five wide on the turn and came up empty.

FINAL VERDICT moved up to contest the pace on the outside, led in the three then two path on the turn, came out a bit into upper stretch then was put to a
left-handed crop, drifted out near the furlong marker then was corrected by the rider, responded well to the challenge of two foes while taking a straight path
under a hand-ride until the sixteenth-pole, was put back to a left-handed crop at that juncture, drifted out again and bumped with the runner-up then held as
the un-official winner. LI'L LANG showed speed between foes, dropped just off the pace late on the backstretch, tracked in the two path on the turn, was
asked in the three path at the quarter-pole then came out some in pursuit of the leader, made a bid outside the furlong marker then was carried out some,
battled outside of FINAL VERDICT and inside of MUSICAL MAESTRO into the final sixteenth, was bumped by the un-official winner shortly thereafter and
forced out into MUSICAL MAESTRO then just missed. MUSICAL MAESTRO tracked the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, gained under a
drive in upper stretch, made a bid outside the furlong marker then was carried out some, fought outside of the top two into the final sixteenth, was bumped
by LI'L LANG when that foe was forced out shortly thereafter and missed while able to get the show. DEVIL'S CAY broke near the back of the field, settled
off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path late on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, gained outside into the final furlong, was fanned out
behind the top three late and narrowly earned the last spot in the superfecta. COLLECT FROM IKE broke out and bumped with an opponent then dropped
back, moved in at the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, moved further out in the drive and
improved position. GASLIGHT DANCER bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, swung six
wide into the stretch, was fanned out late and also improved position. BUSY MORNING showed speed between horses then dropped just off the pace, went
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was roused near the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed kick. KING MOONRACER broke
out at the start, settled towards the back, was urged along near the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch,
lacked room in traffic inside the three-sixteenths pole, found room in the final furlong but also lacked the needed kick. OKALOOSA angled in while showing
speed then contested the pace on the inside of foes, dropped just off the pace late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came under a drive in
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. ITALIAN SYMPHONY settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch
and failed to threaten. STREET SWAGG lunged at the start and was last to commence but broke relatively with the rest of the field, settled on the outside,
went three then four wide on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. IMAGE OF QUALITY bumped with a rival at the
start then was hustled, contested the pace between horses, dropped back some while moving from the two path to the rail on the urn and tired.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A RIDER CLAIM OF FOUL, FINAL VERDICT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND

Footnotes
KANT HURRY LOVE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. LEELOO brushed the off side stall at the start, chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and closed well to latch on the aforementioned foe as she hit the
finish. STERLING SILVER chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. MAJESTIC RETURN coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened. SECURITY CODE chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
CAPTAINSDAUGHTER broke through the gate prior to the start and was examined and reloaded, chased just off the inside and then along the inside
coming under coaxing and being angled out at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and trailed. This race had a timing malfunction and
was hand timed to arrive at an accurate time.

second, took the advantage outside the half-mile pole then went clear, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, came off the inside at the
quarter-pole, responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging. CLASSIC CARA went three wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. UNDER AGREEMENT
(FR) broke out and bumped with a rival, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two then three path on the far
turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. PURRFECT GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled near
the back on the outside, moved from three to five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and drifted in late while improving position. TRUE

further out and also improved position. WAKE UP LAUREN went three wide on both turns and was no factor. SUMMER FESTIVAL bumped with foes on
both sides at the start, went three to four wide on the turns and failed to rally. CISNEY broke out at the start, pulled some under restraint early, raced in the
three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to
rally. THAT'STHEFACTJACK saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from the inside to the two path on the far
turn and came up empty. LION'S MIRACLE MO settled towards the back while inside to the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. BANANA PUDDING settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to respond. SONIA'S
FLAME broke in then was hustled to the front and sped clear, rounded the first turn in the three path, showed the way, lost the lead to the winner outside the
half-mile pole, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and retreated.
