OUR CORNERSTONE raced in range along the inside, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for a clear path in upper stretch, kicked in gamely
and got up late. ATTA PARTY vied inside of RAYMOND up the backstretch, continued to battle around the turn, edged ahead to a slim lead a furlong out,
continued on top deep stretch then got edged in final strides. RAYMOND vied outside of ATTA PARTY from the onset, continued to battle around the far
turn, could not match strides for the lead past the furlong marker but stayed on with response. COALMINER'S KITTEN was unhurried and raced in the back,
swung four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. ACTION SEEKER tracked the embattled pair up the backstretch, came under a ride three wide
near the quarter pole, failed to respond and weakened in the lane. SAILOR CHOW sat just off the early pace, hustled along two wide into upper stretch,
failed to move on and gave way.

THOUSAND SPRINGS was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide around the first turn, was nicely rated sitting off the top trio up the
backstretch, let out a notch entering the far turn, loomed boldly four wide at the quarter pole, gained a slim lead approaching the furlong marker and edged
away. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up to engage STUMPY'S LOVE
SONG entering the turn, dueled two wide between rivals into the stretch, could not move on with eventual winner past the furlong marker but stayed on for
second best. DOUBLECHECK tracked the pace through early stages, moved up to engage rivals at the quarter pole, remained up close into the stretch,
tipped out a path wider a furlong out, finished with response and gained show. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG sped to the lead in opening stages, set the
uncontested pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of OUR HEAVELY GIFT entering the far turn then took on added rivals at the quarter pole,
fought back along the inside then failed to match strides past the eighth pole, flattened in the final sixteenth and got edged for show. I GOT A GUY raced
three wide off the early pace, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. BIG TAP raced in the back, saved ground throughout and
never threatened.

STROLLNTOTHEMARKET tracked the top pair in early stages, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, came four paths wide into upper
stretch, took command past the furlong marker and finished going away. MARKSON raced in range two wide into the turn, tipped out wider for a clear path
in upper stretch, responded willingly when called upon, finished with good response and cleared second best. POE MANS RIDE sped to the lead soon after
the start, continued on top then took on challengers at the quarter pole, fought back and held a slight edge racing two wide a furlong out, drifted in a path
approaching the sixteenth pole, which caused WILY WADE to get in tight and steady then weakened to show. WILY WADE raced in range and saved
ground around the turn, came a bit off the inside in upper stretch then angled back to the rail, moved up closer then got in tight and steadied when POE
MANS RIDE drifted in near the sixteenth pole, steadied and flattened out. DO IT LIKE KEVIN raced up close in early stages, vied for the lead going by the
quarter pole then tired in the drive. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY, POE MANS RIDE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR

EUTYCHIA led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, turned back the bid from UNDECODED near the quarter pole, saved
ground entering the lane, had plenty left in reserve and drew off under steady encouragement. UNDECODED was forwardly placed racing three wide up the
backstretch, edged up to challenge EUTCHIA near the quarter pole, could not move on with eventual winner, sustained a steady bid and secured second
best. GIRL PRO tracked the top trio along the outside, hustled along three wide trying to reach the leader late on the turn, ran on into upper stretch then
flattened out. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL raced off the early pace, saved ground around the final turn, came three wide into upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. SASSY AIN'T I raced up close around the first turn and continued forwardly placed up the backstretch, flattened mid-way around the far turn
and continued to weaken in the lane. REINA DEL SUR lacked speed and raced in the back, was ridden three wide into upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
INCA EMPIRE settled off the pace through early stages, picked up the tempo four wide late on the far turn, swung into action entering the lane, roused
forward and took a slim lead at the sixteenth pole and held firm. ROMAN GIANT was unhurried and raced well off the early pace, edged closer along the
inside late on the far turn, roused forward along the rail in the stretch run, raced in striking distance but could not get by the game winner. CHAPEL BARN
vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle with TIME MACHINE up the backstretch and around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, fought
on then got collared on both sides in the final furlong and weakened to show. TEMPTED MISSION sat in good position sitting just off the embattled pair,
moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, ran on into upper stretch then flattened out. EARS TO ME trailed the field up the backstretch,
continued in the back around the final turn, came three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. TIME MACHINE vied outside of CHAPEL BARN
around the first turn, continued to battle up the backstretch and around the far turn then tired in the drive. K C ROCKET tracked the top trio up the
backstretch then stopped around the far turn and jogged in.

Footnotes
LITTLEMORE TA KELA broke in and came away a step slow at the start, raced well off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung four to
five wide into action entering upper stretch, rallied gamely along the outside and edged away. JUSTASTROLLIN tracked the pace up the backstretch,
moved up to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter pole, got carried out wider entering top stretch, shifted in a path then took over the lead leaving the
furlong marker, kept clear under steady encouragement then got overtaken late. DEER RUN raced in contention in the opening quarter, moved up closer
three wide near the quarter pole, came three wide into upper stretch, lost path, steadied, tipped wider and gained show. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced off the
early pace, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under firm handling and gained in final stages. NATIVE HELLRAISER was well
reserved racing in the back, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner then angled off the inside and gained position without threatening.
FRANKLYGREAT set a pressured pace up the backstretch then vied for the lead inside of HOOKED ON DREAMS around the turn, edged away to a slim
lead in upper stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. HOOKED ON DREAMS pressed the pace up the backstretch, vied outside of
FRANKLYGREAT around the turn then tired in the drive. ROWDY RAY raced in range sitting off the top pair in the opening quarter, had to wait for a path
along rail around the turn, lacked a clear path in upper stretch, steadied at the furlong marker and continued blocked along the inside through the lane.
