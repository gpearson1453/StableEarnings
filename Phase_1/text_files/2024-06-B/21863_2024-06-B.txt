Footnotes
WHITING FIELD set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. STING MUSIC stalked the pace three wide, lugged in through the last quarter mile
and was clearly second best. REMERTON was bumped soon after the start, chased the pace inside, lacked the needed rally but stayed on for the show.
MOHAWK RIVER disputed the pace in the four path around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and faltered near the quarter pole. FIGHT TIL
DAWN was outrun inside. CROWN THAT SAINT came out and bumped soon after the start then had only brief speed inside. AGENT MOR played no factor
while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
MARSHMALLOW QUEEN prompted the outer pacesetter in the three path, bid under a ride turning into the stretch, took command well before the eighth
pole, tipped to the rail, and drew clear. TEARDUC showed the way in the five path before merging to the two path entering the turn, received a right handed
cue passing the quarter, surrendered the lead at the top of the stretch, but chased on to secure place. AMY THE BUTCHER stalked in the six path, was
coaxed along in the four path around the turn, floated back out to the six path at the top of the lane, and was along for show. JUST TAKE NOTES tracked in
the two path, steadied passing the half, fanned out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, but failed to bid. CHIEF LADY broke well but
quickly dropped wellback along the inside and never threatened. FAIRHOPECURLY rated in the four path but never menaced.

MISPRINT dueled inside of foes down the backstretch, dropped back inside around the turn, angled out leaving the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the
left lead in the lane, re-rallied outside and was up leaving the sixteenth pole. OMO TEN GIRL dueled between foes, drew clear in upper stretch, continued
on the left lead and was unable to resist the winner late. CHAINA chased the pace three and four wide and ran on for the show. NO ACTION vied in the four
path and weakened in the final furlong. KHOZY COLBY failed to menace while racing four wide. MIGUEL'S BELLE had early speed between foes, checked
nearing the turn and dropped back inside.

OKAY FINE settled around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, came under coaxing when challenged by an outer foe passing
the three eighths mark, and kicked on from the two path down the lane to hold sway. GREY PRINCESS tracked in the two path, was roused from the rail
into the far turn, and ran on up the inside down the stretch for place. SUDOKU TERRY broke out at the start but was quickly corrected, stalked in the four
path, was driven around the far turn, and kept on for show. DONTMESSWITHTESS bumped with foes on both sides at the start, raced off the pace in the
two path, received a right handed cue in the three path entering the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. JUDGE
JUDITH bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close in the three path, bid passing the three-eighths mark, but weakened down the lane. MAD
MADAME MIM (IRE) trailed in the three path and never threatened. SAUCY SIX bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path but was no

CHLOE'S TOY stalked the pace inside, came through inside of the pacesetter to take the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, tipped out in upper stretch
and held firm under a drive. HITS DIFFERENT trailed two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and rallied inside of the winner. MEGAN MAKIN MONEY
set the pace two wide between foes, battled outside of the winner past the eighth pole but was outfinished. GRIDLOCK raced up close three wide and was
one-paced through the lane. FOGGY NOTE hit the starting gate, chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally.

PROVERB tracked in the three path, took command in the two path passing the three-eighths pole, opened up under coaxing passing the quarter, continued
to inch away in upper stretch, and held sway. MAJOR KING got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, laid off the pace inside, waited in the
two path rounding the turn before being roused passing the quarter, angled out to the six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. RARE JEWEL got
bumped at the start by an inner foe, rated in the two path, came under a ride along the inside passing the three-eighths pole, floated out to the four path at
the top of the lane, but evened out for show. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) broke out an bumped an outer foe, laid up close in the five path, but faded from the
seven path entering the stretch. B G LEE broke out and bumped between foes at the start, trailed in the five path, fanned out to the nine path turning into
the lane, but failed to bid. NATURE BOY showed the way in the four path, but lost the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, and yielded in the stretch. KRABI
chased in the five path but was done after a half. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF B G LEE

Footnotes
LETS GO KOKO tracked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, kicked clear late on the far turn and held clear under a drive.
PALACE FLIRT raced off the early pace four wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and stayed on to gain the place. SPREZZATURA raced up
close inside, was shuffled back nearing the quarter pole, angled three wide leaving that marker then rallied inside of foes to just miss second. NEOM CITY
came in and tightened up SOUTHERN PALACE nearing the first turn, raced off the pace inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole and had a mild rally.
SOUTHERN PALACE hit the starting gate to get away last, was forced to checked when shut off nearing the first turn, trailed three wide early, edged closer
four wide around the far turn but was no threat in the lane. NINA'S LAST GIFT pressed the pace two wide and tired in the stretch. RITABOOK chased the
pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. BELLESHAZZA set the pace along the rail and retreated after six furlongs. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF SOUTHERN PALACE, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NEOM CITY FROM FOURTH AND PLACED HER FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE
NEARING THE FIRST TURN.

Footnotes
FLY THE W laid up close in the three path, bid midway around the far turn, kicked on to lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear in the final sixteenth.
LORD EDDARD STARK raced off the pace in the four path, was driven around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for
place. VLADISLAV tracked in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter, and chased on from the two path down the lane for show. LORD OF WAR
showed the way in the two path, received a right handed cue going into the far turn, was challenged by the outer eventual winner midway around the far
turn, dug in from the three path in upper stretch, but yielded around the sixteenth. OCALA DREAM laid in midpack in the four path, was driven around the
far turn, but flattened in the five path down the lane. MUTAAWID trailed in the five path and never threatened. SOCIALLONGDISTANCE rated in the three
path but was no menace.
