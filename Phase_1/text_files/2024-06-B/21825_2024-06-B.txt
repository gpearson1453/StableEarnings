Footnotes
SWEET MO B vied for the lead two wide and between horses, then drove clear in midstretch. LOOKATMYBUCKLE chased from midpack in the four path,
shifted out to the five path with three sixteenths to go and ran on to gain place in the closing stages. JERSEY TURNPIKE broke out then bubbled subtly
shortly after, prompted three deep, vied turning for home, but hung on his left lead through upper stretch, yielded to an inner counterpart in midstretch and
lost place late. EL DANDI vied inside of a pair of rivals of rivals around the turn, then gradually yielded. XAVI tracked the leading trio from the two path
around the turn, chased them before lugging in briefly in midstretch, and lacked a bid. FREDDY BOY was off slow then bobbled at the start, pursued from
off of the pace in the five path and failed to factor. HERB ELIAS broke inwardly at the start, saved ground while off of the pace, was briefly put to tight
quarters by an outer foe at the furlong grounds and failed to menace. CERTAIN VICTOR E brushed the inner stall door and broke a step slow, then made
little impact from the two path. MILLERS BRO broke a step slow before quickly dropping back after the start, lagged behind around the turn and was outrun.
PER RULING #2024-00815 FROM HISA, EL DANDI WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO UNPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE WHIP STRIKES.

Footnotes
TITLED LADY pressed two wide, led into the lane and drove clear. OFF RAMP set the pace along the inside, got headed by the eventual winner entering
the lane and was second best. ROSE PALACE was antsy loading, then broke awkwardly, trailed the short field in the four path and surpassed a tiring rival in
the shadow of the wire. CENTER STAGE stalked three wide, took aim within striking range entering the lane, but weakened and lost show at the wire.

Footnotes
ATKINS laid off of the pace two wide, gained four deep into the far turn, bid and vied tucking three wide turning for home, led into the final furlong and
inched ahead. DOCTOR NASH showed the way along the inside, got headed by a pair of outer bidders leaving the three furlong pole, fought on to battle for
the lead through midstretch, but yielded to the eventual winner in the late stages and narrowly saved place from an outer bidder. LEBLON bumped the gate
upon leaving it, pursued from midpack while keen along the inside around the first turn, pursued between horses approaching the far turn before being
roused three to four wide turning for home, took aim drifting to the five path entering the lane, ran on willingly missed place at the wire. ROYAL ACT pursued
from midpack three wide, bid along with an outer rival leaving the three furlong pole, dueled between a pair of rivals entering the lane, failed to sustain even
terms in upper stretch then kept on through the final furlong. MINISTERIAL broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, pursued in the five path around the
far turn, flopped back to his left lead while lacking progress in midstretch, then stayed on while failing to threaten. IMPROBABLE STORY stalked two wide
but weakened between horses around the far turn. LEADER OF MEN stalked along the inside and gave way.

ANAKARINA set a clear pace in the two path and was ridden out under moderate hand urging. RELIABLE SOURCE chased from midpack along the inside,
was shuffled back behind a tiring rival turning for home, recovered to launch a rally in upper stretch and split foes in the late stages to gain place. EMPRESS
JULIA tracked forwardly from the four path, vied for place through the lane but was outkicked by an inner rival late. EMPIRICAL MISCHIEF tracked along
the inside, chased and vied for place with an outer rival through midstretch but yielded late. GIVE HER ANOTHER laid off of the pace four wide, shifted out
in upper stretch and rallied. LUCY MCGEE broke out and spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, fanned out to
the six to seven path entering the lane, stayed on while shifting in and improved position. AND ONE MORE TIME pursued from midpack tucking two wide
and between horses into the turn, but weakened approaching the lane. BURIANA pursued from midpack in the three path around the turn, chased in the
four path in upper stretch and faded between horses. TEQUILAANDTHERAPY broke a beat slow, lacked speed along the inside, got shuffled back to the
rear while blocked turning for home and made little impact. ALL STAR TOUT lacked speed three wide and between horses and failed to factor. FLEET
STREET chased in the three path while closest to the clear leader, but weakened between horses through the lane.

OH MY MIA pressed three wide early on, then two wide while remaining in the three path around the turn, gained command entering the lane and drew off
under a drive. CHAMPAGNE SURPRISE laid off of the pace three to four path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, then rallied to gain place at the
sixteenth pole and was second best. VINO VERITAS broke slowly, raced at the rear two wide, tucked to the inside around the turn, shifted three wide
launching a rally entering the lane, gained between horses in midstretch to offer an inside bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but got outkicked. STREETS
OF PARIS tugged while forwardly placed behind the leaders early on, steadied shifting out at the half mile pole, stalked outside of the top pair and from the
four path around the bend, chased and proved no match for the clearing leader in upper stretch, then yielded place between bidders at the sixteenth pole.
PRISON BOUND advanced between horses early on to set the pace in the two path, got headed by an outer presser entering the lane and weakened. TIZ
SALTY broke in a tangle, laid off of the pace along the inside, moved between horses turning for home and failed to factor. TAN PAM prompted along the
inside for a quarter mile but faded around the turn. SKY RULES broke slowly, pursued from the two path, floated three while while between horses turning
for home and weakened.

BORN FLAWLESS broke sharply, set the pace along the inside, shook clear entering the lane and held sway. THE QUEENS JULES stalked three wide, bid
for place entering upper stretch, dueled with an inner rival for that position into deep stretch and prevailed. NULLARBOR broke out multiple paths at the
start, pressed the leader from the outside, failed to sustain pressure entering the lane, dueled for place with an outer bidder through midstretch but was
bested. SOARING BIRD tracked from the three path, spun to the five path entering the lane, drifted out briefly in upper stretch, yet sustained his chase in
the final furlong and saved fourth from an outer bidder. DIVINE ARMOR laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the six path in the final furlong and ran
on late. PAPA ROCKET broke a step slow, trailed three wide, advanced passing the three furlong pole, chased in that path through the lane and failed to
menace between horses late. FAN THE FIRE brushed an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch and faded. FLAGS UP
was brushed by an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and got outrun.

AMARETTI vied for the lead outside of a rival tucking from the four to three path into the turn, wrestled an advantage travelling in hand into upper stretch,
turned away a rail challenge leaving midstretch and inched clear under a drive. PISTOL stalked two wide before moving to the inside into the turn, took aim
inside of the leader in upper stretch, attempted a bid in midstretch but was turned away in the final furlong and proved second best. CHARRIERE took
contact from an inner rival at the start before taking back from cramped quarters among foes leaving the chute, trailed in the three path around the bend,
swung five to six wide entering upper stretch and rallied to gain show in the final sixteenth. BACKYARD MONEY tracked in the three path, tipped four wide
entering the lane, chased to gain show in midstretch but was outkicked by an outer rival late. CONNIE K pursued from midpack two wide and between
horses, then failed to menace among foes. WILLOW BEND laid off of the pace four wide, fanned five wide entering the lane and failed to factor. INTO LOVE
bumped an outer rival at the start, vied for the lead with an outer foe while remaining a path off of the inside around the turn, then weakened between the
