FROMANOTHAMUTHA was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, responded well when asked nearing the
quarter-pole, shook clear under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, came out near the eighth-pole and held under steady urging while drifting out some in
the final furlong. ST ANDREWS was well placed down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch
and was second best. FIRST GLIMPSE was urged along at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and
improved for the show. NOLO CONTESTO was hustled from the gate, moved out then tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the
five-eighths pole, chased in the four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and weakened. OPTIC WAY contested the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DETERMINED LILLY broke out a step at the start and was corrected, tracked just off the inside through the first turn and then along the inside thereafter,
remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in gamely between
foes late to prevail. SNOWY EVENING just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors in the final jumps. SPOOKY LADY broke out at the start, established
the front and came under a firm hold as AUTUMN GLORY arrived on the scene to her outside into the first turn, showed the way narrowly through sensible
splits at times headed by that rival who was hard held and eager to the outside, remained patiently handled and restrained until nearing the five-sixteenths
when given a notch to work with, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole,
fought on to the finish. AUTUMN GLORY tossed her head at the start getting away last, grew eager soon after the start and pulled on the bit coming under a
hard hold by the rider, went three wide through the first turn skygazing and rank under restraint, pulled her way to the front with six furlongs to go four paths
off the inside and continued the wrestling match with her rider down the backstretch until settling a bit better with four furlongs to run tucked three wide, got
given a notch to work with just off the inside at the five-sixteenths and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the stretch. RIBOT'S VALENTINE chased along the inside, received taps to the right shoulder through the far turn and was given a nudge with
five-sixteenths remaining, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was never extended.

FIGHTING BACK settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths pole, went three wide on the turn, rallied outside to get the lead in upper
stretch, battled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. ANDY CANT moved out early then tracked the pace, chased
in the two path on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, fought on with the winner in the final furlong but missed while clear for the place. ICE ROAD was
bumped at the start then hustled, settled on the outside, was urged two to three wide on the turn, moved out while remaining on his inside lead in upper
stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while best of the rest. BOBBY THE TANK angled in while going
clear early, showed the way down the backstretch, raced inside on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. ENDOWED broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn, moved off
the rail in the final furlong and failed to threaten. BARNSTORMING broke out and bumped with a foe, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back
late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the four path and came up empty. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE broke a half-step slow then dropped back, was
urged along at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn and was no factor. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A POSSIBLE TIMING

Footnotes
AGGELOS THE GREAT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge inside the furlong grounds, brushed with ONE THE HILL a sixteenth from home and then took over
command seventy yards from the finish before inching away in the late stages. ON THE HILL coaxed from the start, showed the way briefly early on before
dueling from the two path with BIG PRANKSTER to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive continuing the battle and seized command near the sixteenth marker just before brushing with the aforementioned foe, got headed seventy yards
from the finish while running on willingly for the place honors. BIG PRANKSTER coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of the aforementioned foe coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, kept on to
secure the show honors. APOLLO CODE coaxed from the start, bumped and jostled with SOLO'S FURY along the rail five and a half furlongs out before
tipping out to chased three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path nearing the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. ROCK THE WEEKEND chased five then four wide coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SOLO'S FURY reluctant to load prior to the start, got bumped and jostled
with APOLLO CODE five and a half furlongs from home, chased along the inside coming under light coaxing near the seven-sixteenths, attempted to get out
at that station and was checked along the rail conceding four to five lengths of ground so as not to make contact with APOLLO CODE to the outside, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

into the far turn as the leader tucked to the two path, advanced on that rival coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch
taking over command straightened away, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out while appearing on the wrong lead, got straightened out and
assumed back the front inside that station before edging away to the finish. SPIRIT OF ESTHER broke out at the start bumping DETONATE in concert with
HIDDEN WAR DANCE who broke inwards, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three wide from that point on once tipped out into the
backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then ran on to chase the
winner home. MISS LAO two then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, got headed just inside that station and weakened in the late stages while safe for the show
honors. DETONATE got bumped between foes who each broke her way at the start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. ROZAY SUMMER chased just off the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. DELL ARTE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tired. OUR REWARD coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way three wide into the
first turn before heading four then five wide through that bend, entered the backstretch five to six paths off the rail and tucked four wide and then three wide
steadily while in hand, tucked to the two path into the far turn and came under increasing pressure from STARTS NOW to the outside, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, got displaced from the front straightened away and tired. ADULT ENTERTAINER three to
four wide through the first turn, chased four wide until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun two to
three wide for home and made no impact. HIDDEN WAR DANCE broke in at the start bumping DETONATE in tandem with SPIRIT OF ESTHER, who broke

Footnotes
RIDER'S SPECIAL was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, gained to make a bid into the
stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then drew off while placed under a hand-ride to the
finish. MAGNIFICENT MILE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, gained four wide on the turn, made a bid into the stretch, battled
with two foes into the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner. KENTUCKY JOKER brushed with an opponent at the start, was
urged along on the far outside, dropped from the five path to the three path on the turn, moved out some around the furlong marker, drifted in near the
sixteenth-pole and improved position for the show. TWELTH MAN was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. QUICK HAMMER was hustled to the front then sped clear, went around the turn in the two path, was asked
nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. UNION LIGHTS settled off the pace, moved closer under urging while three
then four wide on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MUDVILLE NINE brushed with a foe at the start, was ridden along off the
pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground on that bend and failed to respond. FIGHT FIERCELY was fractious in the gate,
brushed with rivals at the start then dropped back, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and showed little.
