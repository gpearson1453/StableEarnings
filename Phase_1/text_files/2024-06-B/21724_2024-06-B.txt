Footnotes
HUB CITY stalked the pace two and three wide, took the lead lead near the quarter pole, drifted out under left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole,
bumped DOWN IN THE BAYOU and lasted. DOWN IN THE BAYOU tracked the pace three and four wide, rallied widest, was herded out and bumped
leaving the sixteenth pole and just missed. STAR PERFORMANCE broke in and bumped foes at the start, chased the pace two wide and was along for the
show. HARMONY ABARRIO was bumped just after the start, raced two wide and never threatened. AZURE LADY was bumped on both sides at the start,
raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the lane. MISS CASSIDY was off a step slow, saved ground and failed to menace. COUNTRY
ECONOMICS dueled at the rail and tired in the drive. BARBARESCO BABY had only brief speed while racing four and five wide. WICKED LEGACY was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide and lacked a rally while lugging in through the stretch. ZOYA'S FAITH dueled two wide and retreated
through the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF DOWN IN THE BAYOU, HUB CITY WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH.

Footnotes
HARD SPICE set the pace in the two path, opened up under a nudge rounding the turn, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, continued to
kick away down the stretch, and was driven out thru the final furlong. AWESOMELY WILD had a slow start, raced off the pace along the inside, tipped out to
the four path and was roused into the turn, and chased on from said position down the stretch for place. HOLY KINGDOM tracked in the three path, was
coaxed midway around the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and was along for show. SPANISH GIRL chased in the two path but made no impact
from the five path in the stretch. FOR THE THRILL bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close along the inside early but weakened from the three
path down the lane. LOLA LOCA bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path but never threatened. MRS BRADSTREET veered out at the
start, stalked in the five path but gaveway early around the turn.

Footnotes
FRANKS MIMI prompted the pace in the three path, bid under rousing early around the far turn, took command midway around the far turn but immediately
faced an outer challenger, dug in while dueling with that foe into the final furlong, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. FIRST SHOT FIRED stalked in the
three path, was nudged along from the four path into the far turn, bid for the lead midway around the far turn, ran on to sustain that bid in a duel with the
inner eventual winner down the stretch, but was repelled in the final sixteenth to place. NO PLEBEIAN rated in the four path, was ridden from the two path
into the far turn, swung out to the five path turning into the lane, and was along for show. CHROMOTION showed the way in the two path, came under a
ride while merging to the rail going into the far turn, but lost the lead midway around the far turn, and faded in the stretch. INTOLERABLE was reluctant to
load, tracked in the four path, was coaxed along around the far turn, but failed to menace. ADMIRAL CURL trailed throughout.

MODERN LANE dueled inside of foes in the two path and held firm under a drive. GOLDEN SKULL broke outwardly and bumped foes at the start, dueled
between rivals in the three path and was second best late. FORT ATTITUDE was bumped between rivals at the start, prompted the pace in the four path,
could not match strides with the top two in the lane but held for the show. NORFIE was bumped at the start, raced in range four and five wide and lacked the
needed rally. RACKET had only brief speed two wide. PAPA KATZ was bumped on both sides at the start and trailed while racing well off the rail.
MANGROVE MAMMA was outrun inside.

CLEARLY COPPER stalked in the five path down the backside, was coaxed to bid in the three path near the three-eighths mark, took the lead at the top of
the lane, and drew clear. SOME OF IT bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two path, moved up inside of foes early around the far turn, tipped
out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for place. GOSSIPER showed the way from the two path turning into the backstretch, was roused
when challenged passing the three-eighths mark, but lost the lead at the top of the lane, and evened out for show. BELLA CARMELINA tracked in the three
path, was coaxed into the far turn, but failed to bid. TELL ME SOME LIES bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but never
threatened. LAST GLORY prompted the pace in the four path early but gaveway between foes early around the far turn.

Footnotes
THREE ZERO stalked in the four path, bid under a ride in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, took the
lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. ZIO LORENZO showed the way in the four path before merging into the two path and receiving a right handed
cue entering the turn, was challenged by an outer foe midway around the turn, dug in in upper stretch, but lost the lead around the eighth pole, and yielded
around the sixteenth to place. LIEUTENANT STAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path, was pushed along in the four path around
the turn, and kept on from the five path in the stretch for show. FRISSON bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, received a right
handed cue passing the three-eighths mark, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, but made no impact. MAGIC SOUL broke thru the gate
during the loading process, prompted the pace inside of foes from the two path, came under a ride along the rail around the three-eighths mark, but faded
down the lane. FIRST SLEW trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GREAT VENEZUELA stalked the pace in the three path, took over in midstretch and drew off under a drive. AVELLINO raced in range inside, angled out in
upper stretch and ran on for the place. VINDICATE CHA CHA set the pace in the two path, led to midstretch and weakened. PARTY SHAKER chased the
pace inside and lacked the needed rally. DR. RAY D. failed to menace while racing two wide around the turn and swinging five wide in upper stretch. MY
HAPPY HOLIDAY trailed in the three path.
