Footnotes
RISING INFLATION broke very alertly and went straight to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, showed the way while well
rated, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop outside the
furlong marker, drew off into the final sixteenth and proved much best under a strong hand-ride from that point to the finish. SAVE TIME broke out at the
start, was taken in hand early, saved ground under restraint on the first turn, was rated while moving off the rail on the backstretch, came under urging near
the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while well clear for the
place. MATURITY DATE was hustled from the gate, went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the winner on the outside, was asked in the two path
on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and tired while best of the rest. AUTUMN'S TURN saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged
along passing the five-eighths pole, moved closer around the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped back under urging along the rail on the second turn and failed to
threaten. CLASSY MISCHIEF rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, spun five wide
into the stretch and failed to respond.

WARMING chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command near the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. GOOD LONG CRY chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on willingly to secure the place honors. MOON GATE coaxed from the gate,
chased along the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took narrow and
brief command three-sixteenths from home before being collared by the top one, then kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. ABIENTOT coaxed
from the start, raced four wide in pursuit down the backstretch and through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, tipped five wide into upper
stretch, ran on through to the finish. LAUGHING LADY broke a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the wire. THE SUGARS broke in at the start under hustling, spurted away in
command just off the inside down the backstretch and maintained her advantage through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the
inside route into upper stretch under growing threat, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened. CAROL SAID NO coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. BURNER ACCOUNT
coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. LADY
RIVER LILY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from half a mile out, continued to save ground throughout and trailed.

HIGHER QUALITY dropped back early then angled in at the rear, moved closer under urging with five furlongs to run, saved ground while ridden along on
the turn, pursued the runner-up in the stretch, gained to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging to prevail. DADDY KNOWS
was hustled from the gate, advanced to the lead leaving the chute then went clear, moved from the inside to the two path under extra left-rein pressure on
the turn, drifted out significantly under an intermittent right-handed crop in the stretch, led past the sixteenth-pole but was caught while clear for the place.
CHOCOLATE SHAKE bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed and led early then tracked the pace, chased two then three wide on the turn, pursued
the winner under a drive while drifting out into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. CO CONSPIRATOR settled on the outside, was urged
along passing the five-eighths pole, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, moved in
near the sixteenth-pole and tired. LORD CAPTAIN climbed while moving in leaving the chute, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went four then
five wide on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SKYLANDER chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to collar the leader a sixteenth from home, edged away to the finish to prevail. MYSTIC NIGHT
prompted the pace outside a pair of rivals five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, seized command
with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out and was along clear for the place honors. BOURBON CALLING took the
overland route four to five wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and improved position to secure the show honors. CLASSIC MARK prompted the pace four then three wide between foes coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened. BOLD VICTORY sluggish early on, grew detached at the tail of the field chasing three then
two wide, came under coaxing half a mile from home, went three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BLAKE B. coaxed from the gate, cut the
pace three then two wide under pressure from a pair of rivals, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and spun two to three wide into upper stretch,
yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANNMARIE showed early speed then contested the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked nearing the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, inched clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. MY FIRST LOVE
settled just off the pace, raced between foes late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, came
five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner on the outside in the drive and finished with good courage for the place. TRADE SECRET brushed with a foe
at the start, was well placed just off the pace, raced between horses late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was given her cue near
the five-sixteenths pole, swung four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and was out-kicked. SLACK TIDE showed early speed then
contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the stretch in the two path,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. GRINGOTTS settled just off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, moved out in the stretch and
lacked the needed response. JOEY THE FISH was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved
out in the drive, drifted out late and failed to threaten. JOLLY MISS JILL was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back near the
nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to rally. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN tossed her head at the start but broke
with the field then brushed with a rival, was urged along at the back, traveled around the turn in the three path, was taken up off the heels of two opponents
after turning into upper stretch and was no factor. MERAVIGLIOSO showed speed then tracked the leading duo on the outside, was asked in the four then
five path on the turn, chased into upper stretch aned came up empty.

Footnotes
DANZIGWITHTHESTARS settled tracking the front just off the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch behind foes, gained clearance as LET'S GO BIG BLUE drifted out and then back inwards, got tipped to the three path roused just inside the eighth
pole and bumped with BORN DANCER, then rallied among a quartet in the late stages to get up in the final jumps and prevail. BAR FOURTEEN coaxed
from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked back inside three
furlongs from home, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and dueled through the stretch with LET'S GO BIG BLUE, then
got joined inside the sixteenth marker by an additional pair outside that foe and was nailed in the final strides. LET'S GO BIG BLUE coaxed from the start,
raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, drifted out
straightened away and was corrected coming back to the two path a furlong out, dueled with the aforementioned foe through the final eighth, got joined late
outside by an additional pair and fought on between foes through to the finish. BORN DANCER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was bumped just inside the eighth pole by DANZIGWITHTHESTARS, offered
up a mild kick to just miss for the show honors. LOCKE AND KEY a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, tracked along the inside early on before tipping
two to three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. KING OF
COMEDY chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was
outkicked. SELL SOMETHING coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch, offered no kick. ROUGH DRAFT a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got coaxed from the gate, tracked from just off the pace just off
the inside and then along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. CABLE
READY grew a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start and inspired a pair to do likewise soon after, bobbled at the break taking a first awkward step and
then got pinched out by pressure outside from KING OF COMEDY, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FABULOUS FOX went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in
upper stretch, remained on her inside lead until late then swapped to the proper lead and held under a strong hand-ride. CAPITAL SPENDING settled just
off the pace on the outside, was asked in the three then four path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and
gained willingly late to just get the place. SPLASHY settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
finished with good energy to just miss the place while up for the show. BETTER BE SMART stalked the pace on the outside, was let out while two then
three wide on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and narrowly earned the last spot in the superfecta.
CERRETTA settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path while getting closer on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, came between
horses near the sixteenth-pole and improved position. PLAY FREE BIRD was backed out of the gate then reloaded, established a good position just off the
pace, was asked briefly while along the rail on the turn, lost position and dropped back into upper stretch and failed to rally. H M S VICTORY settled towards
the rear, raced in hand between foes in the two path early on the turn, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole then was roused six wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. JUSTHEART settled just off the pace, raced between foes in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and
lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
DAME CINCO established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, got set down spinning two to three
wide into upper stretch, came under challenge from the runner up latching on outside a furlong from home, rebuffed that rival gamely to edge away in the
late stages and prevail. SIGNAL FROM NOISE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before going
three then two wide through the turn, got roused spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, issued a bid for command a furlong out, got repelled inside the
sixteenth marker and ran on well clear of the rest for the place honors. AMANDA'S FOLLY coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages
while along for the show honors. TONED UP chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. PRETTI XTREME chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
INTO HAPPINESS five to six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. MALIBU MOONSHINE chased along the inside under encouragement from three furlongs out,
tipped three wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch while off heels and lacked the
needed response. ZEN AIR settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn and failed to rally. LCGOLUCKY settled in the two path, was asked between
foes on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. PAPPOU'S LAUGH brushed with an opponent at the start, moved up on the
outside early, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch on even
terms for the lead, dropped back outside the furlong marker and weakened. MITOLE'S DIAMOND dropped back early, went around the first turn in the two
path, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and was outrun.
