Footnotes
BAND CAMP , nudged on behind foes heading to the half, angled four wide leaving the far turn and commenced a run, took aim on the leader approaching
the stretch, steadily closed in from the outside and took over a furlong out, kept on under a drive and on his left lead then was edging away late. SUPREME
LAW , off slowly when tossing his head at the break, recovered and was used four deep to take over after a quarter mile, spurted away leaving the far turn,
set the pace three wide into the stretch, dug in when confronted by the winner, battled gamely inside that one past the sixteenth pole then gave way
grudgingly through the final yards. B WEST had speed to the inside of LITTLE LANCE, eased back off the leader around the turn, came back along the
inside to loom a presence in upper stretch, could not quite go with the top pair in mid stretch then faded a bit late. MAGIC SPIN , three wide stalking the
early pace, saw the leaders get away around the turn then came up empty. LITTLE LANCE vied outside B WEST and held the early lead, ceded command
heading to the turn then retreated.

DO IT FOR MICHAEL , off last, rushed up outside horses down the backstretch, disputed the pace while three deep around the turn, went clear turning for
home and drew off under urging. NOLA BOSS stalked the duel under patient handling on the turn, eased out to the four path approaching the stretch, had
aim on the winner in mid stretch and flattened out. KITTY'S SON , steadied when coming in at the break, circled foes, was five deep turning for home,
floated to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied. CASEY N PAP lacked speed, raced in the four path turning for home, moved to the six path in upper
stretch and failed to rally. EL MAYO disputed the pace between horses to the stretch then gave way. HELLO SUNSHINE saved ground on the turn, angled
to the five path in upper stretch and came up empty. SIR MICK , sent into contention down the backstretch, hugged the rail, checked when trying to get near
the three eighths pole and gave way.

APRIL FOOLS ANDY settled off the pace, took closer order while angled out past the five sixteenths, circled four to five wide into the lane, leveled off under
left handed encouragement near mid stretch, forged past HUNTER JOE inside the sixteenth marker and cruised clear late. HUNTER JOE prompted the
pace outside MR. HUSTLE, moved to apply more pressure entering the far turn, dueled then took a slim lead past the five sixteenths, spurted clear past mid
stretch, could not resist the winner's charge but continued on with good effort to the wire. YES THIS TIME saved ground within range, was under a ride past
the five sixteenths, worked outward in upper stretch but failed to generate a significant response. MR. HUSTLE cleared early, dropped in and set the pace,
was joined into the far turn, battled to mid stretch then faded. WOW WHATA SUMMER steadied early, regrouped to stalk outside a rival, shifted out with
pursuit in upper stretch but came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCCI had speed towards the inside of rivals then eased back off foes into the turn, tracked the dueling leaders around the turn, angled out approaching the
stretch and was put to a ride, opened up under a stiff drive in mid stretch, kept on as his rider took a peek towards the infield jumbotron to measure
oncoming rivals, responded to a left handed ask in deep stretch and dug in to narrowly prevail. LONG LANCE broke a step slow, settled off the early pace
three wide, gathered momentum and circled four wide advancing into the stretch, shifted out a bit wider leaving the three sixteenths, closed sharply through
the final furlong, drew alongside in the final yards and just missed. SPEAK UNITY drafted well back off the early pace, saved ground while put to coaxing
into the stretch, swung out well wide and finished with good energy. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN saved ground off the pace, eased out and worked between
runners leaving mid stretch, was guided back down a bit and flattened out. CASH NOW , bumped and steadied at the break, regrouped to race between
runners into the turn, came three wide with a run in upper stretch, moved between foes, steadied in traffic near mid stretch, dropped in and came up empty
late. HE'S ORIENTATE broke inward, corrected and edged up to stalk, saved ground into the stretch, steadied in close quarters as an outer rival angled in,
regrouped and faded late. BIG HAMBONE broke on top despite a hop, vied outside the winner then between foes early on, emerged in a battle to the inside
of VALIANT VINNY leaving the far turn, carried that duel into the lane, ceded to the winner near the three sixteenths, chased and gave way. VALIANT
VINNY , bumped at the break, rushed up between foes soon after then bid three deep to poke a head in front into the turn, sparred outside BIG HAMBONE
around the turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. BOSS IS A PAL stalked outside a rival, raced three wide under asking into the lane, shifted
out, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and gave way.

BESTSUGARDADDYEVER circled the first turn three wide, was in the four path down the backstretch, circled foes the far turn, turned for home four deep,
brushed with VANCE SCHOLARS in upper stretch then drew away while kept to his business. VANCE SCHOLARS stalked the pace down the backstretch,
advanced in the two path between horses mid way on the far turn, brushed with the winner in upper stretch, finished willingly but was no match for the
winner. HAY CHIEF , shuffled back entering the first turn, hugged the inner rail to upper stretch, swung out in mid stretch and failed to menace. UNION
FLEET , always off the inner rail down the backstretch, raced in the two path the far turn, drifted wide in upper stretch and came up empty. TOPS THE

Footnotes
MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE , with the pace three deep and under rating, took over nearing the three eighths, responded when nudged upon and kicked well
clear past the five sixteenths, wandered outward from a left handed ask inside the sixteenth pole and proved much the best. GET LIKE MIKE settled off the
leaders while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the lane, moved up outside rivals and continued on willingly to be second
best. THENAME OF THEGAME vied between foes early, secured the inside leaving the far turn and prompted past the three eighths, remained inside
chasing the winner into the stretch then gave way grudgingly. RUDY RUDY RUDY bobbled at the break, disputed the early pace inside a pair of rivals,
eased back off foes leaving the far turn, angled out to pursue but came up empty through the final furlong. WESLEY THOMAS broke a step slow, pulled his
way forward to stalk behind the leading trio, was under pressure three wide into the lane and weakened.
