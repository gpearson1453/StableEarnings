ONE RED CENT dueled early on, went clear to the half, stayed on well to the stretch and held sway to the wire. SERGEANT GUMP good position to far turn
while three wide into the stretch but held at bay to the wire while best of the rest. DOC B slow into stride outside, kept on into the turn, split horses and
rallied on in the stretch. DON'T STOP off rail chase to the turn, could not keep up in the stretch run. ROAD MINISTER no speed to the turn, improved
position mildly in stretch. A BIT OF CAPTAIN between horses to the turn close up, gave in willingly thereafter. CENTAURO no speed to the stretch veered
in with no late gain to the wire. WAY TOO FAST inside speed dueled to turn pulled up in the stretch in distress and was transported off of the track via the
equine ambulance.
