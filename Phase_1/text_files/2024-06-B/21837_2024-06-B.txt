Footnotes
DOLCE SERA dropped back after the start then settled towards the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, moved
off the rail just before the three-eighths pole, angled out to the four path under urging later on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to make
an outside bid coming to the furlong marker, gained the advantage inside that marker and prevailed under strong urging. MOONLIT WEEKEND settled on
the inside of a rival, gained three wide under urging on the turn, chased the leader into upper stretch, made a bid nearing the furlong marker, battled with the
winner into the final sixteenth and missed while able to get the place. KAREN'S HONOR tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path early
on the turn then dropped to the two path, gained the advantage passing the five-sixteenths pole, was asked for her best in upper stretch, led under a drive
into the final furlong then was overtaken and outfinished while able to get the show. BLENHEIM BABY broke in and hit the gate, prompted the pace on the
inside of the leader, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, chased the vanguard into the final furlong, was
out-kicked into the final sixteenth, drifted out under pressure late then was eased up about three strides from the finish and missed the trifecta. TEN TEN
went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat while moving from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the advantage at
the five-sixteenths pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. TOOT YOUR HORN was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside under
some urging, went five wide for most of the turn then dropped to the three path and failed to respond. CHARISSE was urged along at the rear, went three
wide for most of the turn then dropped to the rail and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SURFACE TO AIR chased along the inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive rallying inside the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. DONEGAL MOMENTUM coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged
away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish while well clear of the rest. REDDINGTON
coaxed from the start, jumped tracks of the walkover path near the seven furlong marker, then grew unsettled tossing his head behind foes facing kickback
two to three wide down the backstretch, remained behind them until tipped out four to five wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide
into upper stretch and weakened. LAMBETH bobbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping KHAFRE, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired. KHAFRE lunged at the break and then got bumped by LAMBETH, who recovered inwards from a bobble,
chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
CUT THE CORD broke alertly then was hustled, chased the early pace, angled to the outside with five furlongs to run, moved closer under urging late on
the backstretch, dropped back some in the four path on the turn, chased outside in the stretch, gained alongside the runner-up to make a bid into the final
sixteenth and got up to narrowly prevail. SHADOW DRAGON settled on the outside, was urged in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two
path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, gained on the inside of the winner to make a bid into the final sixteenth, battled
between foes to the finish and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. DR. KRAFT was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside,
made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, shook clear when asked for his best in
upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth, drifted out some at that juncture and was caught while clear for the show. MIGHTY ATLAS broke a
step slow while carried in, moved out while settling off the pace, was roused in the two path early on the turn, shifted to the three path late on that bend,
swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ROCKET AND ROLL was hustled to the front, moved in while showing the way, was
asked along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch then was taken up briefly inside the three-sixteenths
and tired. MAJESTIC FRONTIER settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. WILD BANKER settled off the pace, was hard
ridden while saving ground on the turn, moved off the rail in upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ENIGMATIC cut the pace just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, remained patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. MATURITY DATE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors. DAY AWAY coaxed from the gate, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. REDO got brushed at the start by ORI when coaxed from the gate,
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened. ORI broke a half a beat slow and
inwards awkwardly at the start brushing the hind end of REDO, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CELESTIAL EXPRESS chased three then two wide before tucking inside into the turn,
came under coaxing half a mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. PRINCESS SUMMER chased along the inside and then
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, was in the midst of a move when forced to check near the quarter pole when advancing on
to the heels of ORI who was committed in that path nearly riding into the back of that rival, then went three wide into upper stretch and was eased home to
the finish.

asked near the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the two path, shook clear while put to a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole and drew
off under strong urging. BOOK OF WISDOM was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole, swung five
wide into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead under a right-handed crop in the drive, swapped to the proper lead when switched to a left-handed crop
at the sixteenth-pole and improved to secure the place while no match for the winner. DASHING DELLA broke out and bumped with an opponent, was rated
just behind the leader on the inside, passed the seven-sixteenths pole under very snug restraint, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked with a clear
inside opening at the quarter-pole, moved out coming to the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. LADY FORTUNA was urged along
towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn, was taken in hand off heels near the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. JULIANA'S ROSE broke out a bit at the start, settled under some urging, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to respond. PROPER GRAMMAR was well spotted just off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch and tired. LOVE LIKE CRAZY bumped with a rival at the start, raced just off the pace, made a bid between horses leaving the backstretch, vied in
the two path under urging on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. PAUCILOQUENT was taken up when the winner crossed in

improved position. PERFECT OUTCOME bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace on the turn, was taken in hand briefly while

PEAK POPULARITY broke narrowly on top as ANY PORT bobbled, dueled through the first turn from the two path before tipping out five to six paths off the
rail down the backstretch, advanced to pop a head in front nearing the six furlong marker, continued the battle with her only danger latched on to her inside
until shaking away inside the half mile pole, went three wide through the far turn and was given a nudge near the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into
upper stretch, widened away through the stretch to the finish given one solo tap near the eighth pole to the right shoulder and was in hand to the end. ANY
PORT bobbled at the break and came under coaxing to take command showing the way into the first turn, dueled inside of her sole rival along the rail
through the first turn before tipping three to four paths off the rail down the backstretch, got headed narrowly six furlongs from home and remained patiently
handled latched on to the inside, got shaken off inside the half mile pole and tucked to the rail through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened, and was taken back in hand through the final furlong with the outcome in no doubt.

Footnotes
STRONG PLAY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well back while moving in under urging, saved ground on the turn, swung out five
wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. DREAMING OF CARLI was well placed just off the pace,
moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, took the lead inside the furlong marker, led until the final
strides but was denied while clear for the place. INFLAMMABELLE broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the
turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken and weakened but held the show. MAJULU broke in
at the start, took an awkward stride while close to the rail early, chased then raced just behind the leader on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was
hustled to squeeze through and make a bid outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. REALTA moved out under
urging near the five-eighths pole, went three then two wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FIT AS A FIDDLE
came inward just after the start then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the
advantage outside the quarter-pole and gave way. TONE OF SILENCE was hustled from the gate, angled out early then was ridden along on the outside,
went three wide on the turn, came out into upper stretch and was no factor.
