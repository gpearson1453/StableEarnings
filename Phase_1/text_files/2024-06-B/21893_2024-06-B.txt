MID DAY IMAGE , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, stalked the duel, raced in the two path through the stretch, split horses near the eighth
pole and drove clear. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE came in at the break, disputed the pace outside PHANTOM SMOKE, drifted wide in upper stretch, raced on
his left lead late and finished willingly. DOCTOR JEFF stalked the duel in hand around the turn, eased out at the head of the stretch, had aim on the lead in
mid stretch and flattened out. BY THE SEY SHORE lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail in the stretch until swinging
outside approaching the sixteenth pole and passed tired horses. PHANTOM SMOKE drifted in a bit leaving the starting gate, showed speed inside horses,
hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and weakened the final furlong. ROCK THE BOAT chased the early pace, drifted very wide leaving the turn and
failed to threaten. NOBLE EMOTION , in the four path between horses on the turn, weakened. DETROIT CITY , five deep on the turn, retreated through the
stretch.

Footnotes
LUIGI'S SPIRIT , bumped and in tight at the break, regrouped and settled within range while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn then moved up
three wide to engage the leader into the stretch, spurted clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, wandered outward through the final seventy yards
then held sway while kept alert. TUBTIMSIAM stalked in about the two path, steadied when edging up and trying to work through a seam near the three
eighths, recovered and gained towards the rail into the lane, eased out then steadied when lacking room soon after, altered out to pursue the winner from
mid stretch, drifted out late but stayed well. MAGICAL MONARCH broke outward and soundly bumped with the winner, straightened and cleared, set a
rated pace towards the inner rail, held off challenges past the five sixteenths, could not resist the winner soon into the lane then weakened through the final
furlong. BROOKLYN GUY , sluggish from the gate, lagged back under a ride near the half mile marker, angled wide for the drive and offered a mild
response. ENERGY EFFICIENT , four wide to contention, shadowed the leader while about three wide, failed to kick on between foes nearing the quarter
pole and weakened.

steadily pulled away through the stretch while kept to his business. OSKAR MARTINEZ (IRE) stalked the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch, lugged in
and rallied. MASTER OF MALICE , three wide chasing the pace leaving the backstretch, remained prominent to the stretch then faded. FLICKER (GB) ,
along the inner rail around the first turn, worked between horses the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GETTLEMAN , alertly
steered to the inner rail soon after the break, remained along the rail in good position down the backstretch then gave way on the far turn. FLAMENCO

Footnotes
SHELL BELLE edged up leaving the chute and stalked inside, eased out leaving the far turn then bid in hand between foes mid turn, responded when set
down and to the inside of SWEET HEIDELBERG leaving the quarter pole, kept on while hounded past mid stretch then steadily drew away under a drive.
SWEET HEIDELBERG , four wide early, moved up leaving the far turn then bid three deep mid turn, raced in about the five path battling outside foes into
the lane, fought on to the outside of the winner to about the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. IRISH LACE , away last after an awkward break,
regrouped and settled off the early pace, made a solid four wide run under asking mid turn, pursued about five wide into the stretch, stayed on willingly past
mid stretch then flattened out late. HAPPY UNION , off the pace while saving some ground, eased out mid turn then raced three wide into the stretch,
altered further out for the final furlong but lacked a serious finish. HELEONORTIZ stalked the early pace outside MIT MAZEL, dropped back between foes
near the half mile marker, was under pressure well off the rail into the lane but failed to generate a rally. COAL MINE , between foes early, shifted in around
the turn, chased past the three eighths then gave way. MIT MAZEL cleared early and set a rated pace towards the inside, was under pressure from outer
rivals nearing the three eighths, stayed on under a ride to upper stretch, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCESS JAVONCIA stalked the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, advanced in the three path leaving the far turn, swept to command in upper
stretch and was under urging in the drive. DIVA READY raced in the three path on both turns and rallied nicely. GOGO CHANEL , checked when pinched
back shortly after the break, worked her way to the five path in upper stretch and closed. INSTINCTIVE lacked speed, circled both turns four deep and
passed tired rivals. THEODORA GRACE stalked the pace inside horses and gave way. JOYA DEL SUR sped to the early lead, moved to the inner rail
entering the first turn, remained along the rail and gave way in the stretch. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER chased the pace, saved ground around the far turn and
faltered. STOP THE CAP , along the inner rail most of the trip, was no factor. THE HAUNTED ROOM hugged the inner rail and gave way on the far turn.

bit into the turn to edge up four wide, ranged up four wide outside rivals leaving the three sixteenths, came in slightly exchanging contact with GRAYSON'S

inside, eased out progressing into the stretch, bumped with FIRST PEARL when attempting to work through a tight spot between foes in mid stretch, chased
on past the sixteenth pole then steadied when lacking some room in the final yards. FIFTH GEAR was lightly steadied near the half, regrouped and quickly
gained four wide to bid mid turn, vied outside KISS CAM then gained command into the stretch, edged away a bit near the three sixteenths, was joined from
both sides soon after, fought on to the sixteenth pole, shifted in late and faded. CANADIAN BEAR , bumped and in tight early, saved ground mid turn,
angled out for the drive and kept on with effort. BOYS GO TO JUPITER , bumped early, chased into the turn, dropped back leaving the three eighths then

Footnotes
JOHN THE BEAR prompted the pace outside TAKE CHARGE TOO around the turn, overtook that one in upper stretch, steadily and gradually drifted out
through the stretch and edged clear late. SWILL saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and rallied inside horses. FIVE
DREAMS , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, advanced outside the winner in upper stretch, was floated to the five path in mid stretch and
flattened out. WHISKEY AND YOU lacked speed, raced outside horses in the stretch, was fanned to the six path in mid stretch and passed tired horses.
THE JUDGE AND JURY stayed in the two path around the turn, moved to the three path turning for home, chased between horses and weakened. TAKE
CHARGE TOO , sent to the early lead after breaking a little bit slowly, hugged the rail, battled to mid stretch, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
CELTIC CONTENDER came in soon after the break bumping with QUINT'S BREW then continued to come in multiple paths leaving the chute causing
crowding to his inside, corrected and tracked four wide, bid three deep under some rating mid turn, was roused clear soon into the lane, drifted in under
strong handling past the sixteenth marker, kept on tenaciously and narrowly prevailed. PLAY HARDER , bumped at the break, edged up between foes early
then chased outside a rival mid turn, worked outward to be about four to five wide in upper stretch, moved up to set his sights on the winner in mid stretch,
closed gamely, drew alongside in the final jumps and just missed. QUINT'S BREW bumped with an inner rival leaving the gate then bumped with the
CELTIC CONTENDER soon after, was forced inward by that rival leaving the chute and exchanged contact with BLUE KINGDOM, regrouped to stalk the
pace off the rail, bid between foes mid turn, vied into the lane, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. THE BAND RUNS ON stumbled inward at the
break and was away last, recovered and gained inside rivals to reach a forward spot after a quarter mile, pursued inside mid turn, eased out for the drive but
lacked a serious finish. CIRCLE P shifted outward leaving the chute, lost ground four wide most of the way and failed to generate a rally. CAP COM , off the
pace, saved ground leaving the far turn and failed to menace. HAILEYSFIRSTNOTION , bumped at the break and then again leaving the chute while
moving to the lead, spurted clear leaving the five eighths and set the pace two wide, was taken on by a pair of outer rivals mid turn, fought on to the three
sixteenths then weakened. BLUE KINGDOM , soundly bumped leaving the gate, was jostled and shuffled back exiting the chute, recovered to chase then
dropped back around the turn. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of QUINT'S BREW, CELTIC CONTENDER was disqualified from first
and placed third for causing interference leaving the chute.

Footnotes
CATCH THE KITTEN , taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, stalked the pace inside horses, moved to the two path leaving the far turn, gained the
lead in upper stretch, went clear in mid stretch, drifted out late and prevailed. HAZELMOOR BEACH , reserved behind the winner throughout, advanced in
the two path in upper stretch and rallied. PLEASE MARRY ME chased the pace two wide for six furlongs, drifted out turning for home and weakened.
MAJOR HOULIHAN , three wide the first turn raced in the two path the far turn, floated to the five path in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and failed to
rally. OUT OF LUCK , outside horses down the backstretch, floated to the six path in mid stretch and lacked a rally. SEAFARER , kept outside horses down
the backstretch, remained well off the rail the far turn and was never a factor. SWEET FACTOR set the pace along the inner rail to the stretch then faltered.
PEACE OUT hesitated at the break and was outrun. NAMI raced between horses down the backstretch and was shut off entering the far turn.
