Footnotes
EMBER raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the far bend and
kicked clear in the lane. IL CAPITANO was away from the gate sharply, raced in the two path early, fought his rider while leading the way up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second turn, could not go with the eventual winner in the stretch and chased that rival home while drifting mildly late.
LAST MARTINI raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the two path and improved position
in the stretch. MISSION KEY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the
pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position from there. MAKE NOISE raced in the
two path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path
and faded in the lane. COPANELLO BAY raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the second
turn in the three path and made no bid. OUT RUN'M bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the
field up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and was never a factor.
