Footnotes
MATCHLESS hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the turn and
showed the way to the quarter marker while two to three wide, drifted four wide nearing the top of the stretch, was set down heading to the furlong marker
and extended the lead at mid-stretch, held sway into the final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch. A DIME FOR ME broke alertly, ceded the early lead
and stalked the pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed into the turn and chased MATCHLESS from a three to four wide path nearing the
quarter pole, was floated five wide into upper stretch and chased MATCHLESS approaching the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into
the final sixteenth and just held for second at the finish. SHOUT IT OUT tracked the early pace from the outside and was guided four wide into the turn,
slipped to the three path and chased the moderate pace heading to the quarter pole, stayed to the inside of the leading pair entering the stretch and gained
ground at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and just missed for second at the finish. RUNNING LUCK got caught a bit in tight in the early
stages and checked nearing the five furlong pole, tracked the pace from the inside heading into the turn, was well placed along the bend and saved ground
nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, could not muster a late response and
weakened. A BROKEN BREEZE chased the moderate early pace, was guided two to three wide into the turn and was outrun approaching the quarter
marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and did not threaten. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LET THETRUTHBETOLD broke out at the start and was away slowly, unhurried in the early going, was guided three to four wide into the first turn, lagged
through the backstretch run, went two to three wide into the far turn and trailed approaching the quarter marker, was full of run into the stretch, closed
willingly past the furlong marker, took command into the final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch. FAR TO LONG prominent away from the start,
raced three to four wide into the first turn and tracked the pace into the backstretch run, made a middle move and rushed to contention at the half-mile
marker, chased LEVI three to four wide into the far turn, ran in pursuit into the lane, took command at the furlong marker and led into the final sixteenth, was
overtaken by the oncoming winner in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for second. LEVI broke a step slowly leaving the start, was hustled in the early
going and gained command into the first turn, set a contested pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run, shook free nearing the half-mile marker
and set a decent pace heading into the far turn, extended the lead approaching the quarter pole while traveling in the three path, led into upper stretch then
was overtaken nearing the furlong marker, weakened in the late stages and was a clear third. SIX HOT GRANDS broke alertly away from the start, ceded
the early lead and stalked the pace between rivals into the first turn, rated into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace heading to the half-mile
marker, chased two wide into the far turn, could not muster a response into the stretch drive and gave way. THIRSTY LOV raced close up to the early pace,
saved ground into the first turn and took a narrow lead nearing the six furlong marker, contested the pace with LEVI into the backstretch run, ceded the lead
to that foe nearing the half-mile marker and stalked the decent pace approaching the far turn, lost ground into the second turn, could not keep pace into the
stretch and faded in the drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ORIGINAL raced three wide through the first turn then settled in a stalking position while letting UNION WAVE dictate the pace, turned up the pressure
through the far turn then went head to head with that same rival all the way down the stretch, gained a slight advantage in the final yards and held off a late
bid from LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) on the outside at the wire. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) raced close up on the inside through the first turn and maintained
that position for the first half-mile, lost some ground when UNION WAVE and ORIGINAL quickened away near the seven-sixteenths pole, shifted to the
outside for the stretch run then came on again with a late surge to just miss. UNION WAVE grabbed the lead and dictated slow fractions with LORD
WIMBORNE (IRE) and ORIGINAL not far behind, tried to quicken away at the seven-sixteenths pole and put some distance on the former but then had to
deal with a challenge from the latter foe coming out of the last turn, battled gamely down the stretch but weakened a bit late and came up short. SUNNY
SPOT broke last but was close up through the first turn, dropped farther behind in the run down the backstretch despite some prompting to keep up, was
eased through the stretch drive and walked off under his own power. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

DR. ONE sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn and set a moderate
pace while off of the rail along the bend, was pressured by BOBBED N LURED nearing the quarter pole, repelled that rival into the stretch and kicked clear
nearing the furlong pole, was confronted again by BOBBED N LURED into the final sixteenth, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and lasted at the wire for
a good debut win. BOBBED N LURED broke alertly, lost the early lead and chased DR. ONE through decent fractions heading to the half-mile marker,
advanced into the turn and pressed the pace three wide nearing the quarter pole, was repelled in upper stretch and chased DR. ONE to the furlong pole,
re-rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and just missed for the win at the wire,
while clear of the rest. DANGEROUS GAME was forwardly placed away from the start, chased the decent early pace from the outside, was well placed
approaching the turn and gained ground four wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit four to five wide into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong
marker, stayed on into the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. GALLOPING MAJOR tracked the decent early pace from the second flight,
raced two to three wide into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter pole, swung to the four path into the stretch, made a mild late rally but
needed more in the final sixteenth. WHAT A RELIEF prominent away from the start, chased the decent early pace from the inside, was well placed nearing
the turn, saved ground along the bend and ran in pursuit heading to the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and remained in contention
heading to the furlong marker, could not keep pace past mid-stretch and gave way. DOMINITE DOMINIC tracked the decent early pace from the second
flight, saved ground into the turn and lost position nearing the quarter marker, could not muster a response into the stretch and did not factor in the late
stages. SCIENCE RULES allowed to settle, trailed to the half-mile marker, was guided two wide into the turn, lacked a response past the quarter pole and
was outrun. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
OUTRAGEOUS tracked up close on the outside of the compact field, cruised to bid for the lead approaching the five-sixteenths pole, was still in hand at the
top of the stretch, was given a shake of the reins and drew away to win as the rider pleased. GENTLE JULIA was hustled to the lead and set the pace with
EXTREME BLAZE pressing to the outside, held the lead to the turn, had no response when challenged by the winner at the five-sixteenths was briefly
passed by LOCHMARA but came back under strong handling to save the place. LOCHMARA was a little slow into stride and broke behind the field but
advanced up the inside to regain contact with the field, stayed to the inside through the turn and loomed a threat passing the quarter pole, briefly gained the
second position in upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong and was passed by GENTLE JULIA but held the third spot. HARBOR DEAREST raced
between horses down the backstretch not far off the pace, angled out to the four path on the turn and made a mild bid to get into contention, went five wide
into the stretch then flattened out and was not a factor in the late stages. EXTREME BLAZE pressed the pace from the start while appearing keen and hard
to place, took up sharply just before the quarter pole and lost all momentum, was re-gathered in mid-stretch then pulled up quickly past the wire. This race
was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BOB'S BLUE MOON broke alertly, assumed early command and set the pace approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and extended
the lead nearing the quarter pole, was set down into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, drew away while kept to task into the final
sixteenth and was hand urged in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. IMPERIAL HORNET asked for early speed leaving the start, stalked the pace
from the inside heading to the half-mile pole, was well placed approaching the turn and saved ground while in pursuit of BOB'S BLUE MOON, tipped two
wide into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, could not make headway on the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on in the late stages
to be second best. HALO RANDO broke a step slowly away from the start, rushed up to track the early pace then climbed a bit approaching the half-mile,
chased the pace three wide into the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit four wide into the stretch, could not impact the top pair in
the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides to secure third. SMUGGLER'S RUN tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, was well placed
entering the turn and chased four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, could not muster a
late response and just missed for third at the finish. DEBS TIZ prominent away from the start, stalked the moderate early pace from between rivals, chased
into the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch and remained in contention nearing the furlong marker, could
not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. SATANTA was unhurried away from the start, content to trail to the half-mile marker,
was guided to the outside and went four to five wide along the turn, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
REGAL PATRIOT was hustled from the break and pressed by COWBOY KISSES through quick fractions while well clear of the rest, put away that foe in
upper stretch and responded when roused and challenged by HOT CHICKS ONLY to the outside, held that one at bay under a strong hand ride and
prevailed. HOT CHICKS ONLY broke well and raced at the front of the tracking group content to let the pace scenario up front play out, went through the
turn in the three path and responded when asked to pick up the pace from the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the stretch, battled gallantly with
REGAL PATRIOT to the wire but came up short in a solid effort. CROWN MAGIC was allowed to settle and raced near the back of the field down the
backstretch, kept to the inside through the turn and finished willingly up the rail under strong handling to gain the third spot. COWBOY KISSES broke well
and pressed REGAL PATRIOT through decent early fractions, kept close attendance while three wide into the turn, lost position into the stretch, could not
find the needed late response and weakened in deep stretch. ACCLIDER broke a bit slowly but advanced through the backstretch run, saved ground while
launching a bid through the turn then swung five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not summon a late rally and finished evenly.
GOTCHA LOOKIN broke slowly and trailed down the backstretch, was guided two wide into the turn and trailed heading to the quarter pole, improved
position in the stretch but was not able to threaten in the late stages. I'M DR. O settled off of the decent early pace, gained ground two to three wide and
between rivals into the turn, shifted four wide for the stretch drive and lost ground at the furlong pole, could not produce a late bid and flattened out in the
final sixteenth. LOOKIN TO EXCEL tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, raced outside of rivals entering the turn and lost position nearing
the quarter pole while three to four wide, maintained an outside path into the stretch and came up empty in the late stages. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
