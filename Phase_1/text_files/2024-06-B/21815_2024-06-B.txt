Footnotes
MEDAL OF VALOR pressed the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn outside of the leader, dueled briefly in early stretch and drew off under steady
urging. CHOCOLATE MOOSE slightly hopped at the start, pressed the pace in the four path outside of the leaders, bid on the far turn, dueled in early
stretch and yielded at the eighth pole. BENNY'S DAY stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, was no match but gained the show spot. PAIGE
PERFECT raced in the six path around the far turn, stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. MY MISTER PERFECT was off awkwardly and
raced well back, was in the four path on the far turn and improved position late. MIDNITESTATEOFMIND raced in the four path and had no late bid.
SEMINOLE AUSTIN was not a factor. R GUY MAX led from between rivals, went clear early but couldn't last. QUALITY DANCER saved ground to no avail.
This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
