MURTAGH pressed the pace three then two wide into the turn, made the lead at the five sixteenths pole, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch and
lasted under strong handling. THE RED MAN allowed to settle, rallied determinedly inside rivals through the deep stretch and was steadily cutting into the
winners advantage. TOYI stalked the pace down the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide midway on the turn, was carried out to the eight path by the
winner, kept on but was outfinished. ARMOR PIERCING with the second flight inside, swung wide while improving position in the middle of the racetrack
entering the stretch then leveled off. WHEN IN ROME went evenly. GOLD HERITAGE failed to menace. GIZMO'S MISSION set the pace along the inside to
mid turn, had speed into the stretch and gave way late.

joined by the winner but finished second best. SAMMY AND SHORTY vied for the lead along the inside for a half, shifted out to the six path at the top of the
stretch then faded. SHOW SLIDING HOME failed to menace. VICTORY DIVISION was in tight at the start and no factor. NEBULOSA broke sharply, set the

HUNTER SCOTT pressed the pace two wide, dropped inside on the far turn, altered course to the seven path behind the drifting leader, rallied to make the
lead late and just missed hanging on. ONE TEN stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch,
shook clear while drifting out to the six path before the furlong marker then was outfinished in the final stages. STAR ENTERTAINER trailed until deep
stretch then passed tiring rivals late. CREDIT RIVER stalked the pace four wide into the stretch then faded. ROYAL DRAGOON failed to menace.
MORETHANREADYEDDIE away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside for six furlongs and gave way in the final eighth of a mile.

BIG POPPER trailed into the turn, closed with a rush in the middle of the racetrack to make the lead inside the furlong marker and finished full of run to win
going away. MARSICO never far back, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, had a mild late rally and finished clear for second. RANSAM PAYNTER
broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, got out on the turn and through the stretch, lost ground and was outfinished. VOORHEES passed tiring
rivals in the four path. DONAHUE chased the pace along the inside into the stretch and weakened late. SKYHOOPER stalked the pace two wide into the
stretch and also weakened late. OUTA JAIL ON BAIL close up three wide, was through after a half. ELEGGUA was through early. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
