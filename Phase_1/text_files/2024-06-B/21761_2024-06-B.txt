Footnotes
WICKED SKY forwardly placed outside, was roused three wide on the bend, took the lead inside the final furlong, gradually drifted out in the late going but
held on. TOO MUCH TUESDAY shared the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the turn, swung out leaving the bend, rallied belatedly from path five
but proved easily second best. PEYTONS HONOR raced in contention from inside, did not keep up on the bend, swung out to path three for the stretch and
took over third late. MISS KITTY PIE unruly in the gate, trailed staying well off the inside, lost ground through the turn then passed outside tired ones deep
stretch. TINA'S TAPIZAR pressed the early speed from just outside, took the lead three wide on the bend, angled in some nearing the quarter pole, was
clear into the lane, moved to the rail then gave way inside the last eighth. NAPABIT also unruly in the gate, displayed early speed just outside TOO MUCH
TUESDAY, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, could not stay with TINA'S TAPIZAR leaving the turn, came off the rail some upper stretch and
quickly faded. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BEEALEA rated off the pace, commenced his bid three wide on the second turn, gradually closed the gap on ANDTHETHNDERROLLS through the stretch
and took over with eighty yards to go under a well-judged ride. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS stalked the early speed while three wide, took over on the
second bend, quickly moved clear, angled in some for the stretch run, did not have enough left in the late going but was easily best of the others. AVIANO a
step slow at the break, was settled at the back, picked up his pace after a half mile, was widest taking the second turn and passed outside tired ones the last
quarter mile to get third nearing the wire. YOU'RE IN COREY soon had a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the backstretch, began to yield on the
second bend, no match for the top pair when set down for the drive and began to wear down deep stretch. GOLD SMOKE raced in contention from inside
for nearly five furlongs then began to fade. VIOLENZA D'ORO vied for the lead just outside YOU'RE IN COREY, did not keep up on the second turn, fanned
four wide into the stretch and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
CITY SHACK bumped at the start, was kept close just off the rail, angled out through the bend, came five wide into the lane, rallied, lugged in deep stretch
but edged ahead in time. MISS TENA MARIE forced out at the break, soon trailed, picked up her pace four wide on the turn, angled in some entering the
stretch, found herself blocked, got through three wide inside the last furlong, split rivals, also lugged in through the waning yards and was too late.
BACKSTAGE BAMBI prominent between horses, waited for room while boxed in on the bend, got through three wide into the lane, edged ahead, lugged in
some after entering the final eighth and did not have enough left nearing the wire. HER NAME WAS LOLA forwardly placed just off or along the rail, rallied
to loom a serious threat from inside with a furlong left but leveled off instead. TILL set a pressured pace from inside, floated out some into the stretch and
weakened between rivals the last eighth. HIGHTAILING IT broke inward, bumping CITY SHACK, raced in contention toward the outside, lost ground widest
through the turn and gave way for the drive. MOONSHINE MOLLY broke outward, pressed the early pace, went for the lead two wide on the bend, drifted
out to path four entering the stretch and also gave way.

RUNNINGFORCASH shared the lead outside CHEEKERS once on the backstretch, dueled two wide in the lane, edged ahead nearing the sixteenth marker
and held on under steady handling. IRISH DECLARATION prominent between horses, altered to the outside for a clear path with a half mile to go, was
three wide on the second bend, floated out to path five entering the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but got up for second in the waning yards.
PAYNT BY LETTERS made a small lunge outward at the break, trailed from inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, lost considerable ground widest
through the second turn, rallied in the stretch, came up short but caught CHEEKERS for third. CHEEKERS was sent to the early lead, showed the way off
the rail but inside RUNNINGFORCASH, gained the rail into the second turn, battled through the stretch then gradually wore down. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY
prominent but boxed in early just off the inside, gained a clear path on the second bend, came three wide into the stretch, had every chance between rivals
but finished evenly. MAPACHE G raced in contention toward the outside for a half mile, angled in some nearing the second turn, failed to stay close three
wide with three furlongs left, was steadied briefly behind KARAYEL and altered in midstretch then lacked a significant response. KARAYEL well placed from
inside, was just off the rail taking the second turn, began to yield leaving that bend, angled toward the outside nearing the eighth pole and continued to fade.

Footnotes
SWAGGY GEORGE was sent to vie for the lead just outside WILDWOOD RUBEN then slowly edged ahead when set down for the drive. ICONICUS was
prominent from outside from the beginning, three to four wide taking the turn, rallied belatedly the final furlong but caught WILDWOOD RUBEN for second.
WILDWOOD RUBEN was also sent to contest the early lead, had the rail on the turn, floated out some for the stretch run, fought gamely through the stretch
but slowly wore down. LAKE MILLS was steadied behind traffic shortly after entering the main track, raced in contention three wide, brushed with JACK
SPRAT nearing the turn, advanced two wide on the bend, failed to keep up as he fanned out further into the stretch, moved out widest inside the last eighth
and only made up minor ground. SHANGHAI POINT well placed from inside, flattened out for the drive. JACK SPRAT boxed in early while just off the rail,
was crowded and brushed by LAKE MILLS nearing the bend then gave way along the rail after three furlongs.

SNOOZER soon took a clear lead and the inside into the first turn, was overtaken midway on the backstretch, came again when allowed two wide on the

SNOOZER abruptly into the first bend, took the lead midway on the backstretch, moved to the rail, was headed by the latter leaving the second turn, angled
out some when SNOOZER moved clear upper stretch and could only just hold his position late. MAC PANDOWDY settled off the rail early, moved to the
inside midway on the backstretch, commenced his bid after a half mile, came off the rail some on the second turn, advanced behind LONESOME DREAM
upper stretch, altered outside that one after entering the last furlong and battled for third the rest of the way as he closed in the weakening LONESOME
DREAM in the waning yards. CITY OF GOD settled inside, made a strong but belated bid along the rail in the stretch. SEMINOLE BEACH chased from just
off the rail, made his bid two wide after a half mile, had a striking position with two furlongs to go, floated out to path four entering the lane, fought for third to
the wire but did not have enough late. IMPULSIVENESS was soon well back of the rest, saved ground taking the second bend, angled out widest upper
stretch and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. PLAIN OR PEANUT chased from outside, was four wide through the second turn and failed to have
a significant stretch bid. BOISE chased the top pair from outside, rallied after a half mile to threaten three wide on the second bend, was forced out some by
SEMINOLE BEACH leaving that turn then steadily gave way.
