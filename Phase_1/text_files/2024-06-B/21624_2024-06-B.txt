GRAZEN IN THE SUN sped clear from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, continued clear to the eighth pole, headed by SAFA at the sixteenth pole and
was outkicked late. RAISING SILVER stalked outside rivals then between foes in the early going, got boxed in and had to put the breaks on past the
three-eighths pole, tipped three wide into the clear, kept to task outside a pair of rivals in the lane and gained third. VRONSKY FEINT bumped back to last
at the start, had the rider adjust his footing shortly after, saved ground through the turn, tipped out approaching the eighth pole, chased between foes in the
furlong grounds and missed third. PUTT FOR DOUGH bumped leaving the gate, settled inside, moved into range leaving the backstretch, saved ground
through the turn and cornered nicely into the stretch, failed to answer the call and lost the show honors. NEEZER DALTON traveled outside a rival towards
the rear, angled out at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and could not rally. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY chased at the rear, went three then two
wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. RYDER'S CANDY closest in pursuit to the turn, chased between from the two path past

DESERT RHAPSODY hit the gate leaving, pressed three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, drew alongside
again at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over and put away inner rival with a quarter mile remaining, then drew off under right handed urging and strong
handling. HYMNAL stalked four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, continued in the three path on the far turn while being asked left handed, could not
make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but kept on to earn second. MAGIC TIP bumped in the beginning, went up to take control from inside
then led a bit off the rail, cleared early on the backstretch, got pressured by DESERT RHAPSODY into the far turn, lost command midway around the bend,
failed to keep up approaching the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. WILDCAT RYE'D bumped with MAGIC TIP at the start, chased between then
moved inside on the first turn, lost ground under coaxing in the middle stages, fell further back while on the fence through the far turn, eased in the lane and
walked off.

PHOENICIAN GHOST sped to the front and set the tone early, led a bit off the rail through the turn, asked right handed entering the lane, continued clear
into the final furlong and held well under urging. PINEHURST (IRE) stalked the lone leader outside a rival into the turn, took aim three wide leaving the
bend, loomed from outside but failed to find the needed late kick. BLAME GEORGE raced up close along the rail, saved ground through the turn, chased
evenly in the final furlong and could not summon the needed late punch. EASTBOUND veered in at the start, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground
around the bend, moved out in the lane and offered a mild response to improve position. MAN CHILD got floated in and bumped early, tracked off the rail to
the turn, chased three deep around the bend and could not rally. LETSHAVEONEMORE got bumped by MAN CHILD early, tracked near the inside then two
wide around the bend and weakened.

JACKSTOWN prompted the pace from outside, drew on even terms at the three-eighths pole, put away inner rival a quarter mile out, led two to three wide
into the lane, drew away when given his cue in upper stretch and coasted through deep stretch. BRAZENLY chased a bit off the rail into the turn, ridden
along two wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished willingly for a clear second. PRINCIPE CARLO stalked the top pair from outside,
took the turn three then four wide and weakened in the drive. HAPPY SPRINTER broke a step slow and was coaxed along early at the back, went two wide
into the turn, eased out to the four path around the bend, raced widest in the lane and could not make an impact. LEYAS CANDY set the pace under
pressure from JACKSTOWN to the outside, headed by that rival three furlongs out, lost command midway around the bend, chased the winner past the
quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
NESSO'S LASTHARRAH was closest in pursuit from outside to the turn, challenged from outside around the bend, put a head front at the quarter pole,
cleared at the top of the lane and held well under left handed urging. TARANTINO sat off the pace on the inside, chased a bit off the rail then two wide on
the turn, moved out at the top of the lane, came with a late bid but was not enough. KID AZTECA broke a step slow, also laid off the pace, gained three
deep around the turn, loomed from outside with a furlong remaining but faltered late while saving third. HEART HEADED stalked two wide into the turn,
chased between past the quarter pole, finished willingly down the lane but could not summon the needed late kick and missed third. INCREDIBLE SHOT
bumped with inner rival early then dropped back and moved inside, hugged the rail through the turn, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole, kept trying in
deep stretch and angled inward to go between rivals late but needed to find more. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) antsy in the gate, stalked from inside into and
around the bend, lacked room in upper stretch and could not recover. RES IPSA LOQUITUR bumped with INCREDIBLE SHOT early, grabbed the lead and
set the pace early, challenged from outside on the turn, lost command at the quarter pole, fought back to the top of the lane and faded. AWESOME
RHYTHM broke alertly from outside then dropped back and race outside a rival at the rear, trailed two wide around the bend, eased in the lane and walked
off.

Footnotes
MIDLAND MONEY sped clear and crossed over, padded the lead around the bend, roused in upper stretch, tapped with the left hand at the eighth pole and
drew off under confident handling in deep stretch. SMASH IT away quickly and chased under coaxing from inside before switching to the outside, rounded
the bend in the two path, could not cut into the lead in the stretch but stayed on for a clear second. FRISCO broke inward then was forwardly placed under
coaxing, saved ground along the rail to the stretch and weakened in the lane while holding third. CARDINAL SPIRIT trailed inside a rival while urged early,
angled out around the bend and could not rally. ROAD TO ELDORADO chased three deep into the turn, started to weaken past the quarter pole and faded
through the lane. BUSTER'S WAY raced well off the rail at the back early, went three wide into the turn, trailed four wide leaving the bend and had little left
for the stretch run.

ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS stepped to the front and crossed to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, set down in upper
stretch, put to right handed urging at the eighth pole, led clear to the sixteenth pole, switched to the left hand late and lasted. MOMENT'S PLEASURE
chased three then two wide early, rounded the far turn three deep, drew alongside the winner late and could not get by. DENDERA steadied off heels
approaching the clubhouse turn, settled in a stalking position on the inside, moved closer in the middle stages, roused approaching the five-sixteenths pole,
hugged the rail to the stretch, finished determinedly in the final furlong but lacked the needed late kick. HEY DEMPS broke a bit slow, reserved four wide on
the first turn then moved down to the two path, was running on heels from the nine-sixteenths pole to the seven-sixteenths marker, chased three then four
deep on the second bend and improved position in the drive. SMART MONIQUE broke a step slow, reserved on the inside at the back, had one beat on the
far turn, remained inside in the lane and summoned a mild rally to also improve placings. SWEET LAYLA RAE chased between briefly before being taken
back, went three then two wide between rivals on the first turn, traveled outside a rival on the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three path and lacked
a rally. TIZZY TWISTER stalked two wide early, inched closer on the backstretch, chased between in the two path on the far turn and weakened down the
lane. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE tucked inside off the pace, coaxed closer in the middle stages, rounded the far turn two wide, lacked room in upper stretch
and tipped out into the clear but could not regain momentum. LADY MARY LOU tracked four deep into the first turn then moved into the three path around
the bend, dropped back off the pace, traveled outside a rival up the backstretch, trailed two wide into the lane and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
FLATTERWITHJEWELS chased five wide around the clubhouse turn and dropped back off the pace, went outside rivals five wide into the far turn, bid four
deep at the five-sixteenths pole and quickly took over, put away SWEET HELLO past the quarter pole and powered away when asked. DE JORIA hopped at
the start, stalked three wide out of range on the clubhouse turn, raced in range two, three, then four wide on the second bend, was no match for the winner
but bested the rest. SWEET HELLO pressed three deep early, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, challenged again three deep on the far turn, fought
inside the winner to the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane while churning on to secure third. ZZYZX went up to fight for the lead from inside early,
pressed early on the backstretch then drew on even terms again, fought inside a trio of rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to kick on with the new leader
outside the quarter pole and faded in the lane. ROMAN EMPRESS trailed two wide early, continued at the back three wide leaving the backstretch, came
five wide into the lane and never threatened. BONITA LEONA stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and was forwardly placed four deep into the clubhouse
turn, chased wide up the backstretch, remained four wide through the far turn and weakened. TRUE FRIEND vied between briefly then dueled outside
ZZYZX for command, inched ahead briefly on the backstretch before fighting head to head again in the middle stages, vied between rivals briefly midway on
the far turn and folded once overtaken.

Footnotes
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ took control and showed the way early, opened up along the rail on the turn, set down in upper stretch, drifted out from the left
hand and remained unchallenged while being kept to task to the wire. MAKE IT SNOW tracked the lone leader out of range, went two wide around the bend,
three wide into the stretch and whittled the gap on the winner while gaining second. KITTY KITANA (GB) chased between rivals at the back into the turn,
angled out and came four wide into the stretch, failed to threaten in the final furlong but edged VITALERA (CHI) for second. VITALERA (CHI) was closest in
pursuit down the hill traveling two wide then along the rail and could not respond when called upon in the lane. RECINTO ROMPERE traveled inside a pair
of rivals at the rear, moved out crossing the dirt, angled back to the inside in upper stretch and could not rally. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) broke a step slow
from the inside, chased three deep at the tail end of the field into the turn, trailed three wide leaving the bend, moved out across the dirt and was never a
factor. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
TRIBAL found a good position near the front in the two path, bid three deep near the five-sixteenths pole, put a head in front in upper stretch, fought
DEALERS SPECIAL head to head in the final sixteenth and dug in to prevail. DEALERS SPECIAL stalked along the rail, bid between rivals midway on the
far turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, lost command to TRIBAL with a furlong left to run, battled back from inside and was outgamed in the end.
QUINTECENTS established the early lead while steering to the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, challenged by a pair of rivals around the bend,
resisted to the top of the lane, relinquished the lead to DEALERS SPECIAL, stayed with the top pair to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. ADEBAYO went
three deep into the clubhouse turn then angled to the rail settling off the pace, continued along the inside to the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole and
came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the drive and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. LEGITIMATE TARGET (GB) raced in range
two wide then shifted out a bit at the three-quarter pole to bother a rival, dropped back out of striking distance in the middle stages, drew closer when roused
two then three wide on the far turn and could not produce a bid down the stretch. SUPREME COAST reserved between rivals in the early going, coaxed
along leaving the backstretch, ridden along two wide on the far turn and never responded to to right handed urging. ZAFIRO ANEJO also reserved in the
early going and moved inside, saved ground through the far turn, asked right handed at the top of the lane, then switched to the left hand at the eighth pole
and failed to respond. CLASSIC ALPHIE traveled well off the pace on the rail, remained inside to the stretch and never got involved. POINT MAKER was off
slow and broke inward before being corrected, dropped back to last and moved inside, trailed two wide on the second bend and passed a tired rival down
the lane. BOUND TO SUCCEED tracked three deep then got forced out by LEGITIMATE TARGET (GB) at the three-quarter pole, moved back into the
three path around the bend, stayed off the inside to the far turn, angled in around that bend and tired down the lane.
