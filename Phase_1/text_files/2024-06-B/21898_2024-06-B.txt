Footnotes
SPATIAL REALITY pulled a bit early on, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, responded when roused, drew off and was ridden out. GULF
COAST GIRL raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied outside for second. QUEEN CATALINA was bumped at the start,
stalked three wide, chased two wide on the far turn, weakened and held well for third. SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES tracked on the inside, chased inside on the
far turn, was in tight and steadied at the quarter pole, then tired. SPIRANAC was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, steadied entering the far
turn, then lacked a rally on the rail in the stretch. CISNEY raced off the rail, off the pace, was steadied behind a tiring rival and shuffled back entering the far
turn, then failed to rally. CASUAL CAUSE stalked close up two wide, dropped back entering the far turn and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the run
at the quarter pole and Jockey Objection by the rider of SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES against QUEEN CATALINA, the race was declared official.

RIVER DOG away alertly, set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled with LLOYD into the stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival passing the furlong
marker, battled heads apart through the final furlong and prevailed determinedly in the final seventy yards. LLOYD tracked close up early on, chased two
wide on the turn, rallied into the stretch, bid outside of RIVER DOG, dueled with that rival through the stretch run and dug in gamely to the finish. REAL
TALK bobbled and was off a step slow, stalked two wide, chased on the turn, rallied outside rivals in the stretch and was gaining slowly late. WHIZWIT was
outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole, came wide and closed belatedly outside. MY MAMBA raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and
tired. LOOKIN' SUPER raced two wide off the pace, chased two wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

MISS CASEY chased close up four wide, then three wide on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, took over, drew clear under urging and was in hand
the final yards. TAPIT'S GIRL chased close up on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, finished well but second best. MATOULA steadied at the
start, raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, came wide into the stretch and closed belatedly outside for third. OUR LITTLE TIGER chased
between rivals, two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. HAPPY SOPHIA set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled
into the stretch and tired. PERFORMANCEANXIETY bobbled at the break, chased three wide and gave way on the turn.

WANDERING WEST raced off the pace inside, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, gained a short lead, drew clear nearing
the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely late to hold on. CANADIAN PHAROAH raced off the pace two wide, advanced at the quarter pole, angled out,
commenced a late run outside passing the furlong marker and was gaining steadily in the final yards. TYCOON tracked along the inside, steadied entering
the far turn, moved up again on the rail, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and held for third. BRASSTOWN raced
three wide early, took over to set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled past the quarter pole and stayed on well through the lane for a minor share.
GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS hopped and was off slowly, raced three wide early, settled off the pace, chased four wide on the far turn and weakened. LORD
