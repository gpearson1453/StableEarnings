Footnotes
MAZOKU chased tucking behind the top pair down the backstretch, tracked along the inside around the turn, offered a rail bid in upper stretch, edged an
advantage at the furlong grounds and held sway. PENS STREET was slow into stride, trailed in the two to three path around the turn, shifted out to the six
path leaving upper stretch and produced a belated kick outside of rivals in the final furlong to reach place at the wire. SAMARITA rushed forward after a
flat-footed beginning to set the pace inside of a pressing foe, led shifting off the rail entering the lane, but met an inner challenge in upper stretch, got
headed by that bidder at the furlong grounds, kept on but got nailed at the wire for place. PROTOMAGIC pursued from the four path, floated to the five path
into upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong and kept on without threatening. FOREVER HOME prompted outside of the leader
around the turn, drifted to the four path entering upper stretch, chased briefly and faded. STORM CHARGING laid off of the pace along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
COMPLEX MUSIC dueled for the lead with an inner rival around the turn, led turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch and fended off an outer bidder in
the closing stages. SELL IT tracked in the three path, ran on to sustain pursuit into the final furlong, gradually closed in through the late stages but needed
more to reel in the leader. FAST BEACH chased along the inside, then stayed on in the two path while hanging on his left lead and gained show late.
OUTOFPI broke a step slow and leaned in at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path into upper stretch, then failed to menace
between horses late. SOUND CAUSE broke a beat slow, trailed in the two path, shfited to the four path entering the lane and failed to factor. GALPIN
SUNDAY dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, yielded to that one in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead nearing the final sixteenth and
weakened late.

ONE COOL DUDE stalked the embattled leading trio from the three path, tipped to loom a danger outside of them entering the lane, bid in upper stretch,
gained command while being set down leaving the three sixteenths pole and kicked away under a drive. COMMUNICATION MEMO laid off of the pace
along the inside, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole and held that position. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL broke
a step slow then clipped the hind heels of an outer rival shortly after the start, pursued from off of the pace in the three path, swung to the six path entering
the lane before being floated wider in upper stretch, then stayed on outside of foes in the late stages to gain show in the shadow of the wire. LIKE A
SALTSHAKER vied two wide and between horses, yielded in subtly tight quarters entering the lane, tipped out in upper stretch, kept on to reclaim show at
the sixteenth marker but was bested by an outer bidder at the wire. HOLDING PATTERN trailed in the three to four path around the turn, entered the lane in
the six path then surpassed tired rivals in the late stages. SPYCRAFT had his hind heels clipped by a rival shortly after the start, vied three wide, got
outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and weakened. STARTDFROMDABOTTOM vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, yielded in upper stretch

Footnotes
ECLATANT stalked three wide, ranged up in the four path entering the lane, bid outside of the game leader in upper stretch, edged past at the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. LA CARA set the pace along the inside, led from a pair of outer rivals entering the lane, gamely held sway through midstretch as an
outer bidder loomed a danger, but was bested by that one at the sixteenth marker, yielded and saved place. LADY KATHRYN pressed outside of the leader,
got outmoved by an outer bidder in upper stretch, yet kept on willingly through the final furlong and missed place. YOU'LL BE BACK chased while forwardly
placed along the inside and was best of the rest. BONNE FILLE was bumped between horses and put in tight among foes at the start, raced off of the pace
along the inside, tipped off the rail nearing midstretch and failed to menace. HEREFORAGOODTIME was bumped between horses soon after the start,
pursued two wide and among foes, then lacked a bid. PANACHE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in teh four path, floated to the six path in upper
stretch and failed to factor. MOON LAW bumped an inner rival soon after the start, lacked speed in the two path and failed to factor. SUPER MAXIMA trailed
in the three path around the turn and got outrun. TWO TURNTABLES bumped with an outer rival in the opening stages, took up behind foes at the five
furlong pole, pursued from midpack along the inside getting keen into the turn, chased from the two path before shifting to the four path in upper stretch and
weakened between horses.

Footnotes
STRASSE was bumped by an inner rival at the start, shifted out and rushed forward four deep to vie outside of the leading pair nearing the half mile pole,
drew clear in the three path with three furlongs to go, then held sway under a drive through the lane. SESAME STREEK broke out and bumped a rival at the
start, vied with an inner foe early on, but stalked an outer rushing rival into the turn, pursued from the four path around the bend, ranged up to regain place
entering the lane and ran on willingly in pursuit. FORCED ERRORS vied along the inside, chased an outer clearing rival from the two path around the turn,
lost place an outer rival entering the lane yet kept on well. MO HOPE stalked outside of the leading pair early on, chased failing to sustain forward position
into the turn, tucked to the inside at the three furlong pole, saved ground turning for home, but was put to tight rail quarters leaving the three sixteenths pole
and failed to menace. PLUNDER broke a step slow, trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and failed to threaten. SOCO AND LIME
broke slowly, advanced inside of rivals approaching the turn, shifted out to the three path to inch between horses turning for home, but weakened.

BALLADRY bumped with an outer rival at the start, tugged while forwardly placed two wide and between horses, settled into stalking stride along the inside
around the turn, slipped inside of the leaders to offer a rail bid in upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong grounds. MISS JEOPARDY broke a touch
outwardly at the start, stalked four to three wide before moving to press the leader with three furlongs to go, vied getting floated three wide entering the lane,
but got outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch, battled for place through the late stages and narrowly prevailed between horses. JUST AN OPINION
prompted along the inside before taking back to stalk at the half mile pole, checked into the turn before losing position to outer foes passing the three furlong
pole, shifted out to the three path recovering stride entering the lane, re--rallied tipping to the four path in midstretch and ran on late to miss place. MILA
JUNES bumped with an inner rival at the start, led in the three to two path into the turn before showing the way along the inside around the bend, but shifted
out to the two path entering the lane, vied between bidders in upper stretch, was no match for her inner challenger nearing midstretch, fought on to vie for
place through the final furlong but was bested late. IDALOU bobbled subtly at the start, chased from the three path, fanned out to the six path entering the
lane and failed to menace. CONTROLLED TEMPER took light contact from an outer rival leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the five path, advanced
tucking to the four path into the turn, progressed to achieve striking range turning for home, but drifted to the five path in upper stretch and weakened, then
was taken off of the track in an equine ambulance. MRS. RIP leaned out at the start, shfited in and brushed a foe leaving the chute, then trailed in the four
path and got outrun.

Footnotes
GOLD LUCK laid off of the pace three wide, gained into the turn, sustained progress to bid outside of the leader entering the lane, but was kept at bay while
chasing through midstretch, yet closed in in the final sixteenth and drove past in the closing stages. CATS BY FIVE prompted three to two wide, vied into the
turn, gained an advantage with three furlongs to go before meeting an outer challenge entering the lane, shook free of that bidder in upper stretch,
maintained a margin into the final sixteenth but gave in to his persistent outer counterpart late. PENSACOLA tracked two wide, then chased the top pair
home to prove best of the rest. DEVILSGOTACAUSE brushed an outer rival at the start, prompted along the inside before chasing outer counterparts with a
half mile to go, failed to sustain forward position into the turn, chased from the two to five path entering the lane and lacked a bid. MIDNIGHT DAJOEY was
brushed by an inner rival at the start, led two wide then along the inside approaching the turn as an outer rival prompted, got headed by that one at the three
furlong pole, yielded to the top pair turning for home and weakened. HOCUS trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
STYLISH SUE leaned out at the start, showed the way along the inside, led from a pair of outer prompters nearing the lane, shook free in upper stretch and
held well. PHAROAH'S WINE broke outwardly, stalked three wide, ranged up outside of the top pair, claimed place while taking aim on the clearing leader in
upper stretch, then was kept at bay through the final furlong. GRECIAN GODDESS tracked two wide, pursued from the two to three path around the far turn
before shifting five wide into upper stretch, and ran on to edge show at the sixteenth pole. SMOOTH WAVES stalked along the insidie, chased around teh
far turn, claimed show shifting out in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer bidder for that position with a sixteenth to go. WINGS LIKE EAGLES broke a
beat slow, settled off of the pace three wide, pursued between horses around the far turn, fanned to the six to seven path into upper stretch and offered a
mild kick. PENDULUM laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the far turn and failed to menace. CALL ME TONI
broke slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted out and improved four wide with a half mile to go, but was hung wide around the far turn, got floated seven
wide into the lane and made little impact. BOSS LADY BAILEY pursued from midpack along the inside, saved ground and faded. EMPIRES PRINCESS
pressed two wide, then between horses around the far turn, but weakened among foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOST WANTED broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked from midpack four wide, ranged up to bid entering the lane, dueled with a game inner rival
through the final furlong and narrowly prevailed as an outer rival joined the fray at the wire. MOBSTER set a pressured pace along teh inside, dug in to
resist an outer challenge in upper stretch, gamely battled with that one through the late stages but missed and saved place. COMMUTED bumped with an
outer rival at the start, lacked speed two wide, swung to the six path while picking up stride entering upper stretch, offered a good kick to quickly close in on
the top pair late but missed place. NUEVO EMPIRE tracked two wide before tucking to teh inside approaching the turn, then chased evenly aiming inside of
the leaders through the lane. HE'S A JOKER pursued from midpack along the inside, then from the two path around the turn before shifting to the four path
entering the lane, then chased evenly. KINETIC broke a step slow, raced at the rear along the inside, came under a drive shifting to the four path while
trailing leaving the three furlong pole, tipped wider in upper stretch and moved up willingly. HAPPY GREY was bumped by an outer rival into an inner rival at
the start, stalked three wide, bid along with an outer foe entering the lane, but failed to sustain a bid and faded in midstretch. COWBOY CODE was bumped
between horses at the start, chased from midpack in the four to five path and gave way. MAGNIFICENT RAGS was a bit restless in the starting gate, then
made little impact along the inside. DR. STORM was a bit tough to load, then broke a step slow and got outrun three wide. HARD SCHOLAR prompted two
wide but weakened between horses entering the lane.
