Footnotes
SIMPLY WICKED set the pace under a snug hold, contested the front in the final turn, drifted out bothering WEDGE POND, and edged away late.
GABBYSONHOLIDAY saved ground early, gained quickly outside nearing the final turn then drifted wide at the head of the lane, closed gradually outside to
score place and was awarded the win after a disqualification. CAB SAV was under a strong hold entering the backstretch, sat in a striking range from the
four path, moved up fanning three wide to challenge the front, rallied three wide into the stretch, was bumped and caught late. WEDGE POND stalked the
pace, pressed the pace from between foes, rallied between then was squeezed out into the stretch, and flattened out. ZOFFA tracked the pace inside, and
lacked a solid bid. LONESOME CAT was tired early. STEWARDS INQUIRY and JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of WEDGE POND
against the rider of SIMPLY WICKED alleging interference at the head of the stretch was upheld. SIMPLY WICKED was disqualified and placed fourth for
interference to WEDGE POND.

WRONG SPOT hesitated then trailed the field, gained quickly in the final turn, circled the field into the lane, and won driving. MOHAMAD unhurried early,
shifted out to the three path at the quarter pole, angled inside in traffic, and was up late for place. MONEY MUNCHER stalked the pace while five wide,
moved up closer nearing the quarter pole then was roused, and was outkicked. MACHINE reserved off the early pacesetters, swung wide at the head of the
lane, and lacked a closing response. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH sat in striking position from the rail, challenged the lead in the final turn, and came up empty
in the drive. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR failed to menace. CARRERA CABALLO showed the way in the three path, and faltered into the stretch.

Footnotes
MISSCZECH tracked the pace while three to four wide, set sights on PRETTY ARIA nearing the final turn, gained the lead and drove clear under a strong
hand ride. BIG HUG unhurried early, gained quickly outside through the final turn, chased four to five wide entering the stretch, and finished with good
energy. BURROW DOWN saved inside early, and closed belatedly. KNOWING GLANCE rated off the pace, and offered a late mild bid. PRETTY ARIA
zipped clear leaving the chute, held good margins through the backstretch, was overtaken at the quarter pole, and wilted in the stretch. FORCE TO REKN
WITH raced three wide leaving the backstretch, was roused in the final turn along the rail, and came up empty for the drive. PLUM BLUE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ECHO CREEK sat in striking position from the three path, drove inside under handling and won going away. TELLTALE sat just off the pace under a snug
hold, moved up alongside FASTESTGIRLINTOWN, rallied outside through the stretch but was no match for the winner and just held on for place. VILLA
NOVA chased three wide, closed gradually inside and just missed after a good effort. SOFIA D 'AMORE saved ground inside, dropped back through the far
turn, and bid belatedly. CHURCH HARBOR raced wide entering the backstretch, stalked five wide, and lacked a kicked that was needed. QUEEN RHONDA
trailed the field early, lodged mild and faded. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN set the pace from just off the rail, was overtaken with a furlong remaining and
stopped. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
STONE CARVER contended the early pace while four wide, gained leading leaving the backstretch, stayed clear under handling through the stretch and
held safely. CREDIBILITY chased five wide, was brushed entering the far turn, was under heavy encouragement into the stretch, and closed gradually to
score second place honours. WALKTHELINE bumped sideways in the early stages, sat in striking range, drove three wide and evened out through the
stretch. DON'T LET ME DOWN trailed the field early, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide, and closed well late. DRINKING AGAIN
bumped leaving the gate, was jostled in traffic in the backstretch, shifted out to the four path brushing THE BEAT, and was unable to improve position
through the stretch. NORTHERN JEWEL lacked a solid bid. MUDINATOR broke outward into DRINKING AGAIN away from the gate, pressed the pace from
the rail, and faded. THE BEAT jostled between foes while in traffic early, shifted out into close quarters entering the far turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
SILENT RUNNER sat in striking distance, moved closer leaving the backstretch in the three path, was set down at the three-sixteenth pole, gained the lead
and drove clear. GREAT ESCAPE sat mid pack while three to four wide, dropped back in the final turn, shifted inside in the stretch, and surged late to score
second. DECOY saved inside, rallied through the stretch and was out finished for place. KAUAI DAN fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, angled
outside nearing the stretch drive and closed late. SIR BREGOVIC sped to the front quickly, held a short lead into the far turn, was under attack nearing the
eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. UNCHARACTERISTIC unhurried early, swung wide at the head of the lane, and lacked the closing response needed.
ASYOUBELIEVE stalked five to six wide, fanned three wide into the far turn, rallied three wide approaching the stretch, and yielded in the final sixteenth.
RIVERSIDE unhurried early and offered a late bid. HYPERFOCUS tracked inside, and was roused to no avail. READYTOTAPNSING chased outside,
circled at the head of the stretch, and failed to threaten. REGAL RIOT sat in range and stopped.

Footnotes
ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO tracked outside, exchanged touches with OOPS AND DOWNS leaving the backstretch, rallied three wide at the head of the lane,
and drove clear late. OOPS AND DOWNS brushed ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO repeatedly, rallied between foes and weakened in the final sixteenth. WHO'S
THAT BABY set a pressured pace, responded to challengers at the quarter pole, and flattened out. BROKEN PROMISES chased inside, and tired.
MORNING RAIN never reached contention. SPOT ON JOLEE pressed the early pace while three to four wide and retreated. The Official Veterinarian
reported BROKEN PROMISES as having bled. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.
