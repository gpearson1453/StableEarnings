MEDAL OF FACT shared the lead from outside, angled in some midway on the bend, was roused three wide, took over upper stretch then opened up to be
clearly the best inside the last furlong. ROAD GAME vied for the lead from inside, moved clear on the turn, was no match for MEDAL OF FACT the final
eighth but proved easily second best. SIRCORRI prominent from outside from the beginning, lost ground five wide through the bend, edged ahead for third
upper stretch then could only just hold his position late. FEROCITY was a step slow at the break, advanced two wide to dispute the pace between rivals, did
not keep up on the turn, fought for third in the lane but did not have enough in the waning yards. R H SMOAKEM displayed early speed three wide but faded
between rivals after three furlongs. GINSBURNED overcame a slow start to press the early speed, improved position four wide on the turn but gave way for
the drive.

Footnotes
STROPE a bit awkward at the start, advanced between horses, was rated off the early leader, came into the lane from path three, took over inside the last
eighth then was drawing off under confident handling inside the final sixtenth. HAND OVER MY HEART broke alertly, moved clear after the first furlong, did
not have enough left in the stretch and narrowly lasted for second. DIAMONDONICE inattentive in the gate, hesitated at the start then broke inward,
progressed from inside, altered out twice to gain a clear path in the stretch, came up short for second but proved easily best of the rest. SHEBA'S PAL
chased in midpack, was three wide taking the turn then had no late bid. BEST MAN SPEECH ran widest of all throughout and was never a factor. RED
ROIL also hesitated at the break then was forced inward by DIAMONDONICE and failed to menace. PETE'S LEGACY altered in from crowding shortly after
the start and showed little.

W W GRAND FINALE broke inward, bumping IT'S ON, was rated off the early speed, went for the lead outside horses on the bend, moved clear from path
three upper stretch then continued to gradually open up on the rest under steady handling. GREEN GRACE vied for the lead between rivals, gained the rail
nearing the quarter pole, was no match for W W GRAND FINALE in the lane but easily best of the others. HARPER BRIANA well back early, advanced
along the rail on the turn, swung out widest for the drive and got third late. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE displayed early speed from inside, began to yield on
the bend, battled for third deep stretch but was outfinished. HANABI broke alertly and a bit outward, was soon challenged from inside, two wide with a
quarter mile left, was no match for the top pair in the lane and gradually wore down deep stretch. IT'S ON bumped at the start, was checked back from
crowding leaving the chute, chased from outside and was never a factor. WILDISH was a contender between foes on the backstretch but faded two wide on
the turn.

BAM BAM CAM a bit awkward at the start, moved up between horses, came into contention three wide on the bend, took the advantage outside AFRICAN
WARRIOR inside the final furlong, angled in some then began to draw off with a sixteenth left. AFRICAN WARRIOR was sent to gain a clear lead after the
first eighth, saved ground taking the turn, floated out some entering the stretch and gradually wore down. EURO SUPRISE unruly in the gate, was away
somewhat slowly, advanced between rivals, angled in on the bend, gained a striking position along the rail upper stretch, could only make up minor ground
the last furlong but pulled away for the show. REAL NEWS vied for the early lead briefly, did not stay with AFRICAN WARRIOR after travelling the first
furlong, closed the gap outside the latter on the turn, began to yield just inside the furlong marker, angled out some and continued to slowly retreat.
AVENGING WARRIOR chased from outside, improved position some just off the rail on the bend, angled out widest at the top of the lane and had no late
bid. JOEY B hesitated then made a slight lunge from the gate, trailed, fanned out to path four entering the stretch and could only make up minor ground in
the waning yards. WILLOW RIDGE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY rated in the second flight from outside, went for the lead just outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch then
was drawing off inside the last eighth. LIFE OF SATURDAYS broke on top, steadily angled in leaving the chute, crowding those inside her, moved clear
briefly into the bend, was soon challenged from outside, did not have enough left inside the final furlong but was clearly second best. WAR COLORS broke
somewhat slowly, moved up to contention as she took over third three wide on the turn, was no match for the top pair when set down for the drive, began to
wear down late but lasted for the show. A REAL HERO settled at the back, lost ground widest through the bend and passed outside tired ones through the
stretch. JULIAISON chased from between horses and had no late bid. PALAGO bumped at the start, was caught in crowding along the rail as she vied for
the lead shortly after leaving the chute, jostled with SUNDAY SPEIGHT until she was checked midway on the backstretch then faded two wide on the turn.
TAPICITA fractious in the gate, was taken out, examined then approved to run by the veterinarian, was reloaded, broke outward when the race began,
bumping PALAGO and was never a factor. SUNDAY SPEIGHT altered in trying to keep a clear path inside LIFE OF SATURDAYS shortly after entering the
main track, jostled with PALAGO for nearly a furlong, gained the rail nearing the turn then began to fade before finishing three furlongs.

JACK VAN BERG soon moved clear of the others, stayed in path three and maintained full control with only mild urging deep stretch. SOUPER FORTUNE
chased in midpack from outside, was just off the rail on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and took over second inside the final sixteenth. D'
YANK moved to the inside early on, gradually angled out through the turn, lodged a mild bid from path four in the lane and caught FASTNFURIOUS for third
near the wire. FASTNFURIOUS broke on top, was soon chasing JACK VAN BERG from outside, two wide taking the bend, still threatened with a furlong to
go but leveled off instead. BLAZEN ROAD was soon well back, angled in entering the turn and passed inside tired ones the final eighth. TROY OUNCE
prominent just off or along the rail, flattened out just off the inside through the lane. ONE PUTT RICHIE chased running widest on the backstretch, improved
position three wide on the bend, swung to the outside for the stretch run and had no significant response. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN was steadied behind traffic
shortly after entering the main track, chased in midpack between horses, angled in on the turn, fanned back out for the stretch run but had little to offer.
MKAR THE FAST stumbled badly at the start and showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
LORD GRANTHAM pressed the early pace from outside, took over three wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch and held sway under steady urging.
SANTINO'S FANTASY vied for the lead just outside READY MADE, was just off the rail through the turn, angled outside LORD GRANTHAM when the latter
moved clear upper stretch, did not relent but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. GET THROUGH chased from just off the rail, commenced his bid
leaving the turn, was forced out by I'M YOUR CAPTAIN upper stretch, soon moved clear of that one, was closing in on the top pair in the late going and
proved easily best of the others. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN bobbled inward at the start, bumping solidly with SAFE, quickly recovered, moved to the inside
midway on the backstretch, advanced just off the rail on the bend, angled out upper stretch and steadily gave way. SAFE was bumped solidly at the break,
steadied, moved to the inside, angled out through the turn, came into the lane from path six and had no late bid. STOSH soon trailed, staying well off the
inside, was widest through the bend and also had little to offer for the drive. READY MADE fractious in the gate, was taken out, examined and approved to
run by the veterinarian, reloaded, broke alertly, disputed the pace well off the rail but inside rivals on the backstretch, was forced inward entering the turn,
gave way midway on the bend, shortened his stride considerably distancing himself from the field in the stretch, finished the race and walked off.
