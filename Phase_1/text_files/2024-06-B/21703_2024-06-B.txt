Footnotes
BRONZE BEAST good position to the stretch, forced way through traffic, split horses and ran off to prove tons the best. HINDOSTAIN FALLS sharp break,
three wide run into stretch, swerving in late stretch from changing leads in the final furlong while no match for winner. TINO speed from between foes to the
turn, led into stretch, weakened. FIRE WIRE no speed to the stretch, raced on late to improve only. HECTOR B slow from the gate improved position only in
the late going. BOSPHORUS BLUE slow into stride, hustled along from well off rail to the quarter pole but leveled off in the stretch while widest in the final
furlong. WILDERZAR slow into stride from the gate saved ground throughout to no avail. KOLTEN'S PRIDE rushed between horses to the front, gave way
readily from turn. ADMIRAL TIM ran up inside to turn but dropped back readily.
