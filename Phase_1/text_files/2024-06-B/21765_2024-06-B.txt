Footnotes
PHILIPSBURG (IRE) set a pressured pace from the fence early, surrendered the lead on the turn, came again up the rail through the lane under strong
handling, drifted out late under right hand urging near the wire and just prevailed. BREAKING NEWS stalked the pace to the turn, made a three wide bid to
take command turning for home, dueled with the winner through the lane coming in close quarters inside the sixteenth pole while the winner drifted out
under right hand urging with the crop nearly striking him in the few final strides and jsut missed the bob on the wire. STAR KANOO pressed th pace to
midway on the bend, bid for the lead from between rivals at the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch, lugged out in the lane needing to be taken up
off the heels of the runner-up and kept-on to the wire. BALADINE well placed just off the leaders along the fence to the turn and lacked a response when
called upon. SARAH'S BOY BLUE was outrun. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF STAR KANOO CLAIME FOUL FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
KING ANTHONY tracked the leaders to midway on the turn, rallied from four wide making a steady advance and wore down the pacesetter through the
drive. WILLIE BIRD set the pace on a clear, well rated lead, responded willingly coming for home and was out-finished by the winner while clearly second
best. LA PERFECT BEE reserved to race mid-pack to the top of the lane and made a mild late bid to be along for the show. CUPID'S WAR rushed up the
inside to press the pace into the turn, battled early on the bend and flattened out. YOUNG MISCHIEF failed to menace. TALLAPOOSA contended early and
faded. DRAFTSMAN slowly away from the gate and was never a factor.

WENT WEST reserved off the pace for the run down the backside, saved ground through the turn while gaining position, cut the corner turning for home and
rallied up the fence in a determined drive. COMISKEY PARK stalked the pace into the turn, rallied four wide to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch, took a
brief lead inside the eighth pole and was out-finished in deep stretch. ELI'S PROMISE sped to a clear lead early, maintained the advantage to upper stretch
and was outkicked in the lane. RICHIESONAROLL unhurried early to race near the rear of the field, circled six wide turning for home and made a mild bid.

Footnotes
BEEHIVE pressed the pace from between rivals, took command from the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole and held the runner-up safe. SALLY'S
SUPRISE tracked the leaders through the turn, swung five wide to rally down the lane and finished willingly to be second best. DOROTHY CROWFOOT set
a pressured pace from the fence to midway down the lane and weakened late in the drive. TU CHA unhurried early to settled off the pace and passed
weaker rivals in the stretch. FAST N HAPPY pressed the pace from three wide to the head of the lane and faded in the stretch. TWAS LOLA failed to
menace.

Footnotes
TIGHTROPE sped to the lead while well in hand, opened a clear advantage on the turn, widened in upper stretch and was kept to task through the lane
while unchallenged. DRAGON DREW stalked the winner through the turn, was no match for that one chasing down the lane but finihsed willingly to be
second best. PINBALLER tracked the leaders through the turn, swung wide at the head of the lane and closed with a mild bid to gain the show. SIMPLE
LOGIC slow away to be the trailer to the top of the stretch and showed late interest gaining ground in the stretch run. BOURBON TEDDY was well placed
down the backside, lacked a closing response and steadily faded coming home. MR FROST failed to menace after contending early.

UNCAPTURED PULSE stalked the pace through the turn, angled seven wide turning for home and closed well to be going away in deep stretch.
RIVZONAROLL prompted the pace to upper stretch, took a brief lead leaving the eighth pole and was out-finished by the winner. OVER CALENDARED
reserved well off the early pace, angled well wide turning for home and mounted a belated rally in the lane. HURTS SO BAD tracked the leaders throughout
and failed to mount a closing bid. TEA WITH LEMON slow early to be the trailer and showed some late interest in the stretch. GETTIN PAID sped to a clear
early lead, responded when challenged in upper stretch and tired late in the lane. FUTURE VISION was not a threat. IRONMAN RICHIE chased the leaders
through the turn and gave way coming for home.

Footnotes
RIVER REDEMPTION reserved on the fence in mid-pack down the backside, advanced from between rivals on the turn while still in hand, quickened in
upper stretch to overtake the pacesetter inside the eighth pole and pull away to the wire convincingly. WICKED SUPRISE set the pace while well rated on a
clear lead, responded when called upon turning for home to hold the advantage to midway down the lane and finished willingly as second best in a good
effort. REMEMBER THE MAINE stalked the pace throughout to be well placed and lacked a closing kick finishing evenly to hold the show. RUSSIAN TO
WIN prompted the pace to the head of the stretch and weakened. BAKENEKO keen early down the stretch for the first time, angled to the clear into the first
turn going wide, continued to chase from the outside throughout and kept on having raced greenly. DYNABLUE was slow early to be at the rear of the field
and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SON OF GRACE tracked the leaders from five wide and faded. HONEST TO GOODNESS went one-paced as a
non-threat. ROGUE ELEMENT was outrun. WINNING NUMBERS FOR PLACE PICK 8: 1/3/6-1/4-1/6-1/5/6/7-2/5/6-1/2/5/6-3/8/9-1/3/4/7/12.

Footnotes
BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER slow early to be the trailer, commenced a rally under an early drive on the turn, angled six wide turning for home and made a
steady advance to prevail in the drive. IDEA MAN reserved off the pace along the rail down the backside, gained ground on the bend, angled out five wide
splitting rivals in upper stretch and closed well to gain the place. WINGING WAYS set a pressured pace to the head of the stretch, responded when called
upon in the lane and was outkicked late in the lane. SOVIET STANDARD pressed the pace from between rivals to upper stretch and weakened in the lane.
TWO COOKIE RULE raced mid-pack in striking distance, went wide coming home losing position and showed some late interest keeping on through the
lane. MAD DRAGON awkwardly away from the gate, settled into stride, rushed up with an early bid to be prominent and flattened out. KENNESAW chased
the leaders from the fence while saving ground, cut the corner turning for home to loom in upper stretch, was bumped in upper stretch by tiring rival causing
him to bounce off the rail and be taken in hand having been eliminated. LIMA ZULU stalked the pace into the turn, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter
pole, bumped inside rival while tiring in the stretch and gave way through the lane.
