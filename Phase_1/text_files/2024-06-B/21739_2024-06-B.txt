Footnotes
GHOSTLY ROSE saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch, kicked in and won going away. TORCH IS PASSED set the pace in the
two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. CENTERFOLD GUY chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally but
kept on to hold clear of the rest. SHACE SLOANE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and passed tiring rivals. HONOR THAT DUDE
failed to menace while racing two wide. ZADDY bumped with FIGHTING WORDS near the half-mile marker, chased the pace two wide around the turn and
lacked a closing bid. FEAR THE FACTS chased the pace three wide and faded through the stretch. RUN MY CARD was bumped at the start, saved ground
and made little impact. FIGHTING WORDS had some early speed three wide, bumped near the half-mile marker and retreated.

Footnotes
SAMMY'S SAMARITAN set the pace in the two path, was roused after the half and tipped inside entering the turn, opened up passing the quarter and in
upper stretch, drifted out in the final furlong, but held safely. THINGSRGETTINHARRY stalked in the three path, was coxed along in the four path rounding
the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, hung on his left lead, but ran on for place. AMAZING JETT tracked in the two path, came under a
ride going into the turn, and kept on from the three path down the lane for show. TEXAS AIR FORCE broke out at the start, trailed along the inside early,
angled out to the five path and was driven around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact while hanging on his
left lead. FIFTY ONE FIFTY bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, but was one
paced down the lane. TESTA DURA bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn,
but yielded entering the stretch.

BARRY THE BUILDER chased in the four path, was coaxed to bid around the three-eighths mark, took command passing the quarter, and kicked away
under a drive. JOE FROM KIEV bumped with an inner foe at the start, then veered in and bumped the same inner foe just after causing a chain reaction,
rated in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, and chased on from said position down the stretch for place. RAPSCALLION got bumped by an outer foe
and had to check early, trailed in the three path early, was roused passing the three-eighths mark, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and
finished evenly for show. WICKED PHANTOM got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe and had to steady just after the start, raced wellback in the
three path and made no impact. BIGLY DEAL went clear around the first turn to set the pace in the four path down the backside, was roused from the three
path early around the far turn, but lost the lead midway around the far turn, and faded in the stretch. RUBY'S BIG RED bumped with an outer foe at the
start, then got pinched and had to steady just after, raced off the pace in the five path but was no menace. BULLET BLUES bumped between foes at the
start, then got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe and had to steady just after, tracked in the two path but backed up around the far turn. NO
CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE RUNNING JUST AFTER THE START

Footnotes
VITO'S BROTHER set the pace in the two path and widened while drifting out in the stretch. BREEZE THE BAYOU pressed the winner in the three path,
was no match for that foe but held clear of the rest. AMAZING WOO chased the pace from the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and held on for the
show. WINE GOGGLES lacked early speed, raced five wide and never threatened. DYNAMIC EMPIRE failed to menace while racing two wide. FOURTY
FOUR played no factor while racing four wide. BLAME DENNIS chased the pace three wide between foes, steadied near the half-mile pole and offered no
further bids.

Footnotes
BIG BAND LUZZIANN showed the way in the three path, went clear midway down the backstretch, continued to get away under confident handling in the
two path rounding the far turn, was coaxed from the four path at the top of the lane, and held sway. CONFER chased in the three path, was ridden between
foes in the two path around the far turn, angled out to the six path while hanging on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. LINNY KATE
raced off the pace in the five path, was driven four wide around the far turn, got bumped out to the eight path by an inner foe at the top of the lane, and kept
on for show. STARRY HOPE trailed in the three path, swung from the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, angled inwards, and stayed on. I'M
BLUSHING laid in midpack in the four path down the backside, was roused while three wide early around the far turn, floated out to the six path bumping an
outer foe in upper stretch, and flattened. LADY DOMINANCE rated in the four path but did not threaten from the seven path down the stretch. LUCKY GIRL
COCO prompted the early pace in the four path, but faded in the stretch. COMPASS FIRE tracked in the two path but weakened along the inside around the
far turn.

LIGHTS OF BROADWAY was pinched back at the start, trailed inside, advanced inside into the far turn, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths marker,
swept to the front in midstretch and drew off under a drive. CATTIN pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead midway around the far turn, led to
midstretch and was no match for the winner in the final furlong. YACOWLEF (IRE) bumped the winner at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out in
upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. CENTRODELANTERO set the pace in the two path and weakened in the
drive. AMERICAN SPEED failed to menace while racing three and four wide. MY FAVORITE TOPIC chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid.
HUSBAND MATERIAL raced in range three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA tracked in the four path, ranged up under coaxing to bid passing the quarter, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane,
took the lead just after the eighth pole, and held sway. NOW SHOWING laid in range in the two path, waited behind the leader rounding the far turn, angled
out to the seven path under rousing turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. E M'S TREASUREGIRL showed the way in the two path, received a right
handed cue passing the three-eighths mark, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, but was caught by an outer pair in the final furlong to show.
LADY AZTECA chased in the four path, came under right handed urging midway around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch,
but made no impact. GRACE DARLING (IRE) rated in the three path, was coaxed along rounding the far turn, but flattened down the lane. GOOD BRIGHT
FLAMES rated off the pace inside and never threatened. MY ROYAL VOW laid up close in the three path but weakened in the stretch. DIAMONDS FOR
LILY trailed throughout.

WICKLOW GAL stalked in the five path turning into the backstretch, bid for the lead after a half, took command while merging into the two path nearing the
far turn, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn, kicked away while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, and held sway.
SANDPIPER MEMORIES tracked inside, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and ran on for place.
DUBSTEP had a slow start, trailed in the three path, moved up in the two path rounding the far turn, and kept on inside of foes down the stretch for show.
DON'T GET PICKLED was unhurried in the two path early, came under a drive and tipped out to the five path entering the far turn, fanned out to the nine
path at the top of the lane, and improved position. NANA FANNY raced off the pace in the four path, was roused into the far turn, but made no impact.
DREAM TRAP prompted the early pace in the three path, was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the
lane, and did not factor. BOSTON PRINCESS set the pace along the inside, was challenged passing the half, surrendered the lead and was cued in the two
path around the three-eighths mark, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, but gaveway in the final furlong. STREAKING GREY had an awkward
start, was steadied around the first turn, laid in range from the two path down the backside, was roused in the three path entering the far turn, but weakened
in the stretch. WICCA WISDOM rated in the three path but was no menace.
