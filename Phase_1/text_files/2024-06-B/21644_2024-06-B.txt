Footnotes
HONEY PLEASE was hustled to contention then steadied off the inside flank of GOLDEN RUN passing the seven sixteenths pole, altered course and
resumed her bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep past the quarter and held on well with only moderate encouragement. The latter
angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail past the quarter and was steadily
handled to hold second. STATELY APRIL gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. HEY MACARENA gave chase, raced off
the rail on the turn then eased out entering the stretch but showed little in the lane. NEVER WALK ALONE chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and
weakened. MOUSE TO MOUSE gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn. SARAH'S PRIDE chased outside and rounded the turn in the four and five
paths.

STROLLINGINTHEWIND stalked inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide leaving the far turn, dueled clear toward mid-stretch
and widened under steady urging. CHANGE YOUR LUCK angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths
pole, was met at even terms midway on the far turn, dropped back leaving the eighth pole and settled for second best. HOT FUDGE SONDE stalked from
the four path the first turn, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, but flattened stride
leaving the turn. LOST WEEKEND saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, raced in the four and five paths on the far turn
and passed some rivals in the lane. AGAIN WE MEET hesitated leaving the gate, saved ground racing well back and bid only mildly leaving the seven
sixteenths pole. HAPPY YEARS settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. SCARE
DEM showed little response through the backstretch. SAM WHEAT stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. IRISH FLIGHT was not a factor.

O K SMARTY PANTS engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, took the lead inside the sixteenth pole and
held on under steady urging. JLODIAMOND was hustled to contention and entered the turn off the rail, angled to the six path approaching the head of the
lane, lugged in past the eighth pole, drifted out from mid-stretch and finished well. REMY'S HOTSHOT angled to the inside and set a pressured pace, raced
with the edge nearest the rail on the turn, gave up the lead past the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. MAMA MARGE gave chase, raced off the rail on the
turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SLEWING gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and closed
the gap in the lane. BET YOUR BOOTS came away awkwardly then saved ground.

Footnotes
TRIPLE BAD gave chase toward the inside through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, was eased out toward the top of the stretch, dug in for the
lead inside the sixteenth pole and inched clear under the wire. JUBA BOUND angled in and rated a slim lead three wide through the backstretch, rounded
the turn near the rail and was steadily handled leaving the turn, but gave up the advantage past the sixteenths pole and reluctantly ceded later yards. FREE
DROP BACH chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, angled to the outside entering the stretch and dueled through late yards
for third. COLT ROCK chased through the backstretch, entered the turn about the three path, was carried out toward the top of the stretch and ran evenly in
the lane. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS chased, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. REMYS GUNSMOKE engaged in close early chase
but steadied off the inside flank of Juba Bound in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. ANGEL OF
ATTACK was never a factor. CHARITABLE WINDSOR stumbled to his nose leaving the gate and lost the rider. The Stewards conducted a review of the
start of this race, and also reviewed and rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Juba Bound for alleged interference through the backstretch, lodged by
the rider of Remys Gunsmoke.

Footnotes
TIZ VINNO stalked two deep on the first turn, challenged into the backstretch and dueled for the nod approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge
through the turn and dug in under determined handling to draw clear later yards. PASS THE CASH rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of Tiz
Vinno leaving the half mile pole, ceded the nod to that one approaching the quarter, though remained close nearest the rail to mid-stretch before relenting.
DEE DEE SIX raced off the rail the first turn, started her bid leaving the half mile pole and improved steadily from that point, rounded the far turn about the
five path and came along for third mid-stretch. S S ITS FUN TO RUN rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase past the half mile pole, rounded the
far turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. DICE ARM was bumped leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. FEATHER WISH ducked out and made contact with Dice Arm leaving the gate then rated close in
the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the three path on the far turn. MONSTER SUMMER showed
little response through the backstretch. BOBBI TWO STEPS raced in the five path the opening turn and showed little response leaving the turn. HIDDEN
RIVER saved grouind.
