the stretch to prove much the best under left handed crop urging. EDWARD MADDEN stalked the pace three to four wide and was between rivals on the
turn and then fought on to the wire to gamely hold the place award. RAPID RESPONSE stalked the pace on the outside and was five wide on the turn and
chased on while being out-kicked for the place award. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY stalked the pace two to three wide and faded. IMMORTALIZATION was
settled early,, came wide into the lane and had no rally. MOGALU showed good early speed on the inside and weakened on the turn. JIMMY THE KID set
