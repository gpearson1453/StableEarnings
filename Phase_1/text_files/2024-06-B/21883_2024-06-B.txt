VANDULIE saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win as the rider pleased. BABY MARTINI was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide, moved
up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and while unable to threaten the winner, finished well for second. MY MOTORHOME prompted VANDULIE to the
stretch while two-wide and held on fairly well for third. JUST PIN ME saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be four-wide entering the
stretch but failed to seriously threaten.

Footnotes
TAINO HOUSE was allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide nearing the three-eighths pole to reach contention, gained a slight lead from DECIMATE
nearing the eighth pole then dueled with that one from that point and prevailed narrowly. DECIMATE set the pressured pace while two-wide, responded
when headed nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely to lost a tough decision. ARTHUR SPOONER was prominently placed while three-wide, angled in
leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished in a mild rally. THOUGHTS OF GOLD disputed the pace set by DECIMATE from along the inside into the
stretch and weakened. PICK A LANE FRANK was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, swung out to come four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
OUR VALLEY was forwardly placed to near the three-eighths pole racing along the inside then was taken in hand pulled up entering the stretch and was
transported off the track via the equine ambulance.

UNCLE PETE was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the eighth pole, came in slightly to bump with ALZATI nearing the quarter pole
and then finished fast to be up in the final strides. KNIGHTLINE saved ground setting the pace, settled into the stretch with a clear lead and just failed to
hold off the winner in a game effort. PRINCE OF MEMPHIS saved ground chasing the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally.
ALZATI was prominent from the start while two-wide, came out slightly to bump with UNCLE PETE nearing the quarter pole and weakened late. MO
MAMBO saved ground while being allowed to settle, came two-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. JACOB YEN was unhurried early, came five-wide into
the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. BUTTONSARENOTTOYS dropped back early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. THE

ALSO CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO IT, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED THERE WAS MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO
CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LOUIE THE FIRST was off a step slow then rushed up to set the pressured pace, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole then responded when
asked and prevailed under strong handling. STREET MOGUL saved ground while being close-up, slipped through entering the stretch, offered a bid nearing
the eighth pole but was unable to get by the winner in a game effort. KNOCKOUT GUY was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, found room entering the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. MR. EXECUTIVE prompted LOUIE THE FIRST while racing two-wide but lacked the needed late response. JULLIAN IN
PARIS broke out then dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. A LOT OF VERVE steadied from between horses shortly
after the start then was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to seriously threaten. PAKAS SECRET was prominently placed
early while two-wide and weakened. ENJOY THE MOMENT was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and tired. AVELLINASA was unhurried early,
came four-wide into the stretch but was not a factor.

Footnotes
MOON TIME dueled with SENSEMAKER for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole, brushed with
REGULATION DAZED at the top of the stretch, continued to duel on to the wire and prevailed narrowly while drifting out slightly late. REGULATION DAZED
broke slowly to get away behind his field, then moved up strongly on the final turn while two-wide, checked running up on horses heels nearing the quarter
pole, found room between horses entering the stretch, brushed with MOON TIME AND SENSEMAKER at the point and then finished strongly to miss in a
game try. SUMMER SHANDEE was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and rallied late. SENSEMAKER dueled with MOON TIME from along the
outside, drifted out slightly at the three-sixteenths pole then brushed with REGULATION DAZED shortly after that and lacked the needed late response.
ATOMIC CANDY was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally. WEAR THE CROWN saved ground
stalking the pace, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole and weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
INVOLING MOON TIME, REGULATION DAZED AND SENSEMAKER AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED IT
WAS MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MOTIVATING FORCE dueled with CHINOOK BEND for the lead from along the inside, drifted out 3-w leaving the three-sixteenths pole, continued to dueled
for the lead from that point and prevailed in a prolonged drive. COY ROY chased the early pace while two-wide slipped through between horses entering the
stretch then dueled with MOTIVATING FORCE from that point and missed in a game try. BENNY BUCKETS saved ground while being reserved off the
pace, slipped through entering the stretch, offered a bold bid at the eighth pole but was unable to stay with the top two late. FIRST ENDEAVOR settled in
the middle of the field while three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly. BOSSYBYNATURE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the
stretch but failed to seriously threaten. CHINOOK BEND dueled with MOTIVATING FORCE from along the outside, came four-wide into the stretch and
tired. RALLIFIED dropped back while saving ground and failed to menace.
