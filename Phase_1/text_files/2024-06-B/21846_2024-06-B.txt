Footnotes
SONADORA GIRL laid in range in the two path, was roused along the rail into the turn, bid inside of the pacesetter midway around the turn, took command
passing the quarter, floated out to the five path on her left lead while opening up slightly in upper stretch, switched leads passing the eighth pole, and
continued to draw clear. WEST BANK stalked in the five path, came under coaxing going into the turn, tipped out to the seven turning into the stretch, and
chased on for place. KHOZANKA tracked along the rail, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, and finished evenly to be up for show. MISS
TAPTRESS got a bit fractious in the gate slightly delaying the start and had her head turned as the doors opened, rated in the four path, was driven in the
five path around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. LACE CURTAIN laid up close in the four path but
flattened down the lane. LADIDA set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue from the three path when challenged midway around the turn, but
lost the lead before the quarter and faded in the stretch. SPANISH GIRL raced off the pace six path and never menaced. FAMILY STASH trailed
throughout.

LE BEAU pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and lasted. NO MO CANDY settled in range two
wide early, raced four wide around the far turn, rallied outside and just missed. BRITISH EMPRESS set the pace along the rail, led to the quarter pole,
fought on inside of the winner past the eighth pole and was outfinished. TAP MY BELLE raced in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. MAKIA
bumped with ELECTRIC RUNNER at the start, saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. ELECTRIC RUNNER
bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and had no response. AMANDAANNADREW trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
QUEEN DEYMAR laid off the pace in the four path, was driven from the five path into the far turn, swung from the four path to bid at the top of the lane, took
the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. GRANDMA'S PUDDING chased in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, but
got stymied between foes passing the quarter, tipped out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. ANDIE ONE bumped with an outer
foe at the start, trailed in the two path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and rallied to get
up for show. R AWESOME SAUCE bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the two path, was roused from the rail midway around the far turn, bid
along the rail near the eighth pole, but flattened in the final sixteenth. VELOCISSIMA showed the way in the two path, was coaxed into the far turn, but
faded in the stretch. SHE'S SO BEARRISH stalked in the four path, was pushed along from the three path into the far turn, angled out to the five path
passing the eighth pole, but weakened. STRATEGY QUEEN rated in the three path but never menaced.

THENORTHREMEMBERS settled off the pace while racing two wide, split rivals in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive. TIZ A TALE pressed the
pace between foes in the three path and finished willingly to be a clear second. UBIQUITOUS prompted the pace the the five path and kept on to gain the
show without threatening. ACAMAR saved ground in range, made some progress in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. GRAND VALLEY
failed to menace while racing three wide. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK set a pressured pace in the two path and weakened in the stretch. NEXT FLIGHT
prompted the pace between foes in the four path and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MR NARCISSISTIC laid up close in the four path, bid in the three path midway around the turn, was roused from the four path into the lane, kicked on while
dueling with the inner pacesetter into the final furlong, stuck his head in front passing the sixteenth, and held firm. AWESOME CRUSADER set the pace in
the two path, was nudged along into the turn, got confronted by an outer foe midway around the turn, dug in gamely while dueling with that outer foe to hold
onto the lead passing the eighth pole, but was edged out in the final sixteenth to place. HILARIOUS AFFAIR raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden
into the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and rallied for show. CANTARO trailed in the three path but made no impact from the five path in the
stretch. SWASHBUCKLE tracked in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, but flattened down the lane. MAPTITUDE chased in
the three path, was coaxed from the rail around the turn, but was one paced in the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SOPHIA'S STORM stalked the pace from the rail, squeezed through a tight opening inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
EAST WING dueled inside KIKILOVE while racing in the two path, led to midstretch and held on for the place. ADIOS BABE raced in range three wide
between foes, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, had aim outside in midstretch but could gain the show. TROTTING GEAR raced off the pace
two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch but lacked the needed rally. KIKILOVE dueled in the three path and faded through the lane. MISS UCRANIA
played no factor while racing three wide. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER tracked the pace four and five wide and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
K. C. CHIEF set the pace in the three path, received a right handed cue from just off the rail passing the three-eighths mark, and drew clear down the lane
under a drive. KING D'ORO tracked in the two path, was ridden from the rail into the far turn, angled out to the three path passing the eighth pole, and ran
on for place. O CAPTAIN had an awkward start, trailed in the three path, was roused from the four path passing the three-eighths mark, floated out to the six
path at the at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. HAPPY RUNNER bumped with an inner foe at the start, was held up while in range from the three
path, coaxed midway around the far turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, but flattened around the sixteenth. TREASURE KING chased in the five
path, was coaxed along in the three path around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, but did not factor. BLUE SLIDE PARK
bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path but did not threaten. SPY HUNTER laid up close in the four path but gaveway from the three
path down the lane.

Footnotes
STAR OF THE BEAST pressed the pace in the three path, vied between foes in the lane, had the rider lose the whip in midstretch and responded gamely to
strong hard urging to outfinish foes on both sides. KALIMAN tracked the pace in the four path, rallied outside, reached near even terms near the sixteenth
pole but was turned back by the winner. PAEZ set the pace in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished
through the final sixteenth. RAGS SPECIAL steadied near the half-mile, saved ground and never threatened. DANCINGINTHESTORM broke in a tangle,
raced three wide and was never a threat. ORANGE LAKE hesitated at the start, chased the pace four wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane.
