bid on the turn then flattened out late. LIL' LATE LUCK lacked speed along the inside then offered some late energy. TREASURE PEACE prompted pace
outside, bid clear in midstretch then yielded to the winner. NURSE CARALYN in tight early, dropped far behind and lacked solid rally. UNBRIDLED SASS
chased very wide down the backstretch and was no factor. SWEET MISCHIEF urged off the leaders outside and faltered. SWEETEST MOMENT dropped
far behind inside then passed fading rivals. BATTALIA hustled to the front inside, vied on the turn then gave way. FIVE STAR FRAN flashed speed inside
then stopped abruptly. COLETTE'S SPIRIT trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LIBERTY STAR saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch then drew off in the final furlong driving. PYLON set the pace inside, led to midstretch, was
unable to contain the winner and held well for the place. MAXIM MOMENT forced the pace outside, challenged the leader on the turn then weakened
slightly. HIDE THE RANSOM chased three wide then lacked solid rally through the stretch. REJECTED AGAIN prompted the pace along the rail and outside
to the stretch and faltered. HIBACHI trailed to the late stages and was never a factor. WE READY dropped back early, raced very wide throughout and was
outrun.

PUT THE CRAZY AWAY bid outside on the turn, took over into the stretch and pulled away under wraps. FAST MOTION broke step slowly, rushed to the
front inside, was collared after half and proved easily second best. MISS CINNAMON dropped well back wide then finished willingly while no threat.
POWER AND GLORY bumped about early, trailed far behind then passed trio of rivals. FAST GAL chased in the two path and weakened steadily. SWANS
ISLAND bumped about early, flashed speed outside and stopped. DISCO FLASH flashed speed in the opening quarter then gave way readily.

PLEASANT DREAMS stalked the pace inside, bid into the stretch and drew away under moderate pressure. LOST IN THOUGHT controlled the pace to the
stretch then proved easily second best while no match for the winner. DRIVEN TO SUCCESS trailed early, advanced on the final turn then flattened out.
WHISKEYSTREETBLUES settled off the pace outside and lacked a response. THE LAST JET moved close up under rating hold for half mile and stopped.
ROCK IT RUBY flashed speed for half a mile and gave way readily.

HARLEY'S CHARLY settled close up inside, bid three wide on the turn then edged clear in the final furlong. DREAM KNIGHT led under pressure inside, lost
the advantage in midstretch and continued gamely. KABOD prompted the pace outside and continued willingly to the finish. BIG JOHN dropped well behind
inside, moved wide in the stretch with some late energy. SMART AND FAST hustled off the leaders inside then gave way on the turn. ROCKIN FREEBEE
moved briefly closer after half a mile then faded. MIL DOSCIENTOS broke very poorly losing any chance at the start. SUMMER ASH displayed poor action
from the outset and trailed far back throughout.

WIND NINETY NINE saved ground, moved closer after the half, bid three wide in the stretch and was up in a long drive. LEGAL DEAL led inside, dueled
after half mile to finish in a game showing. ROAN MOUNTAIN bumped early, settled three wide, faded on the final turn then came again inside for the show.
VINE JET pressed the pace outside, led briefly at the quarter pole then weakened late. YODEL E. A. WHO shuffled back early, dropped far behind and was
no threat. JAA MODE was in tight soon after the start then gave way into the far turn. A claim of foul by the fifth finisher against the third finisher for early
interference was dismissed.

Footnotes
CURLINS CRUZIN controlled the pace, widened when ready on the turn and drew away handily. VIRAL VIDEO lacked speed inside, angled out in the
stretch and was up for the place. EXCLUSIVE DANCER far behind early, bid inside on the turn and closed well. STAR OF CAESAREA went after the
winner on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. CRAIGH NA DUN saved ground close up then gave way through the stretch. MAKEMYDAYCHARLIE
broke slowly then lacked a rally. BIAGIO prompted the pace opening quarter then stopped. CARRY GRANT trailed far behind and was eased in the stretch.

stretch and rallied strongly. SPEAKING prompted the pace along the inside, went after the winner, on the turn then weakened late. YOUNG SQUIRE
crowded
just

SIMOVITCH eased back off the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch, collared the leaders and pulled away eagerly late. WINDSOR GOLD underwent shoe
repair in the paddock, vied outside, led in the stretch then weakened. CONCEALED CARRY alternated for the advantage inside then faltered in the stretch.
RON DON SCORESE chased wide off the pace and continued well while no threat. SAILOR'S RETURN dropped back along the inside and lacked a
response. TIME TO CRUISE lacked speed, faded after half a mile and was no factor. WISH FOR PEACE trailed early in the two path and was always
outrun.

Footnotes
RETWEET far behind inside, advanced outside on the final turn, moved very wide into the lane then surged clear in the final furlong. BIG BOYS ANSWER
eased back early, angled inside rivals into the stretch and closed well. T REX outrun for three quarters, bid, was taken up between rivals at the eighth pole
and finished willingly. SPY NOVEL moved close up, bid on the final turn then flattened out late. EFF THIRTY FIVE took over after half a mile outside, shook
loose on the final turn then weakened in the stretch. BANDOOLA saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. LIGHTNING RIDGE bid closer on the final
turn then came up empty in the stretch. PICTURE THIS dropped far behind and was never a factor. FACTOR U AND ME IN alternated for lead for half a
mile then began fading on the final turn. ROAN BURGUNDY dropped back early and lacked a response.

Footnotes
LEVIOSA stalked the leader inside, took over after half mile and stayed safe driving. HIGHTIME VALENTINE settled off the pace, bid four wide into the
stretch with a gradual late gain. GIA'S FUEGO prompted leaders three wide, bid on the turn and continued willingly. BOCA ROYALTY saved ground off the
pace and narrowed gap late. CAPTIVATING CARA far behind early, offered some late energy. GAVICHI set pace just off the inside then weakened in
stretch. MORE RANSOM saved ground and was never a factor. SCINTILLATING STAR chased in midpack and faltered. JULIET'S MUSIC raced well off
the pace outside and faded. MELODIA trailed far behind losing contact with her field.
