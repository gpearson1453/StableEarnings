Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT angled in to race off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn, began a bid passing the
quarter pole, gained ground in the lane and kicked clear late despite drifting mildly near the wire. DOCTOR OSCAR dueled on the inside through the
opening quarter, continued to battle from the two path around the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught in the final furlong. BUGLER pressed
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and chased on in the stretch. SLIM SLOW SLIDER tracked the leader
on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. MINISTER OF SOUL dueled between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the stretch. HEY NOW stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in
the five path and faded from there. DIVINE LEADER raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three
path and made no bid.

RED'S MR Z raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path
coming around the far turn and kicked clear in the lane. INCREEDIBLE VICTOR raced in the three path early, chased the leaders up the backstretch,
challenged from the three path coming around the second bend, dueled in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. LL'S CLASSY DUDE lost his rider on a rear
before loading into the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the
three path and improved position in the stretch. KAPTAINS KROWN dueled on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around
the far turn and faded in the lane. LEGACYINTHEMAKING raced in the three path around the first bend, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around
the far turn still in the three path and made no bid. MORNING THUNDER raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the
