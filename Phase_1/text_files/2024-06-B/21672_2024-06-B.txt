bend to rally in the late stretch and be up for the place prize. CATHOLIC SUE track the from the two path and well maintaining the second position down the
backstretch, was in a steady drive on the turn to take over the lead in the upper stretch, then was out finished by an outer foe and missed the place position
in the end. BACK IN CHARGE was allowed to settle towards the back while two wide, moved up on the turn while in a strong bid, then came up evenly in
the stretch. GYPSAN broke outwardly, then settled towards the back in the three path, bid mildly on the turn and kept on down the lane to no avail in the
end. CAPETOWN CANDY was unhurried early and no threat. LEOPARD BAIT tracked the pace in third position from the inside down the backstretch was
in a moderate pace throughout the turn then lacked responding in the late stretch. ELENA MAE emerged from the pack to show the way along the rail was

Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT tracked the pace while two wide, was nicely rated down the backstretch, was encouraged steadily leaving the far bend to tip past the
pace setter, gained command in the upper stretch and held on well to the end to claim victory. MONGOLIAN BEE saved ground while tracking the pace
from the three path in the early stages, then bid on the far turn to menace in the early stretch, but could not catch the determined leader and was second
best in the end. STANS HOME RUN saved ground in the early furlongs while racing between rivals midfield, then bid on the far turn, menaced in upper
stretch to get up to the third position but did not have enough to catch the cleared leader in the end. QUARTERBACK DAK tucked along the inside towards
the back of the pack in the early furlongs, then bid mildly on the far turn, rallied in the late stretch, but it was too little in the end. DESOTO'S WAR broke
outwardly and bumped rival, then raced towards the back of the field while three wide, rallied mildly leaving the far bend and into the stretch but it was not
enough in the end. ABSAROKA set the pace from the inside headed into the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn, then faltered in the
homestretch. HAMAZING WISDOM raced along the rail in the middle of the pack was in a moderate pace throughout and needed rally in the latter half. HIT
ONE OUT was bumped at the start and failed to rally.

SUITABLE dueled from the inside into the turn, took command while in a steady drive then held on well down the lane while in a determined rally to prevail
in the end. IMPERIAL RED BIRD pursued the pace from the inside into the turn, then menaced in the upper stretch and went shoulder to shoulder for the
place posiition in the final yards and was up at the wire. CLEAT chased the pace while two wide into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch and was
closing well just missing the pace position in the end. LARRY'S LEGEND prompted the pace while three wide and in a strong drive, then rallied on the turn,
lacked the winning bid to overcome the leader and gave way in the end. ELUSIVE D'ORO was allowed to settle along the rail, then rallied in the late stretch
and came up empty. SPONGE BATH chased the pace while three wide and outside of rivals, then came out five wide leaving the bend and lacked rallying in
the final yards. LOUISIANA FLASH was away well to duel with the inner rival into the turn, continued to press the emerging leader while in a hard drive, was
used up in the upper stretch and tired in the end.

WITHOUT A TRACE sparred with an inner foe down the backstretch and into the turn, was in a long drive, then found more in the late stretch to kick clear
and prove best in the end. BANDERA AZTECA dueled from the inside down the backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the turn then was outkicked in the
late stretch and was second best. COUSIN LARRY stalked the pace from the two path, then came out three wide leaving the turn to rally in the late stretch,
battled for the show prize and was up at the wire. MYSTERY MO stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, continued to bid in close behind the
leaders on the turn, then menaced in the late stretch just missing the show prize in the end. HEIR TO GREATNESS pressed the dueling leaders from the
three path and in a hard drive down the backstretch, was depleted on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
CINNAMON FACE shifted outside the emerging leader into the first turn to track the pace from the two path down the backstretch, remained well rated
before inching up on the far turn, met with an inner foe to spar in the late stretch then kicked clear to be up in the final strides in the end.
SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT moved up while three wide on the first turn to press the leader down backstretch from the two path, bid on the far turn to gain
command briefly at the quarter pole, then was challenged by an outer foe to duel in the late stretch and was outkicked in the end. TEMPLAR RED was
forwardly placed along the inside to track the pace down the backstretch, was in a moderate pace throughout the far turn, dug in a gamely in the late stretch
and was able to get up for the show position in the end. DOUDOUDOUWANADANCE set the pace from the inside into the first turn, maintained the lead
heading into second turn while in a steady drive, was overtaken at the quarter pole, then found a little more in the final yards while in a gamely rally and just
missed the show prize in the end. OPTIMISTIC COWGIRL was allowed to settle towards the back of the field while two wide in the early furlongs, then
rallied leaving the far turn and closed too little too late in the end. MY FRIEND AMY was unhurried early and no threat. ENCHANTED NILE failed to
menace.

TIGER DAD pursued the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, shifted inwards heading into the stretch, dug in gamely to edge past
the pace setter in late stretch and prevailed while in a strong drive. GRAPNEL angled in towards the rail to set the pace down the backstretch, drifted out
slightly leaving the bend, was in an all out drive then was out finished in the late stretch and was best for place. RUNWAY MAGIC was unhurried early, then
came out four wide leaving the bend, rallied in the late stretch, besting the rest of the field and was up for third place in the end. HOSTILE AFLEET bid for
the lead while two wide then chased the emerging leader briefly before dropping back heading into the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. SAMMY
DANSEUR JR. was allowed to settle in the two path in the rear duo, then bid on the turn while three wide and was no threat. DOSE'S DREAM was allowed
to settle along the inside in the back duo, then bid mildly on the turn and was no threat.

SPEIGHTSVILLE bid for the lead while two wide, then dueled with an inner foe into the turn, gained command in the upper stretch while in strong drive and
lasted to the wire to prevail. RANCH BADGE raced at the rear of the pack, then fanned out five wide leaving the turn and closed well down the lane while
passing inner rivals and was up for the place prize in the end. CASTILLE bid for the lead while three wide, then settled back to chase the emerging leaders
into the turn, was in a gamely rally leaving the turn and kept on for the show prize in the end. BALSA lunged at the start, then hustled to catch up with the
pack, bid while four wide on the turn, rallied gamely in the stretch and just missed the show prize in the end. DICEY WAGER bid for the lead from the inside
early, then sparred with an outer foe heading into the turn, could not retain bid and gave way in the stretch. DUDE PERFECTA chased the pace while two
wide into the turn, then menaced in the early stretch but did not have enough in the end. PURE MALICE was off a step slower then the field leaving the gate
and was no menace. PUTMAN chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace throughout the first half and did not spark in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLYING CAESAR broke inwardly then chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, remained well rated on the turn, then dug in gamely in the
upper stretch and swept by the pace setter in the final yards and was up in the final strides to prevail. MR. TEXAS CHARM emerged from the pack to set the
pace from the inside down the backstretch, was challenged by an inner foe on the turn, cleared that foe, was in long drive in the upper stretch then was out
finished by an outer foe in the final yards. OBVIOUS CONCLUSION was unhurried early, then bid four wide on the turn to rally mildly in the upper stretch,
could never catch the leaders and was up for the show prize. LEONARDO CREED trailed well behind the field down the backstretch, then came out six wide
leaving the bend to bid mildly in the stretch and came up empty. RICH MOUNTAIN pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, was in a steady
drive throughout the turn, could not overpower the leader and flattened out in the stretch. GOING TO SANANTONE chased the pace while four wide and
outside of rivals down the backstretch, then bid on the turn while two wide and needed more in the home stretch. BAYOU BOY was no rally. CANDY
BINDER chased the pace from the inside down the early backstretch, then bid gamely heading in the turn in attempt to overtake the leader, was in tight,
steadied then gave way in the final stages. CAPOTE'S GLITTER was no menace. JAMIAN hustled from the rear to meet with field on the turn while four
wide, was hard used in the upper stretch and tired in the end. VIGILANT STORM drifted outwardly shortly after the start then steadied off heels and failed to
rally. There was an INQUIRY in regards to interference on the turn. After review, there was no change made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
CRANKY SHEILA sparred from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, gained command in the upper stretch while in steady drive then held on
determinedly to prevail in the end. FLYING FIRST CLASS veered outwardly, then dueled with an inner foe throughout the early stages, drifted out four to
five wide leaving the bend and was out finished in the end. SPACE PIRATE was reserved in the early furlongs towards the back of the field, then shifted out
five leaving the turn and surged down the lane and just missed victory in the end. SOLECITA was allowed to settle along the rail towards the rear of the
field, remained reserved on the turn then rallied mildly in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. IMMA GOING TO WIN was impeded at the start,
then chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, rallied on the turn from the inside then kept on down the lane to no avail in the end.
COWGIRLSLIKEBLING chased the pace while four wide mid pack, then bid on the turn while three wide, continued in the early stretch before giving way in
the end. TAPITSGOTAPISTOL moved away from the pack to press the dueling leaders from the three path into the turn, could not outbid the pair heading
into the stretch and flattened out. TOO MUCH GUITAR chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then urged eagerly between foes on the
turn before flattening out in the stretch. STARTECA was out run and no menace.

Footnotes
WILBURNSCLASSYLADY was forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn, then tracked the pace down the backstretch while nicely rated, bid
gamely on the far turn to split rivals in the early stretch, took over the lead and held on well to prove best in the end. TEXAS TWINKIES saved ground in the
early stages towards the back of the field, bid while three wide on the far turn, dug in gamely in the upper stretch and closed well in the final yards to be up
for the place prize. CASHMERE DANCER raced in the middle of the pack while two wide in the early furlongs, then bid on the far turn while coming out four
wide, rallied in the late stretch and was able to get up for the show position in the end. MY PATRIOTIC GIRL was allowed to settle along the inside, then
raced at an even pace throughout the backstretch and into the far turn, rallied mildly in the late stretch and came up empty in the end. RUN WITT RUN was
reluctant to load, then moved up on the first turn to duel from the two path down the backstretch, gained command by a head on the far turn, then was
overpowered by rivals in the early stretch and yielded in the end. HOURGLASS FIGURE settled at the back in the two path and was no threat in the end.
RIOBELLA led the way into the first turn along the rail, was confronted by an outer foe to spar down the backstretch, continued to press the emerging leader
on the far turn while in steady urge on the far turn, rallied briefly in the upper stretch then gave way in the end.
