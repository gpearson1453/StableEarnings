Footnotes
CHIEFS LIL PEARL hopped at the start then was hustled to assume command, edged away on the backstretch, responded when roused and held drivng.
SOFIA STRONG chased the winner while off the rail, could not impact that one but held off the others. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY was also chasing to the far
turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. MO SUGAFOOT had no speed, trailed to the second turn and was not a
threat. SWISS SCRIPT had brief early speed but gave way after three furlongs.

HYPHY had the best speed, set all the pace inside to the stretch and held under steady urging. HEY WILMAAA pressed the winner throughout while two
wide then was outkicked in the lane but held second. FANTASTIC SECRET had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly and got the
nod for the show. ANTECEDENCE was outsprinted, chased two wide to the stretch then battled FANTASTIC SECRET in the drive but was nipped for third.
TEASPOON OF PEPPER was bumped by ELECTRIC ELIZABETA soon after the start, took up then had no speed and was never a threat. ELECTRIC
ELIZABETA drifted inward early, bumped TEASPOON OF PEPPER then chased the pace two wide for three furlongs and tired.

SPANISH CHANNEL went right to the front, set all the pace from the rail then drew away under steady urging. CALIFORNIA HALO tracked the pace three
wide then eased to the rail and saved ground chasing the winner, could not make an impact but was never threatened for second. LADY RANGER bore out
six wide into the first turn, chased for three furlongs but weakened in the drive. LUTE'S DIAMOND had no speed, was three wide on the second turn and
lacked a closing response. DONTFORGETHESUGAR stumbled badly at the start, had no speed, was widest on the backstretch and not a factor.
WARNING SOUND broke in a tangle then also lacked speed and was outrun. STEEL NERVES chased the pace from the rail to the second turn then gave
way.

PRIME TIME PORTA was on the pace from the outset, edged away on the second turn then held under steady urging. TIZ CURLY JOE chased the leaders
to the second turn, was asked for more three wide and made up some ground late. MR MAKUNOUCHI saved ground throughout but lacked a closing
response. IKE BUTTE had no speed, was four wide to the stretch and did not rally. SENOR AT WAR broke out, straightened but had no speed and was not
a factor. LIL BIT OF HEAVEN disputed the pace with the winner to the second turn then tired.
