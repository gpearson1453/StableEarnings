Footnotes
XERCES set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then shook clear again late and lasted under steady pressure. VANILLA BEAN rated
outside, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place
late. UPPITY UP tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. OMIKAMI unsettled in the gate, was allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and got up for a shaare. BLUEBERRY PIE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, then faded
into the stretch. MY BRIDGET VERDOT unhurried, angled out and moved to position down the backstretch, then faded three wide through the second turn.

SMOOCHING rated outside the leader, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to
the task. CHEERFUL TROUT never far back, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed well for
the place. LAST GLIMMER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final furlong
and held the show. MOST DIVINE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals, angled around a tiring rival and closed
for a share. K'ANTHEIA ran evenly. GOTHAM GRAY unhurried, looped three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no
rally. ELLYMARIE tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong. SUNSET
VIBES pulled in the early going, angled out through the first turn and moved up down the backstretch, then faded four wide through the second turn.

stretch and closed well for the place. VICTORY BADGE unhurried, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain, then flattened late and held the show. ANIPPE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside, angled out for racing
room and could not gain. VACCINA sprinted away from the field quickly, drew off down the backstretch, then faded in the lane. CARINA NEBULA was never
