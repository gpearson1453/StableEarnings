Footnotes
DIXIE'S FLATTER was inside runners stalking in the third tier rating kindly, began to creep closer with five sixteenths to go, started to reach for more ground
in the five path turning for home, seized control by the furlong marker and was kept to the task to hold safe crossing the finish line. MANETKA settled near
the rear down the backside, was asked for more run three eighths out, moved in four wide by the quarter pole, shifted out widest in the seven path gathering
momentum straightening out for home and won the battle for second right at the wire. HIGHLAND ROCKY stalked outside foes in the third flight, was asked
right-handed trying to move with the eventual winner midway on the turn, angled out to the six path for the drive and surged late between challengers to just
miss the place share in a photo. WETIKO had a nice spot watching the contesting duo after the break, tracked outside through the turn, was in the hunt four
wide with rivals on both sides at the top of the lane but needed more late to pose a threat at the wire. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY tracked on the rail in the
second flight at the half, kept pace inside travelling around the oval, skimmed the fence going by the weary early leader at the eighth pole but evened out in
deep stretch. CHEAP SPEED pressed the issue on the rail down the backstretch, dueled up front bobbing heads for the lead around the turn, edged away
from the early speed foe in the two path, clinging onto the lead in upper stretch but gave way nearing the sixteenth pole. STOLZER ONKEL was off poorly to
start, co-trailed on the outside with a half remaining and finished up mildly between horses down the lane. GRAN ADONIS hopped slightly on the break, had
a slim advantage outside contesting the lead in the early stages of the race, continued in the mix up front while three wide between runners turning for home
but had little left to offer and folded at the furlong marker. FINAL RUN FOR LOVE was away slowly to begin, co-trailed inside with his stablemate at the half,
could not get interested around the bend and through the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MOON LANDING travelled in mid-division in this compact bunch early, moved around the outside measuring the lead horse on the turn, closed in smartly
when encouraged right-handed at the top of the lane, went on by at the eighth pole and won going away at the finish line. MUSICAL SPELL was loose on
the lead, going comfortably up top, continued unopposed through the turn, was collared outside by the winner at the furlong marker, offered little resistance
and stayed on to best the rest at the finish line. GRAN SPIRITED had a stalking position, having one beaten down the backside, took closer order on the
fence traveling around the bend, was in with a chance on the rail straightening out for the drive but failed to fire inside to the wire and settled for a clear third
in the end. ZIPPY GIZMO was outrun early, trailing along the backside, made little headway throughout the turn and passed a weary runner in deep stretch.
SOONER LUNAR was content to watch the pacesetter down the backside, chased the frontrunning leader around the bend, was still in the thick of things
two wide with horses on both sides turning for home, could not go on and yielded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
COURAGEOUS COPPER forced the issue outside in the early stages, began to edge away for the outright lead at the quarter pole, spurted clear in upper
stretch and kept on going to the wire for the score. TRICKY MAGICIAN tracked two wide between horses down the backside, waited patiently behind the
embattled duo around the turn, shifted off the leaders three wide finding a seam straightening out for home and won the secondary duel down the stretch.
ALICIA'S KID tracked four deep outside horses down the back straight, closed in four wide by the quarter pole, loom a threat in the five path at the top of the
lane and fought for place share, losing the battle in deep stretch. KID FORESTER tossed his head at the start to trail in the beginning, began to go past
runners outside with a half mile to run, was asked for more midway on the turn, shifted out widest in the five path turning for home and finished with intent to
settle on the fringes. EXCHANGE DAY had a slim advantage inside at the start, forced the pace on the rail around the turn, chased the winner in upper
stretch and retreated on the fence by the furlong marker. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked outside foes in the third flight down the back straight, continued to
run evenly through the turn, angled out to be four wide for the run to the wire and was one paced down the stretch. SEA TO AIR was headstrong fighting the
riders restraint behind horses down the backside, trailed the field by the half, had clear run at the top of the lane, made little impression running mildly inside
to the finish line. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER tried to hustle for a better inside position after the start, but was relegated to a stalking role inside travelling in the
third flight down the backside, made little impact around the bend and had nothing to show for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CAUGHT SPEEDING was lightly bumped at the start, attended the early pace from between runners to the half, lost ground at that juncture stalking into the
turn and switching outside a foe, advanced five wide into upper stretch, took the lead past the furlong marker, forged clear under steady handling.
THEFRONTIERSMAN unhurriedly raced at the rear outside foes heading to the turn, advanced five wide from the three-eighths, swung eight wide turning
for home, kept on to get up for place late. PET SOUNDS vied inside contesting the pace just off the rail, moved out a bit further turning into upper stretch
and with the lead, was soon challenged, yielded grudgingly late and lost place near the wire. NORTH WARDEN was in just a bit tight in the early going,
settled at the rear, came into upper stretch three wide, kept on willingly to get the nod rounding out the super. FOREST FLASH stalked from outside racing
four to six wide through the turn and stretch, ran on evenly late. FROST BITTEN settled off the pace, advanced mildly two to three wide turning into upper
stretch, needed more late. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE pursued from mid-pack off the inside, was encouraged along about the seven-sixteenths, kept on
one-paced. BLONDINA'S BOY was outside foes four to five wide on the turn, failed to menace. UNCLE'S THE BANKER prompted the pace from outside
mostly three to four wide up the backstretch and on the turn, faltered and faded. ALPHA KADIN broke out appearing to bump a rival then steadied slightly at
the start, was ridden along at the back three to four wide on the turn but made no bid. PLAY THE DOTS failed to threaten racing inside. JOHNNY GOLD
chased from inside in the early going, faded.

Footnotes
ECSTASY set a soft pace, narrowly leading down the backstretch inside, continued having a slim margin up top around the turn on the rail, found another
gear when set down at the furlong marker, was well rationed on the front end and repelled rivals in the stretch drive. JESSAMINE HILL veered out on the
break, was content to hound the pace three deep down the backside, continued to measure the inside runners three wide going around the turn, loomed the
main threat four wide straightening out to the wire but was denied by the frontrunner who had something more to offer in deep stretch. ROIKOP tracked with
runners on both sides in the second flight travelling in hand down the backstretch, chased the lead trio at the quarter pole and closed in willingly in the last
furlong to be a non threatening third at the wire. STOLEN VALOUR vied between horses in the early parts of the race, was no match for the top two who
separated themselves from the field at the eighth pole and faded late to settle for a minor share in the end. WHY EM SEA AY was last inside when the field
bunched up at the half, was encouraged right handed five sixteenths from home, made little progress on the turn, spilt tired rivals in the four path
straightening out for the drive but could not get into contention down the lane. YOUSANGTOME settled in midfield behind the front trio down the
backstraight, was roused for more by midturn, could not go with the leaders and backed away at the quarter pole. ARAMI'S FACTOR hesitated then hopped
slightly on the break, tracked three wide outside horses along the backside, was tapped on the shoulder for run with five sixteenths to go, had little response
outside through the turn and emptied out widest in the five path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
MAGIC TOMAHAWK settled off the pace inside, moved out off the rail a bit late on the turn advancing, came out six wide in upper stretch, bid in conjunction
with an inside foe, dueled with that one from the sixteenth pole to the wire and got the nod. TOURIST'S DREAM angled in after the break, settled at the
back saving ground on the turn, came out five wide in upper stretch, dueled with the winner through the final sixteenth and just missed. FOREST STAR
stalked close up, went three wide on the turn, bid past the three-sixteenths obtaining a brief and narrow lead, was outkicked by the top pair but fought on to
get the nod for show. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE broke a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, moved forward to take the lead past the five-eighths, set the pace
from off the rail, could not kick on with the top ones and lost the nod for show. STORMIN DAVE settled toward the rear, was mostly three to five wide on the
turn, swung nine deep turning for home, showed mild late interest. SNOOKERED was unhurried at the rear racing off the rail, gained mildly from between
runners in the stretch. CONFUSING set the early pace from inside, was soon overtaken and continued to chase, saved ground, came out in upper stretch
then back in seeking room in behind the leaders, ran on evenly. YORKVILLE settled off the pace between runners, advanced six wide coming to the quarter
pole, evened out in the lane. FOUR K FORCE was forwardly-positioned chasing four wide on the turn, faded in the stretch. LUCYS CHILD settled well back,
swung nine wide, was never a threat. GATLING GUN was in just a bit tight soon after the start, raced between foes near mid-pack, was empty for the
stretch run. HARDWARE GAP broke outwardly, was not far off the leaders in pursuit outside of foes five wide, gave way.

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD prompted the pace at the break, took over control three quarters from the line, dictated terms up front down the back straight, had a slim
lead on the rail two furlongs from the wire with rivals pressing outside, was encouraged right-handed in upper stretch and drew off convincingly for the win. A
ROSE FOR RAVEN travelled near the rear two wide between runners, improved, narrowing the margin down the backstretch, was roused but seemed to
have stalled on the far turn and rallied impressively in the final sixteenth to best the others crossing the finish line. C C'S KINGDOM threw his head on the
start, made a sharp move to get inside under the wire for the first time, tracked outside around the initial bend, angled to get to the rail by the half to take
closer order, kept pace through the final turn inside, never gave way on the fence in the stretch and came on the capture third at the line. FAST BOAT TO
SKYE tracked the duo inside on the first turn, continued to track but outside, being part of the trio watching the pacesetter at the half, moved around foes
three wide by the quarter pole to be a factor entering the stretch, switched back to the wrong lead at the sixteenth pole and faded between foes late.
CUPID'S CLAWS trailed inside along the backside, saved ground on the far turn but made little progress and could not get involved running to the finish
line. FEELTHEBEAT assumed the front on the break, then relegated to a chasing role behind the frontrunning winner down the back straight, was nudged
between foes in the two path at the quarter pole trying to maintain position but had little left to offer for the stretch run and wilted in the lane. EMBRACE MY
UNCLE settled near the rear outside foes along the backside, was hard ridden three wide in the final flight at the three eighths marker, made a brief run until
the six path at the top of the lane and flattened out in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
SEATTLE DOWN UNDER was unhurried trailing on the rail in the beginning, began to go by runners three deep outside at the half, travelled well picking off
rivals smartly circling four wide on the final bend, bid for the lead in the five path at the top of the lane and won going away at the finish. SUGAR IT'S ELI
broke out bumping fellow rival on the start, traveled near the back outside horses in the first turn, inched closer between foes by the half, started to rally
three wide at the tree eighths marker, continued the sustained run in the six path straightening out for home and closed in down the stretch to be second
best with a solid late kick. COPROLITE was situated just off the fence in midfield in the beginning, rated kindly inside still in mid-pack down the backside,
waited on the rail into the far turn, shifted outside but had no path three wide at the quarter pole, followed the winner five wide for the drive and dueled for
the place share in the lane but settled for the show money at the wire. JACK was four wide in mid-division on the first turn, stalked in the third flight outside
rivals down the backstretch, closed in three wide around horses three eighths out, battled for the front in the three path with rivals on either side turning for
home but lost the duel at the sixteenth pole and settled for a small piece of the prize in the end. CONTINUE APACE (IRE) assumed command on the rail
into the first turn, set the pace with no challengers along the backside, continued up front on the far oval, was collared outside by the winner in mid-stretch
and faded inside in the last sixteenth. HALCON NEGRO settled inside near the rear inside on the first bend, could see the field on the rail by the half, took
the shortest route around on the final turn and passed tiring rivals down the lane. I'VE DECIDED hopped slightly on the break, trailed on the rail in the early
parts of the race, was asked to rally inside at the quarter pole, offered little response and tired at the top of the stretch. HEY LUIGI was bumped inside on
the break, travelled in the third flight on the rail down the backstretch, was under a ride chasing the frontrunner with rivals on both sides midway on the far
turn, could not find more and faltered in the two path turning for home. TALL BOY JOEL prompted the leader five wide on the first turn, was alone chasing
the pacesetter through the back straight, backed away abruptly though the field at the seven sixteenths marker and cantering home crossing the wire.
