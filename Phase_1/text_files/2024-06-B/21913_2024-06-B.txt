Footnotes
STARINA tracked the leaders from three wide down the backstretch, rallied on the turn to take command turning for home, quickly opened a claer lead and
drew off as much best. JOYZELLA stalked the pace to the far turn to be well placed in striking distance, angled five wide for the stretch run and kept
grinding to pick up the place. ELODINE set a well rated pace for three quarters, was no match for the winner at the head of the stretch and weakened late in
the lane. MACHIVA trailed for the first half mile and passed weaker rivals coming home. REALISTIC GOAL raced just off the pacesetter down the backside
along the rail and lacked a response when called upon on the final turn. W W LAST HURRAH was not a factor.

Footnotes
ELLIE DELI stalked the pace through the turn, angled out to the five path at the head of the lane, engaged the pacesetter in mid-stretch, drew clear and was
well in hand near the wire. MAYSTART trailed to mid-stretch and closed with a belated rush from seven wide late in the lane. GO STORMIN GIRL set the
pace on a well measured lead to the quarter pole, responded when called upon to battle through the stretch and was out-finished in deep stretch. PALACE
MAGIC tracked the leaders to upper stretch to be prominent and lacked a closing kick. MYSTIC STORM reserved of the early pace and mounted a mild bid
coming home. LOONA LUV went evenly failing to threaten. RUNNERS HEAT well placed through the turn in striking position and faded in the stretch.

TRIPLE SCOUT tracked the leaders from five wide through the turn, rallied on the outside down the lane to be up in time. LILY'S WOOFY stalked the
pacesetter to the top of the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, battled down the lane but could not hold off the winner in a good effort. DOCS SEVEN
stumbled leaving the gate, trailed to the quarter pole, circled wide down the lane and was gaining in deep stretch coming up just short the victim of the
unfortunate start. RACEDAY ATTIRE well placed just off the leaders, saved ground cutting the corner to loom in mid-stretch and hung down the lane unable
to sustain the rally. ADIVA was not a threat. SHORT STRAW set the pace to the quarter pole and tired through the stretch.

TIME HEIST stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, rallied to engage the pacesetter turning for home and drew away in deep stretch. LATIN
CASINO was well placed along the rail in striking distance on the turn, angled four wide at the head of the lane under a drive and chased the winner home.
MALIGATOR trailed to the quarter pole and showed good late interest to be gaining at the wire. WILDWOOD MINISTRY tracked the leaders through the
turn and lacked a closing kick. TRY TRY AGAIN went evenly failing to menace. CAN MAN DO sped to the lead down the backside and weakened in upper
stretch. BERNIE LOMAX broke wide and was never a factor.

TOWERING STORM reserved in mid-pack down the backside, made a steady gain ont the far turn saving ground, angled four wide in upper stretch, jumped
gate tracks down the lane and continued in a drive to be going away in deep stretch. LONE RETURN was well rated on the lead down the backside,
responded when called upon nearing the quarter pole when challenged and kept-on willingly in the lane while unable to hold off the winner. STREET FEST
stalked the pacesetters to the far turn, rallied to loom boldly turning for home and was out-finished in the drive. PONTUS tracked the leaders for
three-quarters and failed to gain in the stretch finishing evenly. CANYON SHADOWS prompted the pace for a half mile and faded. TIGGER ATTACK went
one-paced failing to menace. JAKES CHANNEL reared start, ducked out, was gathered together and was never a threat. COLLIE WRAYS KITTY was
outrun.

HANDSOFFTHEGOODS tracked the leaders to the far turn, swung seven wide turning for home and closed well wearing down his rivals in the lane. SLAVA
UKRAINI set the early pace, lost position on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, came on again in the stretch to re-gain the lead and was outkicked
in deep stretch. ROCKET HOTSHOT reserved off the pace through the turn, was caught wide in upper strtetch, angled in down the lane and failed to get to
the top pair. BRUCE BANNER stalked the pace while well held down the backside, rallied on the turn to take the lead in upper stretch and weakened late.
IMPULSIVENESS slow early to trail and passed tiring rivals in the lane. JET FLIGHT was not a threat. IMPERIAL MOMENT mounted an early bid into the
final turn to take a short lead on the bend and flattened out coming home.

HAY MOON stalked the leader to the far turn, steadily closed the gap on the bend, assumed command at the top of the lane and drew off unchallenged. WE
MISS ARLINGTON tracked the leaders in a clear pocket down the backside, saved ground and closed willingly to gain the place. SECESSION bobbled a
couple strides away fro mthe gate, sped off to a clear lead through quick fractions, had no response when engaged in upper stretch and tired through the
lane. DAPPER DUDE unhurried for the first half mile and made a steady gain to hit the board. KINGSBURRY ATTACK rated in mid-pack along the rail and
saved ground to no avail lacking a closing kick. COOL AND COLLECTED raced near the rear of the field to the far turn and showed some late interest
without impact. NATHANIEL'S HOPE chased the leaders for three-quarters and weakened in the stretch. MY TENNIS SHOES made a brief rally down the
backside into contentio9n and failed to sustain the bid. SMILE LIKE KYLE steadily faded posing no threat. ALVIN was through early.

Footnotes
MINING CAMP stalked the pace from four wide through the turn, engaged the leaders turning for home and quickly drew off convincingly. NAP LOVER
away slowly from the gate, steadily closed ground and was along for the place as an evident second best. SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD prompted the pace
from two wide, kept-on evenly in the lane while outkicked by the top pair. KEYSER unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and showed some late
interest rallying from out wide. RAISERICHIESRANSOM went evenly lacking a closing rally. GRAY MIKE ws set to an early drive on the turn and failed to
respond. PIRATE MARMALADE trailed most of the way and was never a threat. LUCKY PAL set the pace to the quarter pole and tired. THE WINNING

Footnotes
ROAR OF SILENCE unhurried for the first half, rallied on the turn to gain position, angled out through traffic in upper stretch and finished in a determined
drive to be up in time in a well handled ride. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN settled in mid-pack for the first half, rallied six wide in upper stretch to take command
inside the eighth pole and was caught in the final strides. POSSESSION tracked the leaders to the far turn, waited behind rivals on the bend, split horses
turning for home to take a brief lead in mid-stretch and was out-finihshed in deep stretch. SAFECRACKER SUE stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied to
loom boldly at the head of the lane and hung in the drive. BABE IN THE WOODS prompted the pace for a half, made a bid on the final bend and was unable
to sustain the rally through the stretch drive. MULSANNE (IRE) trailed for the first half mile and showed late interest to gain in the stretch. WAHIDA OF
MARDAN set the pace to midway on the turn and tired through the lane. SKIP TO BALI was well placed along the rail in striking position and faded in the
stretch run. MOLLY'S TEMPLE crowded at the start to be the early trailer and was never a threat. LIGHTNING MELODY raced well wide into the first turn,
chased the leaders down the backside, gave way on the far turn and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
MADELYN BELLE stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, tipped out three wide at the quarter pole, engaged the pacesetter in mid-stretch and
pulled away in a determined drive. RAMBERT set a quick pace on a well measured lead to the head of the stretch, responded willingly for the drive, was no
match for the winner and kept-on gamely to hold the place. LIPLINER unhurried early, rallied five wide turning for home and finsihed well to be gaining
through the lane. CHROME ATTACK reserved off the pace to upper stretch and finsihed well down the stretch. BALI BABY chased the pace from four wide
to the head of the lane, angled in for the drive and lacked a closing kick. SHE'S WANDAFUL tracked the leaders from three wide to be well placed in
mid-stretch and lacked a closing response. TAPERINEA pressed the pace from two wide to midway on the turn and came up empty. RAINY MOUNTAIN
was not a factor.
