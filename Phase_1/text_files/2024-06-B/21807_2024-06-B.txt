ROMAN EMPIRE stalked the loose pacesetter, took over at the five sixteenths pole and drew away while kept to his task. PREDOMINATE lacked speed
then closed well outside through the stretch. UNCLE WATER FLOW moved closer outside before half a mile then flattened out. MADISON LUVS DUKE
settled off the pace in the two path then inside, faded on the turn then came again. TROPHY ROOM set clear pace for five furlongs, was collared and
weakened. FOREVER WICKED dropped back inside then passed tiring rivals. IMAGINE THIS trailed far behind and was always far back. BATON angled
wide early, chased outside and gave way. SMARTHUMOR flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly.

JUST STEP ON IT led under pressure inside, repelled a challenge and drew clear. CATIRE VIZCAYA went after the winner on the final turn, bid but could
not get by. EDDIE W saved ground close up and continued willingly to the finish. MASAKADO chased outside, rallied on the final turn then flattened out.
MOTSKARI trailed early and was never in contention. BET THE LINE dropped back along the rail and lacked a response. GRATED COCONUT chased
wide off the leaders and gave way readily.

MARGIN OF AIR rated close up inside, dueled through the stretch and edged off in a determined score. CLASSIC UNION moved close up three wide, led at
the quarter pole and battled to the wire. ELOQUIST bid inside on the final turn, lacked room at the quarter pole, secured room and finished willingly.
LAYTOWN led in the two path then inside then weakened slightly in the stretch. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE settled inside off the pace and lacked a rally. MY
REDEMPTION broke slowest and trailed early then caught fading rivals. THIRSTY PAPPY raced close up three wide for half mile and faltered.
CENTURION raced wide early then gave way readily.

Footnotes
DONTLOOKBACKATALL raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, led at the eighth pole then edged away to the finish. ORGANIZED CHAOS angled
inside moving clear early, was collared in midstretch and continued gamely. EIGHT DANZAS lacked speed, swung wide into the stretch and closed well.
PRINCESS RUNAWAY was soundly bumped about near the half mile pole and continued nicely. DISCO EBO chased in the two path then inside and
flattened out in the stretch. AOIFE'S MAGIC was in tight early, lacked a solid bid then proved empty in the stretch. BOSS LIKE BETH moved close up briefly
four wide then gave way. ALWAYS MIA chased very wide in midpack and stopped. MIDNIGHT IN ALASKA was victim of severe bumping near half mile
pole and lost all chance. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the second finisher for interference on the backstretch was dismissed. SHOSHANAH
injured herself in the starting gate and was ordered a late scratch.

stretch and finished strongly. CARCHAROTH chased near the inside and finished well in the stretch. SHARP TONES sluggish early, advanced wide then
flattened out in the stretch. HEAVY POUR lacked speed then offered some late energy. PARTY AT SAM'S dueled along the inside to the stretch and gave
way. MAXIMUS MERIDIUS vied between rivals for three quarters and gave way. TIME TESTED prompted the pace three wide and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
DIVINE MIRACLE set a pressured pace inside, briefly lost the lead in the stretch then came again in a determined showing. SECRET PATH angled inside
early, awaited room on the final turn, swung wide in the stretch made a gradual gain in the final furlong. IT'S GAME TIME well placed outside the dueling
leaders, earned a narrow lead in midstretch and continued gamely. TRENDING UP trailed to the stretch then offered some late energy. MIDNIGHT ACT
lacked speed, faded before half a mile and was no factor. LAST ROMANCE dropped back inside and was always outrun. JARLIAN raced in midpack and
lacked a rally. MOON DOG pressed the winner for five furlongs and stopped abruptly.
