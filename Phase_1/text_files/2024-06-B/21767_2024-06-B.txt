Footnotes
BUNNY HOP prompted the pace outside K KAKE POP, kept on doggedly under solid handling through the final furlong, wrested command late and held
sway. K KAKE POP sped to the front and secured the inside, remained on her left lead through the drive, battled gamely after being hooked past mid stretch
but wasn't quite good enough. MOMENTOUS MISS , well placed stalking inside, eased out three wide to take aim in upper stretch, moved up outside the
leaders inside the final furlong but was out finished. EMM ESS EH saved ground in mid pack, worked outward in the final furlong and churned on.
CONCRETE FAZE chased off the inside, angled four wide soon into the lane, shifted back in for the final furlong then flattened out. MOMMA'S LINO drafted
well off the early pace while saving ground, steadied off of a rival leaving the far turn, regrouped and cut the corner into the lane, was maneuvered off the
rail through the drive and finished with interest. WAITTILMIDNITEHOUR broke a step slow then steadied in the opening furlong, dropped back and steadied
while three wide leaving the far turn, shifted well out in the course for the final furlong and kept on with effort. POLICE WOMAN , off the pace, circled four
wide into the lane but failed to rally. RUMINT , outside a rival pursuing the pace, faded. RAZORETTE , three wide, faltered.

PLAY LIKE A RAVEN settled off the pace while saving ground, took closer order past the five sixteenths, eased out soon into the lane, closed in under
pressure, took over outside the leader near the furlong grounds then edged away while kept to task. ELVIS HIMSELF cleared after a furlong then dropped in
to open up, set the pace under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, could not resist the winner leaving the eighth pole but continued on with effort to
remain clear of the rest. WISECRACK WARRIOR chased three wide, shifted wider for the drive, moved up a bit near mid stretch then went evenly from
there. MAGIC TOKEN , taken to rate off the pace, saved ground into the lane but lacked a rally. SKYLAR'S BROTHER , the closest pursuer into and around
the turn, gained three wide under asking into the stretch, failed to sustain in mid stretch then gave way.

CHARMED (GB) , in hand along the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, eased out near the three sixteenths pole, took command approaching
the sixteenth pole and drove clear. GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) circled the turn three wide and rallied outside. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK sprinted clear in hand
leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail throughout and gave way in the drive. SUE LOVES BARBADOS lacked speed, was well off the rail around
the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. JOHN HALL stayed along the inner rail on the turn, raced in the two path in the
stretch and passed tired foes. SMITTEN ENOUGH chased the pace in the two path on the turn and gave way. SHOFAR , never a factor, floated to the six
path in upper stretch. ADDY'S LADDY T N T was no factor. SOUTHERN LAD hugged the inner rail on the turn and weakened.

MORNING THOUGHTS prompted the pace outside WORKIN ON A DREAM, stayed on and responded to sharp left handed asks leaving the three
sixteenths, forged to command near the sixteenth pole then edged away while kept to task. WORKIN ON A DREAM was nudged along leaving the chute
and took command, set a rated pace towards the inner rail, spurted away a bit soon into the lane, clung to the lead past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly through the final seventy yards. FORMAL ORDER , in the clear and off the inside, came under a ride mid turn, raced four wide in upper stretch,
shifted in some past the three sixteenths but could only muster up a mild response. DATS MR. MO stalked the leaders three wide and under coaxing,
wandered outward in upper stretch then faded. SASSY KING , off the pace while saving ground, failed to respond. THRUSTER , off a bit awkwardly, raced
off the pace three wide and dropped back.

PRINCESS LUCIA , well positioned while saving ground around the turn, remained inside horses in upper stretch, worked outside in mid stretch, closed and
was up at the finish. DROPPING LEMONS chased the pace two wide around the turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch, finished gamely between rivals and
just missed. LADY LEMONCELLO set the pace near the inner rail and finished willingly to narrow miss. SAINT DEVEREAUX broke slowly, steadied in traffic
about a furlong after the start, swung to the six path in upper stretch and closed late. INTEL AGENT , between horses in upper stretch, altered course to the
inner rail near the eighth pole and was checked lacking room approaching the finish. THY NAME IS WOMAN , steadied entering the turn, raced outside
horses in the stretch and flattened out. TEA ROSE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. KEEP IT SAFE , checked in traffic inside the
five eighths pole, swung to the seven path in upper stretch. REPEAT AFTER ME , bumped leaving the starting gate, was outrun. A P M NOTION bumped
REPEAT AFTER ME when coming out at the break then dropped back on the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action
was taken.

Footnotes
WALDRIP broke outward and bumped with WORKISLIFE, corrected and led early towards the inner rail, ceded command to RAKIA then maintained a
forward inside spot while under some coaxing, eased back off the leading pair leaving the far turn then angled out, responded to strong encouragement into
the lane, ranged up outside to put a head in front in mid stretch, battled outside WORKISLIFE then edged away through the final seventy yards.
WORKISLIFE broke inward making contact with the winner, corrected and stalked two wide under some rating, moved up to engage RAKIA leaving the
three eighths, spurted clear past the quarter pole, could not contain the winner's bid leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. RAKIA broke outward,
quickly straightened and moved up outside rivals to take command near the seven eighths, dropped in after clearing, met an outside challenge nearing the
five sixteenths, was under pressure trying to keep pace into the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded.

WILMA FLINTSHIRE broke inwards, stalked the pace, advanced in the two path between horses entering the stretch, drifted in while taking the lead in mid
stretch, was challenged late by CHANNEL LOOP and got the perfect bob at the finish. CHANNEL LOOP , rated between horses down the backstretch and
around the turn, worked between rivals through the stretch, bid for the lead outside the winner approaching the finish and just missed. LADY OPHELIA , a
forward factor near the inner rail, went clear on the far turn, drifted wide in upper stretch and weakened outside the top pair. AUDIBLY , four deep around
the far turn, was well placed in upper stretch and flattened out. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL , four wide the first turn, circled the far turn three wide, advanced to
mid stretch then flattened out. IRISH ANGEL stalked the pace near the inner rail, advanced inside horses to mid stretch then flattened out. LORRAINE'S
WAY , four wide the first turn, was no factor and passed tired horses. T C NEIGH , sent early, disputed the pace outside LADY OPHELIA and gave way in
upper stretch. ANY FOOLS GOLD raced between horses and weakened. GO WALLY GO was outrun.
