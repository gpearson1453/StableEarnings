Footnotes
EDDIE'S LAST bobbled in a quick start, rated behind the top pair on the inside, roused at the quarter pole, tipped three wide into the stretch, challenged
outside the top pair at the eighth pole, dueled with LEMON SUSHI late and got up at the wire. LEMON SUSHI brushed outer rival in the beginning, dueled
from inside then inched ahead leaving the backstretch, headed again by outer rival around the bend, carried a short lead into the final furlong, fought inside
a pair of rivals midstretch then inside EDDIE'S LAST in deep stretch and got nailed on the line. MOON ICE got bumped and crowded shortly after the start,
settled inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane and edged LOGON TO WIN for third. LOGON TO WIN stalked the leaders three deep,
coaxed along around the turn, still in the three path, finished willingly in tandem with MOON ICE and was outkicked by that rival for third. BEER MONEY
dueled from outside then pressed leaving the backstretch, drew on even terms once again around the turn, kept the pressure on to midstretch and
weakened in the last sixteenth. BRONKO NAGURSKI brushed with inner rival shortly after the start, lost his path and steadied briefly early, dropped back
and race towards the rear into the turn, traveled two wide then shifted to the rail, kept trying near the inside but could not rally. JAMMING EDDY bumped on
both sides and got crowded early, went up to chase between rivals, got put in tight again nearing the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and
weakened. SQUALOTORO trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail then moved into the two path leaving the bend and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
MS MCWHINNEY reserved along the rail towards the rear then inside a rival at the back, saved ground still patiently handled on the far turn, angled out into
the stretch, surged from outside and reeled in the leader, then kicked clear to win going away. CERTITUDE (FR) settled two wide then between rivals, had
to take hold when running on heels near the half-mile pole, chased outside a rival through the far turn, challenged between entering deep stretch but was
bothered by inner rival coming out and had to check, then recovered to gain second. ANG N ASH stalked two wide then along the inside, bid from outside
with a quarter mile remaining, cleared inner rival outside the eighth pole, drifted out at the sixteenth pole to bother CERTITUDE (FR) and flattened to third.
CAMERON SLOUGH tracked from the rail inside rivals, roused while saving ground through the far turn, moved out in the lane and missed third. BELLE
CHERIE showed keen early foot along the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch
and weakened. ENGLISH DANGER tucked inside at the back then went outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, went between foes into the far turn, chased
two wide around the bend, moved out some by inner rival entering the lane and lacked a response when called upon. NICELY CURVED stalked three deep,
dropped back on the far turn, trailed three wide into the lane, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
THIRSTY MAMA hustled clear from outside, led two wide through the turn, drifted out in the lane and held well. GOING DEEP broke a step slow, was a bit
green early on and was taken out wide, chased five, four, then three wide on the turn, loomed while drifting out in the lane and could not summon the
needed late kick while clearly second berst. MISS MCKINZIE broke alertly then ceded command to THIRSTY MAMA, chased three deep then had to check
between rivals entering the turn, raced two wide at the back around the bend, kept trying down the lane and gained third. NOSTRI VIRES chased outside a
rival at the back early on, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path briefly then steered back out, spun five wide into the lane and got outkicked
for third. ODIES MEMORY LANE coaxed from the gate, was ridden cautiously between rivals while brushing with inner foe early, chased behind the leader
two wide around the bend, moved inward at the top of the stretch and weakened. TROPICAL RAIN DAY trailed early, got boxed in along the rail from the
three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, tipped out into the clear and came three wide into the stretch, moved back in a bit and failed to menace.
HOW ABOUT PAVEL chased four deep early, moved into the three path around the bend and faded down the lane. GOBERNADORA ELY stumbled
leaving the gate, recovered and chased along the inside brushing with a rival early, lost ground on the turn, cut the corner into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
LINDA'S GIFT drifted slightly crossing over the dirt following the leader down the hill, moved inward and stalked in hand from the two path around the
clubhouse turn, challenged from inside at the seven-sixteenths pole still under a hold, quickly cleared with three furlongs remaining, continued with a
comfortable lead to the eighth pole, roused briefly midstretch and remained strong to the wire. MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) was off a bit slow from outside
steered to the rail trailing early, drew closer in the middle stages, continued to save ground on the far turn, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole and
outkicked DUVET DAY (IRE) for second. DUVET DAY (IRE) moved into the two path tracking the lone leader, chased after LINDA'S GIFT three deep on the
far turn, remained outside rivals into the final furlong and could not get by MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) for the place honors. PLEASANT WAVE raced
keenly in hand from inside early then settled in a stalking position, continued on the fence through the far turn, given her cue at the top of the lane but
weakened in the furlong grounds. TURNERLOOSE sped clear to take the front, lugged out across the dirt, straightened out at the top of the stretch first time
around and moved inward, led two wide through the clubhouse turn, confronted by the winner from inside leaving the backstretch and offered no resistance,
lost positions between rivals around the far turn and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
THIRSTY IN VEGAS sprinted clear, cut across to the inside, coaxed along the rail around the bend, set down at the top of the stretch and put to right
handed urging and widened through the final furlong. CORALGABLESKAYLIN chased off the rail, closest in pursuit form the two path around the bend and
into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner but stayed on to secure second. MEMOSIS sat off the pace on the inside, went between rivals
at the five-sixteenths pole, angled five wide into the lane and gained third. GRACIE'S BIG DAY broke in and was quickly corrected, chased outside a rival
then moved inside for the turn, saved ground to the stretch, raced a bit off the rail in the lane and could not rally. THIRSTY DESTINY chased under urging
early from outside, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, drifted out a bit past the quarter pole and also lacked a rally.
YOUNG LOVE chased along the rail, lacked room and got shuffled back on the turn, lacked room again in upper stretch, found some room in the final
furlong but could not threaten and was transported off the track via equine ambulance following the race. LIL' BOOM BOOM hopped a bit and came away
slow, raced three deep at the back into the turn, got carried out to the six path around the bend and could not rally. FAITHFUL TRUTH was off slow and lost
path leaving the gate, chased between rivals at the back, angled over to the rail around the bend and failed to menace. CHATTY LEROYBROWN chased
off the rail, three then two wide on the turn, altered out in upper stretch and faded. UNBRIDLED BRIDE jumped up and hit the top of the gate at the start,
was wrapped up and lagged behind throughout and walked off.

Footnotes
RUNAMILEINMYSHOES dueled for the lead from outside, cleared at the nine-sixteenths pole, padded the lead around the last turn, opened up under hand
urging and was geared down approaching the wire. MIZ CLUBCALI reserved between rivals in the two path, chased outside a rival up the backstretch,
improved around the far turn, was no match for the winner but continued on to best the others. GLACIER RIM reserved along the rail, trailed up the
backstretch, moved out and exited the far turn four wide, tipped out further in the drive and gained third. MISS WILL got bumped and lost her path leaving
the gate, traveled two wide near the back early, went between rivals leaving the backstretch, got shuffled back at the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide
into the clear, angled out into the lane and improved position. HOLLYWOOD PENNY traveled two wide off the pace, went three deep into the far turn,
angled to the rail around the bend, steered out in the lane and also improved placings. NOTHING IS FOREVER settled inside, was forced to check at the
three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the lane, moved inward and could not rally. TINY PRANCER bumped outer rival leaving the gate, got crowded
between rivals and steadied shortly after, stalked along the inside, between foes at the half-mile pole, moved inside entering the far turn, was closest in
pursuit entering the lane and faded. LAST ELIZABETHAN reserved on the inside well off the pace, lacked room and got shuffled back to last on the far turn,
trailed two wide into the lane and failed to menace. ANZA SKY stalked outside a rival, closest in pursuit leaving the backstretch, spun three wide into the
lane and tired. MOOREA TIME traveled three deep off the pace early on, moved closer in the middle stages, continued three wide into the lane and had little
left for the stretch run. FANCY FASCINATOR went up to duel from inside but started to pull and became rank around the first turn while drifting out,
continued to be a handful and forced the rider to take a big hold on a short left rein into the backstretch, chased the leader past the nine-sixteenths pole, lost
ground through the far turn on the fence and tired in the lane. BE A GOLDFISH dropped back early, eased and taken out wide on the first turn, pulled up
early on the backstretch and walked off.

CANADA GATE at the five-sixteenths pole and began to draw away, roused entering the lane, asked right handed once past the eight pole and widened
under steady handling. CANADA GATE pressed the pace from outside, chased up close in the middle stages then confronted the leader again at the
seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep up though at the five-sixteenths marker, chased two wide into the lane, weakened but managed to save second.
INDISPENSABLE tracked four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path, remained off the rail and came under a ride on the far turn, chased
three deep into the lane and missed second. WINTERFELL stalked four then three deep on the clubhouse turn, moved into the two path on the far turn and
came up empty when needed. FEEL THE MAGIC forwardly placed three deep on the first turn then moved into the two path, saved ground on the inside
around the second bend and tired in the lane. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC reserved in the two path outside a rival, trailed three wide around the far turn and was

Footnotes
HOPE ROAD reluctant to load into the gate, sprinted to the front and steered across, set the pace next to the fence around the bend, then drew off in the
lane under hand urging. ONE MAGIC PHILLY veered in and bumped rival at the start, chased outside rivals at the back early, advanced four then five wide
around the bend, chased four deep into the lane and outkicked NORMANDY QUEEN for second. NORMANDY QUEEN stalked the pace from inside behind
the pacesetter, tipped out at the top of the stretch, could not produce a bid and got outkicked for second. RICH OF JOY raced in range three deep to the
stretch and weakened down the lane. PHILIPPA coaxed early between rivals, chased two wide then along the rail on the turn and faded. TAHITI ITI sat off
the pace, moved to the inside, angled out in the lane and improved position. LOVE ALIVE raced up close outside the pacesetter, took aim two wide into the
stretch but faded when called upon. BRUNCH WITH AMY tossed her head and got bumped hard leaving the gate, ridden along while trailing up the
backstretch, passed a rival into the turn, chased two wide then ran into traffic leaving the bend and altered three wide into the clear and kept on to improve
placings. RUNNING SUPER tracked off the rail then outside rivals, took the turn three wide, bothered a bit by inner rival at the top of the stretch and
weakened after. AUDITORY traveled in mid-pack well off the rail, went four wide around the bend and came up empty in the drive. TIZ MIZ PARADISE
climbed early and dropped back off the pace, saved ground through the turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
SEA OF CORTEZ (IRE) stalked the pace outside a rival then between foes into the turn, ran into mild traffic on the turn, tipped out into the clear, chased
within striking range to the sixteenth pole, surged late to take over and held off the runner-up. QUALITY WINS took a bump from outer rival early, raced off
the rail at the rear, went two wide into the turn, advanced while angling out to the four path, closed well from outside and missed. BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK
broke alertly while also shifting in, corrected quickly and went up to duel from inside, inched ahead on the turn, cleared in upper stretch, showed the way into
the final sixteenth but got run down by the top pair. BARTHOLDY broke in and bumped, showed early speed outside the top pair then took a stalking
position, bid three deep at the quarter pole, lost contact with the leader in upper stretch, continued to give chase into deep stretch, re-bid late but was
outkicked and missed the show. CLASSICALLY broke in and bumped, settled off the inside, went three to four wide around the bend, drifted inward in the
final furlong and finished willingly. LEADING chased along the rail inside a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, drifted out and had to take up at the
three-eighths pole, traveled a bit off the rail into the drive, moved out in upper stretch, steered back in near the eighth pole and was stymied late. SHOT OF
COURAGE broke in and pinballed leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack early, paused when bumping with inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out into
the stretch, moved out further and lacked room between rivals midstretch and churned on to the wire. STORM OFF was off slow and broke in, sat off the
pace on the inside, steadied past the three-eighths pole, eased off the fence and failed to menace. UNCHARTED bumped with outer rival at the start,
settled in mid-pack and steered to the inside, got blocked by a rival and bumped with outer rival while checking at the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into
the lane, moved out in the lane and was ridden out. LEGITIFY (IRE) fought for the lead from outside to the turn, kept the pressure on in the two path then
between rivals at the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the leaders into the lane and weakened in the final furlong. TAKAMAKAHARA bumped with
inner rival in the beginning, traveled on the inside at the back, saved ground around the bend and never responded to urging. BIG ATTITUDE got bumped
back at the start, traveled outside rivals at the back early, spun three wide into the lane and was never a factor. THE TRAINER OF LEADING LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST SEA OF CORTEZ (IRE) FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
LEADING CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS BY DRIFTING INTO SEA OF CORTEZ (IRE) AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
