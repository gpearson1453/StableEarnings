ANOTHER MYSTERY was allowed to settled in the early going while inside, rallied on the far turn and angled out to be three wide in upper stretch, was in a
strong drive to wear down MAN ON ATTACVK in late stretch to be up in time. MAN ON ATTACK set a well rated pace from the start, drew off turning for
home then was in a strong drive but could not last in late stretch. SILVER QUARTERS was unhurried early on down the backstretch, rallied and swung out
to be five wide in upper stretch to closed some ground willingly but was no menace to the top two. RICHIESGOTGAME was allowed to settled then made a
mild rally and moved out to be four wide for the stretch drive but was no menace. READTHECLIFFNOTES stalked the pace while three wide on the
backstretch into the far turn making a bid then faltered in the stretch drive. TEMPLE FOOL stalked the pace while inside on the backstretch, made a bid two
wide into the far turn then gave way in the stretch.
