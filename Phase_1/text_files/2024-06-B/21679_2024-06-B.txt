Footnotes
ARIMONY was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied around the turn, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to be clear late. MAMIE'S LAST
HOPE vied between horses to late stretch, was outclosed and all out for place. MOONLITE GRAHAM vied inside, inched away briefly on the turn, continued
to duel to late stretch and yielded grudgingly. AWESOME BID stalked the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, got through, bid willingly and
didn't have enough late. HOT CHARLIE raced close to the pace in an outside trip and lacked the needed late response. GUSHER led early, vied three
across to the turn, dropped back and gave way. SUPER HUNK broke slowly, trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
WHATWASTHENISNOW broke out, vied early, drew clear into the turn and widened in the drive under mild urging. MISS FLUFFY was slow early, rallied
outside around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and closed to get up late for place while no threat to the winner. GABRIELLA WHO contended for
the lead early, fell back to stalk the pace, hung late and settled for show. GONE KAT threw her head at the start, was never far back, raced outside and
lacked a late response. O SHUGAH MINT raced mid pack towards the inside, angled out on the turn and lacked a stretch response. EMPRESS IN FRONT
stalked the pace along the inside, bid off the rail, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. SIERRA BLANCA showed good early speed and stopped into
the turn.

BENDER was unhurried early, raced outside, swung wide entering the stretch, drew off for a clear lead and finished much the best. RONAMO raced in the
back, swung wide leaving the turn, closed to earn place and was no match for the winner. ZIA ZAPPER raced close to the pace off the rail, lacked a rally
and earned show. HOLLAND set a pressured pace to the second turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. PRAY FOR ME RAY advanced along the
rail on the backstretch, challenged for the lead on the turn, had little left and gave way. CLAVICHORD lacked a stretch response in a wide trip and did not
threaten. MIDNIGHT SPLIT pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. SIR FLATTER showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way.

Footnotes
BEACH RUNNER stalked the pace, rallied four across entering the stretch, closed willingly and drew clear late. SIDEWINDER SLICK stalked the pace,
moved up to challenge between horses into the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded to finish second best. SWEET MONEY vied inside to the sixteenth
pole, yielded grudgingly and was all out for show. LATIGO ELLIS vied to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and outfinished for third in a good effort.
WRECKING STORM stalked the pace while racing outside, bid five across entering the stretch and hung late. DAVE'S ENCHANTMENT was void of early
speed, finished well inside and gained late. JEEPS STRIDE was unhurried early, saved ground, bid inside and had little left for the drive. NOT TO FANCY
failed to menace in an even effort. SHAME ON SAM trailed the field and failed to contend.
