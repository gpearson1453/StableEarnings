Footnotes
STRIDER'S SLIDER set a pressured pace two wide, then made a bid off the bend to kick clear and then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best
under a drive. MAT MATTERS was rated along on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly, then came four wide off the bend and was
gaining late to be clearly second best. SANDY'S REFUGEE pressed the pace on the inside and then moved off the inside to be two wide by the quarter
pole, then dropped back to the rail leaving the turn and weakened, stayed on for the show award. BELLS RUN stumbled at the break, settled back early
after the bad start, saved ground on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally to best the rest. UNCLE GEORGY tracked the
pace three wide and then was two wide by the quarter pole and then was empty. SIREN was settled four wide early and then was three wide on the turn and
stopped.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S ALIBI stalked the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid off the turn and hit the front and edged clear leaving the furlong marker and then
held off MORE THAN GLORY late to prove best under a drive. MORE THAN GLORY was well rated along the inside, moved out and came two wide into
the lane, waited to the furlong marker to angle out and closed well but was too late. MOSEY was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and cut
the corner leaving the turn, then made a bide in the lane and moved out in the lane to gain the show award. LULLABY LAND was hard held early three wide
into the first turn, then was rated along and came four wide off the bend and lacked the needed bid while racing evenly. CALL ON CLARA was reserved
early, advanced two to three wide on the far turn and swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late kick. PRIVATE CREDIT was very keen early
and fighting the riders hard hold while setting the pace on the inside, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened in the final furlong.

AMUNET was settled early on the inside, advanced on the far turn and split rivals by the quarter pole, came two wide off the bend and closed well and
surged late to get up in time to prove best. MOMMA KIM set the pace while clear and on the inside, then turned back a bid leaving the turn and was clear by
the furlong marker but was denied late to just miss. AFRICAN ANGEL was rated along on the outside and was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide
off the bend and had a mild kick to gain the show award but needed more. CLOUDY BAY tracked the early pace in between rivals, made a two to three wide
bid by the quarter pole but flattened out in the final furlong. HUSHEMUP tracked the pace on the inside and faded in the drive. AMPLIO ESQUEMA was
reserved early on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a mild late kick. MILLROSE chased the early
pace on the inside, moved out and was three wide on the far turn and weakened. SYNONYMOUS was settled back early and lacked a serious rally.

EMPTY MY POUCH was rated along the outside, made a five wide bid by the quarter pole and gained a short lead by the furlong marker and then held well
to prove best under a drive. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT chased the pace on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid to split rivals by
the furlong marker and missed late. GRUMPY BROOKSIE dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the final furlong, bested rest. HAP'S VICTORY
stumbled badly at the break, then rushed up between rivals to duel for the lead two wide, then continued to duel for command on the turn and then was in
between rivals off the bend and faded in the final furlong. CHUCK ADAMS tracked the pace four wide and weakened in the lane. NECCO stalked the early
pace three wide and weakened.

to be clearly second best. SERENE WARRIOR pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole but came up
