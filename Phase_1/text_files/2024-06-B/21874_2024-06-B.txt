Footnotes
ECHO SEVEN broke alertly to take command from the onset, was loose up front down the back straight, set the pace, unchallenged around the bend and
while staying on the wrong lead through the stretch held safe by a diminishing margin for the win at the wire. SPEEDY EXECUTIVE broke a step slow to trail
inside down the backstretch, started to rally going past rivals inside three furlongs out, shifted out lengthening her stride in the four path at the top of the lane
and closed in smartly late but could not threaten in the end. CRIMSON NIGHTS was three deep outside foes in the second flight along the backstretch,
emerged from the pack to chase the pacesetter around the turn, closed the gap mildly by the top of the stretch, could not sustain the run and faded at the
furlong marker to be a clear third at the finish. AZIEL stalked the lone speed on the rail in the beginning, was roused three furlongs out, keeping an even
pace with the winner around the turn and was one paced in the lane to settle for a minor role when crossing the finish line. DISGRUNTLEDPELICAN
tracked in the two path with rivals on both sides down the backstretch, was shuffled back between foes three eighths from home, could not offer a run,
trailing the field on the turn and came back on to pass a weary foe in the stretch. A STING FOR LOVE stalked near the rear outside horses along the
backside, made little impression around the bend and could not be a factor outside foes in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MOON OVER EGBERT stalked near the rear in the beginning, made a good move getting a better position on the rail down the backstretch, started to reach
for more ground midpoint on the turn inside, loomed boldly three wide in upper stretch between rivals and drew off when encouraged right handed at the
furlong pole. CELENTANO was unhurried to see the field on the turn, quickly burst between horses in the two path at the quarter pole, continued to gather
momentum in the four path at the top of the lane and closed belatedly to best others when crossing the line. MR. MARSHALL prompted the pace outside in
the beginning, battled outside for the lead throughout the turn, put away the pesky speed rival in upper stretch, had little left to fend off the winner at the
eighth pole and faded late to settle for the show money at the finish line. AMAZING SUCCESS was brushed inside to begin, had an ideal spot, alone
,watching the engaged pair along the backside, closed in on the contesting duo by the quarter pole, was fanned out in the four path to be in the hunt
straightening out for home and re-rallied late to settle on the fringes in the end. CHUNKY MONKEY hopped a bit at the start, trailed three deep early on,
made an early move three wide outside foes at the half, could not close in on the lead group with five sixteenths remaining and finished up willingly in the
lane just losing the nod for the minors at the wire. BUSTA GROOVE travelled outside runners in mid-division, made mild headway around the turn, angled
out to the five path for the drive but could not get involved in the stretch running. MEKO MAKEE stalked near the rear in the two path in the early going,
made a brief run when roused on the fence three furlongs from the wire, could not find more turning for home and flattened out on the rail in upper stretch.
THIS KATZ FOR REAL settled in mid-pack inside rivals, made little progress between foes around the bend and failed to menace in the drive to the finish
line. CADFAEL broke inwards to begin, was hustled for the lead inside down the back straight dueled on the fence for the front throughout the turn, could
not find more in upper stretch and emptied out on the rail at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
PROUD RONIN broke inwards to start, sat comfortably behind the contesting trio down the backside, was on hold behind the group of three up top around
the turn just waiting to the que, pounced in the three path finding a seam straightening out for home and pulled away for a convincing win in the final furlong.
ONTARIO HOLIDAY tracked in the second flight outside foes in the three path down the backside, watched the dueling threesome around the bend, moved
in but was fanned out four wide at the top of the lane with the eventual winner to his inside and finished up well enough but was just second best on this day.
JAVA POWER broke inwards to begin, travelled inside in midfield along the backstretch, saved ground keeping pace through the turn, shifted out to be three
wide for the drive and surged late to capture the show award. MISTER HOLDEN pressed the issue three deep outside in the early stages, moved in to have
a slim lead up front outside at the quarter pole, was collared by the winner when between rivals in upper stretch and stayed on for a minor role in the end.
GOLDEN WIND dueled between runners in the backstretch, battled inside for the lead at the quarter pole, continued to try, fighting inside until the sixteenth
marker but yielded in deep stretch. VINI VIDI VICI was antsy prior to the start, soon after the break was checked mildly to trail in the beginning, passed a
rival at the half but could not be a presence in the running down the stretch. LEMON TWIST bobbed heads for the lead running on the rail along the
backside, came under a ride midway on the turn but could not maintain position up top with the other two leaders and retreated on the fence in upper
stretch. LEFT IN MY DUST stalked near the back having one rival beaten down the back straight, could not get interested seeing the field throughout the
turn and could not get into contention outside horses down the stretch.

ZISISIT (IRE) settled mid-pack outside two to three wide, advanced swiftly outside foes three deep late on the far turn with aim on the leader by upper
stretch, struck the front a furlong out, drew away under steady urging. SWINGING MANDY was urged from the break, set the pace in the clear, was
overtaken by mid-stretch and no match for the winner but second best. SILENT SKY brought up the rear between runners two to three wide into the first
turn, continued racing near the tail end up the backstretch, advanced some on the far turn fanning five wide into upper stretch, kept on and was along for
show late. INSCRUTABLE angled in after the break, settled inside saving ground, was tipped out from the five-sixteenths and three deep coming past the
quarter pole, only went evenly in the stretch and lost show honors. FORTYFIVESEVENTY stalked inside off the clear leader, lacked any late kick. JULIE'S
MIST was caught outside three to four wide on the first turn, raced at the back throughout and failed to menace. NOVEL stalked outside a foe two to three
wide, began weakening late on the far turn and was guided out at the top of the stretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
ANSELMO was away a touch slow, trailing on the fence, co-trailed the tight pack on the outside entering the backstretch, cruised around horses circling
three wide on throughout the final turn, posed the main threat in the five path straightening for home, dove to the inside gaining at the eighth pole and edged
away in the final strides for the win. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY pressed the pace outside on the first turn, continued to force the issue in the two path with
runners on either side down the backstretch, assumed command three furlongs out, determinedly fended off the outside rival at the top of the lane but could
not ward off the winner inside in the final seventy yards. MO TOURIST settled on the rail ahead of one rival in the early going, could see the field midway on
the final bend, began to pick up foes smartly four wide at the quarter pole, swung out six wide making a late run through the stretch and got up right at the
finish line to win the show battle. JUST START ME UP stalked four wide outside horses on the first turn, improved four deep outside down the back straight
to prompt the lead at the half, bid for the front three wide with five sixteenths to go, angled out five wide for the drive dueling up top, could not find more late,
stalled at the sixteenth pole and lost show at the wire. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE sat just behind the pacesetter, nestled on the fence in the early stages, tried
to offer a rally passing a tiring foe midpoint on the turn, shifted out in the four path turning for home and finished up with good intent in deep stretch. BET N
WIN tracked the top two between horses early on, settled back a touch in midfield along the backside, was hard ridden making little progress on the far bend
and could not be a factor in the drive to the wire. VINCENZINO tracked outside in the second flight, took closer order to be in the mix in the three path
between foes by the half, could not continue with the leaders midway on the second turn and folded inside rivals at the furlong marker. BAYTOWN ELVIS
was hustled for the lead on the rail, maintained a slim margin up front while pressed outside by multiple rivals down the backstretch, had no more to offer on
the fence by the three eighths marker, stopped on the rail at the quarter pole and was not persevered with down the lane galloping across the finish line.

COOLER MAN was allowed to travel at the back of the pack in the first turn, continued to settle into stride in last down the backside, shifted out, four wide at
the quarter pole starting to mount a rally, angled for clear running room widest in the five path entering the stretch, was full of run late under a vigorous ride
and went on past them all by the sixteenth pole, going away smartly at the wire. BRITISH ARTILLERY tracked two wide between runners in the first oval,
was headstrong under the rider's restraint briefly when entering the backstretch, settled into rhythm in the second flight with horses on either side at the half,
waited while in tight quarters two furlongs from the line, found a clear path two wide turning for home and stubbornly battled down the lane between horses
with a solid runner up effort. VICTORY TOWN cleared from the outside post to lead on the rail comfortably going up front, had a slim advantage inside down
the backstretch, put away the early speed foe by the quarter pole, spurted away straightening out for the drive, weakened with a sixteenth to run and saved
the show prize at the wire. ARASHI stalked near the rear three wide on the first turn, took closer order to be in the second flight three deep outside tracking
in the backstretch, continued to gain, narrowing the margin three wide on the far turn, was in the thick of things in the four path at the top of the lane. evened
out through the stretch and settled on the fringes in the end. SHAMATEUR tracked on the rail in the early parts of the race, saved ground keeping pace
through the final turn, skimmed the fence straightening out for the drive to be in with a chance but failed to fire at the furlong pole and could not threaten late.
WAR IN CHARGE tracked three deep outside on the initial bend, closed in to shadow the pace outside down the back straight, could not go with the
frontrunner when scrubbed on for more at the quarter pole, swung three wide with challengers on both sides at the top of the lane, offered little finish and
tired at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
TODAY settled nicely on the outside five deep down the backstretch, quickly pulled the rider to the lead, circling around rivals smartly by the quarter pole
while under a tight rein, had company on his inside dueling through the entire stretch and gamely prevailed by a nostril at the finish line. RED IN FRONT
was in a tracking role just outside down the back straight, moved in to poke his head in front midway on the turn between rivals, having the winner to his
outside, fought on relentlessly down the stretch to the finish line but lost in a heartbreaking tight photo at the wire. SING DIXIE stalked near the rear three
deep on the outside under a snug hold in the early stages, followed the eventual winner swooping four wide around foes in the turn, chased in the five path,
the top two who were in a match race down the stretch and held on to be a non threatening third at the finish line. LONHRO'S GAMBLE was situated on the
rail near the back of the pack early on, had to wait behind a wall of runners three eighths from home, continued to look for running room around the bend,
finally had a clear path four wide at the top of the stretch and found more down the lane, closing in sharply to just miss getting up for the show award in the
end. OH PEANUTS trailed the pack in the two path down the backstretch, could see the compact field travelling three wide between horses at the three
furlong marker, shifted out widest in the six path turning for home and finished up willingly to pass tired foes outside at the furlong marker. JOEYBONES
tracked four wide down the backstretch with the eventual winner to the outside, could not go on with the top duo by midturn, dueled for the show award
turning for home four wide but failed to menace running down the stretch. QUANDALE tracked three wide between runners along the backside, was urged
for more three eighths out, could not quicken with others by the quarter pole and lacked a bid inside through the lane. HARD RELOAD was away alertly for
the lead, set the pace loose up front along the backside, was engulfed by rivals outside five sixteenths from the prize, backed away on the fence through the
far turn and had nothing to give on the rail in upper stretch. FRAC CITY chased the pace on the rail down the back straight, took the shortest way around
but was losing positions on the turn, angled outside in the four path for the stretch run but had no finish to offer to the wire.
