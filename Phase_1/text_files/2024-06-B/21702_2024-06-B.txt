Footnotes
MCEWEN, bumped at the start by TEAPARTYTODAY, bumped with SILVER BLUR forcing that rival to check, moved to the lead inside down the
backstretch, opened up before the turn, took a good lead into the stretch, just held on. SILVER BLUR, bumped and checked between MCEWEN and ICE
STORM at the break, wide early, off rail turn, rallied between horses, drifted out into the path of TEAPARTYTODAY late, ran out of ground. ICE STORM
bumped at the start with SILVER BLUR, stalked four wide, rallied third best. TEAPARTYTODAY broke inwards, bumped rival, pressed outside early, well
placed outside turn, rallied, was bothered late when SILVER BLUR drifted out. ICOULDBETHEONE had speed off the rail between horses, chased inside
turn, faded stretch. CAUSE I BELIEVE, well placed outside early, dropped back backstretch, faded. The riders aboard TEAPARTYTODAY and ICE STORM
lodged claims of foul against the rider of SILVER BLUR for interference in late stretch. As a result SILVER BLUR was disqualified from second and placed
fourth. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
