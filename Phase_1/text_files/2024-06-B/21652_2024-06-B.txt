late response and held for place. SHE HIT A HOMER advanced outside to the turn to loom a threat, fell back and went evenly late. IT'S SAUL RIGHT
improved position in an even effort. RAPPERS THIEF ducked out, bumped and was steadied at the start, showed speed to the turn and stopped. MISS
LUCKY LADY was far back early, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH raced close to the pace along the inside, dropped back
into the turn and stopped.

NOT A REHEARSAL set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. BONIFIED WILDCAT pressed the pace,
fell back on the turn, continued willingly to close well and narrowed the gap to finish second best. RUNAWAYFLAIR broke awkwardly, raced close to the
pace, put in a steady effort and earned show. GHOSTLY THUNDER was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well. SHES ACTING SINGLE
was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and improved position. MOVESLIKAGHOST pressed the pace inside, fell back on the turn and flattened out.
MO JO MONEY bumped at the start, saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn and came up empty. W F AMERICAN HONEY had brief speed only. F S
LIBERTY BELLE broke awkwardly and bumped at the start and was outrun. DIAMOND DAISY was off a step slowly, was taken outside, swung wide leaving
the turn and lacked a response.
