CAPTIVATING BOY vied three deep before clearing and tucking to the two path into the turn, inched further away nearing the lane and held sway late.
GUNNER BAY tracked from midpack along the inside, gained place from an outer rival in upper stretch, tipped to take aim outside of the clear leader
entering the final furlong, then slowly closed in late but was kept at bay. G T FIVE HUNDRED dropped back from between horses soon after the start, laid
off of the pace in the two path, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied and gained show while flopping back to his left lead in the final sixteenth.
CATHEDRAL BEACH trailed along the inside, shifted out to the three path turning for home before fanning to the six path in upper stretch, then offered a
belated kick to reach fourth in the shadow of the wire. FITZPATRICK laid off of the pace in the four path, got floated to the six path at the three furlong pole,
progressed entering the lane to gain show while tucking to the four path in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong but lost show to an outer bidder in the
late stages and yielded. ZIPPIN GIGI laid close up along the inside, was roused to the three path to pursue outside of the clear leader passing the three
furlong pole, but lacked a bid and faded between horses leaving upper stretch. TAILLIGHTS chased forwardly three wide early on, got floated to the five
path by inner rivals at the three furlong pole, then gave way between horses while hanging on his left lead. MOLTO VIVACE prompted between horses early
on, chased his outer clearing counterpart into the turn before getting floated to the four path whlie among foes at the three furlong pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
WELAKA vied with an outer rival around the first turn, backed off to stalk outside of that one approaching the five furlong pole, rebid as a outer rival pressed
alongside turning for home, led into the lane and drove clear leaving upper stretch. MUCHO MOJO was bumped between horses soon after the start,
tracked along the inside, stalked behind the leaders turning for home, tipped to the four path to take aim outside of the new leader entering the lane, but only
managed to chase that one thereafter and was second best. DONTKISSDAMINISTER bumped with an outer rival shortly after the break, vied with an inner
rival while taking the first turn in the three path, inched clear and tucked to the two path approaching the five furlong pole, met a pair of outer challenges
around the far turn, got headed by the eventual winner entering the lane and gave way. MR. PETERKIN bumped with an inner rival multiple times at the
start, raced at the rear along the inside, improved position in the two to three path around the far turn and failed to menace. STAR NATION took light contact
from an inner rival at the start, lacked sped two wide, trailed in the three to two path around the far turn and failed to factor. MONTAUK POINT bobbled and
brushed an outer rival while breaking towards the front at the start, stalked in the two path, shifted out to the four path with five furlongs to go, ranged up to
press the top pair around the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid, got floated to the five path entering the lane and weakened. EL FRANCO transferred
contact from an outer rival to an inner foe before bumping with his outer counterpart again at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, shifted to the five
path with five furlongs to go, chased into the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
TUT'S REVENGE set a clear and uncontested pace around both turns, bumped his margin under a drive in upper stretch, but was collared by a pair of
fast-closing outer bidders in the shadow of the wire, yet just lasted via a head-bob. CASH EQUITY (FR) was allowed to settle and trailed early on, took the
far turn in the two to three path before swinging out to the seven path entering the lane, rallied along with an inner rival to quick close in on the tiring leader
in the late stages, bid at the wire but missed via a head-bob. HIGHWAY ROBBER laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the six path entering
the lane, rallied along with an outer rival to offer a late bid between horses at the wire, but missed. RUNNIN' RAY tracked in the four to three path around
the first turn, chased shifting to the five path in upper stretch, but got outkicked by a pair of outer rivals passing the furlong grounds. HIDDEN STASH
steadied slightly pursuing from midpack along the inside around the first turn, sustained pursuit two wide and between horses around the far turn, then
lacked an inside kick through the lane. BAL A KAZOO brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked the clear leader from the three to two path around the
first turn, chased coming under urging around the far turn, shifted back to the three path into upper stretch and tired. HOWLING TIME brushed with an outer
rival at the start, got keen behind foes early on, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path into the lane and failed to factor. SIVAKO tracked
tucking to the inside around the first turn, chased into the lane and weakend.

Footnotes
ROSHIELL MY BELLE leaned out at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned out to the six path into the lane, rallied to sweep past the leader
leaving the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. LA BUKANA rushed along with an outer rival to reach the front passing the half mile pole, showed the way along
the inside as her outer counterpart sustained pressure around the turn, shook clear straightening into the lane, held sway through midstretch, but was
caught by an outer on-charging bidder in the final sixteenth. DELICATE was briefly fractious in the starting gate, stalked the leaders from the three path,
gained place chasing the clear leader into the lane, but lacked a bid before getting outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, then held show. STATLER INN
laid off of the pace along teh inside, shifted to the two path into the turn, moved between horses approaching the lane before chasing in the three to four
path, but lacked a bid, flopped back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole and needed more to challenge show. JEWISH MOTHER tracked three wide,
chased in the four path around the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. WAVER lacked speed in the four path, retreated to trail
passing the three furlong pole, then failed to factor. MARY LOVES LOUIE broke slowly and trailed early on, surpassed an outer rival shifting to the three
path at the three furlong pole and made little impact. BARBARINA rushed forward early on, prompted two wide around the turn, but gave way entering the
lane and weakened. MIAVANA prompted along the inside, chased an outer pair into the turn and weakened.

from an outer pursuer. B SUDD stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, gained place at the three sixteenths pole, chased the clear leader
through the final furlong but was kept at bay. CHANCE trailed in the three path, swung out to the five path into upper stretch and ran on to edged show late.
MASTER OF ARMS broke a step slow, tracked along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, bid and vied for show between horses in the final furlong
but got outkicked. MAUNA KEA BOUND brushed with an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner while remaining a path off of
the inner rail around the turn, but yielded to his outer counterpart in upper stretch and gave way. SUPREMELY brushed with an outer foe leaving the gates,

Footnotes
ROUSSETTE prompted along the inside before rating back to stalk around the first turn, advanced to press outside of the leader with five furlongs to go, bid
along with an outer rival around the far turn, forged an advantage nearing the lane, drove clear leaving upper stretch and held from an inner bidder. FEAR
OF UNION broke a beat slow, lacked speed along the inside early on, shifted out to the four path entering the backstretch, came under a drive pursuing the
main group with three furlongs to go, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, split foes two wide in midstretch before sustaining progress to bid inside of the clear
leader in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. ACTIVE DUTY leaned into an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted out to
the five path down the backstretch, chased outside of the leaders around the far turn, yet ran on in the final furlong to edge place late. GOTTA HAVE
DREAMS tracked in the four path, bid three deep at the three furlong pole, chased an inner counterpart in upper stretch, sustained pursuit into the final
furlong but was outkicked by a rival on either side in the late stages. SAGITTARIUS was bumped by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide,
took closer order between horses with a half to go, tracked in range turning for home in the two path, but chased in the three path and between horses
through upper stretch and yielded. BECKSTER stalked three wide, chased between horses around the far turn then gave way. YELL COUNTY led from an
inner prompter early on, showed the way into the backstretch, met a pair of outer challenges around the far turn, got headed turning for home and
weakened leaving upper stretch. OATHBREAKER broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, then three wide around the far turn before fanning to the five
path entering the lane, but failed to factor. REMEMBER THE FEAR laid off of the pace along the inside, surpassed an inner tiring rival nearing the lane and
made little impact. CAJUN CRUISER stuttered a step at the start, tracked along the inside and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF MO leaned in at the start troubling an inner rival, pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked the main group from the two path around
the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, brushed an inner rival launching a rally entering midstretch, flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds,
progressed whlie lugging inwardly leaving that station, ranged up to the leader in the final sixteenth and edged past late. BIG TROUBLE set a clear pace in
the two path, held sway in the three path into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer bidder in the late stages. KODIAC WINTERGREEN (IRE) broke
slow before being bothered by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the two path, entered the lane in the five path before altering wider in upper stretch, then
offered a good late kick to miss reaching place at the wire. HAY STACK saved ground off of the pace, rallied inside of rivals in upper stretch, took aim inside
of the leader in the final furlong but leveled off. JOHANNY laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out around the far turn before fanning to the six path
into upper stretch, then sustained gradual progress in the final furlong. OUR DOTSIE tracked two wide and between horses into the first turn, ranged up
three wide around the far turn to take aim on the clear leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase between horses through midstretch and yielded.
CANDY BAR was bumped by an outer rival at the start, got a bit keen forwardly place three wide and between horses into the first turn, settled into stride
tucking three to two wide into the backstretch, applied pressure along with an outer rival nearing the lane, but was outkicked by that one entering it and
weakened between horses. CECILE stalked along the inside, shifted out to the four path entering upper stretch, but was brushed and forced into tight
quarters by an outer rival entering midstretch causing a strong steady, then failed to recover. MILLIAT (IRE) broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the two path,
then in the three to four path around the far turn before swinging to the seven path into the lane, but lacked a rally. LAST CALL bumped an inner rival at the
start, lacked speed in the two path and got outrun. MUSICAL PRAYER tracked in the four path around the first turn but steadily faded thereafter. THE
RIDER OFCECILE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL
AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
ATOMIC CITY set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer prompter entering the lane and held sway through the late stages. MISS MARTINI
leaned in as an inner rival missed the break at the start, tracked four wide, gained place tucking three wide in midstretch, ran on in pursuit of the leader
through the lane but was kept at bay and saved place from an outer late challenger. BLACK DOG pursued from midpack in the two path, swung five wide
into upper stretch, rallied to offer a late bid for place but just missed. TOTALLY JUSTIFIED tracked along the inside sustained a chase along the rail through
the lane but needed more. MAD ABOUT MARIE broke a beat slow, saved ground off of the pace and moved up late. OLIVIA'S POTION prompted outside of
the leader, but failed to sustain pressure entering the lane and faded between horses. TRADING SECRETS broke slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted to
the four path entering the lane and improved between horses. SHE'S A SWEDE was bumped and forced outwardly at the start by an inner rival, lacked
speed in the three to four path and between horses, then made little impact. REIGN CHAMPAGNE laid off of the pace in the three path and gave way
between horses. TIZNTSHELOVELY broke out and bumped a rival at the start, stalked three deep into the turn, chased entering the lane and weakened
between horses in upper stretch. POOTOOGOOK lacked speed in the four to seven path and got outrun.

Footnotes
ZADORSKY stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage while brushing his inner
counterpart in upper stretch and drove clear. REAGAN'S FLAME bumped an outer rival at the start, laid close up along the inside, stalked around the turn,
chased into the lane before tipping out to the three path in upper stretch, then edged place between horses leaving the furlong grounds and proved second
best. SHE'S COOL took contact from rivals on both sides at the start trailed along the inside, advanced inside of rivals in upper stretch, sustained progress
altering two wide at the sixteenth pole and reached show late. WINAKACHING tracked behind the main group early on, shifted to the four path with three
furlongs to go, chased to attempt a bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner rival leaving that station, yielded and lost show late.
INDESCRIPTABLE pursued from midpack in the four path coming under urging into the turn, got floated to the five path at the three furlong pole, then
improved mildly and failed to menace. CRAZY CAMI brushed an inner rival before being pinched back from crowded quarters between foes at the start,
raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, and failed to factor. KRICKLE set the pace in the two path, got brushed and headed by an outer
bidder in upper stretch, lugged out and steadied from rider's correction at the furlong grounds, then continued to weaken. BEELIEVE HER raced forwardly
two wide and between horses, but faded turning for home. BEAUTY N THE BOLT laid off of the pace in the two path and tired.

Footnotes
FIBBER tracked in the two path, gained on the top pair along with an outer NAY V BELLE into the turn, paused while awaiting racing room just behind the
leaders turning for home, swung out four wide to take aim as his aforementioned counterpart struck the front, offered her own rally to reel in that rival at the
furlong grounds and drove clear. NAY V BELLE stalked three wide, bid turning for home, gained an advantage entering the lane, but was caught by an outer
bidder at the furlong grounds and remained clear of show. LADY MOSCATO trailed in the two path, shifted out to the five path improving entering upper
stretch, then ran on to gain show at the sixteenth pole. TRIAL laid off of the pace in the four path, got outmoved by an inner rival getting floated to the six
path entering the lane, then surpassed a pair of tiring rivals. BENEDETTA dueled for the lead with an outer rival through a fast opening quarter, got headed
by her counterpart with three furlongs to go and faded through the lane. ASTERNIA dueled for the lead two wide, led narrowly turning for home as an outer
rival applied pressure, got headed by that one entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CENTURIA (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked taking aim outside of the leading pair around the far turn, bid entering the lane and drew
off. UNION MIST laid off of the pace two wide, awaited racing room behind rivals around the far turn, split foes in the three path in upper stretch and rallied
to edge place in the final furlong. STRATOSPHERIC stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the pace-setter with five furlongs to run, pressed into the far
turn, bid along with an outer rival nearing the lane, but got swiftly outkicked and lost place in the final furlong. STAY LOST saved ground off of the pace,
chased creeping closer around the far turn, fanned to the four path entering upper stretch and ran on mildly. I AM THE SAUCE pursued from midpack two
wide and between horses, chased in the five path around teh far turn and lacked a bid. LEAMETATRAINER pursued from midpack three wide and failed to
factor. ABOVE ALL ELSE showed the way around both turns, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders entering the lane and weakened. LOOKING FOR
GINNY trailed along the inside and failed to factor. SOUNDBITE tracked three to four wide, but chased into the far turn and weakened. LEMON LATTE
raced at the rear two wide and got outrun. TIME FOR MAGIC stalked two to three wide and weakened between horses approaching the far turn.
