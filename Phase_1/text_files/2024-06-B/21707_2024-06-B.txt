Footnotes
BRICKTOWN BROWN last away, moved to a forward position down the stretch the first time, cut the corner in the first turn to vie for the lead onto the
backstretch, dueled through the second bend while remaining closest to the rail, displayed good resolve to prevail late in a determined effort. DOCTOR
TINK forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, vied three wide up the backstretch, dueled outside the winner through the final turn and into the
stretch, outkicked late to prove second best. LA BATALLA within striking distance early, fell back before a half, proved no match for the top two the final
quarter. YOU'REOBADBOY with the early pace, continued to contest the issue up the backstretch while between the top two, stopped far turn. This race
had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TRIBAL QUEEN with the pace three wide and outside in the run up the backstretch, angled in slightly midway on the turn when clear, dueled into the stretch
then held sway over that rival in the final sixteenth under steady handing. HALE'S LUCKY LADY behind the leaders toward the inside early, slipped through
along the rail when moving closer turning into the stretch, mild bid, second best. HUSHED came out at the start, was straightened to race with the pace up
the backstretch, steered out when falling back off the winner entering the stretch, weakened gradually to the wire while managing to save the show.
ASSEMBLED STORM broke back, lacked speed, four wide into the lane, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. IMA HOT TOTTIE with the
pace while between rivals up the backstretch, steadied while still between horses in the turn, fell back and did not contend thereafter. MY INSTIGATOR
forwardly placed early while between rivals, steadily faded down the lane. IMA HAPPY DANCER reluctant to load, stumbled badly at the break to spot the
field several lengths and lose all chance, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF IMA HOT TOTTIE AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE MIDWAY ON THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SARA'S SAPPHIRE took command after the start, rated past the wire the first time, continued to show the way under light restraint up the backstretch the
second time, extended advantage through the third turn and maintained daylight to the wire while under steady handling. RUBY THE DESTROYER broke
with the winner, fell off that one early, continued to chase the middle half mile, could do little with that one the final quarter mile, clearly second best.
MOONLIGHT RAIN void of early foot just off the inside, continued to lag through the second turn and up the backstretch, was along for the show through the
lane while not a threat to the top pair. RIVER LIBERTY settled off the top two inside, had little for that pair the final furlong, caught for the show.
MINNESOTA NICE raced back off the pace while outside, stopped the final quarter. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

steady handling. STRIKETHREEYOUROUT broke in, raced n the second flight early off the inside, dropped to the rail in the turn, rallied up the inside to
earn the place. FLATOUTSASSYOK chased the winner off the inside, could do little with that one through the lane, outkicked for the second spot late.
AZUSA STREET lacked earlyfoot,improved position slightly when racing in the two path. LIL TIZZY lacked a rally while four to five into the lane. SALT
CREEK CAT off a step slow, remained back. GOLDIE'S LEGACY in mid pack early, backed up through the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LAPIS LAZULI outrun early, began to advance from between foes three furlongs in, steered outside 2nd turn, four wide rally, up in time in a well judged ride.
TWENTY TO PARK closest to the leader, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, bid inside the winner and between horses with a sixteenth to run,
could not match strides in the late going. TAP N PLAY asked leaving the gate to assume command, stretched that advantage up the backstretch, held a
shrinking advantage into the stretch, could not contain the top two. KISSOFTHENILE in the second flight early, came up empty for the drive to finish up
evenly. FLASHY BOY GOES steadied past the wire the first time to be shuffled back to last, remained back and was never a threat. FRIGERATOR
stumbled at the start, settled in mid pack early, had little left for the stretch run outside, faded to trail home. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WON NINETY off the pace outside, five wide first turn, asked along advanced into second turn, took over, enough left to hold off the runner up in the final
strides. GOSPEL FOREST fractious in the paddock, hustled away from the back, vied, fell back off winner into the far turn, moved out, rebid late to narrowly
miss. C J'S LEGACY void of early foot, staged a belated rally to be in time for the show. ALWAYS A KING away in good order, set or forced the pace for a
half, broke stride briefly when headed by the winner late in the final turn, weakened through the stretch to lose a couple of more positions. BERRYVILLE
BULLET fell back to trail after the start, continued back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. TIZNOWS GRANDSON boxed in along the
inside through the first turn when within striking position, came up empty for the drive. SPENT WELL forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady
retreat before three furlongs. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SPANISH HOMBRE asked away from the gate, pressed the leader from along the inside into the first turn, dueled the middle part, shook clear turning for
home and increased that advantage under steady handling. BANJO BEAR broke on top, showed the way under the wire the first time, relinquished the
advantage to the winner first turn, pressed then proved no match through the stretch, lasted for the place. LIARS CLUB closest to the top two after moving
out in the three path, continued that pursuit into the stretch, getting to the runner up late, well clear of the others. FIRE EXTINGUISHER five wide into the
first turn, continued back, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. DOCS CARO CAT settled in mid pack early, failed to muster a response
in the drive. RONALD DALE settled in mid pack early, tired from those efforts in the drive. CHARING CROSS last away, trailed throughout in showing little.
This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HE'S A ROCK took command soon after the start while angling to the inside, set the pace, rated up the backstretch, bit of a breather into the far turn, asked
along late in that bend and held the runner up at bay in the run to the wire. FORTY STRANGERS pressed the winner from off the inside, crept closer late n
the final turn, could do little more with that one while lasting for the place. WRISTBAND void of early foot, began a steady gain after three furlongs,
continued willingly to the end to be getting to the top two. WAR HAWK saved ground behind the top two, continued inside into the lane, lacking a closing
punch. LUCKY MCCOY void of early foot, improved before a half, went evenly through the lane in lacking an additional response. KYEMBEA forwardly
placed early, began to fade after a half. DEROY remained back throughout in lacking a closing bid. TUFF MANDATE five wide into the first turn, fell back to
trail before a half and was well beaten in the end. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.
