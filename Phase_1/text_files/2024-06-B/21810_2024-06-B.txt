MORE THAN GOOD prompted the pace along the rail into the stretch, gained a narrow lead near the furlong marker and proved best under right handed
urging. CRYO pressed the pace three wide into the turn, gained a narrow advantage past the five sixteenths pole, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and
finished second best. MUNI MUNI SLEW never far back, finished with good courage along the inside. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO went evenly. GILLIGAN
trailed into the turn then had a mild late rally in the two path. ROCK ON KITTEN was restless in the gate and never threatened. AMIGO'S AFFAIR had
speed through the turn then faded. KOSCIUSZKO was no factor. UHAVETOBEKITTENME away alertly, set the pace in the three then two path into the
turn, kept on into the stretch and gave way late.

Footnotes
KISS ME ON OCONEE prompted the pace two wide through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch, drifted to the six path and finished full of run under
mild right handed urging to win going away. QADIRA away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was no match for the winner.
CHARLOTTES WAY forwardly placed, finished with good courage in the five path. SURPRISED GEM unhurried early, passed tiring rivals through the
stretch along the rail. HEART OF THE BEAST trailed early, swung wide and improved position. MALI BALI had good early speed three wide and was
through after a half. KINDNESS IS FREE failed to menace. SISTER CODE was no factor. MO RISSA veered out at the start and was no threat.

Footnotes
SWING LOW trailed for a half, closed rapidly three wide through the far turn, made the lead in upper stretch, shook clear under right handed urging and
lasted under brisk handling. ICE BLAST allowed to settle, swung wide, had a mild late rally near mid track and finished second best. SWEEPING GIANT
was fractious in the gate, slow early then found his best stride late two wide. KADESH pressed the pace two wide, made the lead at the half mile marker, set
a pressured pace into the stretch along the inside then was outfinished. HAMMERIN AAMER stalked the early pace, offered a mild bid three then two wide
through the far turn then came up empty. SURF AND TURF was no threat. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU also fractious in the gate, set the pace along the
inside for nearly a half then folded. SUDDEN SHIFT was no factor.
