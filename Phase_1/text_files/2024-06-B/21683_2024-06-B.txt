VICTORY LINE opened up early, never pressured, drew out. CANYOUHEARMENOW stalked outside, rallied for place. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN, well placed
outside, made a place bid in the drive, tired. LOVE OURS, well placed inside, made a place bid in the drive, tired. FRANKS RELOAD showed little. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
