Footnotes
PAID IN FULL saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when challenged and prevailed in a stiff
drive. MOVE OVER (GB) saved ground while being reserved off the pace, moved up along the inside on the turn then slipped through to join PAID IN FULL
and CREATIVE BID, dueled with them despite drifting out slightly late and just missed in a game try. CREATIVE BID chased PAID IN FULL while two-wide,
moved up to join that one during the quarter pole, was three-wide entering and continued on to the wire to miss narrowly in a determined effort. SHOT OF A
LIFETIME was allowed to settle while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. BERNALINHO was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired.
STEPHEN JAMES prompted the pace for five furlongs while three-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
HELEN'S SUN saved ground setting the pace, settled into the stretch with a clear lead and then ducked out sharply nearing the wire causing interference to
WARRENS CANDY MAN late. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE FINISH
AND AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS DISQUALIFIED HELEN'S SUN FROM FIRST TO SECOND. WARRENS CANDY MAN saved ground chasing HELEN'S
SUN then angled out leaving the quarter pole to be three-wide, was gaining on the winner in the late stages then was carried out sharply by that one nearing
the wire and finished willingly for second when clear but was awarded the win via disqualification. VALIDATE saved ground while being all to settle, slipped
through during the drive and closed strongly. EMPEROROFTHENORTH steadied from between horses nearing the seven-eighths pole then was unhurried,
came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. NYQUILER was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch
and weakened. O'BANION (IRE) was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. NORTHERN BLEND was reserved
off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

ABRAAJ MIRAGE saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win going
away. PRINCE OF LUCK bobbled at the start then moved up along the inside to set the pressured pace, responded when asked but was unable to resist
the winner late and held on well for second in a game try. UPPER ROOM was allowed to settle, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly.
BRONY BOY was unhurried early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole then angled in during the drive and finished in a mild rally. GOLDEN
COWBOY prompted PRINCE OF LUCK while racing three-wide and weakened. ANNA'S IRON MAN was prominent early while racing two-wide and tired.
IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. PER RULING #ECM2024-238 FROM HIWU, ABRAAJ
MIRAGE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

TABLE BAY was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. PIRATE RED chased
SURROUNDEDBYANGELS while racing two-wide, split rivals during the drive and finished well for second. SURROUNDEDBYANGELS saved ground
setting the pace and held on fairly well when headed for third. J C'S A LEGEND was reserved off the pace while racing four-wide on the turn and lacked a
rally. PASS THE CROWN saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously threaten.

DON'T TELL HYDEE was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead leaving the eighth pole then drifted out late interfering with
EYES FOR GOLD and held on but FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY DON'T TELL HYDEE WAS DISQUALIFED FROM FIRST AND PLACED
SECOND. EYES FOR GOLD saved ground while being reserved off the pace, steadied nearing the quarter pole lacking room, angled out to be three-wide
entering the stretch, was closing strongly when forced to alter course nearing the sixteenth pole when DON'T TELL HYDEE came out and finished willingly
when clear then was awarded the win via disqualification. SHELBY GOLD was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
FIRE ESCAPE saved ground setting the pace to the eighth pole and weakened when headed. JUSTIN'S LADY was allowed to settle early, came four-wide
into the stretch but lacked a rally. RED PANTY NIGHT was forwardly placed for a half mile while three-wide and tired.

the lead to nearing the stretch from along the inside and weakened. SUBITO SLEW dropped back early while saving ground and improved his position.
