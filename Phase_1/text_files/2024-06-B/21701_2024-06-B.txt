MAILS HERE prompted the pace three then two wide, gained a narrow lead midway on the turn, set the balance of the pace under strong pressure and
proved best under left handed urging while fully extended. TAHLEQUAH JOE allowed to settle, loomed boldly three wide in upper stretch then couldn't get
by the winner. WILDCAT PRIDE bumped with SPIRIT OF AKRON then stumbled at the start, was never far back and finished determinedly inside the top
pair. NOAH MY BABY set a pressured pace along the inside until the middle of the turn, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened.
SHOWTIME BOY failed to menace. SPIRIT OF AKRON bumped with WILDCAT PRIDE at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
CHARGINA stalked the pace down the backstretch, surged three wide to make the lead past the three eighths pole, widened into the stretch under right
handed urging and won under strong handling. SCOOP THERE IT IS well placed, had a mild late rally four wide and got up for second. FRANKLY MY
DEAR stumbled at the start, rushed to the lead soon thereafter, battled two wide into the turn, chased the winner from there and was outfinished for second.
SKY failed to menace. LA REINA DEL NORTE stumbled badly at the start, raced outside and lacked the needed response. MORE MUCHO dueled for the
lead along the inside foe three furlongs, kept on past the furlong marker and weakened late.

RONNI'S WIND pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead at the five sixteenths pole then widened at will through the stretch to win easily. MY
TWO JAKES wouldn't load in the gate, trailed early, had a mild late rally three wide and got up for second. HISTORYINTHEMAKING broke slowly and
finished determinedly four wide. VILLAGE CAT sped to the front soon after the start, set the pace until the middle of the turn, kept on into the stretch and
weakened late. LIGHTENING LOTTIE well placed, failed to respond. GHOSTLY REVIVAL was through early.
