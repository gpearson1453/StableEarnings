Footnotes
DRILIN' FOR GEMS chased the leader into the turn, rallied two wide to make the lead near the five sixteenths pole then widened the balance of the trip
under right handed urging to win as much the best. FORMYBOYS allowed to settle, had a mild rally in the five path in upper stretch and finished clear for
second. VERNON'S BEST slow early, found his best stride late in the two path. PLUM TUFF veered out at the start, moved up three wide into the stretch
then came up empty. MR SIX stalked the pace from the three path and gave way in the stretch. TOOK THE RISK opened a daylight lead shortly after the
start, set the pace into the turn, kept on into the stretch and stopped late.

DELOVELY vied for the lead three wide into the stretch, responded under right urging to make the lead nearing the furlong marker and drew off. PINK
PARTY PANTS away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner. MAKES SENSE TO ME unhurried early,
finished with good courage in the four path. PEARLINTHEROUGH allowed to settle, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch giving up
ground then came on again late to finish on even terms with MAKES SENSE TO ME at the wire. FULL TIME STRUTIN chased the pace along the inside
until deep stretch then faded. ELIKA stumbled at the start and railed throughout. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

MANDOLIN BREEZE stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, dug in under right handed urging to make the lead near the sixteenth pole and proved
best under strong handling. FEELING EASY pressed the pace two wide, took over mid turn, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
THE KID'S PRAYER went evenly. QUICK RENDEZVOUS away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, kept on until deep stretch then
faded. SPUNKY ONE was no factor. VAMONOS PIACENTE had brief speed. CORA CORONA stumbled at the start, moved closer in the four path on the
turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
MIESHA vied for the lead four then three wide into the turn, made the lead past the five sixteenths marker then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best while taken in hand late. VERTISALUTE never far back, rallied three wide into the stretch and finished clear for second. DOMINUS O'S ME
settled mid pack, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the eight path. SOMETHING LUCKY passed tiring rivals. BEAUTIFUL CHARADE battled for the
turn and weakened late. SMARTASSET set a pressured pace along the inside down the backstretch and weakened in upper stretch. A P'S RUNAWAY
DIVA was no factor. QUETZALY was no threat. BOLD NICKY was through early.
