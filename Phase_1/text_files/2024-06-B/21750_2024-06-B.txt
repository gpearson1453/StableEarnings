ABOVE THE SKY was rowdy in thepost parade, unhurried to the turn with a five wide run into the stretch, kept on and cleared away to hold sway at the
wire. MIKEY'S MAGIC GAL inside run early, no room to the quarter pole, split horses late. GAMBI had a slow start, rallied on wide into the stretch grinding
along. TONALITY broke poorly from the gate and lost best chance, ran on from the turn to improve mildly late. LADLE sharp speed to chase pace to turn,
cleared into stretch faltered. MIRANDA was rowdy loading into the gate, quick speed to the turn, over taken and wilted back in the stretch.

Footnotes
KATIE GOT LUCKY good position inside throughout, rallied into far turn, kept on to clear off to the wire under good handling. MOONSHINE DREAMER
outside run to far turn never far back to the stretch and finished well for the place spot. CARIBBEAN NIGHT slow from the gate, no early speed with an
outside run to far turn, angled in stretch kept on but lost place on the wire. CHICA DE ORO speed to the front, led to far turn and weakened through stretch
run. SOULSTONE trailed to the half, shuffled to far turn, stayed on outside stretch run to improve in the late going. TRICK HAT saved ground with no speed
throughout and improved mildly late. BLUE GUITAR chasing pace to the half and steadily faded from inside through the stretch run. COMPETITIVE FIRE
never menaced throughout.
