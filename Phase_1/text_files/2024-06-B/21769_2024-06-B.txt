roused under left handed encouragement in the late stretch to edge past the pace setter and be up in the final strides to prevail. MR. SHORTY broke slightly
outward and bumped foe, then set the pace from the inside, continued to show the way in hand on the turn, was in a strong drive in the late stretch then was
outfinsihed by CAJUN WARRIOR in the final yards. NEVER OVER ME chased the pace while three wide into the turn, came out four wide in the upper
stretch, rallied and was up for the show prize in the end. CLIPPER COVE pursued the pace from the inside, menaced leaving the turn and lacked the
needed response in the late stretch and was out finished for the show prize in the end. FLAT OUT PERFECT settled at the tail of the field outside of rival,
then rallied mildly leaving the bend and was no threat. TIZ FABULOUS coaxed from the gate while two wide and between rivals, continued to chase
throughout the turn while in a mild bid then flattened out in the stretch. MORO FLASHBACK angled in along the rail and trailed behind the field with an outer
foe, then steadied at the quarter pole and failed to menace in the end. PER RULING LSP32324 FROM THE TEXAS HORSE RACING COMMISION CAJUN

Footnotes
AMERICAN FOREST pursued the pace from the inside, remained well rated on the turn, then dug in gamely in the late stretch to tip by the dueling pair and
was up at the wire to claim victory. EUROROCKSTAR laid off the pace while four wide then inched up on the turn to duel with an inner rival heading into the
stretch was in an all out drive then was out finished by a inner rival in the final yards and hung in the end. RECKLESS RED veered outwardly then contested
with an outer rival down the backstretch, cleared that rival on the turn and dueled with another heading into the stretch, was in a long drive then steadied
late and held onto the show position in the end. OZZIES WINGS Y G pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch, continue to urge eagerly on
the turn while chasing the leaders then gave way in the stretch. FLY'N SEXY raced towards the back while three wide, was in a hard drive on the far turn to
rally in the stretch and came up evenly and empty. TEXAS PRADO raced while four wide towards the back of the pack while urging steadily, then angled
inwards in the upper stretch to bid in the lane and made no impact in the end. BLINGO was impeded at the start, then chased the pace while two wide,
dropped back on the turn, came out seven wide in the upper stretch and was no threat. SUMMER HELP dueled with an inner foe down the backstretch and
in a hard drive, could not retain bid on the turn and flattened out in the remaining furlongs. There was an INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following
the race. The rider of RECKLESS RED claimed foul against the rider of EUROROCKSTAR for interference in the late stretch. After review, no change was
made to the order of finish.

ABSOLUTE COURAGE was brushed at the start, then vied for the lead into the first turn, established the pace down the backstretch while two wide, then
contested with an inner rival on the far turn and into the early stretch, found more and kicked clear in the final sixteenth to prevail in the end. DEFINE saved
ground in the early stages while racing towards the back along the rail, then rallied leaving the far turn and closed well down the lane to be up for the place
position in the end. PURE MALICE broke outwardly and bushed foe, bid for the lead from the inside before pressing leader down the backstretch, then
moved up to duel on the far turn and into the early stretch, then was outkicked and missed the place position in the end. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE tracked
the pace while three deep down the backstretch, then menaced leaving the far turn in attempt to overpower the leaders, lacked the overcoming stride and
gave way in the end. CHELSEA DAGGER raced in the middle of the pack along the inside down the backstretch, then bid while two wide on the far turn and
between rivals and lacked responding in the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY settled in the two path early, bid while three wide on the far turn and never

Footnotes
FOO FLIGHTER bumped foe at the start, was reserved in the early stages towards the back, then improved position heading into the far turn while still
being well rated, came out three wide in the upper stretch to gain command at the eighth pole and held on well to prevail in the end. TEXAS CLUBMAN set
the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was pressed by an outer foe on the far turn, remained unbothered, continued to lead in the upper stretch
then faltered in the end. GHOST COWBOY tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then bid between rivals on the far turn to gain second
position in the upper stretch, could not overcome the leader and gave way in the end missing the place prize. CAPTAINS COVE was squeezed back at the
start, then settled while two wide at the tail of the field, then bid on the far turn while coming out five to six wide and came up empty in the end. RED DRAW
raced at a moderate pace while tracking the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn and lacked sparking in the home stretch.
SONNY BOB tracked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, was in a mild drive on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. ALL MIGHT
pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, could not overcome the leader on the far turn while in a hard drive then flattened out in the
stretch. EAGLEFORD stumbled at the start and was no menace.

Footnotes
REQUISITION tracked the pace from the inside while in a steady hand ride down the early backstretch, then gained command heading into the far turn, was
confronted by an outer foe at the quarter pole to spar briefly before shaking clear in the late stretch to prevail while in a strong drive. LEVY was brushed at
the start, then raced mid pack while two wide, was nicely rated before being asked on the far turn while three wide, dug in in the upper stretch could not
catch the cleared leader and was up for second place. EGO saved ground in the early furlongs while two wide, was roused on the far turn while four wide to
improve position in the upper stretch and get up for the show prize in the end. FEDERAL HILL broke outwardly and brushed foe then raced from the inside
mid pack, remained at an even pace throughout the far turn and needed more in the end. CREATIVE MIRACLE pursued the pace while two wide and in
second position down the backstretch, then steered clear of the incoming rivals to duel with the pace setter leaving the far turn, could not overbid the leader
and gave way in the end. TAM'S TIME was allowed to settle while three wide down the backstretch, then urged on the far turn to rally in the stretch and
came up empty. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) settled along the inside early, then bid in the late stretch and made no impact in the end. GOLD ACCOUNT broke
outwardly and bumped foe and was no threat. GIST was bumped at the start and failed to rally. WHOOPING JAY angled in to set the pace into the first turn,
was in a steady drive then was overpowered by an inner foe heading into the far turn and gave way in the end.

Footnotes
ON WING angled to the inside to set the pace into the turn while in hand, then was asked at the top of the stretch and pulled away to prove best overall.
HOLLYWOODBOULEVARD was in a steady hand drive while pursing the pace from the inside into the turn, then came on in the late stretch to gain second
position, could not catch the cleared leader and was best for the place prize. CAT ISLAND EXPRESS hopped then bumped rival at the start, then hustled
along the inside, remained rated on the turn behind the pack, then was encouraged mid stretch and closed well for the show prize in the end. SHE'S A
GOLD LADY was reserved towards the back early, then came out five wide leaving the turn and rallied too little too late in the end. MO WILLA chased the
pace while two wide and between rivals, was in a mild drive on the turn then lacked the needed response in the stretch. JUST PLAIN BAD pressed the
emerging leader while two wide into the turn, could not overbid the determined foe and gave way in the lane. MAGENS BAY moved up from the four path
from the back to bid while two wide on the turn, rallied in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. CHARMING LEAH chased the pace while five and
outside of rivals, then moved up to bid from the three path on the turn and did not fire in the stretch. LADY ATHENA chased the pace while four deep and
between rivals, then steadied off heels, regained stride heading into the turn, bid in the upper stretch to no avail in the end. MORO PRINCESS pursued the
pace between rivals and while three wide, then checked up heading into the turn, regained stride, came out four wide in the upper stretch to rebid but it was
to no avail . KOLLYNS JULIE was unhurried and no rally. J L SPRING TARGET was impeded at the start and no factor.
