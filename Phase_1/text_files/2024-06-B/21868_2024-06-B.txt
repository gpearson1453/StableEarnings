Footnotes
IOWA HAWKEYE laid off the pace while three wide in the second flight of rivals, came under coaxing leaving the turn while four wide, dug in gamely in the
upper stretch to gain command at the eighth pole and drew clear to prove the best. MISTER BEAMS bid for the lead between rivals before settling back
three wide to stalk the leading pair into the turn, was in steady drive leaving the bend, shifted outward in the upper stretch and rallied bid to get up for the
place in the final yards while in pursuit of the cleared leader. NORTHWIND led briefly from the gate before going shoulder to shoulder with an inner foe into
the turn, assumed command, was challenged by rivals from both sides at the quarter pole and into to the early stretch then gave way in the final sixteenth.
STORM STRATEGY chased the pace with inner stablemate into the turn, rallied bid entering the stretch and came up empty. MESSAGE DISCIPLINE
moved up along the inside to spar with an outer foe into the turn, continued to press said rival throughout the bend, then rallied gamely to vie in the upper
stretch before flattening out. CHADRON was off a step slower than the field, then pursued the pace from the inside, was flat throughout and needed rally.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CUT pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, inched up to spar with the pace setter in the final quarter, dug in grudgingly throughout and
was up at the wire to prevail. LARRY'S LEGEND drifted outward at the start, then set the pace from the inside, was confronted by an outer rival at the
quarter pole to duel in the early stretch, was in an all out drive in the final yards and hung at the wire. RAVEN'S NEST prompted the pace from the four path,
continued to pursue while two wide on the turn, came out three wide in the upper stretch and dueled for the show position down the lane and was up at the
wire. BOUGIE JOE prompted the pace while three wide down the backstretch, continued to chase along the rail on the turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch
and was outbid by an outer foe for the show prize. GOLD BARON settled back at the tail early, then came out four wide leaving the bend to bid in the stretch
and never threatened. WIREWYRE shifted inward at the start, then hustled along the rail to pursue the leading the pair into the turn, bid briefly before
flattening out in the stretch.

then dug in and was in an all out drive and lasted to the wire to prove best. NIGHT ORB stalked the emerging leader while two wide, was in a long drive
leaving the turn, rallied in attempt to overtake the lead, lacked the winning bid and held onto the place position. MAGGIE D'CAUSE chased the pace from

Footnotes
ESSAY emerged to establish the lead from the inside, maintained the pace throughout the turn while in a steady hand ride and was kept to task down the
lane to prove the best. TEXAS CREED pressed the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn, then rallied bid in the upper stretch but could not
catch the leader in the end and was second best. BRUSHY BILL was in tight early and checked up, then trailed circled five wide leaving the bend and
closed well down the lane to be up for the show prize. HEATS HERO was allowed to settle from the inside, then rallied leaving the bend but it was too little
too late. BETTER EDGE pursued the pace between rivals and while two wide, steadied slightly, then rallied bid on the turn between rivals, was bumped
heading into the stretch, rebid while in a mild rally and came up empty. CLEVER IT bid briefly for the lead while two wide, then faded throughout and lacked
rallying in the stretch. GOLDEN GRIT was unhurried early, then was moving up on the turn while four wide and in a strong drive, was bumped by an inner
foe entering the stretch and lost stride. KING ADOLIS chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, then rallied bid at the quarter pole while drifting
out slightly, bumped foe then lost momentum in the stretch. EAGLE IN THE AIR chased the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then
flattened out in the stretch. HASHTAGMAKITHAPPEN pursued the pace while four wide and in a hard drive throughout then flattened out in the lane.

Footnotes
SON OF A BLING vied from the inside early, then assumed command heading into the turn, then held sway down the lane while in a strong drive to claim
victory. BANDERA BLING vied for the lead while two to three wide early, then pressed the pace on the turn while in a hard drive, could not catch determined
leader in the lane and held the place position. SHARP LORENZO was bumped at the start, then vied with inner foes into the turn, continued to stalk the
emerging leader while three wide throughout, then rallied in the early stretch, could never catch the leader and was best for third place winnings. MY
BUDDY MEL broke inwardly and bumped foe, was allowed to settle while two wide in the back pack, trailed throughout the turn, then rallied bid between
rivals in the upper stretch and came up empty. RIPSTER was allowed to settle in the back trio while three wide, then bid mildly on the turn and into the
stretch and never threatened. DARYLS TRUMP CARD bid for the lead while two wide before settling back and stalking the leading trio into the turn, then bid
from two path in the upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FLYING CAESAR was allowed to settle along the rail in the back trio then rallied bid on
the turn and came up flat in the stretch.

SUPERSECRETWEAPON established the pace into the first turn along the rail, was in a long drive on the far turn, then held on well down the lane while in
an all out drive to prove best overall. REGAL TERKA tracked the pace from the inside in the early stages, then came out three wide leaving the far turn to
rally bid in the upper stretch, gained second position but did not have enough to overcome the leader in the final yards and was second best. CINCO
RICHIE was forwardly placed to press the pace from the two path throughout, rallied gamely leaving the far turn, could not overpower the pace setter and
gave way in the lane. MORO MAFIA broke inwardly and brushed foe, was rank heading into the first turn, then raced while two wide mid pack down the
backstretch, rallied while three wide on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. KING ARTHUR RIDGE was allowed to settle along the inside, then
bid while two wide on the far turn and into the stretch and never threatened. YO SOY ROY was brushed at the start and was no threat. VINO TEXAS JESS
was no menace. ALLIGATOR CRAWL was no menace. SILVER AND GOLD raced from the inside mid pack at a moderate pace throughout and failed to
rally in the stretch. CRAZY RIDGE stalked the pace while three wide in the early furlongs, then pulled up on the far turn and eased across the wire.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE SHOCK pursued the pace while three wide, was encouraged on the turn from the inside, came out four wide in the upper stretch, dug in
gamely and closed well to be up at the wire to claim victory. RAGS ROYAL PRINZ stalked the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive on the turn, dug
in gamely in the upper stretch to go head to head with DESIRABLE EDGE in the final yards then was out finished by COMPETITIVE SHOCK from the
outside and hung at the wire. DESIRABLE EDGE dueled from the two path before gaining command heading into the turn, was contested by foes from both
sides at the quarter pole, then pulled away to duel with RAGS ROYAL PRINZ in the late stretch, was in an all out drive, then was out finished and hung
third. PROUD SAMARITAN raced towards the rear while five while, then rallied bid leaving the bend and was closing willingly down the lane. BRODY'S
TREASURE broke outwardly, then chased the pace while two wide into the turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch and kept on down the lane while in a mild
drive. CHASING THE RUSH dueled with an outer foe into the turn, continued to press said rival throughout the turn, found more to vie briefly in the upper
stretch while in a gamely bid then gave way in the final furlong. TOO MUCH SPEED raced while four wide mid field, then rallied mildly in the stretch and
came up empty. MR. BOOP veered outwardly, then chased the pace from the inside, was flat throughout and needed rally. BARTOLOME was hindered at
the start and failed to rally. C J'S MISCHIEF was impeded at the start and was no menace. BRILLIANT EDGE was no factor.

Footnotes
CONTRABBANDA hit gate at the start, then saved ground in the early stages, fanned out six wide in the upper stretch, dug in gamely to take command at
the eighth and drew clear in the final yards to prevail. KARA saved ground in the early furlongs, then bid between rivals on the far turn while three wide,
shifted out six in the upper stretch and closed well down the lane to be up for the place prize. C W CHARM raced mid field along the rail at a moderate pace
down the backstretch, was in tight on the far turn, steadied sharply, angled out seven wide in the upper stretch then closed willingly down the lane and was
up for the show prize. UTSIRA tracked the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then rallied a gamely bid leaving the far turn while four wide,
assumed command briefly in the upper stretch, then was passed up by CONTRABBANDA from the outside and gave way in the final yards. MIZ RITHYM
raced mid pack down the backstretch while two wide, came under coaxing leaving the far turn, rallied mildly in the early stretch and needed more in the end.
CACTUS BLOSSOM tracked the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout the early furlongs, then rallied bid in the final quarter but it was to no
avail. PLATINUM PHANTOM sparred with an inner foe heading into the first turn, then gained command to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long
drive on the far turn, then was overpowered by rivals heading into the home stretch and gave way. SOTONA was well rated while stalking the pace from the
two path down the backstretch, remained in a steady drive on the far turn before launching bid in the upper stretch, lacked the needed response and gave
way. HOT COOKIE was unhurried early and no threat. MISTY MOOD was allowed to settle while two wide towards the back, then bid while three wide on
the far turn and into the stretch and made no impact . ROYAL LIAISON was bumped at the start, stalked the pace while three wide throughout the early
furlongs, then rallied bid on the far turn before flattening out in the final in the late stretch. MATAGORA BAY dueled from the inside into the first turn before
pressing the emerging leader down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn, was depleted of energy and tired in the stretch.
