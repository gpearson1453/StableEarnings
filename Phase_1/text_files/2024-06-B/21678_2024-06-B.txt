DREAMINONTHENILE sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more, responded,
dug in gamely over pressure and held firm. BUG A BOO raced in the back in the opening quarter, moved up closer racing four wide late on the turn, swung
into action entering the lane, gathered momentum under a drive, finished with good response and captured place. LUCKYHOTSTUFF broke on top then
conceded position and tracked the early pace, given cue three wide in upper stretch, roused forward to race in striking distance approaching the final
sixteenth then yielded and got edged for place. SAMIRA raced up close just off the early leader, was ridden along trying to reach the leader near the quarter
pole, came two wide into the lane, ran on past the furlong marker then flattened out. SABRIA chased two wide off the early pace, shifted out wider in upper
stretch and failed to move on. RISKY WHISKY raced off the pace, saved ground and faded in the lane.

ZIP CODE ENVY moved up soon after the start and challenged COLLECTED GLORY for the early lead, vied inside of rival around the turn, shook free
entering the head of the lane, dug in gamely under pressure and held firm. COLLECTED GLORY broke on top then took on the challenge of ZIP CODE
ENVY in opening stages, vied for the lead around the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the lane but ran on gamely for
second best. SLUSHY tracked the top pair into the turn, hustled along three wide near the quarter pole, came three to four paths wide in upper stretch,
sustained a steady bid and cleared a share. IRISH TAP chased two wide off the early pace, ran on two wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally for
impact. CHIP SHORTAGE chased along the inside, edged closer near the eighth pole then evened out. JAVISTHA raced off the early pace, hustled along
three to four wide into the lane and never threatened. FREEBRITNEY raced in the back throughout.

FREDDY J was well rated sitting just off the early leaders, edged up closer late on the far turn, given cue two wide in upper stretch, roused forward, dueled

up to engage rival for the lead at the half mile marker, vied around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane, held clear past the furlong marker, then
took on the late challenge of FREDDY J, fought back gamely and got edged out in final strides. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL tracked the pace along the inside,
raced behind a pair of rivals late on the backstretch, waited then angled out late on the far turn, shifted out four wide and gained show. STROLLER BOY
stalked the pace up the backstretch, raced three wide in aim at the quarter pole then steadily weakened in the lane. KILLIAN led the way around the first
turn, took on the challenge of WICKLOW LADDIE at the half mile marker, vied for the lead around the far turn then tired in the drive.

PEACE DOG broke on top then settled in striking range three paths wide up the backstretch, poked a head in front three furlongs from home, widened to a
clear advantage, came two to three wide into upper stretch, opened up and kept to task. CONCEPT broke out at the start, tracked the top flight along the
inside, angled out and picked up the pace three wide mid-way around the turn, ran on three to four wide into the lane and gained second best. SEA TO
SUCCESS got bumped at the start, pressed then vied for the lead up the backstretch, got collared by eventual winner three furlongs from home, ran on
through the turn, churned on through the lane and finished well clear over the rest. BOLT FORTY FIVE set a pressured pace in the opening quarter, got
overtaken by the winner entering the turn and steadily faded. NORWAY BEACH raced up close through the backstretch, steadied sharply entering the turn
and quickly retreated.

Footnotes
DILLON ROCKS was well placing sitting just off the embattled duo up the backstretch, let out a notch and took over the lead mid-way around the turn,
hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch, widened advantage and kept to task. SISAWAY NOW vied inside of GOOD SCOUT up the backstretch,
was no match when the winner took over the lead mid-way around the turn, ran on with response along the inside and finished clearly second best. GOOD
SCOUT vied outside of SISAWAY NOW up the backstretch, got overtaken by the winner mid-way around the turn, steadily weakened through the lane and
held show. LEATHERNECK raced off the top trio up then backstretch, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. HEZA WILD RIDE
lacked early speed, raced in the back and had no response when called upon.
