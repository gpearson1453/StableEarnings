AL REICHERT tracked the pacesetters while four to five wide, swept the lead nearing the quarter pole, and drove clear. MENDELJOHN (IRE) rated just off
the pace, shifted out to the four path nearing the stretch, and closed gradually for place. VANTASTICCANAVERAL stalked the pace while four wide,
launched an all out bid at the head of the lane, and was edged out late stretch. MUSTAFA passed tiring rival late. LIL ZAPPER showed the way through the
backstretch, was overtaken into the final turn, and gave way. LIFES ADVENTURE settled inside and failed to threaten.

WHY NOT DANCE set a pressured pace, dueled at the head of the lane inside of MIDNITE SCORE, rival took a slim lead but refused to go down without a
fight, battled back in the final strides and won the nod. MIDNITE SCORE pressed the pace from the three path, gained a slim advantage at the head of the
lane, dueled gamely in the drive and lost the nod after a determined effort. OOPS (GB) lodged a late mild bid. TENDER LOVE rated well off the dueling
pacesetters, took closer order but came up empty for the drive. GOOD BYE NEW YORK trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LYKAN stalked three to four wide early, moved up outside SMART PLAY to challenge the lead, rallied through the stretch and edged clear in the late
stages. SMART PLAY brushed by a riderless horse in the opening turn, responded to a challenge from LYKAN into the stretch, and gave way grudgingly
after a long drive. FOUR O SIX CREED tracked inside, urged along the rail into the stretch but lacked a closing response that was needed.
FLASHFORDANI trailed the field early, chased four wide, and failed to threaten in the drive. THALES raced five wide into the opening turn, and tired early.
TORIADOR stumbled hard leaving the gate, losing the rider, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into
the start of the race but made no change.

BUNNY NOREEN set a pressured pace inside, drew clear into the far turn, was kept to task under handling and successfully fought off a late charge by
KEEPMEINPOWER. KEEPMEINPOWER unhurried early, took closer order leaving the final turn, closed steadily and just missed. BETTOR BET'R stalked
the early pacesetters, drove four to five wide off the final turn, and closed gradually to score show. BURNING UP prompted the pace while five wide, and
faded gradually through the stretch then was edged out late. BEAUTIFUL CALL trailed early and bid belatedly. WICKED WIZZY offered little. GOLDEN
FORTYNINE chased the pace while wide through the backstretch, and tired.

Footnotes
KEEN FLATTER prompted the early pace outside of EL NOBLE, was headed at the top of the stretch, and won going away. EL NOBLE set a pressured
pace from the two path, was no match for the winner and held firm for second. H K RAPPER chased the pacesetters through the backstretch, and gave best
late to earn show honours. KYSTONE reserved off the early pacesetters, and was outkicked in the stretch. PARKING PERMIT improved position late.
ATTENZIONE raced near the back of the field while wide, and lacked a closing response. TAKE CHARGE CURLY saved ground early, swung wide leaving
the final turn, and lacked a kick. WHERE'S THE GOLD settled midpack while three to four wide, and came up empty in the drive. ESTIFRAAD saved ground
inside, and faded. VIATURE lacked running room inside early, swung four wide and gave way.
