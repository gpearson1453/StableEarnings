Footnotes
HIDDEN PROMISE broke alertly, set a pressured pace for half a mile, shook loose and widened under urging. DOCTOR DOOM fanned four wide on the
first turn, remained wide and rallied for the place. JEBOLOGIST prompted the winner for three quarters and faltered. WE BE THERE dropped off the pace,
moved wide on the final turn and was no menace. CORKMAN dropped well behind and was never in contention. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE urged close up
inside for half a mile and faltered. SOCIAL GROUP raced far behind throughout. LONG GRAY LINE lacked speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MENDED WE STAND bid three wide on the turn then wore down the pacesetters and edged clear driving. PONTIFFANY prompted the pace outside, led
narrowly in the stretch and continued gamely to the wire. LEAN ON E settled off the pace and closed well through the final furlong. MATTY BO led under
pressure for half a mile and continued willingly. HIDDEN CACHE saved ground close up then flattened out in the stretch. SO SWELL lacked speed and
narrowed gap without menacing. FAST INTENTIONS chased wide and was always outrun. MELODIA lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

SWING OIL dueled three wide to the stretch, bid to the front and pulled away while kept to his task. NOT THISTIMERANDY urged off the pace inside,
angled out in the stretch and closed well. NUEDORF dueled between rivals to the stretch and weakened slightly. ROAD CALL lagged far behind then
offered some late energy. BORRACHO CONCHO earned a narrow advantage inside for half a mile and gave way. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN dropped far behind
and was never in contention. SPIRIT'S HERO chased close up very wide and stopped abruptly.

outside then closed well in the stretch while no threat to the winner. UNION BELLE raced close up in the opening quarter and continued willingly. BURNING
EMBERS broke alertly and led outside then proved empty in the stretch. PROBLEMS ABOUND trailed racing wide to the stretch then caught rival.

GETAWAY PALACE set the pace under rating, widened when ready on the final turn and drew off under mild urging. ROAD TO DREAMS saved ground off
the pace, bid into the stretch and lasted for the place. FAST MULE trailed far behind then offered a late energy inside. DISTORTED VIEW dropped well
back inside, made a brief bid into the stretch then flattened out. PEACH PERFECT dropped back early and lacked a rally. OBSTINATE moved close up
outside for half a mile and gave way. COLLIN'S GREY LADY pressed the winner for three quarters and stopped.

DREAMWITHINADREAM earned narrow advantage inside then retreated after half mile. FIRE ARMY chased off the pace in the two path and stopped.
BRASI raced wide behind dueling leaders and gave way readily.

MORE THAN WORK stalked the pacesetter, took over in midstretch and pulled away under steady handling. WHISKEYMAC hustled to the front, led to
stretch then weakened in the final furlong. HOLY MOLY MOSES dropped far back, moved three wide and closed well. BETWEEN THE COVERS saved
ground within striking range then flattened out in the stretch. DANCE A DINI chased off the pace outside and faltered. CHECK MY SIX lacked speed and
was never in contention. MAJESTIC LION lagged far behind losing contact with his field. COLES CONUNDRUM lost his action near the half mile pole and
was eased.

Footnotes
MUST BE LOVE hustled clear in the opening quarter and stayed safe in a long drive under constant urging. JESTER'S SONG saved ground off the pace,
bid closer on the turn and was up for the place. JEWELS IN THE BAY prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch and weakened late. NORTH
POLE outrun early inside, angled out in the stretch and was no factor. ZAMBONI WARRIOR forced the pace outside and began fading at the quarter pole.
OUR ANDREW B lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention. PROFESSOR KOOL was urged close up between rivals through the initial quarter
then gave way.

Footnotes
MY LAST MISSION led in the two path then inside, shook loose on the final turn and widened under steady coaxing. STREET GLIDE far back early inside,
closed well in the stretch to gain the place. KEEPING IT COUNTRY settled off the pace, bid outside on the final turn then flattened out late. CUPID'S DUDE
was well placed behind dueling leaders then weakened in the stretch. J D FACTOR steadied into the first turn, chased inside and had no response.
SOPHOS steadied into the first turn then raced far behind throughout. EGOT A POKER FACE steadied to avoid traffic into the first turn and lacked a rally.
BRONX BOYS drifted in into the first turn, pressed the winner inside and gave way. MIDNIGHT CAT dropped back early inside and gave way readily. A
claim of foul by the fifth finisher against the winner for interference into the first turn was dismissed.
