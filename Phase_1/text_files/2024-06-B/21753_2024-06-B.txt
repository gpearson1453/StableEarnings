Footnotes
TAYLOR FIELD raced five wide entering the backstretch, moved up into striking position nearing the final turn, dueled outside of DONTBRINGMEDOWN
through the stretch, and wore down rival. DONTBRINGMEDOWN showed the way through the backstretch under a snug grip, saw margins decrease in the
far turn, responded to a challenge from TAYLOR FIELD, and was worn down. SILENT COUNT trailed the field, and showed interest late. BRYNN'S DREAM
stalked the pacesetter while two to three wide, and lacked a closing response. CAPE'S LEGACY sat in range while three wide and tired early.

Footnotes
COOLWIND rated well off the pace, circled at the head of the lane, was set down near the three-sixteenth pole, drifted into the three path and won driving.
BRODY'S PAL tracked the pacesetters while three to four wide, moved up alongside STREET VENDOR approaching the quarter pole, gained a slim
advantage and was outkicked. STREET VENDOR was allowed to settle early inside, shifted out to the three path leaving the backstretch, dueled inside of
BRODY'S PAL, and weakened in the stretch. ABOVE AND BEYOND settled outside in the five path, chased three wide in the final turn, and came up empty
for the drive. VICTORIA'S CHIEF was under a strong hold leaving the opening turn, contested the pace while four wide, was overtaken and tired.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC stalked four wide into the opening turn, contended the pace in the five-path, gained a slim advantage in the far turn, responded gamely to a
challenge from LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR, and held firm. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR tracked outside, moved up closer while three wide, dueled outside of
LANNY MAC approaching the stretch, battled on outside but was unable to get by late. WYE CROSS trailed the field, and rallied belatedly for show. A LATE
ONE contended the pace from the rail, was unable to move on the field, and faded. CARSON'S LEGACY saved inside, and flattened out. ALL THAT GOLD
pressed the pace and was done early.

the bob. COUNTRIFIED trailed the field, found seam along the rail when turning for home, dueled into the stretch and lost the bob. BARE BACK JACK

ROCKTILLYOUDROP chased three to four wide, and came up empty in drive. DANCING WILLIE was outsprinted leaving the opening turn, and tired with a
furlong remaining. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) contested the early pace, was overtaken at the quarter pole and gave way.

NORTHERN FORCE raced wide through the backstretch, sat in striking distance nearing the final turn, dueled outside of SHINING TIGER and prevailed
under a drive. SHINING TIGER prompted the pace from between foes, challenged the front into the final turn, gained a short advantage then was
confronted by another rival and was outfinished. DOUG'S HERO hustled outside leaving the gate, chased the pace while four wide, was unable to move on
with rivals and kept on evenly late. SAWCHUK saved ground inside and lacked a solid bid. FORCED TO RUN contested the early pace, held a slim
advantage leaving the backstretch, and gave way in the stretch. SAMURAI CHALLENGE fractious in the gate, was away slowly, and was outrun throughout.

AMEER settled inside early, was asked to quicken approaching the final turn, swung outside turning for home, rallied steadily outside and won going away.
BREAKING THE BANK unhurried early, raced wide through the backstretch, advanced quickly in the final turn, shifted outside in traffic at the top of the
stretch and closed gamely for place. PACHECO unhurried through the backstretch, trailed in the final turn, rallied inside through the stretch, and was
outkicked for place. SIX SHOTS OF T sent for speed then crossed over in the backstretch, led the way through the far turn, and had little in reserve late for
the drive. LAHUN stalked the pacesetter from the rail, and lacked the rally needed in the stretch. HE'S A SAINT sat in striking range from the four path, and
failed to threaten in the drive. ONE SKY chased four-wide leaving the backstretch, and was unable to improve position in the stretch.

BEAUTIFUL MESS unhurried early, advanced quickly in the final turn, closed huge outside through the stretch and got by just in time. DANCE SHOES sat
in striking range while five wide, gained the lead nearing the three sixteenth pole, battled on outside of MAJESTIC OOPS and was rundown. MAJESTIC
OOPS rated off the pace while four wide, contested the lead inside of DANCE SHOES, kept on grudgingly under encouragement, and missed after a solid
late effort. MACHINA trailed the field, and passed tiring foe. SKIP'S ROCK quickly went to the front, was overtaken at the five-sixteenth pole, and stopped
soon after. SINGING BELL stalked the pace, was unable to keep pace with the field and wilted.

Footnotes
ANNAMARIA stalked the pacesetters from the three path, set sights on SADIE MY LADY in the final turn, gained an advantage into the stretch, and
prevailed. ROCKY RIDGE GINGER saved ground early, gained closer order then launched an all-out bid along the rail and missed after a game effort.
QUEENS OVER JACK'S was unhurried early in the five path, and rallied belatedly to score show honours. SADIE MY LADY set the pace under a snug
hold, kicked clear into the far turn, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and weakened. CROWN OF CAIRO trailed leaving the backstretch, and closed
late. SUNBIZ hurried outside, chased four wide and was outrun. GRANDMA DEE tracked inside early, and faded steadily. DIAMOND DI prompted the pace
from the rail, and tired early.
