LOVE U dueled inside of STARSHIP SUNRISE, drifted out a bit turning for home and weakened. LITA prompted the pace three wide and weakened a bit in

STARSHIP SUNRISE dueled two wide to upper stretch and tired. MISS BEE HAPPY checked early, raced four and five wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
AIRDRIE HILL prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed along rounding the turn, swung from the four path to bid at the top of the lane, took the lead
passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. SOPHISTRY set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, yielded to the outer eventual winner
passing the eighth pole, but held place. MEAN TO ME chased in the four path, came under right handed encouragement in the three path midway around
the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane and kept on for show. MY DENYSSE got fractious in the gate and had a slow start, raced off the
pace in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the turn, but made no impact. MATTINATA stalked in the four path, was driven in the two path
around the turn, but faded in the stretch. KURUTU got a bit fractious in the gate and broke slowly, trailed in the four path, fanned out to the seven path
turning into the lane, and never threatened. MIND SHIFT GAME was hustled towards the back of the pack in the five path and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SINGING SANDRA set an easy pace in the three path turning into the backstretch, waited under confident handling rounding the far turn, was coaxed
passing the quarter, kicked away while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, and held sway. DARLING DARLEY chased in the four path, was driven
between foes from the two path into the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the stretch, and ran on while angling inwards late for place. NAA
DUDETTE rated in the two path, came under right handed urging along the rail midway around the far turn, and finished evenly in the three path down the
lane for show. HEAVENS EXPRESS raced wellback in the four path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and stayed on but
made no impact. LUCEVAN LA STELLE prompted the pace after the opening quarter in the four path, was driven from the three path into the far turn, but
faded from the two path down the lane. PUCKERED raced off the pace inside and never threatened. ULTIMATE MISSION trailed in the five path early and
never menaced.

and ran on for the place. RED HAIRED GAL trailed inside, circled six wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. SILJIM raced off the pace three and
four wide and lacked the needed rally. MISS DIZ tracked the pace four wide and faded through the lane. CAJUN GAL chased the pace inside and faltered
after a half. TAPPING GIRL pressed the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO stalked in the four path, was coaxed in the three path approaching the three-eighths pole, bid from the five path turning into the lane, and
inched past the inner pacesetter in the final furlong. CART GIRL SAM broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue while
tipping out to the three path at the top of the stretch, and dug in, but was edged out by an outer foe to place. VIDIANO broke in and bumped an inner foe,
chased in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. SOUTH
AMERICA got bumped on both sides at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up under coaxing along the rail around the turn, but flattened in the
stretch. CROSS HASTE tracked in the five path but did not threaten. NIC'S BRO got herded out and bumped an outer foe at the start, then always trailed.

CHAMPIONS DREAM set the pace in the two path and held firm under a steady drive. JUST A PHOTO saved ground off the pace, angled four wide turning
for home and rallied outside. BURNIN TURF tracked the pace four wide, bid four deep around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. NOVO SOL (BRZ)
raced well back in the two path, went four wide around the far turn and had a mild rally. HANDY DANDY pressed the winner in the three path and weakened
in the drive. MERLIN had early speed inside, checked midway around the first turn, continued to race in range inside around the far turn and faded in the
stretch. TIZ THE BOMB failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MARWAD (GB) was outrun while racing three wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED
BY THE RIDER OF JUST A PHOTO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

SONICUS chased in the two path, was coaxed along around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and rallied past inner rivals in the final
furlong. FULMINATE stalked in the six path, was roused while four wide passing the three-eighths mark, swung from the six path into the stretch, and ran on
for place. BAHAMIAN MOON vied for the lead in the four path, had her nose in front while between foes in the three path passing the quarter, and kept on in
the four path down the lane to hold show. FORTUNA BELLE dueled for the lead in the three path, received a right handed cue inside of foes from the two
path midway around the turn, dug in from the three path entering the stretch, but was edged out in the final furlong. ADMIRAL HOPPER pressed in the five
path, was coaxed between foes in the four path passing the three-eighths mark, but finished evenly from the five path in the stretch. ONE OF ONE trailed

four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, swung out to the six path entering the stretch, hung on her left lead, and ran on for place. POIEMA
set the pace in the three path, waited confidently in the two path rounding the turn, was roused turning into the lane, but was caught by an outer pair late to
show. DRUM ROLL stalked in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, and finished evenly in the four path down the lane. TATOR
MADE bumped between foes at the start, laid up close in the two path, received a right handed cue along the inside midway around the turn, but faded in
the stretch. ADMISSIBLE bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path and never threatened. STARSHIP NALA raced off the pace in the
