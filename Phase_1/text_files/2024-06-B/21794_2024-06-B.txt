Footnotes
KHOZEIRESS stalked the dueling leaders in the early stages, dropped back a bit on the backside, made a three wide bid on the turn, rallied outside of
EYEING CLOVER into the stretch, could not stay with that rival in upper stretch, then came again outside in deep stretch for the win. EYEING CLOVER
dueled two wide for the lead, battled heads apart on the backside, took over on the far turn, responded when roused entering the stretch, shook clear from
KHOZEIRESS, dug in gamely and yielded grudgingly late. ANTIGRAVITY raced two wide off the pace, then moved up inside, chased two wide on the far
turn and rallied inside for third. AMATTEROFTIME raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, rallied into third and then was outfinished for
that spot. TEN GAUGE dueled inside for the lead, chased inside on the turn and faded. MARKET MAVEN raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

FEET while moving up on even terms with that rival and then shared the win. COLD FEET set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, kicked clear in
upper stretch, dug in gamely, bumped with OUTLAW COUNTRY in the final strides and shared the win. POINT LIAM raced off the pace between rivals, was
shuffled back on the turn, came five wide into the lane and closed well late outside. JUDGE DAVIS raced off the pace , moved up behind horses entering
the stretch, then clipped heels and stumbled at the three sixteenths pole, quickly recovered and closed late in the two path. MAYA PRINCE raced three wide
off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch and was outkicked. FITTS vied between rivals for the early lead, then chased,
raced on the rail in the stretch run and weakened late. IKIGAI chased outside, raced three wide on the turn and tired. FLYING LIAM pressed the pace,
chased on the turn and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run and a Jockey Objection by the rider of OUTLAW COUNTRY against COLD
