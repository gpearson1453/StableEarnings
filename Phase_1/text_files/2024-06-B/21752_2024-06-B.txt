Footnotes
HALF BROTHER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, began a bid passing the
quarter pole, dueled between horses in upper stretch and kicked clear. BAXLEY dueled on the inside early, continued to battle from the three path around
the bend and in upper stretch and chased the winner home late. FROSTY VIEW hopped up leaving the gate, stalked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with the winner late and kept on from there. IRISH DAWN pressed
the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend, continued to battle in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
KONTEEKEE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. QUALITY RAGS chased the leader
through the early going, dropped back while racing in the five path around the turn and faded further in the stretch. BUCKIN AGAIN dueled on the outside up
the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and tired in the lane.
