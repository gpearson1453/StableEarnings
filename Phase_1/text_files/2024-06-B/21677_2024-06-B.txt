Footnotes
MASTERY KAT stalked the early pace from the outside, was guided along the four path into the first turn, prompted LADY GOOD TROUBLE through the
backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid into the far turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, battled with LADY GOOD TROUBLE into upper
stretch, turned that rival away and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and maintained a clear lead to the finish.
SMILE AND PROFILE allowed to settle away from the start, raced three wide into the first turn and was never far back into the backstretch run, well placed
at the half-mile pole, was roused three then four wide nearing the quarter marker, went widest into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, could not
make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished LADY GOOD TROUBLE to secure place honors. LADY GOOD TROUBLE bobbled a
bit at the start but was away in good order and was sent to establish the early lead, set the pace from the three path into the first turn, carved out modest
fractions while well off of the rail through the backstretch run, came under pressure into the far turn, met the bid of MASTERY KAT into upper stretch, was
outkicked by the winner at the furlong marker, ran on into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second. CANDY ON TOP tracked the early pace from
the inside, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, maintained a two wide path into the far
turn, was outrun to the quarter pole and tired in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NO SECRET sent to establish the early lead, showed the way into the first turn while off of the rail, was well handled while carving modest fractions through
the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead into the far turn and was kept to task into upper stretch, came under pressure at the furlong marker, dug in while
holding a slim lead past mid-stretch, was unyielding into the final sixteenth and determinedly held on for the win at the wire. SUPERMAZEL tracked the early
pace, was guided two wide and between runners into the first turn, never far back through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and chased
NO SECRET approaching the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, battled while within aim of the lead
past mid-stretch, fought gamely into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win at the wire, while besting the rest. HONOS MAN unhurried away from the
start, tracked the early pace from the outside and went three to four wide along the first turn, raced widest into the backstretch run and was well placed at
the half-mile, chased four wide into the far turn, was roused four to five wide into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, battled into the final
sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for third. UNION WAVE was prominent away from the start, tracked the early pace
from a three wide path along the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace nearing the half-mile marker, raced three
wide into the far turn and chased NO SECRET nearing the quarter pole, mounted a three to four wide bid between rivals into the stretch, could not keep
pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. EL JOY stalked the early pace from the inside, shifted out into the backstretch run and stalked the modest pace
between rivals approaching the half-mile marker, chased two wide and between foes into the second turn, bid between rivals into upper stretch, got caught
in tight at the furlong marker and was blocked past mid-stretch, was outrun into the final sixteenth and could not muster a late response. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, crossed over to the middle of the course and set the pace to the half-mile
marker, dictated terms into the turn and led while just off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, extended the lead into the stretch, was kept to task into the final
sixteenth and held safely in a drive at the finish. MATCHLESS tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and lost position
at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch and re-bid at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not catch
the winner in deep stretch and got up for second in the final strides. LILA AT THE BEACH away from the gate a step slowly, stalked the moderate early
pace outside of STATEFOREST, well placed into the turn, chased the pacesetter two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the
stretch, could not reel in the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for place honors, while holding safely for the show. A DIME FOR ME raced in
the middle of the pack down the backstretch, launched a bid in tandem with SMOOVE AS SILK from the three furlong pole, found a seam turning for home
and was kept to task but could not find the needed response. SMOOVE AS SILK was last away then found a good stride after about a furlong and moved
forward on the outside to get into contention, continued to rally wide through the turn and loomed a threat at the quarter pole ran on a bit into the stretch
then flattened out. SHOUT IT OUT broke well but struggled to keep up after a furlong, saved ground to no avail and chased the field to the wire. This race
was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

REEF CITY showed good speed leaving the start, engaged with ELMER JOHN in the early running and contested a decent pace with that rival heading to
the half-mile, dueled inside of ELMER JOHN into the turn and held a narrow lead at the quarter pole, battled into upper stretch and fought with ELMER
JOHN to the furlong pole, responded to firm urging past mid-stretch, shook free of the runner-up in the final sixteenth and drew clear in deep stretch.
ELMER JOHN broke alertly away from the start, engaged with REEF CITY in the early stages and disputed a decent pace with that rival heading to the
half-mile marker, pressed outside of REEF CITY into the turn, battled into upper stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, was repelled by REEF
CITY in the final sixteenth and stayed on in deep stretch to be second best. SIX HOT GRANDS tracked the decent early pace from the inside, chased two to
three wide into the turn, shifted three to four wide into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not make headway on the leading pair
into the final sixteenth and was clear for third at the finish. TAVERNELLE was forwardly placed away from the start, chased the decent pace from the
outside heading to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not find a response in the stretch drive and
weakened in the final furlong. TEMPTING PROSPECT settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, was guided outside of rivals approaching the
turn and chased four wide nearing the quarter marker, shifted widest into the stretch and could not muster a response in the stretch drive. LIBERTY WOLF
lacked early speed and was outrun. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
UPSTART YANKEE tracked well behind the early pace for the first half-mile, advanced three wide on the leaders through the far turn while confidently
ridden, was set down at the top of the lane, engaged in a spirited duel with RICH GOLD to the outside, was relentless on the lead and prevailed in a game
effort. RICH GOLD was content to rate in last through the early going just behind UPSTART YANKEE, launched a bid four wide through the far turn, hooked
UPSTART YANKEE in a duel down the stretch, battled hard but could not get by that stubborn rival in a solid effort. AZURE STAR (IRE) broke inward and
made light contact with UPSTART YANKEE, took the early lead then was quickly joined by THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) on the inside, went head-to-head
through the first turn the pulled ahead of the field down the backstretch with the rider attempting to temper the pace, was put into a drive passing the three
furlong marker, began to weaken approaching the quarter pole, had no response when UPSTART YANKEE and RICH GOLD bid at the top of the stretch,
kept to task down the lane was was able to hold third. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) broke well and vied for the early lead through the first turn with AZURE
STAR (IRE), ceded the lead to that one as they turned down the backstretch, tracked to the far turn, came under heavy pressure with about three furlongs to
run, but did not have the needed response and was outkicked and unable to improve down the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
IRISH PRANCER got caught a bit in tight leaving the start and was shuffled back in the early stages, recovered and chased the decent pace from between
rivals heading to the half-mile marker, stalked from an inside position entering the turn, was well placed at the quarter pole and mounted an inside bid into
upper stretch, took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, shook free and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up in
deep stretch and lasted for the win at the wire. SAHARA SUE bobbled leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early running,
guided two to three wide into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, angled four to five wide into the stretch, advanced at the furlong marker, closed
well into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. BOBBY'S GENIE took back off of the
decent early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and improved position along the bend, got caught a bit in tight and was boxed in at the quarter pole,
found an opening into upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the leading pair into the final sixteenth and was clear at
the finish for third. MORO FIRST CLASS raced close up to the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and lost position at the quarter marker,
maintained an inside path into upper stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and improved position into
deep stretch. BOB'S VAI showed good speed away from the start and assumed early command, set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated
terms into the turn while two wide and carved out the fractions approaching the quarter pole, lost the lead to IRISH PRANCER into upper stretch and battled
that rival to the furlong marker, could not match strides with oncoming rivals past mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. BRONZE GIRL was
prominent away from the start, stalked the decent early pace from between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the turn and
attended to the pace nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into upper stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages.
MADAME GAZELLE prominent away from the start, chased the decent early pace from the outside heading to the half-mile pole, ran in pursuit four wide
into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DOO WOP DON was unhurried from the break but prompted to stay in contact with the field, raced at the back through the first turn, bided time between
horses to the far turn, responded on cue when asked to go on with three furlongs to run, came up the rail into the stretch then finished well under strong
handling to win clear. DANZING REBEL broke alertly but was not asked for speed from the break, settled inside, took advantage of the large gap near the
rail to advance down the backstretch and took the lead passing the seven-sixteenths pole, opened up through the far turn but left room on the inside for
DOO WOP DON to get through, could not match strides with that rival in the stretch but finished willingly to hold second far ahead of the next horse. ENOS
SLAUGHTER was allowed to settle from the break, tracked in the clear under a bit of a hold for the first half-mile, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths
pole, swung out to the five path for the stretch run and ran on well but was no match for the top two. MEEKING stumbled at the start, the rider lost the right
iron but was able to quickly recover, jumped out to the early lead racing well away from the rail under a very tight hold, held to the far turn, was surrounded
by challengers at the seven-sixteenths pole then checked hard when taking an odd step near the three-sixteenths pole, made some contact with NIGHT
PROOF, lost interest and could not recover. NIGHT PROOF broke well and got good position going into the first turn, was content to let MEEKING run off
on the lead, tracked that one down the backstretch, started to lose ground on the far turn then made some contact with MEEKING near the three furlong
pole, could not muster any kind of a rally and was galloped out to the finish. TAMARANDO STAR broke a bit slowly and outward, then raced four wide
through the clubhouse turn, continued to track wide and was in last but not far from the front as the field bunched up at the half-mile pole, struggled to keep
up through the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch but had nothing to offer and was not persevered with down the stretch. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GUIDE MY STEPS allowed to settle away from the start, maintained an outside path approaching the turn and raced four wide to the quarter pole, was full
of run into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, took command past mid-stretch, drove clear in the final sixteenth, was geared down in deep stretch
and was pulled up soon after the finish. SWEET MILLIE broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed good early speed and drew to a
clear lead heading to the half-mile marker, set solid fractions into the turn and drew off nearing the quarter marker, maintained a clear lead into upper
stretch, was confronted by GUIDE MY STEPS approaching the furlong pole, was overhauled by the winner past mid-stretch and stayed on in the final
sixteenth to be second best. LOCHMARA settled off of the solid early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and ran in pursuit to the quarter marker,
angled out in upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and outfinished HARBOR DEAREST to secure show
honors. HARBOR DEAREST forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the solid early pace from between rivals, was guided three wide into the turn and
lost ground nearing the quarter marker, split rivals into upper stretch and re-rallied at the furlong pole, finished evenly in the final sixteenth and was
outkicked in deep stretch. RIVER OF AMBITION chased the solid early pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three wide into the turn and lost ground to
SWEET MILLIE nearing the quarter pole, chased into the stretch, was outrun into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. DESERT RUMBLE
allowed to settle in the early running, was guided two to three wide into the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered a mild late rally but could
not threaten the leaders in the final sixteenth. STANDFORGRIT away from the gate a step slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn and did
not factor in the stretch drive. NICE ENCOUNTER chased the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, could not
keep pace into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. GENTLE JULIA was forwardly placed away from the start, rated off of the solid early pace and
saved ground into the turn, was outrun to the quarter marker and did not offer a response in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
