COMPUTER WHIZ was off a step slow, settled on the inside, advanced on the turn and eased out and made a four wide bid off the bend, then dueled for
command and slowly edged clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. TOTAL SMOKESHOW stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid
to gain a short lead off the bend, then dueled with the winner but was out-kicked late. ARTISTIC LANEY tracked the early pace on the inside, moved out
midway on the turn and came five wide into the lane and had a mild late kick but needed more, bested rest. OPIE'S GIRL was away alertly to set the pace
on the inside while clear, then came up empty in the drive. LACY QUEEN was off a step slow and reserved early and never factored.

headed nearing the furlong marker and could not go with the winner while saving the place award. ROSE RING was settled back early, came four wide off
the bend and finished with interest to gain the show award. ABOUNDING chased the early pace and made a mild four wide bid by the quarter pole but
flattened out in the final furlong. NAUGHTY NELLIE was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn and weakened in the lane. MOON PARTY

Footnotes
D' PISTOL set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to kick clear leaving the turn and then held safe late to prove best under a drive. ENGLISH
BOBBY was five wide into the first turn, then had a outside pursuit, angled in entering the far turn to be two wide on the far turn, swung out five wide leaving
the turn and closed well, second best. KOHAKU pressed the winner two to three wide and faded in the drive, held show award. MO ANGELL was bumped
at the start, then settled while two to three wide, two wide on the far turn, then moved to the inside by the furlong marker but had no late kick while getting
the nod for the last spot in the superfecta. UNUSUAL ACTIVITY was settled back early, two to three wide on the far turn, then split rivals by the sixteenth
marker and had a belated rally. JACK THE BIRD was reserved on the inside, saved ground on the turn and moved out leaving the turn and had a mild late
rally. UTOPIAN TREASURE chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and weakened. LIBERTY HALL chased the pace on the inside
and weakened in the drive. VINO LUX was reserved three wide and lacked a solid rally. KING BUKELE was bumped at the break, chased the pace four
wide and tired. MASCOT was void of early speed and never factored. ERASMUS lunged at the start and failed to menace.

MAMBA OUT stalked the dueling leaders three wide, made a bid three wide on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch
to prove much the best while being ridden out. TABOO HOO was bumped at the start, settled early, four wide on the turn, came six wide off the bend and
won the battle for the place award in the final furlong while no match for the winner. GO GO STAR was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead on the
outside, two wide on the turn and then was in between rivals by the quarter pole, then proved to be no match for the winner while fighting on to the wire but
lost the place award late. SHOT GIRL was allowed to settle early on the inside, three wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and weakened. MS.
THE LAW broke outwardly at the start bumping a foe hard, then went up to duel for the lead on the inside, then came up empty in the drive. WACKER'S
GIRL was reserved early and failed to menace. CARLY'S FLIGHT showed little.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX set the pace on the inside and was well handled, shook away leaving the turn and then held safe late to prove best under a drive. FIRESIDE
KITTEN was settled early on the inside, then advanced on the turn two wide, came three wide off the bend, angled in by the sixteenth marker and was
gaining late to gain the place. BLOSSOMING prompted the winner three wide, came four wide off the bend, then ran on well but drifted out late and lost the
place award. LUNAR ICE stumbled at the break, settled back early and was in between rivals nearing the half mile marker, then advanced two wide on the
trun, split rivals leaving teh furlong marker and finished well. ZIGGZAPPA was settled early two wide, three wide on the far turn and came four wide off the
bend and had a mild late kick. KING'S LEGACY was reserved early, four wide on the far turn and came five wide off the bend and had a belated rally.
ADDISON was off a step slow, settled back early on the outsider, three wide on the far turn but had no late rally. DICHOTOMY was well placed early on the
inside and tired. BODE'S ROSE was settled back early on the inside and had no response.
