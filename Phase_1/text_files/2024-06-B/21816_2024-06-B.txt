checked sharply near the three eighths pole and tired. CHATAIN'S FLYER was bumped soundly at the start, raced five wide to six wide around the far turn
and never threatened. MY LITTLE MIA bumped at the start, vied for the early lead, was injured and was transported off of the track via the equine

Footnotes
BAD BRAD stalked the pace, loomed four wide into the upper stretch and edged up late under strong encouragement. NATIVE REQUITE set a pressured
early pace from the inside of rivals, dug in late and missed in a game effort. A TRUE TARGET dropped back early on, advanced four wide through the far
turn, raced from the outside in the stretch and moved up to improve position. FRENETIC DAY pressed the early pace from the outside of foe and weakened
through the drive. MY STORY raced off the early pace, was six deep near the quarter pole, raced from the far outside in the drive and had no late rally.
STONECOAT was off slowly, lag early on and never menaced. POPPY T stalked the pace along the inside and faded.

the pack early on, advanced into the far turn from the outside of foes, raced six deep into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. ANN'S
STORM settled off the early going, made a two to three wide bid through the drive and had a mild closing run. SKYKAT void of early speed, raced near the
inside past the quarter pole, angled out to race from the far outside and never was a serious threat. HURRICANE TIZWAY rated along to race in hand near
the rail, ridden through the far turn and weakened a bit in the drive. SEE SASSY RUN stalked the pace three deep, raced four to five wide into the upper
stretch and weakened. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER was allowed to settle early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no response. T R'S FIRST raced

and surged clear under strong pressure. FLASH N CLASS raced near the back early on, was two deep near the quarter pole, shifted out five wide through

late. LIVE AFFAIR was bumped, shuffled back at the start, advanced through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and weakened the final
eighth of a mile. RISING KOTO STAR was bumped at the start, pressed early on and faded. DEE'S LEGS was bumped at the start, raced three wide
around the far turn and never threatened. GUTZY showed good early foot to show the pace and gave way in the drive.
