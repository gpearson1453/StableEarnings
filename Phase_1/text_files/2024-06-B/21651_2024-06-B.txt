Footnotes
MO LUTE was away in good order and vied three deep, shook clear late on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and
finished going away. LA LENGUA took a solid bump at the start when DONTDRINKAMDDRIVE drifted in at the start, dropped back, saved ground and
steadily picked up the pace, cut the corner entering the lane, stayed on the inside and cleared second best. DONTDRINKANDDRIVE drifted in and bumped
into LA LENGUA at the start, chased after the top trio around the turn, hustled along three wide down the lane and cleared a share. GOLDEN BONITA vied
inside of a duo in early stages, could not move on with eventual winner late on the turn, ran on to mid-stretch then gave way. RED ROMANCE lacked early
speed and raced in the back, chased two wide around the turn, shifted four wide at the head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. PROMISED OATH vied
between rivals for the early lead, was no match late on the turn and tired in the drive. STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START, AFTER

Footnotes
WAR MUSIC was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground near the inside around the first turn, was nicely rated sitting just off the embattled duo
up the backstretch, let out a notch and advanced to engage duo three deep mid-way around the far turn, took a slim lead at the head of the lane, came
under right handed pressure, widened advantage and held sway. DO YOU BILEVE hooked up with SIMONAS CHOICE soon after the start, vied for the lead
around the first turn and continued duel two wide up the backstretch, took on the added challenge of WAR MUSIC mid-way around the far turn, could not
match strides turning for home, but fought back to mid-stretch, then failed to be a match late. SIMONA'S CHOICE vied inside of DO YOU BILEVE from the
onset, continued to battle for command leaving the backstretch, could not match strides with the eventual winner late on the far turn, ran on along the inside
and secured show. SASSY AIN'T I was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around the far turn, angled three wide into upper stretch, edged
closer then ran on evenly.

Footnotes
TIN BADGE was forwardly placed in opening stages, vied outside of SAY IN NICELY around the turn, continued to battle into stretch run, dug in gamely two
wide, edged ahead at the sixteenth pole and edged away. SAY IT NICELY held a slim lead in the early going, vied inside of TIN BADGE around the turn,
fought back gamely along the rail into the lane then got overtaken near the sixteenth pole. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced off the early pace, swung four paths
wide into upper stretch and finished with good response. UNCLE SINGH was ridden up the inside into early contention, got in tight and was forced to steady
entering the turn, lost momentum, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and ran on evenly. AMERICAN POSSE was ridden along off the early pace,
urged three wide around the turn, ran on into the lane but lacked a needed rally. LUCKY LOUIE chased two to three wide and failed to threaten. TOPPER T
raced in range in early stages then weakened midway around the turn. FRANKLY EPIC pressed the early pace then came up empty around the turn.

BETH'SWICKEDSMACK was forwardly placed in the early going, hustled up two wide around the turn, moved up to poke a head in front at the furlong
marker then held clear under a driving finish. MY FOUR POINT OH rated near mid-pack, headed in pursuit late on the turn, sustained a steady three to four
wide bid through the lane and finished second best. HOODWICKED vied briefly for the early lead, was ridden near the inside around the turn, ran on two
wide through the lane and cleared the rest. PISTOLPACKINGAL raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch
and lacked a needed rally. SUPINE DUCHESS briefly vied for the early lead, shook free leaving the backstretch, widened to a clear advantage, led the way
into upper stretch, got collared a furlong out and gave way. ZOE NATION was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back, came four wide into the lane
and never threatened. SHADOW BANNED broke in at the start then briefly vied for the early lead, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the
drive. OPAL BAY raced two to three wide off the early pace and steadily faltered.

GOLD STRATEGY rated in range two wide up the backstretch, picked up the pace approaching the quarter pole, given cue three wide at the head of the
lane, steadily edged up closer, gained a slim lead from KAYLA nearing the wire and just lasted over fast gaining runner up. LAVENDER LIL was unhurried
and raced in the back through early stages, continued in the rear leaving the backstretch then picked up the pace late on the far turn, swung into action four
wide entering upper stretch, rallied gamely along the outside and got denied by a nose. KAYLA raced in close contention around the first turn and remained
forwardly placed up the backstretch, moved up to engage embattled duo past the half mile marker, led the way past the quarter pole, came two wide into the
lane, raced under pressure from both sides, held a slim lead, dug in gamely, led late then got outfinished nearing the wire. BAYLEYWICK vied for the lead
around the first turn and up the backstretch, remained up close just off KAYLA around the far turn, cut the corner and fought back gamely along the rail then
weakened approaching the final sixteenth. CURLIN'S LIL GAL vied outside of rival around the first turn and through the backstretch, could not match strides
around the far turn and steadily retreated. GP'S AMAZING GRACE raced in range through early stages then came up empty upon entering the final turn
and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
WHEELER DEALER was forwardly placed up the backstretch, vied three deep around the turn, held a slim lead a furlong out, dug in gamely, edged ahead
and held firm. COMMANDER REX sped to the lead at the start, came under pressure near the half mile marker, vied for the lead around the turn, cut the
corner and fought back gamely a furlong out, failed to move on with the winner but ran on and held place. OCEAN RIDE sat back off the early pace, saved
ground and hustled up late on the turn, was set down two to three wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and dug in gamely to capture show.
COWBOY DON raced off the early pace, was ridden two wide around the turn, hustled along three paths wide near mid-stretch, edged closer and just
missed show. CHAMPION BY DESIGN tracked the early leader then moved up to engage rival for the lead at the half mile marker, vied between foes
around the turn then tired in the drive. GRAPHENE CASSOCK tracked the top trio along the inside, chased three to four wide around the turn then gave
way. BLACK STORM trailed in the back, came widest into the lane and had no response.
