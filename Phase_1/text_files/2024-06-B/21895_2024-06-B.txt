Footnotes
MO SATURDAYS was forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn, pressed the pace setter down the backstretch, then angled out to duel from the
two path on the far turn, assumed command in the upper stretch, lug in then kept on to the wire. KOLOMIO set the pace while two wide in the early furlongs,
then dueled with an outer foe on the far turn, continued to bid in close behind said rival in the early stretch, steadied then angled out and kept on while in a
mild drive. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT was bumped at the start, was unhurried early, then came out three wide leaving the far bend to rally in the late stretch
and was up for the show winnings. COUSIN LARRY broke outwardly and bumpd foe, was unhurried early, then rallid bid on the far turn while three wide and
continued down the lane while in a mild drive and was out finished for the show place. AZTEC FIRE tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
then rallied bid on the far turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GO CATS broke outwardly and bumped rival, was allowed to settle
along the rail in the early furlongs and did not rally in the second half. CALL OF HONOR pursued the pace while two wide down the lane, was in a hard drive
on the far turn, was used up drifted in towards the rail in the upper stretch and continued to flatten out. There was an INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION
following the race. The rider of KOLOMIO claimed foul against the rider of MO SATURDAYS for interference in the late stretch. After review, MO
SATURDAYS was disqualified and placed second.

leader. SPRINGTIME MOON pursued the pace from the inside while maintaining second position, was in a hard drive on the far turn then lacked rallying in
the stretch and was out bid for the place position. FIND THE LIGHT broke inwardly and bumped foe and never threatened. NOBLE AWARE was no threat.
SHEZAFASHION QUEEN was bumped and no menace. MOPAC TRAFFIC broke inwardly and bumped foe and failed to rally. OH SO SASSY was bumped
then trailed throughout and was no factor.

OVA CHARGED pursued the pace from inside, came under coaxing at the top of the bend while closing in on the leader while two wide, went into over drive
to take charge at the top of the stretch then drew clear to claim victory. UPTOWNBLINGITHOME was impeded at the start, then saved ground early, shifted
out three wide in the early stretch and closed well for the place position. TIZ MAGIC was bumped at the start, was allowed to settle while two wide, rallied
bid in the upper stretch to best the rest of the field and was up for the show winnings. HALAGA was unhurried early, continued to race at the back the field
on the turn, then rallied in the late stretch but it was too little too late. FIRE VISION was away well to set the pace from the inside while in a steady hand
ride, then was in an all out drive leaving the bend, was overtaken in the late stretch by an outer foe and gave way. CHARLIE T chased the pace three deep
into the turn, then rallied bid leaving the bend while four wide but did not have enough in the stretch. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL pursued the pace while four
wide, was in hard drive on the turn while five wide, steadied slightly in the upper stretch and gave way. ROYAL FLOWER broke inwardly and hindered
rivals, then chased the pace while two wide and in a steady hand ride into the turn, rallied bid in the upper stretch, and lacked the needed response.
REPASADO chased the pace while five wide and between rivals, came out six wide leaving the bend while in a mild bid, angled inwardly in the upper
stretch and did not fire. OUR PASTOR pressed the pace from the two path into the turn while in a steady drive then lacked the overtaking rally leaving the

Footnotes
MY BOY VANDER vied for the lead from the inside before inching away to press the TWENTY INCO on the turn, then went shoulder to shoulder with said
rival in the upper stretch before shaking clear in the final yards while in an all drive to prevail. TWENTY CINCO angled inwardly to establish the lead while
two wide, was confronted by a pressing MY BOY VANDER leaving the turn, spar gamely in the upper stretch before being outkicked in the final yards and
was second best. TIZAWIZ vied for the lead early while three wide, then stalked the leader on the turn in a steady drive while maintaining third position,
rallied mildly in the early stretch, needed more and held the show winnings. CLARISIT raced while four wide in pursuit of the pace, was bumped by an inner
foe, bid mildly from the two path on the turn and into the stretch and came up empty. GOODNESS vied between rivals while two wide, then settled back
along the rail on the turn, rallied bid in the stretch and came up evenly. AFTERNOON DIVA drifted outward and bumped foe, was unhurried early, bid while
four wide leaving the bend and never threatened. DIDNTSEETHATCOMING was bumped at the start, was unhurried early and no menace. FAST

Footnotes
LIBBAN was forwardly placed into the first turn to press NORAH G down the backstretch while two wide, then inched up on the far turn under steady
coaxing, tipped by said rival in the upper stretch and drew off in the late stretch to prove best. GLENALL (IRE) tracked the pace while three wide in the early
furlongs, was in a steady drive on the far turn, then rallied in the late stretch, lacked the winning bid and bested the rest of the field. COLORS OF THE WIND
saved ground in the early stages, then menaced in the upper stretch and closed well down the lane while passing outer rivals and was up for the show
winnings. WILD EXPRESS tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied bid on the far turn and lacked the needed response in the
stretch. NORAH G showed the way from the inside to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn while being pressed by an outer
foe, could not retain and faltered in the late stretch. BLOOD ORANGE trailed and was no factor. HOOSIER PHILLY never threatened. LADY JAE tracked
the pace from the inside throughout the early furlongs, then urged eagerly on the far turn before flattening out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MORTIFY pursued the pace from the inside down the backstretch, remained well rated throughout the turn, was encouraged leaving the bend to vie briefly
in the upper stretch with outer foes, then shook clear to prevail while in a determined drive. DARK RUM was bumped at the start, then vied between rivals
while in a steady hand drive, stalked the leading duo throughout the turn, dug in gamely in the upper stretch to battle between rivals while brushing, was out
finished by MORTIFY and was best for place. DELTA FRONT chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, was urging eagerly on the turn,
came out five wide to vie in the early stretch, was outkicked by MORTIFY and held the show place. HARDBALL was unhurried early, then drifted out five
wide in the late stretch and passed tiring foes in the final yards. CALI KINETIC was impeded at the start, then vied with inner foes down the first half of the
backstretch, continued to duel with the remaining foe heading into the turn, was confronted by eager foes from both sides in the early stretch, battled once
again while brushing then gave way. I'M NO JOKE battled from the inside early before going head to head with an CALI KINETIC leaving the backstretch
and into the turn, was contested by hungry rivals in the early stretch then was out finished in the final yards. CARRY THE FLAG broke inwardly and bumped
foe then failed to rally.

WHAT SAY THEE broke outwardly and bumped rival, then saved ground in the early stages while racing from the inside in the second flight of rivals, came
under coaxing on the far turn while coming out five, dug in gamely in the upper stretch and went head to head with OLE CRAZY BONE in the final sixteenth
and was up at the wire to prevail. OLE CRAZY BONE was allowed to settle along the inside in the second flight of rivals down the backstretch, remained
well rated on the far turn, was set down in the upper stretch while splitting rivals, met with WHAT SAY THEE to duel in the final yards and hung at the wire.
KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN) moved from the three path early to set the pace from the inside heading into the backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the
far turn while being contested by outer foes, vied briefly in the early stretch before giving way. ELDON'S PRINCE was bumped at the start, was unhurried
early, fanned out seven wide leaving the far bend and never threatened. OCELOT was allowed to settle while two wide in the second flight of rivals down
the backstretch, then moved up on the far turn to rally a gamely bid while three wide, continued to battle grudgingly in the early stretch before giving way.
SPOILER raced towards the rear in the first flight of rivals down the backstretch, then menaced on the far turn in the three path to battle for the lead, was in
a hard drive in the upper stretch then flattened out. U. S. ARMY was forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn to track the pace down the
backstretch, as thru after the three eighths and flattened out in the remaining furlongs. PRESIDENTIAL was brushed at the start, then tracked the pace
while two wide down the backstretch, the bid mildly on the far turn before fading in the final quarter.

Footnotes
DOSE'S DREAM laid off the pace while five wide, was gaining steadily on the turn while three wide to duel with STORM CATCHER down the lane,
assumed command in the final yards and held on well to the wire. STORM CATCHER emerged to duel from the inside into the turn, disposed of
LANGUAGE barrier entering the stretch, was confronted by DOSE'S DREAM to spar once again in the late stretch and was out finished. COLONEL
BARTON chased the pace three wide, was urging steadily on the turn, rallied in the late stretch, did not have enough to catch the leader and kept on for
show winnings. TILLIS broke outwardly and bumped foes, then chased the pace while four wide and in a steady hand ride, rallied a mild bid in the late
stretch and came up empty. WEIRD YEAR stalked the pace from the inside, continued to chase while menacing on the turn then lacked the needed
response in the late stretch. UNION DATA bobbled at the start then was bumped, was unhurried early then rallied leaving the bend while four wide and
came up empty. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. was unhurried early and no threat. SR. BI BI was brushed at the start, was flat throughout and never threatened.
CHARLIECANDO was bumped at the start and failed to rally. LANGUAGE BARRIER emerged the duel with an outer foe into the turn, was in a hard drive
throughout, was used up and tired in the lane. CARBON STRYKER broke inwardly and bumped foe and never threatened. MAGIC BOW was no menace.
