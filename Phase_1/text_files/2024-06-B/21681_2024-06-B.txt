BEARING DOWN took command from the start on the rail, opened up on the field with three eighths remaining, was headed outside turning for home,
brushed the rail drifting in when asked right handed at the eighth pole, had more to give late and held on for the win, well rated up front. FIGHTING IRISH
was carried out by a rival on the first turn, settled patiently into stride on the fence seeing the field along the backside, was forced to wait behind foes with
five sixteenths to run, shifted out by the quarter pole three wide and was full of run in the five path to just miss surging at the finish line for the win. INDIANA
ROAD was in the mix three wide between foes in the first turn, became a little eager rating behind the pacesetter, improved position taking closer order
down the backstretch, shifted outside to bid two wide at the top of the lane, was repelled by the winner at the furlong marker, chased determinedly to the
wire but finished up capturing third money at the finish between runners. SIGIRIYA settled on the outside in in mid-pack in the early going, improved on the
fence with five sixteenths to go, shifted out three wide for the stretch drive, was gaining mildly down the lane to be involved at the wire for the top placings
but had to settle for a minor share in the end. NIGHT STRIKER tracked four wide into the first turn, travelled outside in the second flight down the back
straight, made a brief rally three wide midway on the far turn but stalled with a furlong to go. TRUE SHOT bore out on the first turn, was ahead of one foe
while four deep in the backstretch at the half, could not rally through the final bend and made little impression driving to the wire. INDY COWBOY hopped
slightly on the break, settled inside mid-division in the first turn, continued that position down the backside, could not match strides with others three furlongs
out and had little to offer in the stretch drive. TIPSY FOX prompted the pace outside in the early stages, could not keep pace by the three eighths marker
and retreated on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GEM QUALITY had an ideal trip sitting all alone behind the pace duel, pounced three wide outside straightening out for home, wore down the leader by the
furlong marker and was pulling away crossing the finish line. HUNGRY WOLF stalked outside in the third flight, crept closer to the lead trio with a quarter to
run, tenaciously kept on coming and was up late to best the rest at the wire. DISSECTOLOGIST had a slim lead outside down the backstretch, set the pace
while pressed inside on the turn, put away the early speed foe turning for home, braced for the challenge outside from the winner, dueled until the sixteenth
pole and faded, to be caught late for the place share. WALTER ME LAD hopped slightly on the break, trailing after the start, was on hold travelling on the
fence in the turn, shifted out three wide at the quarter pole to commence a rally, continued with momentum in the six path outside and had good late energy
trying to close in for third money down to the wire. CELENTANO stalked on the rail, shifted out at the half, came under a ride by the quarter pole, angled
between foes in the five path at the top of the lane and was outdueled down the stretch for a minor share. FAST AND READY was antsy prior to the start,
stalked on the rail in the third flight, saved ground but could not make any headway through the turn and failed to menace in the stretch running. CANADIAN
AVRO pressed the issue inside in the early parts of the race, gave way chasing the leaders by the eighth pole and folded in the final sixteenth losing more
placings at the wire. CHASING BOURBON settled near the rear three deep outside foes, made no progression three wide on the oval and could not make a
presence in the drive to the finish line.

STONKS travelled on the rail in mid pack, kept position when the field was bunching up at the half mile marker, began to pick up horses when nudged for
more three eighths from the wire, loomed boldly five wide turning for home and overpowered the leader in the final sixteenth to win going away. FRAC
AMOUR tracked outside, closed in to prompt the pace between foes into the turn, bid for the lead with rivals on both sides three furlongs out, maintained a
slim advantage at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. SOUPER ICONIC was alone watching the engaged duo in the
first turn, sat behind the leaders down the back straight, waited for room to make a move settling behind the contesting trio on the final turn and finished up
well between horses in the three path to win the battle for show. BUCK'S FIZZ was brushed inside at the start, entered the first turn six wide, made an early
move pulling the rider outside to the leaders in mid-backstretch, was in the mix up top three wide around the far turn and evened out midway down the
stretch. BOSTON BAY forced the issue outside to start, inched away for the lead to the rail by the half, was collared outside three eighths from home,
stayed up front battling inside on the far turn, could not find more and yielded on the fence at the furlong pole. SILENT SUMMIT was brushed outside to
begin, travelled five wide into the turn, trailed down the backside, waited behind the field entering the second bend, was nudged for more between foes at
the quarter pole and was one paced in the five path down the lane. LEMON TWIST had the lead on the rail in the first turn, tracked the pacesetter along the
backside, lost positioning on the fence at the half, made little improvement finding the shortest way around on the far turn and had little to give down the
lane. GOLD BONANZA stalked near the back in the early going, travelled four deep outside foes at the half, made no gain outside runners when hard ridden
on the final turn, angled out five wide for the drive but came up empty down the stretch.

Footnotes
QUITE READY rated off the leader tracking not too far off just in behind and inside, was put to stout urging in upper stretch, bid up the rail in deep stretch to
get up late. MAD DOG N JOE set the pace from off the rail, came out a bit further for the drive, was all out and led till late before being outfinished.
LAPOCHKA bumped a rival lightly at the start, was held up last but one racing off the inside, swung out seven wide and put to urging leaving the turn,
gained mildly to get up for show honors. SHEKKY SHEBAZ settled mid-pack between foes two to three wide on the turn, came out five wide in mid-stretch,
kept on but needed more. PROVEN STRATEGIES got away well then was allowed to settle, stalked the leader from outside three to four wide, lacked the
needed late kick. LONG POND was a bit fractious in the gate, broke just a half-step slowly then made a steady early advance four wide, was within range
on the turn but failed to rally. CLASSY WHISPER settled outside off the pace three to four wide, swung six deep for the drive, ran on but was not a factor.
SALVATOR MUNDI was relegated toward the back racing inside, saved ground on the turn, was never a threat. GRACEFUL FIGHTER was lightly bumped
at the start, shifted in, trailed along the inside, angled eight wide turning for home, was unable to threaten. FRANK'S ART broke a half-step slowly, was
forwardly-placed outside five wide heading into the turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN settled on the rail in midfield, waited patiently on the fence behind the leader around the bend, shifted just outside in the two path
at the top of the lane, went on by the frontrunner at the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task to hold off the challengers in deep stretch. RELOAD'S
REBEL was unhurried to trail in the beginning, moved in, weaving between horses in the two path by the quarter pole, angled four wide straightening out for
the drive, posed a threat with an eighth remaining but could not run down the winner in deep stretch. HIGHLAND LIFE travelled four deep near the back of
the pack down the back straight, rallied four wide trying to circle the field on the turn, loomed widest in the six path turning for home, was gaining mildly to
the wire but just missed capturing the place share in the end. GAROFOLI settled outside foes three deep in midfield, maintained position when forced to
move three wide at the three furlong pole, kept pace throughout the turn, was in the hunt five wide in the drive to the wire but was outkicked in the final
furlong. ROCK TO FAME took control from the break, set the pace unchallenged along the backside, continued to dictate terms around the bend, was
clinging onto the lead with a furlong to run, had nothing left in reserve and wilted at the sixteenth pole. PUDDINGONTHERITZ chased the pace outside in
the early stages, could not find another gear between runners in the three path with furlong to go and weakened in deep stretch.

Footnotes
ALLEY OOP JOHNNY had a slim advantage inside going into the first turn, was content to track the pacesetter down the backside, shifted outside to
re-engage for the lead with five sixteenths remaining, battled down the lane and finally got the better of the determined leader in deep stretch for the score.
PEJA DU pressed the pace outside at the break, assumed the lead down the backstretch, dueled inside up front midway on the far turn and stubbornly gave
way nearing the wire. CHAIRMAN BOB was situated between horses in the two path in the third flight, stalked near the rear down the backside, rallied
smartly in hand just outside with five sixteenths to run, angled out reaching for more ground in the five path straightening out for home and closed late to be
a non-threatening third at the wire. READY FOR A FIGHT tracked on the rail in the first turn, had a good trip down the backside watching the contesting pair
up front, closed the gap on the fence midpoint on the far turn but could not rally on the rail in the lane and settled for a minor share in the end. LION
KINGDOM trailed the field in the early going, still made no progress running around the final oval, shifted outside in the five path with an eighth to go and
finished up with good interest in deep stretch. SPRING MOUNTAIN stalked three wide in the third flight, was urged on the far turn but could not make any
headway but did finish up willingly in the four path between runners late. SUNRISE DRIVE was ahead of one foe into the first turn, stalked on the rail in the
backstretch travelling in the third flight, was asked for run three furlongs out, offered no response on the final bend and made no impact on the rail down the
lane. GREEN FLEET tracked outside in the early stages of the race, took closer order to the engaged pair midway on the far turn, could not find more in the
stretch and tired at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
SOUPED UP quickly moved to the lead and clear, dictated terms from off the rail, was put to urging in the stretch, held sway while being kept to the task.
FOREST BUZZ stalked from outside going four to five wide on the turn, kept on in deep stretch to get up for place. GIANT TEDDY tracked from inside in
behind the leader and up close in range, moved out past the five-sixteenths, had aim three to four wide in upper stretch but failed to rally and lost place late.
CRUMLIN LAD settled off the pace inside foes, switched out to advance outside runners on the turn, swung eight wide turning for home, gained late to win a
battle for fourth. U S ARMY CORPS broke a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, unhurriedly brought up the rear, moved out three wide coming to the top of the
stretch, was guided out further for room nearing the seventy yard marker and ran on but was outfinished for the minor award. KING ELVIS exchanged a light
bump at the start, stalked from outside three to four wide, shifted in once in upper stretch and needed more. FABLED PRINCE was unhurried early outside
and at the back, came out six deep in upper stretch then was forced out a bit more in late stretch, ran on. AVOMAN stalked from between runners mid-pack
three to five wide, fanned seven wide turning into upper stretch and under urging, lacked the needed late kick. PRICELESS WILL hit the gate while breaking
outwardly, settled at the rear, swung nine wide, and ran on evenly. GALVASTON stalked from between runners mid-pack with good position coming to the
top of the stretch but faded in the lane. AIR COMBAT exchanged a light bump at the start, stalked from between runners two to three wide, came up empty.
SILENT MIRACLE was in just a bit tight as a rival ducked in early, raced near mid-pack inside, faded. FARAWAY KITTEN was not a factor. STEAK AND
CHEESE ducked into the temporary rail passing the gap and lost the rider, was caught by the outrider and walked off.

Footnotes
GAS ME UP travelled between runners close to the back in the beginning, moved in while still in hand three furlongs from home, lacked running room at the
quarter pole behind rivals, swung out to the six path with three sixteenths to go, was full of run by the eighth pole and got up in the final strides for the score.
TOUR THE CITY stalked outside in the third flight, split foes closing in at the three furlong marker to be in the hunt in the three path at the top of the stretch,
bullied his way through runners at the furlong marker and got up at the wire for the place share. CAUSIN' MAYHEM had a nice spot, alone, watching the
contesting duo around the turn, bid four wide in upper stretch outside rivals, poked his head in front with an eighth left to run and weakened near the wire to
just lose the place share in a photo. ROI SOLEIL stalked outside runners near the rear, began to smartly pick up horses four wide at the three eighths
marker, posed a threat six wide with a quarter remaining, could not sustain the rally and stalled in the final furlong. COMPETITIVE TOUCH set the pace
while pressed outside around the turn, was collared outside turning for home, stayed on gamely until the furlong pole and tired in the final sixteenth.
DEADPAN travelled on the outside in the third flight down the backstretch, continued that position around the turn, shifted out to the five path at the quarter
pole, was checked when in tight coming up to the furlong marker and could not regroup in time. FANORE (IRE) nestled on the rail in the third flight, closed
the gap on the fence through the turn, was in range of the leaders by the quarter pole but lacked a bid on the inside down the lane. TUNECHI settled on the
rail near the back, made no improvement inside around the band, angled six wide for the drive and was one paced in the stretch. WET AND WILD tended
the pace outside in the early parts of the race, could not go on with others at the top of the lane and folded in the three path between rivals at the three
sixteenths marker. SAMMY STONE was away slowly to trail down the backside, could not get interested on the turn and was not a factor down the lane.

Footnotes
YACHT BOY was allowed to settle at the back in the beginning, made a bold move four wide around horses at the three furlong pole, bid for the lead three
wide at the quarter marker, switched leads going to the lead at the furlong pole and drew off in deep stretch. EL COHETE tracked the trio inside down the
backstretch, inched closer on the fence measuring the leaders on the turn, shifted out threatening four wide at the top of the lane and was up late to best the
rest in the end. GOLD MAGIC broke inwards on the start, took this field down the backside, was headed outside by the winner two furlongs out, dug in until
the sixteenth pole and faded late losing the place share at the wire. BREAK THE SPELL trailed the field on the fence, caught up to the pack circling four
wide at the quarter pole, continued with momentum angling out widest in the eight path for the drive and finished with intent for a minor role. FAIRWAY TO
HEAVEN tracked the front trio outside, offered no rally between horses three furlongs remaining, angled to the five path straightening out to the wire and
evened out driving to the finish line. UNCAPTURED MOMENT stalked on the rail in the third flight, shifted out four wide two furlongs from the line, continued
outside in the seven path turning for home and lacked a finish between foes down the lane. GUN COURT pressed the pace between runners, was roused
for more chasing the pacesetter making no gain through the turn, shifted out six wide for the stretch run but faltered with horses on both sides at the eighth
pole. ROAR OF THE CROWD prompted the pace three wide outside horses, was scrubbed on three wide with three eighths to run, could not quicken with
rivals on the turn and backed away by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
CAPTURE THE LION rated kindly on the rail in midfield down the backside, kept pace inside waiting to move on the turn, shifted off the fence finding a
seam in the two path at the furlong pole and surged late to get up just before the wire. NIAGARA SKYLINE cleared from the widest post to lead on the rail
by the five furlong marker, set the pace going comfortably, uncontested around the turn, found more driving to the finish line and just missed for the
frontrunning score just before the wire. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) settled three deep in mid-division, crept closer three wide outside foes through the turn, was
in range behind the leaders in upper stretch, battled bravely between foes for the place share at the eighth pole, was no match for the top pair late but
finished up to be a clear third in the end. PERFECT CRIME travelled on the fence near the back of the pack, improved on the rail sitting behind the eventual
by the half, continued to keep coming in the two path down the lane and finished with intent inside to be a fringe player in the end. NEVER SURPRISED
was tucked in on the rail behind the pacesetter, chased the leader on the fence throughout the turn, shifted out to the three path with a quarter mile to run
having a chance for a share of the prize, could not go on and faded in the last eighth. RON'S GIZMO was situated near the rear three deep in the beginning,
started to rally four wide between rivals with three furlongs to go, swung out having momentum in the seven path straightening out to the wire and finished
up with late energy passing horses to the finish line. SPIRIT ANIMAL stalked near the rear with foes on both sides down the backstretch, co-trailed between
horses at the half, offered a run closing the gap in the four path turning for home and finished up mildly in the stretch drive. FOUND MY BALL tracked the
frontrunner outside down the backstretch, chased the leader through the turn between rivals, began to get leg weary in the four path with three sixteenths
still left to run and tired at the furlong marker. SCOOT DADDY was off a step slow trailing on the rail, saved ground making little movement inside around
the bend and could not reach contention inside through the lane. KAUKOKAIPUU settled in midfield between runners, continued with rivals on both sides in
the two path through the turn in the middle of the pack, angled out to the six path for the stretch run, drifted inwards at the furlong marker and had no rally in
deep stretch. LAST DAWN was near the back four deep outside foes, continued a four wide outside horses on the turn, was floated out to the eight path for
the drive to the wire but emptied out by mid-stretch. TARANTO TITAN tracked the leader between foes early on, settled all alone in the third flight through
the turn, closed in three wide with three furlongs to race, dueled in the mix up front for a share in the four path with a quarter to go, had nothing left to offer
and stopped six wide three sixteenths out.
