TRABR'S CREED quick to begin to set the early pace and drew off to be a handy winner under mild encouragement. CONNOR TALKSTRASH chased the
pace from the inside, saved ground through the far turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. DAY JO urged along early, raced three to four wide
around the far turn and needed more in the drive. MEDAL OF HONOR hustled along three deep and faded. MO HAWK MAN swung wide into the upper
stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
DOSS showed good early speed and held gamely to be clear late under steady handling. PRINCE PERFECTA tracked the early leader two deep from the
outside, challenged through the far turn and finished second best. CAJUN MISCHIEF was squeezed back at the start, raced off the pace down the
backstretch from the outside, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. BELLAMY BROTHER stalked the pace, had an inside run and
raced evenly to the wire. COMPUTERIZED stalked the pace two deep and tired. BLUME reluctant to load, raced mid pack early on, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. SAUCER EYES dropped back near the back early on, raced from the inside near the quarter pole, angled out through
the upper stretch and never threatened.

KID SHELLEEN rated along two deep to race in hand, asked nearing the five sixteenths pole to challenge and drew off to be clear under a steady hand ride.
SEDUCTIVE U S A dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, shifted out five wide and rallied for the place position.
PREMIUM showed good early speed to set the pace, ridden a bit near the three eighths pole, was collared near the quarter pole and weakened through the
drive. MAU MAU raced five wide around the first turn, mid pack early on, raced three deep around the far turn, shifted out a bit through the drive and was
even with no closing run. CHIEF ALPHA saved ground and never threatened. ROBO was forwardly placed to lay up close early on to flank the early leader
from the outside and tired readily.

raced near the inside past the quarter pole and needed more in the drive for the top pair. STATLER showed good early foot to set the pace and stopped.
WINONESOON rated along the inside and was empty nearing the quarter pole.
