MOUNTAIN SOUND tracked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. MORE SAVVY was
unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MS SUEDOO was off the pace,
trailed the field on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. BORN TO BE GOOD was away alertly and saved ground on
the turn but was no real threat. CAPTURE MY DREAMS stumbled at the start, chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no
impact. CARELESS HEIRESS set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

CHERRY GARDENS showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. P T BEAUCETTE
was unhurried early and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. ROHESE was hustled from the
inside and roused on the turn but was no real threat. ALMONTE PRINCESS stumbled at the start and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch was all out. MISS SINGH ANGEL showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was
no factor. SUGAR DROP tracked the early leaders from the outside but chased on the turn and was not a threat. SOVEREIGN TALE checked early and
showed little in a dull effort.
