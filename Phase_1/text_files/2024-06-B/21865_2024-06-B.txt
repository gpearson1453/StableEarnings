Footnotes
WOODEN SHIPS settled off the rail the first turn, rallied to the front three wide approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the far turn and was kept
sharp to further extend her lead. FLORIDIFIED saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase into the backstretch and raced at the rail into the far turn,
angled to the four and five paths through the turn and dueled to clear second later yards. PALACIO rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing
the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead toward the quarter and flattened stride mid-stretch. UNUSUALLY LUCKY gave up a few lengths when she dwelled
in the gate, closed steadily through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. JUJU ON DA BEAT rounded the opening turn
about the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn. KEY TO THE CASTLE raced in the four
path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the five path on the far turn. AMELIA'S DREAM stalked two deep, challenged
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
SNOWY JUBA CAT took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the early pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, widened at the rail on
the turn and held well under steady handling. GHOSTLY SQUALL gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and finished well. CHEROKEE CASTLE
bobbled leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and flattened mid-stretch. SCARLET REBEL gave chase,
raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane. THELASTSAY chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened in the lane.
EMBERLY broke awkwardly, gave chase outside and raced in the seven path on the turn. TIZ THE REASON lunged at the break, gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and weakened in the lane. RIVER REWARDS RVF was not a factor. WITNESS THE ENERGY was not a
factor.

BULL gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then dug in and dueled late for second. COLLECTING ANGELS pressured the pace at mostly even
terms, contested at a close disadvantage near the rail on the turn and was outfinished in a later duel for second. SUPER EMOJI chased inside, raced at the
rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. BOSS LADY K P steadied early then gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane.
JUBA B WILD chased, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the stretch. LOOK AHEAD gave chase then faded in the four path on the
turn. WHY NOT DIXIE was bumped off stride leaving the gate then gave chase while saving ground. LOVE YOU A LATI saved ground. POPPY MAC
became fractious in the paddock, ran loose in the post parade then ducked in and made sharp contact with Why Not Dixie leaving the gate.

STOLEN LAUGHTER set a pressured pace inside, dueled clear past the five sixteenths pole and held on with steady handling. LINDA'S TAJ steadied
shortly after the break then gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn, drifted entering the stretch and dug in to take second later yards while gaining on
the winner. BREAKING BULLET chased, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. MRS. SPEAKER gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn
and finished evenly. MARTHA'S HEART chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. GONE WITH THE WYN chased, rounded
the turn about the three path and weakened. ICY STARE broke awkwardly then pressured the early pace, but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole
and faded in the four path on the turn. EVERYDAYISAGIFT gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path.

Footnotes
PARK AVE PRINCE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, kept the edge over BID ON BLUE leaving the three eighths pole, came under pressure at
the five sixteenths and cleared that one nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was kept alert in the stretch. The latter angled in
approaching the first turn and stalked two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole but dropped back toward the quarter, raced off the rail on the far
turn and couldn't improve in the lane. UNCLE PRESS rated close inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path on
the far turn, then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. LAST OF BAD BOYS saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced at
the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. SHOOT THE BREEZE rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
the four path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT settled off the rail the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave
chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. BIG JOE B raced in the four path the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. JOHN'S GLORY raced well back. RIVERLEE became a bit anxious in the gate, rounded the first turn in the
five path and showed little response. THOR'S LAD raced in the three path the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

GRUMPY'S BUDDY settled off the rail, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, took the nod in the four path
entering the stretch, dueled clear a sixteenth away and held on well. MOON FALL stalked the early pace, bid leaving the half mile pole and dueled for the
nod two deep at the quarter pole, but gave up the lead leaving the far turn and relented mid-stretch. NEVERFOLD saved ground well off the pace then
eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for third inside the sixteenth
pole. CANDY FOR JUBA moved to the inside and rated the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, gave up the lead at the quarter
pole and weakened leaving the far turn. RED HOT TODDY showed little response through the backstretch. LOVE IS WICKED raced wide on the first turn
then raced in the four path the second turn and stalked into the backstretch, but faded past the half mile pole. SUGAR LIPS was not a factor. TIME TO

MARSHALL PEANUT moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
held well under steady handling. PENGUIN PARADE raced in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and came
through the far turn about the three path, then dueled to clear second mid-stretch. LORD OF CORK stalked off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and relented in the stretch duel for second. VAGABOND VIRGIN settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, entered the far turn near the rail, eased out in the upper stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. I'LLTAKECAREOFIT raced in the four
path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and weakened in the lane.
NEVERPOPTHECORK settled off the rail and never factored. LIEUTENANT BROWN raced inside early, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but
faded at the rail approaching the far turn.
