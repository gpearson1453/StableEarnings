REDWINEANDWHISKEY well placed, closed willingly four wide through the stretch under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. STRATOGALE
bore out at the start, sprinted to the clear lead soon thereafter, set all the pace and just missed hanging on while three wide. INSATIABLE EVA never far
back, closed a gap late six wide. MY BEST DAY EVER saved ground and finished determinedly. NOT TODAY was shut off then drifted out bumping FOUR
BLESSINGS at the start then rallied belatedly two wide. HONORABLE WOMAN stalked the early pace, moved closer three wide on the turn, kept on while
drifting five wide and was outfinished. MY SUZIE Q well placed, failed to respond. SAKONNA was outrun. FOUR BLESSINGS was bumped at the start and
no threat. PARDY PLEASER was through early.

Footnotes
THAT'S THE WAY unhurried early, closed fast inside rivals into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker then drew off under left handed urging
to win as much the best. MOESTER trailed early, closed willingly four wide through the stretch and got up for second. MISTER MOBIL settled near mid
pack, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. HITE slow early, found his best stride late inside rivals. EXCITEMENT chased the
pace until deep stretch two wide then weakened. FIRST SONG away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch and gave way late.
ROMANTIC COWBOY with the second flight two wide, weakened after six furlongs. DR. ZARNETT failed to respond. MANGA MAN was no threat.
VENTURE ON was through after a half. CASUAL ATTIRE was no factor. CONTROLLER had brief speed, stopped on the far turn and was eased to the
wire.

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip under right
then left handed urging to win as much the best. RED HOT LASS raced wide for nearly a quarter of a mile, angled in two wide, pressed the pace into the
stretch and was no match for the winner. CORNINGSTONE vied for the lead in the two path into the far turn, waited for an opening past the quarter pole,
shifted out to the five path in upper stretch for racing room while inching closer then was outfinished. FROSTY O TOOLE trailed for a half, swung wide and
passed tiring rivals in the seven path. YANKEE DOLLAR sprinted to the lead soon after the start, dropped inside nearing the clubhouse turn, set a
pressured pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. KEY TO SUCCESS was no factor. DOT MARIE well placed two wide, failed to respond. MAGIC
PALACE close up along the inside early, was through after a half.

BATTEN DOWN sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under strong handling. GOULD'S GOLD
chased the winner in the two path, brushed with CATCHING FREEDOM at the top of the stretch and gamely gained second in the four path. COPPER TAX
bumped with CHARLESTON at the start, was allowed to settle then found his best stride late in the six path. CATCHING FREEDOM stalked the pace in the
three path into the stretch, was brushed by GOULD'S GOLD at the top of the stretch and was outfinished in the final stages while racing in the five path.
UNCLE HEAVY bobbled inward at the start and was no factor. CHARLESTON bumped with COPPER TAX at the start, had good early speed along the
inside and was through after a half.
