late salvaging place at mid track. BOCCABELLA raced evenly losing ground to upper stretch outbidding the others there. TAMBARELLA hustled along
chased to upper stretch angling inside while weakening there. DON'T LOOK UP a step slow to upper stretch finished evenly. CONNECT IT raced evenly
playing no factor. WHISPER ME A SONG was never involved. S S ALTERNATE gave way on the turn. AMERICAN DREAMER played no factor.
