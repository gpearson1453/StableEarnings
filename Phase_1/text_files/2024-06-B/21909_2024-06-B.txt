Footnotes
SHE'S RESILIENT prompted FEATHER INTHE WIND from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and won drawing clear.
FEATHER INTHE WIND saved ground setting the pace to near the eighth pole and held on well for second when headed. CHARMANT E was allowed to
settle, swung out to come three-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. FLYIN BY hopped at the start then angled in, steadied in tight along the
inside in the opening furlong, dropped back while racing four-wide on the turn and failed to menace. LUCINDA RELLA broke through the gate prior to the
start but was retained by the assistant starter and reloaded then raced close-up along the inside for three furlongs and gave way.

prominent early while racing four-wide and tired. ARIZONA ANDREW was unhurried while racing four-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and

Footnotes
LA POPIS saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. CLAY'S OPAL
INDY vied with MISCHIEF MAMA for the lead from along the inside, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held on well for second when headed
late. CONFIDENCE BUILDER was forwardly placed from the start, came three-wide into the stretch and finished well for third in a steady effort. MISCHIEF
MAMA vied with CLAYS OPAL INDY from along the outside, was four-wide entering the stretch and weakened. LUVAHAPPYENDING was unhurried early,
came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. WARREN'S MEMORABLE was off a step slow then moved up three-wide to be prominent to near the
stretch and tired.
