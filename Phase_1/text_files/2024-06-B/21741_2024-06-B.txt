Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST closed to contention and stalked two deep, challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod at the three eighths and dueled
clear into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on. DUNDER BOSS saved ground on the opening turn, bid past
the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, finished well to take second late yards and was gaining slowly on the winner. MISS
WAVE took a quick lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod at the
three eighths and chased from that point, but dropped back into the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. PRACTICALLY THERE raced well back
while saving early ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. SO RED
THE ROSE raced well back in the three path the opening turn and could only improve her position. I SHALLBE RELEASED settled off the pace about the
three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened. SALTY SAUL settled inside on the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
JACKYSINTHECASTLE saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail into the far turn, angled to the five path
leaving the turn, dug in under steady handling and got up late yards. INTERCEPTION raced in the three and four paths on the first turn, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms in the four path entering the stretch, relented late yards but kept the nod for second. SMOKIN LADY
took a quick lead inside and rated the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was met at the rail entering the stretch and kept the advantage
to late yards before relenting. COUSIN WINNIE settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. SNEAKY LYNK raced in the four path the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail approaching the head of the lane. DIVA ROSE became a bit anxious in the gate then raced
off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened past the five sixteenths. VIENNA'S TWIRL
stumbled losing her rider at the break.

Footnotes
GIO'S TOUGH COOKIE was hustled to the front approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace inside, contested the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. JUBA'S MOCHA broke in and made contact with Tup's To Take then gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, dueled to
clear second toward mid-stretch and was gaining slowly on the winner. GETTIN SPICY had a brief early lead then gave chase, raced in the four path on the
turn and came along to take third late yards. TUP'S TO TAKE was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly
in the lane. DIVA'S DEMON pressured the early pace two deep, drafted the winner at the rail nearing the head of the stretch but flattened stride the final
furlong. SALTY STARKEY engaged in close early chase, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the stretch. CANDY OUTLINE gave chase and
rounded the turn about the four path. MADMAN JONES became fractious behind the gate, gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path.

DIAMOND'S CABARET stalked inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in for the lead
passing the sixteenth pole and edged away later yards. MALTESE ROSE stalked off the rail the first turn then challenged toward the three eighths pole,
dueled at even terms two deep midway on the far turn, took the nod entering the stretch but was met passing the sixteenth pole and flattened stride later
yards. LOKI'S LIGHTNING tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the
rail on the far turn, but was met entering the stretch and weakened. SENZA FINE stalked the earlier pace about the three path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. SUGAR MOMMA mostly saved ground. LADY TOURIST raced off the rail the first
turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
GOLDEN ASSET took over nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and was steadily
handled to hold on well. PARK AVE PRINCE rated close inside through the backstretch, bid nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn then
dueled to clear second later yards. BIG BOY OVI set a pressured early pace then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the
turn but flattened stride leaving the turn. ROMANTIC WARRIOR gave chase inside and improved at the rail on the turn, angled to the five path approaching
the head of the lane and finished evenly. BID ON BLUE pressured the early pace then faded off the rail on the turn. MEGS GOLDEN BOY gave chase,
raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. BIG JOE B chased through the backstretch, entered the turn about the five path but drifted toward
the head of the lane and weakened. BEST HOP IS A DROP was not a factor.
