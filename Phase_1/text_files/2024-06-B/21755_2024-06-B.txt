get up under strong handling. ALWAYS CONNECTED prompt the early pace from the outside, raced three wide near the quarter pole, led inside the eighth
pole and missed in a game effort. RITZ ON BROADWAY stalked the pace between rivals, shifted to the inside into the upper stretch to take aim and
flattened out. BRAVO REGINA was unhurried early on, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. NO WALK INTHE PARK tracked
the pace from the inside and weakened. VICIOUS MOVES raced near the back early on, eased nearing the quarter pole, was transported from the track via

Footnotes
LIFFEY stalked the pace top pair, moved up three wide between into the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear late under strong encouragement.
RUE CAMBON stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn and kept on gamely to the wire. MARTYNAS' JOY pressed the
early leader two deep from the outside, led briefly and gave way grudgingly late. LA FANTASMA set a pressured early pace near the rail and weakened in
the drive. SPIRIT IN THE MIST (FR) was allowed to settle early, dropped in to saved ground around the far turn into the upper lane and had no response.
VAI GATTINA stumbled at the break, raced off the early pace, was five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. GATA was off slowly, dropped to
the back of the pack early and lacked a bid. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

the top pair from the inside, angled out into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. THE COLORA KID lost ground to race far back and was

NAPOLEON'S WAR set all the pace from the inside, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling. VAX A NATION tracked the early leader two deep
from the outside, slowly closed in on the winner and missed in a game effort. SKIPPERINI stalked the top trio, made a good rail bid around the far turn
through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. BIG BIG STAR rated along the inside to race in hand and had no final winning bid in the drive. TWIST
'N TWIRL rated back off the early pace setters and was even with no closing run. PRALINE'S CAT settled off the early going, hard ridden four wide around
the far turn and had no late rally. BOLT FROM ABOVE was off slowly, saved ground and never threatened. RENEWING VOWS dropped back early, raced
five to six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
GRAND ROZZO was between runners into the turn, angled inside entering upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong inside rival, inched clear under
very strong encouragement. NEW JERSEY HEIST was a step slow leaving the gate, pressed the issue between runners into the turn, three wide bid
nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside GRAND ROZZO through the stretch, finished gamely to the wire. I WANNA ROCK chased the pace into the turn,
angled out six deep leaving the quarter pole, racing on his left lead, gained the show very late. ON THE CHILL good speed away from the gate,
unchallenged on the front end around the turn, came under pressure enter the stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. RUBIDOR slow away from
the gate, settled in well off the pace, bid along the rail nearing the three eighths pole, was outrun to the wire. EAST TO BEAST slow into stride, pressed
along three wide around the turn, never a threat. AWESOME FRIEND very awkward start, never recovered. STORM CAT EYES lost the rider at the start.
There was a stewards inquiry into the start of the race, after review no changes were made.
