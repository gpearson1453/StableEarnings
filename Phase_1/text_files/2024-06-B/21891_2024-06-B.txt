Footnotes
LANETTA stalked off the rail then challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dug in under
steady stretch encouragement and took over the final strides. SPEEDY BUBBLES took the lead at the three quarter pole and tapered to the inside to show
the way, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling leaving
the turn, but was caught while flattening stride nearing the wire. VAN HOOK stalked inside, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SISTER SPIRIT rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. SUMMERTIME ROSE stumbled to her nose leaving the gate, raced off the
rail on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LADY CINCO DE MAYO saved ground. NANA'S BOOPA rounded the first turn
about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded approaching the far turn.

THUNDERTURTLE settled well back from early contention, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in under
steady handling leaving the turn and took the nod in the final stride. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY moved to the inside and rated the early pace, was met into the
backstretch and dueled at mostly even terms, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was nipped at
the wire and just lasted for second. CLEARLY VISIBLE stalked inside on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, angled out leaving the turn, finished well and just missed second. MISS MOON PIE angled in through the front stretch and stalked two deep,
challenged at even terms leaving the half mile pole and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. SECRET
CASTLE came away a bit awkwardly then saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path,
drifted to the outside leaving the turn and passed rivals widest. CALIFORNIA CODE saved ground racing well back, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MRS. DEL raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three

QUEEN SABINE stalked from the three path the first turn, started her bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn, dueled to the
front inside the sixteenth pole and drew away late yards. STILL GRUMPY raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch and took the
lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the far turn but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened late. HOUSE ALERT
raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and finished evenly. FULL
OF CHARM was roughed off the heels of Princess Of Gold into the first turn and raced hemmed in through the turn, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. DREAM LEADER took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came
under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail toward the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. SWEET
WINDSOR raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. TINA'S BACK raced boxed at the rail the first turn and never
factored. PRINCESS OF GOLD was pulled up with a fatal injury shortly after the start and had to be euthanized on the track.

MOTIVATING stalked off the rail the first turn, dueled for the lead two deep midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. BIG SMILE raced
with the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, dropped back at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride in
the three path into the far turn and dueled to take second mid-stretch. ALLEN CAN DO IT raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third later yards. OZONE raced with the pace two deep and took the
nod passing the half mile pole, dueled from that point but was met at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened into the lane. PERSONABLE settled in the
five path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. TEMPESTIVO saved ground into the

MR. DUMBLEDORE settled off the rail the opening turn, started his bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, raced off the rail on the far
turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and kept the nod when LASTWALKTOFREEDOM steadied while lugging in late. The latter rounded the first turn in the
four path, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the five path on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and drew to even
terms, but lugged in under left hand urging late and was steadied while making light contact with the winner in the final strides. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE raced
in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the stretch. ONE CANDY
CASTLE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but flattened late yards.
IN HIGH GEAR rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened nearing
mid-stretch. ALDRINALINE rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. CHASE LIL ME saved ground
on the first turn and showed little response. TAKE YOUR TIME rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch then faded at the rail into
the far turn.

Footnotes
HILLBILLY PRIDE took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace outside, angled in nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn off the rail and
was steadily handled through the lane. CHRISTOPHER'SHEART was squeezed at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path and dueled
through the stretch for second. CALYPSO JOHN chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch
duel for second. MONKEY WRENCH ducked in and made contact with Christopher'sheart leaving the gate then gave chase outside, raced in the five path
on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. ASTRAYAL saved ground into the turn, angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane and finished
evenly to improve his position. SHINEY GHOST came away awkwardly then gave chase inside, raced close at the rail on the turn but weakened nearing
mid-stretch. DOG TOWN ALLEN chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path and flattened in the lane. ROAD PUNCH ducked out and made
contact with Christopher'sheart leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened in the stretch.
