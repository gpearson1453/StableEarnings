Footnotes
NUWANDA , patiently handled in the two path between horses around the turn, moved to the four in mid stretch, closed strongly and took the lead near the
sixteenth pole. LADY ENSIGN , near the inner rail around the turn, was taken to the three path for room in mid stretch and rallied between rivals. WHATTA
WORLD lacked speed near the inner rail on the turn, moved to the four path in mid stretch and rallied. DIVINA DULCE , three wide chasing the pace around
the turn, had aim in mid stretch then gave way. AFTERNEATH set the pace in the two path, weakened and brushed with MOLLIE TPPER in deep stretch.
MOLLIE TAPPER hugged the inner rail chasing the pace, was caught in narrow quarters in mid stretch and brushed with AFTERMATH in deep stretch.
STORMY MIDNIGHT , rated down the backstretch, floated to the six path in mid stretch and failed to rally. ABSTRACT MOMENT , four wide on the turn,
floated to the seven path in mid stretch and was not a factor. FROSTY MAYA , unruly behind the starting gate, chased the pace four deep around the turn
and gave way. An objection by the rider of MOLLIE TAPPER against AFTERNEATH for alleged interference in the stretch run was not allowed.

outside LITTLE JOSIE WALES and determinedly prevailed. LITTLE JOSIE WALES , three wide leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn,
gained the lead approaching the stretch and battled inside the winner the final furlong. UPSWELL , four deep on the turn, challenged for the lead outside the
winner in mid stretch then weakened. TRUE SUNSHINE , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, reached
contention in mid stretch then weakened. DWELLING LEGACY , along the rail stalking the pace around the turn, eased out for the drive and gave way.

DETERMINED KINGDOM , away in good order, eagerly went clear heading to the turn, set a rated pace around the turn, spurted away after being roused in
upper stretch, kept on under solid handling past mid stretch then held firm to the wire. OUTLAW KID eased back from between foes in the opening
sixteenth, stalked outside, had aim into the lane, failed to threaten the winner but stayed on willingly to hold down the place outside BIZ BIZ BUZZ. BIZ BIZ
BUZZ rated close up while saving ground, steadied mid turn, regrouped and cut the corner into the stretch, kept on with some effort but was out kicked by
OUTLAW KID. WINFROMWITHIN broke a tad slow, settled off the pace, angled three to four wide nearing the lane but failed to generate a rally.

FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL stalked three wide, bid three deep mid turn, emerged in a battle to the inside of JARDANI nearing the furlong grounds, kept on
determinedly under strong handling, gained a slim advantage in deep stretch then proved resolute to the wire. JARDANI settled off the pace, edged up off
the rail to be close leaving the far turn, angled out and circled five wide into the lane, took a short lead outside foes near the three sixteenths, battled gamely
outside the winner from there but was edged late. NAKED AND FAMOUS , forwardly placed while saving ground, eased out mid turn, shifted out from
behind rivals in upper stretch, chased but went evenly through the final furlong. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED prompted the pace outside MOSE PERFECT,
moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, dueled a narrow lead between runners past the three eighths, stayed on to upper stretch then faded
through the last eighth. MOSE PERFECT cleared under a light hold leaving the chute, set the pace towards the inner rail, took pressure leaving the half mile
marker, was under a ride while being hounded by outer rivals mid turn, gave way in mid stretch then was reported by the stewards to have bled.

PROVE MY LOVE , confidently handled shadowing the leader two to three wide, moved up and took command inside the quarter pole, responded when
asked leaving the three sixteenths, thwarted a challenge from PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) leaving mid stretch, edged clear under a drive then held sway.
PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) , under snug rating while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, worked her way between foes then threatened inside the winner
near mid stretch, failed to match strides in the final sixteenth but continued gamely to save the place. GASTOWN BABE hopped at the break, regrouped and
settled in the clear, worked well out in the course in mid stretch, finished well but missed the place. BITTY BOSS stalked three wide, shifted out four wide
pursuing from the head of the lane but came up empty. FUHGEDDABOUDIT , outside a rival mid turn while not far back, angled five wide into the stretch
but lacked a serious run. AFANDI sped to the front, set the pace towards the inside, ceded to the winner in upper stretch then weakened through the final
eighth. DARK DAHLIA broke in the air and was away last, saved ground off the pace and failed to threaten. SHERO had speed then rated back off the
leaders and tracked inside, eased out into the lane, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and weakened. DEEDS OF LOVE was getting out a bit near the far
turn, dropped far back then was eased while distanced.

KING'S RIVER , inside while not far back nearing the half, was shuffled a bit behind UNCLE CAT leaving the far turn, regrouped to give hard chase, came
four wide into the lane, shifted out wider past the three sixteenths, leveled off under strong handling, surged outside to take command inside the sixteenth
marker then edged clear. SQUINTS got into a pace battle towards the inner rail early on, carried that into and around the turn, was under stout handling
dueling into the stretch, wrested command leaving the furlong grounds, kept on grittily and saved the place. UNCLE CAT vied on a slim lead between foes
early on, was rated back off the lead nearing the turn, dropped back to last leaving the three sixteenths, swung well out in the track leaving mid stretch then
came back on nicely while just missing second. SWEET SODDY J , four wide early, chased the duelers three wide mid turn, remained on his left lead
through the final furlong then churned on between foes. PRADO ROAD , with the early pace three deep, emerged in a duel outside SQUINTS leaving the far
turn, held a short lead under a ride in upper stretch, battled on past mid stretch then weakened very late. I KNOW MAP secured the rail and settled off the
pace, edged up while saving ground near mid stretch, eased out with run then steadied lacking room through the final fifty yards. IRISH HERO , off last
when appearing to lose his footing at the break, regrouped to pull his way forward behind foes, steadied along nearing the half, angled out to stalk four wide,
failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
SUMMER ANTHEM settled off the pace, angled out and commenced a run leaving the three eighths, circled four wide into the lane, closed in under a drive,
took over near mid stretch, kicked clear then held firm. BRADY BEAR a bit fidgety just before the gates opened, broke slowly and towards the outside,
corrected and rushed up four wide outside foes to take over then clear into the first turn, dropped in to set the pace, was under coaxing holding command in
upper stretch, ceded to the leader but kept on with good effort to be second best. MAYBE IT'S TIME saved ground while forwardly placed into the
backstretch, dropped back a touch into the far turn then was put to pressure, remained inside for the drive and came back on steadily. BOSS MAN J J broke
outward and brushed with JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH, corrected and rated in the clear, moved up between rivals near the quarter pole, stayed on his left
lead and finished evenly. CLASS WIZARD , unhurried early, raced four wide leaving the far turn, gained six wide outside runners leaving mid stretch then
flattened out late. BOCA GUY saved ground, eased out near the quarter pole then needed more between rivals in the final furlong. EDDIE FELSON , two
wide being coaxed along into the far turn, angled out some and edged up between runners past mid stretch, steadied briefly when lacking some room near
the sixteenth pole, shifted in but failed to threaten. MR JEFFERSON saved ground early, angled out leaving the far turn, came seven wide for the drive but
lacked a rally. INVECTIVE , off the pace, saved ground into the stretch but failed to seriously kick on. JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH , brushed at the start,
edged up between foes to give chase, raced two wide with aim into the stretch, failed to go on in mid stretch and weakened. HACHURE , towards the inside,
was not a factor. BALI'S SHADE , four wide to contention, raced three deep pursuing past the five eighths, failed to go on nearing the lane, faltered and was
eased late.

Footnotes
ALWAYSINAHURRY was steadied when squeezed back at the break, regrouped and raced well off the early pace while removed from the rail, took closer
order under coaxing past the five sixteenths, closed stoutly five wide under strong handling leaving the three sixteenths, took over a sixteenth out and
eagerly kicked away. GOLDEN CANDY saved ground pursuing the loose leader, eased out three to four wide in upper stretch, bid between foes leaving mid
stretch, kept on willingly and was clearly second best. POINT DUME forced inward at the break, corrected and opened up early, set the pace under a light
hold just off the inside, came under a ride soon into the lane, failed to resist outer rivals leaving the furlong grounds and faltered. EXCULPATORY drifted
inward at the break forcing POINT DUME inward towards the winner, corrected and chased outside a rival, shifted out some for the drive but came up
empty. KARAN'S NOTION began to buck soon after the break while having his saddle slip, was pulled up nearing the turn and walked off. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning KARAN'S NOTION. No action was deemed necessary.

closed stoutly under solid hand encouragement, forged past embattled rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and eagerly widened while kept alert. RISKY
BEESNESS vied outside a rival before clearing around the first turn, dropped in and set the pace, took outside pressure from the five sixteenths pole, kept
on gamely and saved the place. THIS COUNTRY angled out early and edged up to prompt the pace, moved alongside the leader leaving the five
sixteenths, battled through the lane and kept on willingly. FOR ARROGATE , in a bit tight soon after the break, regrouped and settled off the pace, angled
out around the final turn, came seven wide for the drive and finished well to gain. SAVE THE UNION , off the pace while saving ground leaving the far turn,
worked outward in the drive and churned on between foes. AKAYLA (IRE) settled outside a rival, angled out around the final turn, raced six wide in upper
stretch and offered a mild kick. CANDY DOLL had speed then rated back off the leader, stalked outside a foe, came three wide into the lane, chased but
needed more. CYNTHIA JUNE saved ground while edging up near the half, eased out pursuing in upper stretch then faded in the final furlong. URBAN
