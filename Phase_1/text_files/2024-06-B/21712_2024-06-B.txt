Footnotes
PETINGAS TWIN pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then drew off in the drive to prove much the
best under mild urging. LILTONYTWOPHONES was reluctant to load, broke outwardly at the start, settled early, then cut the corner off the bend and
finished well on the inside to gain the place award. ROCKET DRAGON set a pressured pace early on the inside, then relented on the turn and then swung
out four wide leaving the bend and proved to be no match for the winner while losing the place award late. TAKESCHARGESMILING chased the pace on
the inside and came two wide off the bend and had no rally. SILVERBULLETTWENTY chased the pace on the outside and was three to four wide on the
turn, then ducked out by the furlong marker and lost the rider, was caught and walked off.

settled early and saved ground on the turn, moved out in the lane and finished well to be clearly second best while no match for the winner. NITRO TIME
dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane, stayed on to best the rest. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was reserved early three wide, saved ground
on the turn and had no rally. CALLIN MY NAME chased the early fast pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
DYNAMITE KARMA was well rated early towards the inside, moved out nearing the five eighths marker, made a three wide move on the far turn to take
over, then drew off to prove much the best while being ridden out. CHAIN REACTION was allowed to settle early on the inside, moved out to be three wide
leaving the turn, then angled in and finished willingly on the inside to be clearly second best while no match to the winner. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL vied for
the lead on the inside, then fell back by the quarter pole, came three wide off the turn and weakened, bested rest. MR. EINSTEIN broke in a tangle at the
start and rider almost fell off, then settled back on the inside and had no rally. SOUPER ROYAL MOON vied for the lead on the outside and was two to three
wide on the backstretch and then stopped on the far turn and was eased in the lane.
