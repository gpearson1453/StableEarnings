Footnotes
HIGH CALIBER CATCH pressed the pace while four deep into the turn, then dug in gamely leaving the bend to confront the pace setter in the early stretch,
dueled briefly before kicking clear in the final sixteenth and proving best in the end. ALONG CAME THUNDER settled back to pursue the pace from the two
path in the early furlongs, then bid on the turn while three wide, and closed well in the late stretch to be up for the place prize in the end. DOC'S BUD broke
inwardly, then showed the way by a head down the backstretch and into the turn, was in a long drive in the early stretch, then was challenged by an outer
foe, could not retain bid and gave way in the end. SHE'S SPELLBOUND was impeded at the start, was unhurried early, then bid mildly in the late stretch
and was no threat. HI LEE FAVOREDCATS drifted inwards at the start, then laid off the pace along the rail in the early furlongs, then rallied in the upper
stretch and lacked responding in the end. WESTERN SKY pressed the pace between rivals and while three wide, continued to urge steadily on the turn
while stalking the leader then flattened out in the stretch. RUBY SOHO broke outwardly then pressed the pace from the two path and in a hard drive, was
used up heading into the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
COLOSI remained well rated in the two path in the early stages, was in a steady drive along the rail on the far turn before coming out three wide in the early
stretch, dug in gamely and found the best stride in final yards to be up at the wire. DRIVEHAPPY stalked the pace from the two path throughout the first
three quarters, then rallied leaving the far turn to duel with the leader in the late stretch then was outfinsihed by an outer counter part in the final feet and
was second best in the end. LIONS NOT SHEEP led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn, then
was confronted by an outer foe in the stretch to spar in the final yards then was out finished and was best for the show prize. ICARUS was allowed to settle
along the rail down the backstretch, then drifted out three to four wide leaving the far turn, rallied in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. RIGHT
TONE pursued the pace mid pack while three wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn before flattening out in the stretch. MONET'S
DEVIL was in tight on the first turn, then checked up sharply, settled at the back of the pack in the early backstretch, then rallied from the inside on the far
turn and into the stretch and came up empty in the end. IMPLICATOR pursued the pace while four wide and outside of rivals down the back stretch, then bid
on the far turn and lacked rallying in the home stretch. HARD GOLD tracked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, was thru after the half and
needed rally in the end.

Footnotes
SILVER ASSASSIN tracked the pace from the inside into the backstretch, was nicely rated on the far turn before digging in gamely to split rivals in the upper
stretch, gain command and held on well in the final yards to prevail in the end. HE'S CHARMING was bumped at the start, then saved ground in the early
furlongs while racing towards the back down the backstretch and into the far turn, angled out four wide at the top of the stretch and closed willingly down the
lane to be up for the place prize. GHURAIR'S WARRIOR pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then moved up to duel with the pace setter
leaving the far turn, was outbid by SILVER ASSASSIN in the early stretch and battled for the show position in the final yards and was up at the wire.
MOVEN VAN led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, was confronted by an outer foe on the far turn to duel
briefly at the quarter then was out finished by SILVER ASSASSIN in the home stretch and missed the show prize in the end. MORO TRENDSETTER
bumped inner rival at the start, then settled at the back of the field along the rail, rallied mildly in the homestretch while drifting out and came up empty in the
end. TITO settled at the back of the pack while two wide, then came out four wide leaving the far bend to bid in the stretch and was no threat.
UBSINGINTHEBLUES stalked the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then bid mildly on the far turn to no success and flattened out in the
stretch. DEVITO was no menace. RIDDLE ME THAT was unhurried early then pulled up in the early backstretch and walked off in the end.

Footnotes
BLING BABY veered inwardly at the the start, then settled along the rail while in a steady hand ride, fanned out five wide leaving the bend and edged past
the field in the late stretch while drifting in and was up in the final strides to prevail. INDY LA PRIMERA chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then
shifted to the two path, dug in gamely to spit rivals in the upper stretch and closed well with an outer foe in the end and was second best. BLUEBONNET
GIRL broke inwardly and bumped foe, then chased the pace while three wide into the turn, rallied in the upper stretch, steadied slightly while steering clear
of a drifting rival then kept on for the show position in the end. STACY'S PRINCESS was bumped by an outer foe, then pressed the pace while two wide,
inched up to duel with the pace setter on the turn and into the early stretch then was out finished in the end. HONEST hustled to the front to lead the pack
from the inside, then sparred with an outer foe on the turn while in a hard drive, then gave way in the stretch. DOC'S JOY was impeded at the start, was
unhurried early, then bid mildly from the inside on the turn and needed more in the end. SLICKLICKOFALIVING bumped foe at the start, then chased the
pace while two wide and between rivals into the turn, bid in the upper stretch and lacked responding in the end. QUIET MELODY bumped inner foe at the
start, bid briefly then settled back and failed to rally.

Footnotes
AVAILABLE STAR laid off the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then bid while two wide on the turn, shifted to the three path in the upper stretch,
split rivals and found the best stride in the late stretch to be up in time to claim victory. JACKMAN'S RIDE was bumped at the start, then sparred with an
outer rival down the backstretch and into the turn, gained command in the upper stretch, was in a long drive then was caught at the wire and was second
best. ESPIONAGE chased the pace from the inside while maintaining third position down the backstretch and into the turn, menaced in the upper stretch
and was closing in on the leader but was out finished and held the show prize in the end. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE was unhurried early, then rallied leaving
the bend and kept on down the lane to no avail in the end. PUDDING was allowed to settle while two wide down the backstretch, then bid from the inside on
the turn to rally mildly in the stretch and needed more in the end. PICKENS jostled at the start, then settled along the inside down the backstretch, drifted out
five to six wide leaving the turn to bid in the stretch and came up empty. LOVE MY JIMMY bumped inner foe at the start, then duel with said rival down the
backstretch and into the turn while in a hard drive, was used up and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
VICTORY FOR VETS bid for the lead between rivals then settled back and laid of the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then inched up leaving
the turn to gain second position in the upper stretch, dug in gamely to spar with TURN NORTH in the final sixteenth and was up at the wire to prevail. TURN
NORTH dueled with an inner foe down the backstretch, then gained command at the top of the turn to lead the way into the early stretch, was challenged by
VICTORY FOR VETS in the final yards to duel grudgingly and hung at the end. TEAM GORMLEY dueled from the inside down the early backstretch before
taking command at the half to lead the way briefly, then pressed the emerging leader on the turn, could not retain bid and gave way in the stretch and held
onto the show position in the end. MY BUDDY MEL chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace then rallied leaving the bend and needed more in
the stretch. LIL SWEET THANG was unhurried early, then moved up from the four path in the late backstretch to bid on turn and lacked rallying in the
stretch. MISTER MONTE CARLO hit the gate at the start, chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the turn, was
depleted and tired in the late stretch. There was an INQUIRY following the race. After review no change was made to the order of finish.
