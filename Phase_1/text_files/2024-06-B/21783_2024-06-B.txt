three deep, vied turning for home, dueled with an inner rival in the four path through upper stretch, wrestled an advantage in midstretch before an outer rival
joined the fray in the final furlong, drifted out while getting headed by that one at the sixteenth pole, fought on gamely thereafter but was bested.
BROWNSTONE was hustled forward after breaking a beat slow, vied inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, shifted out to the three path while dueling in
upper stretch, sustained the battle through midstretch but yielded with a sixteenth to go. PED D'ORO tracked along the inside, came under strong urging

FURIOUS ANGER bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, came under urging as an outer rival moved alongside turning for
home, drove past the inner leaders along with that one at the furlong grounds, sparred gamely while continuing to hand on his left lead in the late stage and
narrowly prevailed. FUNNY UNCLE transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, took a brush from an inner rival into the first turn,
tracked four wide, ranged up quickly outside of the leaders turning for home, bid in the six path entering the lane, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch,
dueled with an inner game rival leaving midstretch before an outer bidder menaced in the final sixteenth, and got outfinished while saving place. SPECIAL
DISPATCH leaned in and bumped a rival leaving the gates, got floated out to the six path into the first turn, tucked to the three path while pulling at the rear
of the field around that bend, tugged and steadied behind foes nearing the backstretch before settling into stride, swung out to the seven path to take widest
aim entering upper stretch, slowly closed in on the top pair in the final furlong to bid in the late stages but missed. LAUGHINALLTHEWAY was hustled to
prompt along the inside early on, vied for the lead around the far turn, shfited to the two path entering the lane, but yielded to outer rivals leaving upper
stretch. FIRST PLAYER was bumped between rivals and took back from crowded quarters at the start, got rank and brushed an outer rival while steadying
into the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, tracked the leaders from the two path around the far turn, took aim inside of them in upper stretch
but lacked a rail kick. WEST COAST CRUISER set the pace outside of a prompting foe, vied with that one around the far turn, then weakened between

Footnotes
U DEVIL YOU brushed the gate whlie breaking a beat slow, then stuttered a step soon after, advanced tucking four to three wide into the turn, sustained
progress floating to the four path entering the lane, rallied up to the leader at the furlong grounds and drew clear, then dislodged his rider in the gallop out.
EIGHTY WEST bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, took aim in the two path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival
approaching the furlong grounds, ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole and narrowly saved that position from an outer bidder at the wire. JIMMY'S
DAILYS dropped back after a fair beginning before steadying at the half mile pole, checked remaining under strong restraint well back along the inside into
the turn, pursued from the two path around the bend, encountered traffic in upper stretch before shifting out inside the three sixteenths pole, moved out to
the six path in the final furlong and offered a late surge to miss place at the wire. PERFECT FORCE chased two wide, entered the lane in the three path,
drifted inwardly in upper stretch and ran on mildly between horses late, then dislodged his rider in the gallop out. BRIE'S IN TOWN sped clear early on,
showed the way into upper stretch, but was caught by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and gave way. HAWIJA stalked two wide, but was outkicked by
rivals on either side in upper stretch, then kept on. EL PRESTIGIO was fractious loading, bumped with an inner rival at the start before taking contact from
an outer foe shortly after, pursued from midpack along the inside, got put to tight quarters by an outer rival leaving midstretch and gave way. STIGLETS
bumped an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. JACK'S PROMISE dropped back early on, became
detached from the rest approaching the turn and showed little.

TWIRLING TROILLET was briefly fractious in the starting gate, prompted outside of the leader, vied two wide while between rivals around the turn, led in
hand entering the lane in the three path, then held well between bidders in the late stages. JON'S STREET BAND was off awkwardly, tracked two wide and
between horses, split foes as the leader inched ahead in upper stretch, bid inside of that one at the furlong grounds but was kept at bay. CHULLIGAN
stalked three wide, applied pressure around the turn, chased in the four path in upper stretch, kept on to sustain striking position through the final furlong but
needed more late. PUCKSTER laid off of the pace in the three to four path, pursued in the five path in upper stretch and moved up. KALL KARL stalked
along the inside, chased into the lane, shifted out leaving upper stretch but yielded. TIE BREAKER LENNIE set a pressured pace along the inside, led
narrowly from a pair of outer rivals around the turn, got headed entering the lane in the two path and weakened. WEEKEND FLAME was outrun along the
inside.

SHOW TIME brushed with an outer rival leaving the gate, tracked in teh four path, took aim on the new leader from the five path entering the lane, ranged
up to bid and gain an advantage in upper stretch, then held sway from his persistent inner counterpart through the final furlong. FLAT ON stalked the leader
from the three path, bid turning for home before forging an advantage entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder's bold challenge in upper
stretch, fought on doggedly through the late stages but was bested. DUAL MONARCHY prompted along the inside, stalked turning for home, shifted to the
three path into upper stretch, gained place while wandering about and hanging on his left lead at the three sixteenths pole, then failed to threaten the top
pair and was best of the rest. TIVERTON brushed with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed two wide, shifted to the three to four path around the turn and
moved up in the lane. EAST FROM WEST laid off of the pace in the five path, tucked to the three path with three furlongs to go and failed to factor.
MERLOTTI was outrun along the inside. EXTRA HALO showed the way in the two path, but got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and stopped.

Footnotes
LAURA'S CHARM brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide, pursued from the five path in upper stretch, sustained gradual progress to bid
for the lead in the final sixteenth, drifted out and forged an advantage late. ALTERED SHOT set the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path into upper
stretch, gamely held sway between bidders into deep stretch, but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. KRISPY RICE prompted two wide, failed to
maintain level terms entering upper stretch in the three path, yet sustained pursuit as an outer rival ranged up alongside in the final furlong, drifted out briefly
in the final sixteenth, got outkicked and narrowly saved show. PANAMA RED (IRE) stalked forwardly along the inside, committed to a rail charge aiming
inside of the leader in upper stretch, but lacked the needed punch and missed show at the wire. SARA MIA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to
the two path leaving the three furlong pole and chased willingly through the lane. ALL I WANT IS YOU tracked four wide, fanned to the six path into upper
stretch, shifted wider in the final furlong and ran on. KENDAL GRACE broke slowly, raced at the rear three wide, but got rank and steadied into the turn,
tucked behind foes turning for home and failed to factor. QUALY brushed with an outer rival a the start, pursued from the two to three path while among foes
off of the pace and faded.

Footnotes
CULPRIT pressed two wide, bid in the three path approaching the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, but lugged in and flopped back to his left lead at the
sixteenth pole, got collared by an outer bidder in the closing stages yet held. BOURBON SOCIETY stalked in the three path, pursued under urging in the
four path around the far turn, chased teh clear leader into midstretch, closed in as that one wandered entering the final sixteenth, sustained late bid but
hung. STAR TOPPER saved ground off of the pace, advanced inside of rivals entering the lane, surpassed an inner foe to gain show in the final sixteenth
and lasted. PADIDDLE was reluctant to load, got antsy momentarily in the starting gate, lunged subtly at the break, chased from midpack in the three to four
path, ran on mildly along with an outer rival late and missed show. HAIZUM raced at the rear in the three path, improved in the four to six path turning for
home, then stayed on willingly but needed more to reel in show. CARNITINE showed the way along the inside, met an outer challenge while turning for
home in the two path, got headed in upper stretch and faded. D'ORO LEMON lacked speed two wide and failed to factor. TAPIT'S TALE tracked along the
inside and faded. TORNADO ROAD made little impact along the inside. IN WRITING broke a beat slow, pursued from midpack in the four to five path and
weakened. IN SPEIGHT OF WHAT showed little.
