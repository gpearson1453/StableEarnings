Footnotes
KEY STROKE stalked in the two path inside in the early going, gaining a nice position by the half mile marker watching the engaged trio on the backside,
started to move in closing the gap at the three eighths marker, bid for the lead in upper stretch and drew off in the final furlong. HAYEK had the lead at the
start, relinquished the front in the first turn, assumed command again into the backstretch, set the pace while pressed at the half, began to edge away from
the early speed rivals by the three furlong marker, was then headed by the winner in mid-stretch, offered little resistance but did stay on to best the rest in
the end. ORIGINAL ME sat alone tracking the leaders in the front turn, pressed the pace with runners on both sides along the backstretch, was asked for
more, keeping pace on the rail in the final turn, at the quarter pole was checked on the fence and determinedly re-rallied late to be a clear third at the finish
line. MORE GELATO was brushed inside on the break, pressed outside at the start, took command in the first turn, lost position when reined back entering
the backstretch, was roused at the three furlong marker, made a mild run four wide on the far bend and was one paced in the stretch for a minor role.
BLONDE DYNAMO stalked between horses in the three path on the first turn, could see the compact field sitting on the rail along the backside, was
scrubbed for more five sixteenths out, lacked a response, angled out to the four path and had little to show for the drive to the wire. BAREFOOT
SERVANTU broke out brushing rival on the start, stalked four wide into the first turn, pulled the rider around horses to prompt outside down the backstretch,
could not keep up to the pacesetter when urged right handed midway on the final turn and folded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
VEERY shadowed the pace outside in the backstretch, continued to hound the frontrunner around the turn, poked her head in front between rivals at the
quarter pole and determinedly held off the outside challenger down the stretch to prevail at the wire. FOREST DRIFT had a nice set up, sitting just behind
the engaged duo around the turn, moved out to bid three wide outside the pacesetters turning for home, dueled the length of the stretch but could not go by
the stubborn winner. KITTEN'S ROMANCE stalked outside along the backside, began to lengthen her stride three furlongs from the wire, finished with intent
down the stretch and closed in smartly on the leaders by the time they crossed the finish line. SILENT GUROO had a slim advantage on the rail down the
backside, continued to lead setting brisk fractions on the fence through the turn, was collared outside by rivals at the quarter pole, could not go on with the
top pair running down the stretch and faded late to settle on the fringes in the end. SPIDER BELLE broke a step slow to begin, was unhurried to trail outside
in the early stages, offered a mild run four wide straightening out for home but lacked a rally in deep stretch. DIOSA CATRINA sat alone in mid-division
throughout the turn, sitting behind the top three who were setting a quick pace, was roused at the top of the lane but had little finish to offer inside rivals to
the wire. FRANKIE'S GIRL stalked near the rear inside down the backstretch, made no impression saving ground around the oval and could not get
involved driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
STRIKE A CHORD was away alertly to seize control from the start, continued going well up front setting the fractions through the turn, had no competition
coming at her down the lane, was kept to the task and held safe for the win. CLARAYOUTHEBEST trailed on the rail down the backside, began to pass
runners on the rail midway through the turn, shifted out, off the rail in the two path by the quarter pole, split foes in upper stretch extended her stride and
closed in to get up at the finish line for second in a photo. TAVALINE was content to watch the loose leader dictate the pace along the backstretch, chased
the frontrunning winner in vain through the turn, continued to be scrubbed on but could not reel in the leader through the lane and weakened late to just lose
the nod for place at the wire. SUPER SICILY was brushed inside on the break, tracked outside rivals down the back straight, made little headway while
under a ride around the bend and finished up evenly for a minor role in the end. ROSIEPOSIE tracked inside along the backstretch, was roused on the rail
throughout the turn keeping pace with the leaders, could not find more at the top of the lane and faded on the fence in mid-stretch. EGBERT J brushed the
inside foe at the start, stalked outside horses near the rear, could not offer a rally three wide outside runners when asked around the turn and passed a tired
one in the stretch. I'M TENACIOUS stalked close to the back of the pack between runners in the beginning, was roused with rivals on both sides but could
not advance through the turn and could not get involved in the stretch running.

HAVE IT MY WAY broke outwardly bothering a rival and steadying, recovered to stalk from outside mid-pack on the turn racing three then four wide, ground
on steadily in the stretch to take command by the sixteenth pole, drove clear. WAR EMPIRE settled tracking the leading pair from inside saving ground
through the turn, came out at the top of the stretch with aim, took the lead in mid-stretch but was outfinished. WELLER GREEN was forced out a bit at the
start, settled into stride toward the rear outside, shifted six deep in upper stretch, ran on for show honors. APOPHIS settled between runners early, moved
up to mid-pack inside a foe but off the fence through the turn, came out five deep in upper stretch, needed more. RAYMORE saved ground inside but was
never near enough to threaten. BANKINGONAMIRACLE set the pace inside, gave way in the stretch. WYOMING BILL was ridden along inside but lacking
speed, failed to threaten. ALPHA MEISTER hesitated at the start spotting the field several lengths, raced outside and failed to rally. LUMBERYARD was
forced out and steadied slightly at the start, moved forward to press the pace racing three to four wide and outside on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
INSCRUTABLE stalked on the rail in the third flight down the back straight, waited patiently inside behind runners with nowhere to go midway on the final
bend, finally had clear running room in the three path at the eighth pole and was full of run late, bursting between horses just before the wire to get up for the
score. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY was situated on the rail, being part of the mix up top into the first turn, travelled on the fence contesting the pace inside with
two other rivals down the backstretch, put away the early speed foes by the three eighths marker, opened up around the far turn, was clinging determinedly
to the lead at the furlong marker and just missed holding off the surging winner at the wire for the win. BRAQUET was in tight when runners were angling in
soon after the break, tracked two wide outside horses in the first turn, settled smartly outside measuring the trio up front down the backstretch, rallied three
wide three furlongs from home, loomed in the three path at the top of the stretch, was gaining with each stride but it was not enough to threaten in the end.
HURRICANE GIZMO travelled in the third flight outside down the backstraight, moved three wide around foes at the midpoint in the far turn, angled five
wide for the drive and had good late energy to get up for a minor role in the end. QUEEN GYPSY tracked on the rail in the first turn, settled behind the
contesting threesome down the backstretch, waited for room around the far turn, shifted out off weary rivals at the quarter pole and finished up one paced
through the lane. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY was unhurried to trail into the first turn, still could see the field down the backside and passed the tiring early speed
foes down the stretch. KATHERINE'S GEM forced the issue between runners in the early stages, was asked on the rail three furlongs from home to keep
going, had nothing left to offer and backed away on the fence turning for home. SECRET GIZMO pressed the pace three wide in the first turn, continued
prompt the lead three deep outside along the backstretch, could not keep up by the three eighths marker and retreated between runners in mid-stretch.

NEXT PITCH tracked from inside, shifted three wide at the top of the stretch, edged past after a lengthy drive. JAGGERSGOTAGUN forced the pace inside,
was worn down late. SPEEDEEMAN hit the gate, swung seven wide turning for home, ran on with mild late interest. THE NEW MAYBE had the very early
lead, ceded that advantage content to talk, was encouraged along three furlongs out racing outside, came into upper stretch four to five wide, kept on.
MONDAY MORNING exchanged a bump at the start, raced off the pace and off the rail two to three wide, kept on evenly. SWERVIN MERVYN shifted in,
saved ground on the turn, went evenly. PROUD RONIN raced outside foes five to six wide into upper stretch, faltered and faded. HELLO LADIES raced off
the pace and off the inside, came out in upper stretch, failed to threaten. JAVA POWER bumped with a foe at the start, raced off the inside and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
SILKEN DOLLAR took command from the onset, set a modest pace while left alone down the backstretch, continued to ration out her speed when nursed
along up top around the turn and when asked for more in upper stretch responded well to keep rivals at bay to the finish line. WICKED MERCURY was
content to sit behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, began to creep closer around the oval, chased the winner in vain down the stretch and
stubbornly held on for the place share at the wire. VERI GIZMO stalked three deep outside foes rating kindly along the backside, moved boldly in hand
around runners four wide midpoint on the turn, loomed the threat in the four path turning for home but could not gain on the winner who had something left
for the drive. HAY HAY PAULA travelled in midfield with horses on either side down the backstretch, was encouraged right handed midway on the turn and
showed good late interest to rally three to four wide down the lane to capture a small piece of the prize. LADY MOONSHINE was nestled on the rail in the
second flight down the back straight, waited behind runners onside on the turn, had a clear lane inside at the top of the stretch but could not offer a rally.
SOCIETY'S KAT settled three deep in mid-pack down the backside, offered a brief run at the three eighths pole, angled out five wide straightening out for
home but could not pick up rivals down the stretch. BIJOU BABY was shuffled back slightly to see the field at the half, made no gain three wide outside
horses running around the oval and could no be a factor outside driving to the wire. ANAM CARA co-trailed on the inside early on, saved ground making
little progression around the bend and had nothing to offer in the drive to the finish line. SOUPER SINCLAIR co-trailed on the outside in the beginning, was
scrubbed between rivals making no headway through the turn and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LOON CRY was allowed to settle near the rear in the early going, began to pick up runners five wide outside at the top of the lane, was full of run shifting
outwards in the seven path for the drive and went on by the lead group at the sixteenth pole for the victory. PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) was under a snug
hold in mid-division on the rail, was throttled down behind foes at the three furlong marker, tried for a seam outside at the top of the late, had no room,
shifted inwards by mid-stretch, weaved through horses driving in the three path at the three sixteenths marker, burst between runners going to the rail at the
eighth pole and won the nod in a three way photo for the place result. TAQUANYAH tracked the front pair travelling outside horses down the back straight,
closed in on the leaders through the turn, was in the hunt five wide turning for home, dueled for the lead at the furlong marker and settled for a share of third
money in a tight finish at the wire. ENGLISH SHIRL pressed the pace inside at the beginning, was reined back to watch the frontrunner down the
backstretch, moved in to bid four wide at the quarter pole, briefly poked her head in front in the stretch and battled to the wire to be involved in a tight photo
for the place share. PEMBERLEY travelled outside foes in mid-pack through the turn, rallied four wide at the three eighths pole, shifted out to the six path to
be in range at the top of the lane, could not sustain the run and stalled in the final sixteenth. SARATOGA VISION was ahead of only the poor starter down
the back straight, closed the gap on the rail through the turn, was caught behind a troubled foe coming up to the eighth pole, lost all momentum and tried to
re-rally in deep stretch. QUEEN MACHA broke outwards, hitting the gate causing the rider to lose his right iron for a brief moment, trailed the field down the
backstretch, continued to be well back through the turn and passed the troubled rivals down the stretch. CAHIRA'S BLESSING was hustled from the outer
post to get to the rail for the lead by the half, opened up on the pack travelling around the bend, was hanging onto the lead at the top of the lane, was
engulfed by runners at the three sixteenths marker, checked on the rail when in tight nearing the furlong pole and gave way. SPEED TRAP tracked the top
pair inside running around the turn, was in range behind the leaders in upper stretch, had to be steadied between rivals nearing the three sixteenths marker
and could not recover to pose a threat at the finish.

HAWKESBURY had a slim lead entering the backstretch, improved his advantage by the half mile marker, was unopposed loose on the lead through the
turn and was kept to the task to win comfortably when crossing the finish line. RAFAROO was unhurried trailing on the fence, began to pass foes on the rail
three eighths from home, shifted out three wide at the quarter pole with run, and closed in belatedly finding a seam in the four path travelling down the
stretch. AMERICAN DECISION stalked near the rear in the early going, was hard ridden three wide going the wrong direction with three furlongs remaining,
resurged widest outside horses in the six path straightening out for home and finished up well to capture third money in the end. TUTTI CONTENTI
prompted the pace outside leaving the chute, tracked the leader down the backstretch, was urged right handed chasing the frontrunning winner with horses
on either side at the quarter pole, faded at the furlong marker in the three path and stayed on to re-rally, coming back to get a minor share at the wire.
SPECIAL ELEMENT travelled on the rail in midfield, took closer order on the fence midway on the turn, battled for the place share at the furlong marker but
yielded in deep stretch losing placings late. STRETCH PASS was situated three deep in mid-pack outside foes along the backstretch, made a brief rally
around horses three wide three furlongs out, could not continue the run in the five path between rivals at the top of the lane and folded through the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
CREVALLE D'ORO was patiently handled on the fence in the third flight down the backstretch, continued to wait for her cue on the rail in the turn, shifted
out when asked left handed four wide at the furlong marker, rallied smartly and caught the leader in deep stretch to edge clear at the finish line for the win.
GOLDEN CANARY was content to follow the frontrunner down the back straight, closed the gap on the turn to bid three wide on the outside two furlongs
from home, poked her head in front between horses at the eighth pole but was caught by the stablemate in the final seventy yards and had to settle for
second money. BOLT ENOREE seized command from the start, dictated the pace around the turn, was collared outside by the quarter pole, dueled for a
furlong but was no match for the top two and finished up being a clear third in the end. PRIMA tracked the front duo inside for the first part of the race,
angled four wide at the quarter pole to be in the hunt for a share and finished up evenly to settle on the fringes at the wire. PEGGY ran between rivals three
wide close to the back of the pack down the backstretch, settled outside in the third flight around the oval, shifted inwards at the furlong marker to the two
path and was one paced to the finish line. MIRAMICHI travelled in midfield three deep in the early stages, kept pace outside foes through the turn, was in
range for a piece of the prize five wide in upper stretch, could not find another gear late and gave way at the furlong marker. FOURFIFTYFOUR trailed four
deep while in hand along the backside, made no progress two wide outside a runner around the bend, shifted out to the six path for the stretch run but could
not get involved. MASTER ARAGORN stalked on the rail near the back, saved ground making no impression through the turn and could not offer a rally
inside down the stretch.
