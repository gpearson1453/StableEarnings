Footnotes
RUNNIN' BLOCK bid to contention before half a mile, took over at the quarter pole and rallied clear in the stretch. I'M NOT A BABY settled close up outside,
went after the winner on the turn and was easily second. SURFBOARD moved close up outside, was asked for run on the turn then came again for the
show. INSIDE SECRET set the pace for five furlongs then gave way. BADBADBOBBY steadied along inside on the first turn then was finished after half a
mile. EXCLUSIVE ORDER lagged far behind and was never a factor. BOINTHEBACK lacked speed and failed to respond.

NEW COMMISSION moved close up inside, angled out into the stretch, led into the lane and edged off driving. DARK TIMBER set a clear pace to the
stretch, resisted when collared and continued gamely. SOUPER FLY OVER lacked speed inside then finished willingly through the stretch. ENFORCER
dropped far behind then offered some late energy. FAST BOB lagged far behind then narrowed gap near the inside. RUNNING RIVER prompted the pace
four wide down the backstretch and faded. DADASHEV outrun early, moved extremely wide into the stretch. SHADOW BOX flashed speed outside and
began weakening on the turn. PARDSY hustled close up three wide to midway on the turn and gave way.

KOKOPELLI GIRL led under pressure inside, repelled challenges and drew away in a drive. NEZY'S GIRL broke poorly and raced far behind then advanced
with a late rail bid. SHE LOVES MUNNY outrun early, was blocked and altered course near the top of the stretch. CHANCE OCCURRENCE prompted the
pace four wide, bid at the quarter pole then faded. GO CHLOE GO lacked speed then passed rivals late without menacing. BE MY QUEEN pressed the

DIVINE GRACE alternated for the advantage inside, lost the lead then came again to get the nod at the wire in a determined score. KISS ME HARDY raced
in close pursuit of the dueling leaders, faded then came again just missing. BOSSYNESS prompted the pace outside, led narrowly in the stretch but was
nailed from both sides late. MAGNIFICENT PEARL dropped back outside, moved very wide on the final turn and no factor. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE
