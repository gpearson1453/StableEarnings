Footnotes
COLD PLUNGE mid pack, gained a short lead on the two path through the second turn, shook clear inside the sixteenth pole, then drew off in the final
yards. LUCIOS ZORAN sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then could not match strides
with the winner, while clearly best of the rest. BLUE SOLDIER well placed, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide
into the stretch, weakened and held the show. MR. YASUDA improved his position, inside. MAGNUS EFFECT fractious in the gate, drifted out into the first
turn, stalked the leader to the second turn, then drifted out widest and faded. BUNDABURG broke a step slowly from the gate and was never involved.

to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, fanned three wide into the stretch and closed well for the place, while no threat to the winner.
REINVEST rated tracking the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong and held
the show. REAPPLY hopped at the start, gained position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong.
UNCLE KENNY well placed and between, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

Footnotes
DIANTHUS set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, drew off through the second turn, then was kept to task in the lane. LITTLE MISS
MUNNY unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled three and four wide, then made a
steady gain, edged up for the place and held. MO CHAT hopped slightly at the start, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch,
made a steady gain and missed the place. TALONNADE rated back early, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and got up for a share. LYRICAL PARDON tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch
and flattened the final furlong. PEACH PASS stalked the pace on the outside, then faded on the two path through the second turn. LOYAL ROYAL hopped
slightly at the start, moved up quickly outside, lost some ground three wide through the second turn, then had no rally.

THE CONNECTOR mid pack, moved up and came through inside into the stretch, edged ahead inside the furlong marker, shook clear, then lasted under
steady pressure. GREY CHARMER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled four wide, then
drifted in gaining and edged up for the place late. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF well placed and outside, moved up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into
the stretch and evened out the final furlong. SPICY SHOT mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had a mild
late gain. FUEL THE BERN stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, edged ahead at the
furlong marker, then flattened. NO NAME DUDE set the pace off the rail, drifted in slightly into the stretch, steadied and faded. GET HAMMERED was never
