Footnotes
SIR LANCE sped clear early and secured the inside, was joined from his outside by REAP WHAT YOU SOW leaving the far turn, handled the pressure to
mid stretch, shook clear while drifting out a bit and under a drive nearing the sixteenth marker, corrected and held firm. DUCKPINS tracked to the inside of a
trio of rivals, worked outward for the final furlong, kept on grinding and was up for the place. REAP WHAT YOU SOW moved up outside of the winner
around the far turn, vied for command into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch, remained on his left lead and gave way grudgingly. CASSIUS , off the pace
while saving ground, eased out leaving the three sixteenths and closed steadily between rivals. EVENLY DIVIDED saved ground off the early pace, edged
up towards the inner rail in mid stretch then flattened out very late. CHAT BLANC , taken to rate soon after the break, stalked two wide between foes, failed
to kick on under pressure leaving mid stretch and faded. WEMBY broke a step slow, lost ground five wide moving up into the turn, dropped in a bit and
chased outside a foe mid turn then failed to drum up a stretch rally. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND , three wide between rivals stalking the embattled leaders,
lacked a punch nearing the furlong grounds and weakened. BOX N BEN , a bit sluggish from the break, edged up four wide outside runners leaving the half
mile marker, remained four deep around the turn and weakened. CATCHING STARS , off the pace and outside a rival mid turn, failed to respond.

ENEMYNUMBERNINE , sluggish leaving the starting gate, advanced three deep on the turn, secured the lead approaching the stretch and drew off under
steady handling. ENKINDLE saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in upper stretch, swung out in mid stretch and gained the place. STORM
CREED chased the pace in the two path around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. SWEET HONEY BEE showed speed along the inner rail to the
eighth pole and gave way. LUCKY HONEY stayed in the two path on the turn and was no factor. TWISTY RIVER , fractious behind the starting gate,
hugged the inner rail down the backstretch and weakened on the turn.

Footnotes
ALWAYS FUN , keen from the gate, secured the inside and disputed the pace with SIN PERMISO, drew on near even terms around the far turn, dueled
inside a pair of rivals from the three eighths, spurted clear under a ride soon into the stretch, eagerly widened past mid stretch and maintained a safe
advantage while kept alert. DYNA POINT , between runners near the five eighths, was pushed along three wide past the five sixteenths and into the lane,
worked outward past the three sixteenths then finished up nicely through the final sixteenth to gain the place. NORTHERN RYE dropped in early, tracked
the leaders while saving ground into the far turn, had aim off the three pronged duel past the five sixteenths, eased out three to four wide soon into the lane,
chased between runners leaving mid stretch then flattened out a bit late. STORM FORCE settled off the pace and towards the inside, worked between
runners near mid stretch, shifted in and kept on with effort. FORCEFUL drafted back off the pace, raced three wide nearing the lane, offered a belated
response but failed to menace. FOURONEOHSMOKESHOW leaned in and bumped with FIRE AND KNIVES leaving the gate, raced off the pace, came five
to six wide for the drive but failed to generate a serious run. FIRE AND KNIVES , bumped at the break, moved up four wide past the half and spied the
leaders, chased, wandered very wide in upper stretch and faded. SWEET TRAVELS , three wide early stalking the pace, bid three deep into the far turn,
dueled under pressure to about the quarter pole, stayed on with pursuit past mid stretch then weakened. SIN PERMISO vied outside the winner while
holding a short lead through the backstretch run, dueled between runners from the three eighths to the quarter pole, lacked a response past the three
sixteenths and weakened. MARTY'S MAGIC , taken to rate early while saving ground, raced forwardly into the far turn then faded.

MATTITUDE , bumped soon after the break, set the pace outside SINKIWINKI, turned for home three wide then drew off while kept under pressure the final
furlong. BRZINA , jostled soon after the break, circled the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and rallied. LADY ZETA caused a chain reaction when
bearing out sharply soon after the break, bumping and forcing out WINKIWINKI. She then hugged the inner rail, was well positioned in mid stretch and
flattened out. WINKIWINKI , bumped and forced out soon after the start, saved ground on the turn prompting the winner, drifted to the two path entering the
stretch and weakened. MAMA G'S WISH , bumped in the chain reaction soon after the break, stayed well off the rail on the turn and failed to rally. There
was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
BARZINI broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and pulled his way forward then shadowed the leader into the turn, took over while well within
himself mid turn, kicked clear into the lane, opened up under left handed encouragement in mid stretch then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept
alert. GREAT IDEA broke a bit slow then settled off the pace while saving ground, edged up into the lane then was blocked near the three sixteenths, eased
out past mid stretch then closed gamely between runners to nab the place. HAD TO HAVE HIM had speed then steadied back off the leaders early on,
stalked inside, was stalled leaving the three sixteenths, eased out then back in and finished up willingly inside rivals. GOODBYE NOTE , off the pace while
removed from the inside, was held a bit between foes nearing the lane, shifted outward past the three sixteenths then finished up well between foes.
BENNY HAVENS , bumped and steadied back at the break, drafted back off the pace while saving ground, worked well out in the course through the final
furlong and finished with good energy outside runners. TALL ORDER was steadied off heels near the half, angled out mid turn, moved up four wide to be
the closest pursuer in mid stretch, chased past the sixteenth marker then failed to sustain. UPSIDEDOWN MAN , taken to rate off the pace, circled four to
five wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GREAT HEAVENS , bumped at the break, moved up and stalked three wide mid turn, lacked a punch in upper
stretch and weakened. ONE WAY TRAFFIC broke outward and bumped with a rival, sped to the front and set the early pace towards the inner rail, was
hounded by the winner leaving the far turn, ceded to that one near mid turn, chased in upper stretch then tired.

Footnotes
FREEZE THE FIRE showed speed inside horses leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn while disputing the pace with IRISH WARLOCK,
brushed with that one in upper stretch and drove clear. CARVELLIAN QUEST hugged the inner rail around the turn while stalking the pace, swung outside
in upper stretch and rallied. IRISH WARLOCK dueled outside the winner around the turn, brushed with that one in upper stretch and weakened late. DIVINE
CHILD stumbled soon after the break, circled horses on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. QUINCANNON , in the two path
stalking the pace around the turn, gave way in the drive. AUGUSTINE RED saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and
failed to rally. ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS , three deep on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. JAY raced in the two path on the turn and
was no factor.

Footnotes
MS. BUCCHERO stumbled at the break spotting the field a couple lengths, regrouped and accelerated between rivals heading towards the half mile marker,
stalked the embattled leaders under some coaxing mid turn, ranged up four wide under strong handling to take over near mid stretch then steadily edged
away. MALIBU BEAUTY prompted the early pace four wide outside HAPPY CLOUDS, was guided inward into the turn and sparred with that one three wide
into the lane, battled between foes near mid stretch then stayed on willingly to nab the place. HAPPY CLOUDS sped to the early lead while well off the
inside, drafted in towards the inner rail into the turn and set a pressured pace, dueled two wide and to the inside of MALIBU BEAUTY into the lane, drifted
out leaving mid stretch, corrected and gave way grudgingly. DECO STRONG , off the pace while outside a rival, lacked a serious response. I'M GITTIN
THERE was steadied soon after the break, saved ground and came up empty.
