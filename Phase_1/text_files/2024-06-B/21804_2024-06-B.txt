on the far turn, bid in early stretch but couldn't close late. GO TOWN vied three wide, bid on the far turn, was clear but gave way. NO PARDON rallied in the
four path at the three-eighths pole and faded in the stretch. TOTAL HEART stalked the early pace in the five path, bid on the far turn, was checked in early
stretch and lost momentum. WELL AWARE raced evenly. GOOD LOOKING vied inside to the stretch and gave way. SEVILLA trailed inside. LA JENELLE
vied in the two path and lacked a late bid. MRS CHOFIS was off awkwardly and steadied early, stalked the pace in the four path and gave way on the far
