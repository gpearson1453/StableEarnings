BIG FIG was well placed off the pace while racing three wide, advanced through the turn and engaged the leader at the quarter pole and drew clear.
VIOLENT RIVER raced near the back through the turn and circled the field from four wide at the quarter pole for the late rally to be second best. WILLIAM
GUSTAVO sprinted to the lead from the two path to the half mile marker then shifted in around the turn but was headed at the quarter pole, gave way and
held the show. PARTYINTHESTREETS raced in the middle of the pack from four wide down the back stretch, saved ground around the turn but failed to
menace. COLT'S BRIM pressed the pace from the inside to the nine sixteenths pole then shifted out to the two path and continued to press the pace to the
quarter pole and tired. PRINCE SIMBA was void of speed and trailed.

Footnotes
STAND PROUD was in tight going onto the main track and had to steady slightly then moved up from three wide at the half mile marker and kept on to drive
past the leaders and the quarter pole and drew off. BRIARTOWN broke outward leaving the gate then rushed up to press the pace from two wide and
engaged the leader at the three furlong marker, matched strides outside of CLASSY SHIPMAN to the top of the stretch but couldn't match strides with
STAND PROUD and proved second best. COUNTY JUDGE saved ground from off the pace through the turn then angled out to four wide at the top of the
stretch and made a late run but was not enough. CLASSY SHIPMAN went to the front to set the early pace then was headed at the three furlong marker but
continued on to match strides inside of BRIARTOWN to the top of the stretch and weakened. ALL SAINTS was in tight going onto the main track and had to
steady slightly then shifted out to three or four wide and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
BEYOND THE HYPE tracked the leaders from two wide around the first turn while under wraps, then moved up to engage the leader at the three furlong
marker, took command midway through the final turn and was kept to task in the drive. ZING was allowed to settle while trailing the field to the half mile
marker then move up from four wide through the turn for a rally but had to fend off the late outside rival to hold the place. IZEONPOINT saved ground from
off the pace to midway through the final turn then angled out to four wide in upper stretch and finished strong to miss the place. MY MY was unhurried while
racing on the inside through the turn then went three or four wide in the stretch while showing late interest to improve position. SASSY SAGEY went to the
front to a clear lead to the half mile marker then was eclipsed midway through the final turn and tired. FROSTY FLIRT was forwardly placed down the
backstretch moved out to three wide on the final turn, tipping out to five wide in upper stretch but gave way. QUINN MURPHY went four wide into the first
turn and raced in the middle of the pace from three wide and dropped back on the final turn.

NIGHT ORB hustled away from the gate and raced off the early pace, moved up to engage the leader going into the turn and took command midway
through the turn, drew off to prove best. SAVANNAH'S HERE rushed up the rail to prompt the pace kept on racing up the inside and gave a late kick to be
second best. TIZ SWEET CANDY rushed up from between horses to take the early lead but was engaged going into the turn vied for lead around the turn
but floated out in upper stretch and kept on but was outfinished by inside rival. XTRA SPICY chased the leaders from two wide then moved out to four wide
around the turn and gave a late kick to improve position. DEROUTANTE chased the leaders from the inside to the turn then angled out to three wide but
was out kicked late and failed to menace. THE RAGE OF ART trailed the field to the turn then went four wide in upper stretch but was not a threat. SWEET
SLEW raced near the back to the turn then dropped back and was not a factor.

HOWIT HAPPENED chased the leaders to the turn then angled out to five wide at the quarter pole for a rally and closed willing to draw clear. DARIO raced
off the pace on the inside down the backstretch then moved out to two wide on the turn, moved between horses at the top of the stretch and battled inside of
COACH SAM P and outkicked that one. COACH SAM P shared the command from two wide to the quarter pole then matched strides outside of DARIO
while fighting gamely but was outkicked in the final furlong. CADILLAC COWBOY was within striking distance from three wide to the top of the stretch but
was outfinished by the late closer and an inside rival but proved best of the rest. CHIEF HARLAN was fractious in the gate, raced near the back down the
backstretch then moved up from two wide on the turn and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly. FLYHERBFLYHIGH saved ground
while racing in the middle of the pack then made a milde bid on the turn and flattened out. ALL IN GOOD TIME rushed up to share the command from the
inside to the quarter pole and gave way. WILDCATS'S MEOW trailed the field and was not involved. MALIBU MONEY raced in the middle of the pack from
three wide down the backstretch then dropped back.
