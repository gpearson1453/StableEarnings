Footnotes
SPANKERBOOM pressed six wide and among foes into the turn, forged an advantage tucking three wide at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in the two
path in upper stretch and held sway from a pursuing rival through the final final sixteenth. BOOK'EM prompted three wide and between horses, but checked
back when in cramped quarters into the turn, regained pursuit from off of the pace in the three path, swung out to the six path picking up stride entering the
lane, rallied and lugged in while surpassing inner rivals through midstretch, gained place at the sixteenth pole, sustained progress on the clear leader late
but was kept at bay. CITIZEN JUDY broke a step slow at the start, chased seven wide into turn turn, sustained pressure tucking four wide turning for home,
but chased an inner rival while hanging on her left lead in the three path in upper stretch, then lost place to an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and held
show. ROSATO led four wide into the turn, got headed by an outer rival while tucking two wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, yielded between horses
entering the lane, then shifted out and kept on. MEUCCI'S REVENGE prompted along the inside, chased outer rivals into the lane and gave way. JEWISH
MOTHER raced forwardly five wide and among foes in the skirmish into the first turn, settled in pursuit and tracked from the three path around the bend,
entered the lane in the four path, altered course outwardly from behind rivals leaving upper stretch, but lacked a bid. BAYTOWN CLEOPATRA broke out at
the start, advanced nine to eight wide and outside of foes into the turn, achieved striking range turning for home, but faded between horses in upper stretch.
PREYATHOUSANDWORDS prompted two wide and between horses early on, but failed to sustain position and steadied out of crowded quarters entering
the turn, pursued along the inside turning for home and failed to factor. MOOCHIE GIRL trailed in the three path and showed little.

Footnotes
SHERBINI chased forwardly along the inside, was roused two wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, shifted outside of the top pair and to the
four path turning for home, shifted in while rallying in upper stretch, bid outside of the leader inside the final furlong, drove past at the sixteenth pole and
cleared. STRONG STATE steadied at the start while an outer rival shifted across his path, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path in
upper stretch and offered a strong finish to reach place late. DARE TO BREEZE brushed an outer rival at the start, rushed between horses to reach the
front tucking to the two path entering the turn, shook free of an outer presser entering the lane, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge in the final
furlong then lost place late. ISLAND RIDE stalked outside of rivals, moved forward to press the new leader from the three path into the turn, failed to sustain
pressure entering the lane, got floated inwardly while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and gave way. FLAMING GLORY led early on, but
took back while getting headed by an outer rival into the turn, chased along the inside turning for home and faded. BISA leaned into an inner rival at the
start, laid off of the pace in the five to seven path and failed to menace hanging on her left lead. HUIXTLA failed to factor from the four path. PRINCESS OF
OMAHA broke slowly, lagged well behind around the turn, rejoined the group in upper stretch, shfited out and surpassed tired rivals. TALKSALOT lacked
speed along the inside, got subtly shuffled turning for home behind a faltering foe and made little impact. TIFFANY was brushed between horses at the start,
pursued from midpack in the four to six path and weakened. THE FEISTY ONE was tough to load then antsy in the starting gate, raced forwardly two wide
and between horses briefly, but faltered entering the turn.

ON MY HONOR brushed an outer rival at the start, stalked the to pair from the three to four path, sustained grinding progress slowly closing in on the leader
in the final furlong and edged past in the late stages. ZECA DIABO took light contact from an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide, led in the three path
entering the lane, drove clear in the final furlong but was caught by an outer bidder late. WICKED MELODY raced at the rear along the inside, shifted to the
three path in upper stretch, rallied to gain show in the final sixteenth and needed more late. DU MONDE broke a bit out at the start, raced towards the rear
in the four path, drifted to the six path into the lane, then ran on in the final furlong. BEBEDOURO set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from an outer
rival around the turn, got headed by that one entering the lane, fought on through midstretch but weakened with a sixteenth to go. LORD DIAMOND broke
slow, recovered to stalk behind the leaders and from the two path, but tired through the lane.

Footnotes
YOUR SO SILLEA broke a bit out at the start, prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, gained an advantage whlie well in hand entering the
lane in the four path, drove clear in upper stretch and held from an inner late challenger. NOM DE PLUME pursued from midpack in the three path, split foes
launching a rally in midstretch, progressed to bid inside of the leader in the final sixteenth but was denied. DAZZLING BLUE stalked the top pair from the
four path, came under urging in pursuit with three furlongs to go, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then sustained a chase of the clear leader while
lacking progress in upper stretch, lost place to an inner rival leaving the furlong grounds and was best of the rest. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT broke a step
slow while last away, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the three to four path in upper stretch but failed to threaten. AMERICAN BAND trailed
in the four to six path and failed to factor. CONDENSATION chased forwardly along the inside but gave way. QUICK MUNNY set the pace inside of a
prompting rival, got headed by that one entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
REBEL RED (GB) tracked three wide, then from the four path around the far turn, rallied to close in on the clear leader in the final furlong and reeled in that
one late. ROCKY JOY set the pace along the inside, led from a pair of pressers around the far turn, shook clear of them while well in hand entering the lane,
was set down in midstretch as an outer rival began to close in, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and was worn down in the closing stages.
ENGLISH CHUNNEL bumped with an inner rival at the start, saved ground at the rear, rallied surpassing outer rivals in upper stretch, sustained progress
three wide in the final sixteenth and reached show at the wire. COWBOY CACHE brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, pressed turning
for home, chased the clearing leader in upper stretch, got outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, yielded and lost show between bidders at the wire.
VERY SATISFACTORY stalked along the inside, chased the clearing leader in upper stretch, kept on late and missed show at the wire. SUGAR HOOK
prompted two wide and between horses, sustained pressure around the far turn but gave way in upper stretch. CLOUDY HOLIDAY saved ground in
midpack, shifted to the three path entering upper stretch, but drifted out under left handed urging leaving the furlong grounds and yielded. FREEDOM
MAKER settled off of the pace along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, shifted further out into the lane and failed to menace.
CABERNAYDO lacked speed in the two to three path, swung to the seven path into the lane and made little impact. PACE YOURSELF brushed with an
inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three to four path before shifting to the six path entering the lane, then lacked progress before steadying
when an inner rival drifted across his path leaving the furlong grounds and tired. FIRST BID leaned into an outer rival at the start, tugged forward between
horses into the first turn, tracked two wide and between horses, came under a drive around the far turn and faded. OVER AND OLLIE broke a step slow,
trailed two wide and got outrun.

MOTORCADE was floated out by an inner rival at the start, prompted the leader from the three path into the turn, forged an advantage turning for home,
drove clear and shifting out in upper stretch, then held sway through the final furlong. TRUE JEDI broke a step slow, pursued from the three path, shifted out
to the five to six path into upper stretch, ran on well to edge place but needed more. SHUFFLE DANCE stalked along the inside, was roused to the two path
turning for home, moved between horses entering the lane, vied with outer rivals for place through midstretch but was bested. TAGLIATELLE tracked from
the four path, vied for place between horses in upper stretch but yielded. PICO D'ORO raced at the rear along the inside, shifted to the three path into upper
stretch and failed to menace. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY broke out at the start, set the pace inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but was headed with
five sixteenths to go and weakened.

LUGAN KNIGHT trailed along the inside, sustained grinding progress inside of rivals to bid leaving the sixteenth pole, and forged an advantage in the
shadow of the wire. TRIPLE ELVIS bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, led from an outer pair of pressers around the turn, held
sway through midstretch, but met an inner challenge at the sixteenth pole and got bested. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY stalked in the five path, pressed the top
pair from the four path around the turn, but chased an inner rival in upper stretch, kept on but needed more late. TRUST DADDY bumped an inner rival at
the start, stalked in the four path and between horses before chasing those rivals around the turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a
bid. SQUIRE CREEK took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, prompted the leader from the three path and between horses, but yielded in upper
stretch.

CANDY MAN ROCKET brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked from the three to four path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied to forge an
advantage passing the furlong pole, kicked clear, then was taken off of the track in an equine ambulance. FORT WARREN took light contact from an inner
rival at the start, stalked the top pair form the four path, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch as an inner rival shifted into his path, yet ran on
willingly thereafter to edge place leaving the sixteenth pole. CHATTALOT led two wide and between horses early on, cleared his inner counterpart before
maintaining an advantage from his outer rival around the turn, inched free in upper stretch, but was swiftly surpassed by an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds, gave way yet narrowly saved show at the wire. PRO OXIDANT trailed in the three path, shifted in while staying on in the final furlong, sustained a
late inside bid for show but missed. MACRON laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path at the three furlong pole, drifted wider in upper
stretch and failed to menace. INVULNERABLE prompted along the inside early on, chased an outer pair into the turn and faded. INSOLITO prompted three
to two wide into the turn, drifted back to the three path entering the lane and weakened between horses while delaying a lead change.

Footnotes
YELLOW CARD brushed rivals on both sides and took back from between them at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, surged between
horses in the final furlong and kicked clear. ZARTOWNIS tracked along the inside while a path off of the inner rail around the turn, ranged up to attempt a
bid inside of the leader leaving the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, vied for place thereafter and prevailed.
MONSIEUR CANDY showed the way remaining multiple paths off of the inside around the turn, maintained a margin from bidders on either side leaving
midstretch, but was swiftly outkicked by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole, vied for place through the late stages but was denied. INFLATION NATION
(IRE) brushed with an outer rival at the start, pressed the leader from the four path, sustained pursuit through midstretch, but was outkicked by inner rivals
passing the furlong grounds and lasted for fourth. COMMITTEE OF ONE laid off of the pace in the four to five path, then ran on to miss fourth. POLSTER
tracked in the three path and between horses, entered the lane in the four path and chased evenly between horses. LINZER stalked in the five path and
gave way. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD brushed with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. MACKVILLE bobbled at
the start, trailed in the five to six path and got outrun.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT AMBITION chased from the three to four path, ranged up to bid in upper stretch and drove clear. HALLELUJAH HARRIS trailed in the two to
three path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to gain place late. LUCCHESI vied three to two wide, inched clear entering the lane, but
offered little to no resistance to an outer challenge leaving upper stretch and lost place late. CAJUN CRUISER laid off of the pace along teh inside, shifted
two wide in upper stretch and stayed on. BAULE DEL TESORO laid off of the pace in the four to five path, then chased through the while lacking a bid.
LOBO SALVAJE vied along the inside, gave way nearing the lane and faded. BLOOD BROTHER lacked speed in the four path and failed to factor.
KEYPAD saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. GUATAPE prompted two wide and between horses early on, chased them from within striking
range in the three path around the turn, but faltered between horses. BECKSTER chased from the two path and weakened. GUN SHOW briefly dislodged
his rider behind the gate, stalked outside of the leading trio early on, but weakened in the six path around the turn.
