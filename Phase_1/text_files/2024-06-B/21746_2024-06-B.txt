Footnotes
ACTION SEEKER pressed the pace around the first turn then took on the outside challenge of RABBIT HOUND entering the backstretch, vied for the lead
into the far turn, shook free near the furlong marker, dug back in approaching the wire when RABBIT HOUND came back on and just lasted under a driving
finish. RABBIT HOUND was forwardly placed from the onset then moved up to challenge ACTION SEEKER for the lead leaving the first turn, vied two wide
up the backstretch, continued to battle around the far turn, could not move on with ACTION SEEKER near mid-stretch, then dug back in gamely, edged
back up approaching the wire and just missed. GREY STORM raced in contention around the first turn, then tracked the pace up the backstretch, headed in
pursuit entering the far turn, edged closer on the embattled pair, came three wide into upper stretch and sustained a steady bid. VALIANT WEST settled in
the back through early stages, was ridden three then two wide in the stretch and had no response. PROMISE CODE held a slim lead around the first turn,
got collared entering the backstretch, chased the top pair to the far turn then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
ROCKIN BOOTS held a slim lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled inside of EDGY LOVER around the far turn, shook
free turning for home, held a slim lead and held late under firm handling. EDGY LOVER was forwardly placed entering the backstretch, moved up to
challenge ROCKIN BOOTS near the half mile marker, vied two wide around the far turn, could not remain on equal terms at the head of the lane, but stayed
on determinedly, edged back up late but failed to get by. SASSY B KEEN was well reserved racing in the back, made a move mid-way around the far turn,
gained closer contention, came three to four wide into the stretch and ran on to clear the rest. CAN'T BE CAUGHT rated off the clear top trio up the
backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn, ran on into the lane but failed to make an impact. TACTICAL REBEL raced off the top trio in the
opening quarter, settled off the pace up the backstretch, urged around the far turn but had no response. COUNTY JAIL raced off the pace and saved
ground to no avail. OXFORD OUTING showed early response then retreated around the final turn. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE OPENING
QUARTER WAS HAND TIMED

SHUT UP MAN set the pace up the backstretch, shook off the bid from MILTON STREET at the quarter pole, saved ground entering the lane and drew off.
MILTON STREET raced up close through the backstretch, moved up to challenge SHUT UP MAN for the lead at the quarter pole, could not move on with
rival but sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE raced off the pace, saved ground, hustled up along the rail around
the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, ran on and secured a share. NASTY EXAGGERATOR raced off the clear top trio up the backstretch, chased
four wide through the lane and lacked a needed rally. SHIP BOSS raced up close through the backstretch, flattened around the turn and continued to
weaken in the lane. ESPE'S GUY failed to move into contention.

DREAMIN IT UP pressed the early pace, vied outside of rival around the turn, shook free upper stretch, continued to fend off the inside running KASA and
held clear. KASA tracked the early pace, waited for a clear path on the rail near the quarter pole, cut the corner and launched a bid entering top stretch,
roused forward into close contention but could not reach the eventual winner. SHEZAWILDSTORM raced in contention through early stages, raced three
wide off the top pair going by the quarter pole, hustled along into the lane, sustained bid and secured a share. BEAUTIFLY TROUBL'D set a pressured pace
through early stages, vied inside of DREAMIN IT UP around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner nearing the furlong marker and flattened out.
INCA STROLL raced three wide in range, failed to kick on four wide under pressure around the turn and had no late response. FIREBAUGH raced near the
back, chased four to five wide into the stretch and never threatened. QUIET I'M NOT raced in or near the back, came four wide into upper stretch and had
no response.

Footnotes
MISS PEACH sat back off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung into action five wide entering the stretch, responded gamely when
called upon and swept by late. DEMIDANU tracked the early pace racing between rivals, hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained bid into the final
furlong, dug in gamely between in final strides and captured place. ADDABABY vied inside of WON HAPPY MAMA up the backstretch, shook free turning
for home, widened to a clear advantage a furlong out, failed to be a match when the winner swept by late and got edged for place in final stride.
OURPEPPERMINTCANDY raced three wide in contention up the backstretch, roused for more near the quarter pole, came four wide into upper stretch, ran
on with response and just missed show. SHEMEANSBIZNESS raced in range along the inside, flattened a bit along the rail mid-way around the turn, cut the
corner entering upper stretch, ran on along the inside and had no kick. MY GOLDEN DAY raced in the back, swung five wide into the stretch and had a mild
improve without threatening. WON HAPPY MAMA vied with ADDABABY up the backstretch and around the turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and
steadily weakened. ROCKETS SISTER raced off the early pace, saved ground, shifted out three to four wide and lacked a needed rally. INTERSTELLA
raced off the pace, came three to four wide into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
CHARTER OAK was forwardly placed from the onset, moved up mid-way around the turn to challenge for the lead, took charge two wide entering top
stretch and drew off to an easy score. SAILOR CHOW raced in early contention, moved up three wide racing in tandem with CHARTER OAK mid-way
around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner turning for home, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. FULL AUTHORITY raced in
range along the inside, ran one paced around the turn, shifted out near the quarter pole, hustled along three wide into the lane and gained a share. GRAND
DESIGN was ridden along three wide into the turn, stayed on four paths wide into upper stretch and needed more to threaten. LOVER BOY sped to the lead
at the start, led the way then took on an outside pair of rivals mid-way around the turn, got collared for the lead turning for home, ran on to the furlong
marker then came up empty. LODE OF BLARNEY raced up close through early stages, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
CANDY'S LITTLE TIP raced in the back throughout.
