ATTA BOY LLOYD was bumped at the start by FUN CITY then rushed up to open a clear lead before going a quarter mile while racing removed from the
inside rail and maintained a safe advantage. PRAYFOROURCOUNTRY was unhurried while racing four-wide on the turn and closed strongly for the place.
FUN CITY broke out and bumped with ATTA BOY LLOYD then was allowed to settle, moved up three-wide on the turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole
and was gaining late. CHANCELLORS BOOM chased ATTA BOY LLOYD into the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened late. QUAIL saved ground
while being reserved off the pace but lacked a rally. WEDNESDAY AT SHADY settled in the middle of the field while two-wide but failed to seriously
threaten.

Footnotes
OWHATARUSH vied with MANGIA PANE for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off nearing the quarter pole and gradually increased his
advantage. VERITAS AEQUITAS was allowed to settle early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole but was unable to threaten the winner while
finishing well for second. MANGIA PANE vied with OWHATARUSH for the lead from along the outside to near the quarter pole and held on fairly well during
the drive for third. LUKA GRAZIE was unhurried early, moved closer nearing the quarter pole while four-wide but lacked a v=rally when asked. QUAGMIRE
MAGIC dropped back early while saving ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESS HEKAWI bobbled at the start then was allowed to settle, lacked room nearing the half mile pole, split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole then
moved up quickly to take the lead nearing the quarter pole and edged clear late. ASK ALICE saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed
nearing the quarter pole but was unable to stay with the winner late in a game effort. ANOTHER TEN was off a step slow then saved ground while racing
close-up, lacked room from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths pole then angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished willingly.
SPARKLE IN THE SKY prompted the pace while racing three-wide into the stretch and weakened. VHAGAR saved ground while being unhurried, slipped
through entering the stretch then angled out nearing the eighth pole and improved position. LADY OF THE RIVER was prominently placed while racing
five-wide on the turn and tired during the drive. PHOENICIAN MAGIC was forwardly placed while racing four-wide and gave way late.

Footnotes
DELTA DELTA dueled for the early lead with MONGOLIAN SPRING and SOLDATNA from between horses, continued to duel with SOLDATNA to the wire
and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. SOLDATNA disputed the issue throughout while racing three-wide and just missed in a determined try. PURE

lead to the quarter pole from along the inside and weakened. SIR LOOKING GLASS was unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch and went evenly.
