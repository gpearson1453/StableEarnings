HARBOR OF GOLD was well rated early and two wide on the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane and made a bid to kick away in the final
furlong to prove best under a drive. MINTENON was bumped at the start, settled early and saved ground on the turn, then was up for the place on the
inside. MR. REDOLFO was bumped at the start, settled early in between rivals, two wide on the turn and then angled out nearing the furlong marker and
finished well to just miss the place award. ONE TRUTH dueled for the lead on the outside and was two wide on the turn and then came three wide off the
turn to make a bid but faded in the final sixteenth. UNCLE REMI ran with no front shoes, dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid nearing the
quarter pole but faded in the final furlong. WESLEY THOMAS was settled early on the outside, came wide into the lane and had no rally.

EXTREMELY GRUNTLED set the pace on the inside and was well handled, shook clear on the far turn and then drew out leaving the turn and then
remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. AMERICAN SAINT was settled early two wide, split rivals by the five eighths marker, then moved to the
inside on the far turn and finished willingly on the inside to be clearly second best. MAXIMO MADNESS prompted the early pace three wide, then was two
wide on the turn and then came three wide off the turn and chased the winner and weakened in the final furlong. UPTOWN CHARLY GIRL chased the early
pace on the inside and then dropped back on the turn, then came again late to get the last spot in the superfecta. ZIPPY DO DA DAY was bumped after the
start, chased the pace three wide and tired. JET SPIN was settled three wide early, then moved to the inside on the far turn and tired in the final furlong.

OVER AND THUNDER set the pace on the inside, then shook away on the far turn, then dug in by the furlong marker and held sway late to prove best
under a drive. FORECLOSURE was rated along early, made a three wide move on the far turn and was slowly gaining in the final furlong but could not get
to the winner s. BERMONDSEY stalked the pace three wide, then was ridden along two wide leaving the five sixteenths and then kept on to the wire but
needed more, bested others. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was wide on the first turn, then settled on the outside and never threatened. JADE'S DREAM was
bumped at the start, then reserved on the inside and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BACK FORTY was away alertly but well rated two wide, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and took over off the turn and was given two pops left
handed by the furlong marker with the crop and responded well to draw off smartly to prove much the best. COULD BE A COUGAR tracked the pace on the
inside and made a mild bid off the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for the place award. TURN ON THE CHARM was settled
early, two wide on the turn and cvame two wide off the turn and finished willingly to best the rest. LADY LIGHTFEET set the pressured pace on the inside
and shook clear by the quarter pole but weakened in the final furlong. MOONSAFE was off a step slow, settled back on the inside and had no rally.
SIDESWIPED was settled early on the outside, came five wide off the turn and was not a threat. EMPRESS DEONA was off a step slow, rushed up to press
the pace three wide and then was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SPINNING MUSICIAN stalked the pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid on the far turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then drew off in the drive
after one pop right handed nearing the furlong marker and then drew off while being ridden out. BEE BY THE SEA set the pace on the inside and was
headed by the five sixteenths and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. SHANGHAI CANDY was four wide into
the first turn, settled on the outside, four wide on the far turn and faded while saving the show award. THE GREAT CASBY was settled early, between rivals
by the half mile marker, three wide on the far turn and faded. MERU was reserved on the inside and failed to menace. SAMURAI SAINT tracked the pace
on the inside and tired.
