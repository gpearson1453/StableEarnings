GUCCI BOY jostled at the start, then tracked the pace while three wide into the first turn, remained nicely rated down the backstretch, then was encouraged
on the far turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch, took over the lead in the final sixteenth and held on well to prevail in the end. RUN BRYCE RUN saved
ground in the early stages while racing at the tail of the field, then came out four wide leaving the far bend and found the best stride in the late stretch to get
up for the place prize in the end. GREAT BARRIER reserved ground in the early furlongs while racing towards the back, then angled out three wide leaving
the bend to rally bid in the stretch and closed well for the show prize. YOUNG POPE raced from the inside towards the back early, then moved up between
rivals to bid on the far turn while two wide and kept on down the lane while in a mild rally just missing the show prize in the end. BRILLIANT SPIN was
forwardly place in the two path into the first turn, then stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up to duel with the pace setter on the far turn, gained
command at the eighth pole, drifted in towards the rail then was out finished in the end. DINERO DE LA CASA moved along the inside into the first turn to
set the pace down the backstretch, was confronted by an outer foe to spar on the far turn and into the early stretch, was in an all out drive, steadied slightly
then gave way in the end. LEAR raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, then bid on the far turn and lacked rallying in the home stretch. T D
TWELVE veered outwardly at the start, then raced mid pack while three to four wide down the backstretch, bid on the far turn then lugged out in the upper
stretch and stopped. REBEL RYDER was no factor.

FIRE SWORD battled for the lead while three wide, gained command leaving the turn then drew off in the stretch to prove best in the end. PINKY RING
BLING saved ground early, then fanned out six wide leaving the turn and closed belatedly to best the rest of the field and be up for the place prize.
MONGOLIAN BEE vied for the lead while two wide into the turn, continued to pursue the emerging leader in the upper stretch while in an all out drive then
was out finished in the end just missing the place position. POMEROY HAZE was off slowly and settled along the inside, then bid while leaving the bend
from the five path and closed well down the lane for the show prize in the end. PRIZELESS was rated close behind the leading trio while four wide, then
rallied bid leaving the bend and kept on in the late stretch and just missed the place position in the end. YANKEE INDIAN vied from the inside into the turn
while in a hard drive, then gave way in the lane. CLUE broke slightly outward, then chased the leading trio from the inside into the turn, could not find room
heading into the stretch, shifted outward and rallied bid to no avail in the end.

BIZZEE CHANNEL broke outwardly and brushed rival, then raced from the inside mid pack in the early furlongs, remained rated on the far turn, came out
two wide in the upper stretch, dug in gamely to gain command at the eighth pole, then drifted out and lasted to the wire. SALINE RIVER saved ground in the
early stages towards the rear of the field, was encouraged on the far turn, angled out three wide in the upper stretch, rallied bid then checked up avoiding
drifting leader and kept on for the place position. CARLEA'S DREAM tracked the pace from the inside and in third position down the backstretch, remained
well rated on the far turn while two wide, then rallied bid from the four path in the upper stretch and held onto the show prize. SILENCE D'ORO broke
outwardly, then bid for the lead from the two path to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn, was contested by outer foes in
the upper stretch and gave way in the end. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT was bumped at the start, was unhurried early, then rallied leaving the far bend but it
was too little too late. INTERSTELLAR was brushed at the start, then contested for the lead from the inside into the first turn, stalked the emerging leader
down the backstretch and into the turn, rallied bid from the outside at the quarter pole, could not overpower the leader and flattened out in the stretch. DUST
EM settled towards the back while three wide then bid mildly on the far turn and never threatened. JOSH'S DREAM was forced outwardly by a drifting rival
and bumped another and was no factor. There was an INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of SALINE RIVER claimed foul
against the rider of BIZZEE CHANNEL for inference in the late stretch. After reviewing the replay, BIZZEE CHANNEL was disqualified and placed second
for drifting out and impeding SALINE RIVER.

Footnotes
EQUUS stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, took over the lead at the top of the turn while under coaxing, then drew off in the late stretch
to prove best overall. HONOR CAT was reserved in the two path towards the back of the pack, was in a steady drive on the turn to rally in the stretch while
four wide, gained second position in the upper stretch but could not catch the cleared leader. BLUE HEAVENLY was bumped at the start, then chased the
pace from the inside down the backstretch, was in a steady hand ride on the turn before rallying in the stretch to get up for the show position in the end.
CURLIN'S MAGIC veered outwardly, then tucked along the inside towards the rear down the backstretch, rallied bid on the turn while two wide and lacked
the needed response in the lane and came up empty. MARQUEE LADY was bumped at the start, then pursued the pace while three wide down the
backstretch, urged steadily on the turn and came up flat in the stretch. METHODS raced at the back of the pack along the rail, then bid in the upper stretch
while three wide and never threatened. FLYIN WITHTHE BOSS broke outwardly and bumped rivals, was unhurried early, then rallied on the turn while four
wide, steadied slightly then flattened out. ANNA UP set the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was overtaken at the top of the turn by an outer foe,
