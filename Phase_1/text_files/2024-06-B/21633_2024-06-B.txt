strong handling. MARCUS JUNIUS prompt the early leader from the outside, dug in late to hold the place position but was no match for the winner.
STAVROS set a pressured early pace and weakened through the far turn. OROCOVIX raced two deep near the quarter pole, angled out to race off the
inside in the drive and was even with no closing run. UNXPECTED TIGER dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced five to six wide into the upper
stretch and had no late rally. HE'S ON FIRE raced four wide around the first turn, raced three wide around the far turn and had no response. OILER had an
inside run to race to the inside of rivals and lacked a bid.

CORINNA rated along under a hold near the rail down the backstretch, shifted out three deep and finished well to prevail under strong handling.
GLOSSAMER stalked the early pace between rivals, altered over fallen jockey near the quarter pole, waited for racing room near the eighth pole, shifted out
a path and finished gamely to the wire. LOUISE BROOKS was squeezed back at the start, raced off the early going after the poor start, raced four wide in
the stretch and moved up to improve position. HAZELMOOR BEACH was bumped at the start, stalked the pace mid pack, raced four wide near the three
eighth pole, was five deep into the upper stretch and even late with no closing run. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY dropped back early on, raced three to four
wide around the far turn and had no late rally. TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK rated along near the rail under a hold and began to faded through the far turn.
AMORE MOON saved ground and never threatened. ARGENTINA GIRL raced two wide between around the far turn and had no response. HEARTBURN
tracked the early pace, raced three wide, took bad step near the quarter pole, jockey lost balance and was unseated. RECOGNIZE ME showed good early
foot, raced near the inside in the stretch run, raced in tight quarters near the sixteenth pole, clipped heels and unseated its jockey. A stewards inquiry was
filed to review the fallen jockeys and no action was taken. Photo finish margins estimated from tape delay due to photo finish malfunction.

PUDD'N N PIE stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole and finished strongly to edge away under
pressure. RAPID RUBY dueled for the early lead near the inside, kept on but was no match for the winner. CATALINA CRUZIN was off slowly, raced along
the inside around the far turn, angled out and moved up to improve position. AMIRATI raced two deep near the quarter pole, shifted out six wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. KAPADOKYA dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and faded. The photo finish was estimated by tape
replay as a photo finish malfunction occurred.

Footnotes
MCMAGIC trailed the field around both turns, started his attack nearing the quarter pole, stayed well outside rivals nearing the eight pole, surged to victory
in the final jumps. BAD HENRY four wide and off the pace around the first, remained outside rivals down the back side, picked up the tempo nearing the
quarter pole, put in a strong bid in upper stretch, and fought on gamely to the wire. COUPERIN chased from the two path around the first turn, sweeping
move around the far turn, held a slim lead leaving the furlong marker, finished willingly along the inside through the wire. THENAME OF THEGAME slow
into stride around the first turn, steady urging along the inside around the far turn, weakened through the stretch. DUKE OF DOOLY sprinted clear around
the first turn, controlled the tempo into the far turn, and gave way under pressure nearing the three eighths pole. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN urged along in
the two path around the first turn, came up empty through the lane. STEVIE T raced middle pack around the first turn, saved ground into far turn, outrun
late.
