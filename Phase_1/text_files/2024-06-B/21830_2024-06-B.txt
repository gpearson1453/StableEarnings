drew clear late under a strong hand ride. TOUR THE MOON bobbled the start, was well back, moved to the five path and rallied on the far turn, then surged
late but couldn't get to the winner. KINGSBURY ROAD stalked the pace in the three path but couldn't close late. SILENT SONATA was bumped at the start,
was unrushed early, rallied inside on the far turn and drew even at the three-sixteenths pole before faltering. GOLDDIGGENDEVIL was bumped at the start,
stalked the pace in the four path but had no late bid. BACKYARD JUSTICE saved ground, angled to the five path on the far turn and faded. PRINCE SHIM
broke outward, dueled outside of the winner and gave way on the far turn.
