Footnotes
EMPTY GESTURE seized the lead from the onset, maintained the slim advantage while hounded outside by a couple of rivals on the bend, spurted away
from challengers at the top of the stretch and had more late, to comfortably score for the win at the finish line. VICTORIA ELIZABETH travelled outside four
deep at the half in midfield, moved in three wide outside to force the pace three furlongs from the line, dueled for the lead at the quarter pole but could not
threaten the stubborn frontrunning winner who had something left for the stretch drive. DIXIE MORNING stalked near the rear in the beginning, circled three
wide moving well outside horses at the three furlong marker, loomed boldly in the four path straightening out for home but stalled at the furlong pole to be a
clear third. NOT A LOST CAUSE broke out on the start, prompted the pace four deep down the back straight, vied between rivals through the turn, could not
go on with the leaders at the top of the lane and faded in mid-stretch to hold for a minor role. GET MY DRIFT tracked on the inside along the backstretch,
had good position nestled on the fence watching the contesting trio in midturn, skimmed the rail turning for home but was one paced to the wire and could
not get into contention inside. SPEEDY ESSA had a poor start spotting the field many lengths after the break, rushed up behind a wall of runners into the
turn, had to be steadied sharply and could not be a factor in the running afterwards. YOGA tracked in two path between horses in the early going, was in
tight quarters nearing the three eighths marker, was shuffled back momentarily, made little headway when roused through the turn and was empty in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
THREE SONNY SIDEUP was situated outside foes in mid-division down the backstretch, started to pick up the bit going around horses at the three furlong
pole, closed in to the leaders four wide turning for home, took command under left handed encouragement just inside the eighth pole and was drawing off
smartly for the score when crossing the finish line. ORPHAN HALLIE travelled between rivals in mid-pack in the early going, stalked outside horses in the
third flight around the bend, began to reach for more ground three wide at the quarter pole, swung out to the five path gathering more momentum at the top
of the stretch and rallied late to best the others for the runners up share. FOREST STAR was ahead of only one rival down the backstretch while settling into
stride, stalked on the rail in the third flight through the turn, rallied on the fence at the quarter pole and finished up willingly inside to win the duel for third
money at the wire. HIGHLAND LIFE was in a good position alone watching the top duo set a fast opening quarter, could not match strides when beside the
eventual winner inside three furlongs from the wire and finished up mildly in the stretch to just miss for the show award at the finish line. ALWAYS A WAY
was void of early speed to trail down the backside, still could see the field around the bend and showed some late interest in the stretch to pick up the early
leaders that were tiring nearing the wire. SOUPER RUSH chased the pacesetter down the back straight, continued to try to reel in the loose speedster
around the bend but to no avail, had nothing left to offer at the top of the lane and folded in the three path between runners in the final furlong. KINETIC
STONE was loose on the lead along the backside, continued up front setting a brisk pace around the bend, began to get leg weary on the fence clinging
onto the lead at the furlong marker and stopped in deep stretch.

Footnotes
HELLUVA HOLIDAY trailed the field along the backside, continued to see the pack gathering herself on the turn, began to extend her stride angling out four
wide closing in at the quarter pole, swung out widest for clear run in the five path for the drive, moving well to the frontrunning leader and got up in the final
strides for a well timed rally win. LOADED VIXEN dueled outside in the early going up front, began to edge away from the other early speed rival by the
three furlong marker, opened up on the chasing foes in mid stretch, could not find more late and was caught by the winner who was surging in the final
jump. KAVALA stalked near the rear inside in the beginning, improved on the rail down the backstretch to track the front two into the turn, lacked running
room when stuck behind a trio of challengers at the quarter pole and when clear on the fence in the stretch, willingly ran on the capture the show money.
LIZZIES GIRL contested inside down the backstretch, could not keep pace with the other front end rival by the three eighths marker , continued to fight on
inside turning for home for the place share but tired late between foes and held to settle on the fringes in the end. AMERICAN GAMBLE settled outside
horses in midfield along the backside, started a rally circling rivals three wide around the turn, posed the threat in the three path at the top of the lane, could
not sustain the run and weakened in the final seventy yards. CEFALO was reined back off the contesting pair at the five eighths marker to nicely track the
front duo down the back straight, was asked for more midturn, closed the gap on the leaders but was losing positions to others by the quarter pole and
flattened out at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUCCESS had the early lead inside, ceded that advantage and switched out stalking the leader through the turn, came into upper stretch three to
four wide with aim, gained steadily but gradually under moderate urging taking the lead a sixteenth from home and inched away late. DETERMINED FURY
was prominent early, soon led about the nine-sixteenths, moved clear past the half setting the pace from off the rail, was challenged in mid-stretch, dueled
then yielded grudgingly while second best. WARP RIDE stalked from outside racing mostly four then five wide, fought on to defeat a rival for show honors
but was no match for the top pair. FORESTER'S FORTUNE stalked mid-pack three then four wide, was outkicked for show. FOUR ACES HIGH settled off
the pace racing about three deep into and on the turn, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, ran on. SAILOR'S PASSION was under a hold at the rear
racing off the inside, went about three wide through the turn, was never near enough to threaten. SOULMATE broke a bit awkwardly, moved up inside to
mid-pack up the backstretch, was never a threat. SILENT MIRACLE was ridden along racing off the inside part of the track, faded.

MAXIMUM FIFTY seized command on the break taking this field down the backstretch, extended the margin up top around the bend, was encouraged right
handed at the eighth pole, found more late late when switching leads and held on from a surging rival inside at the finish line. WILDFIRE shifted inside to get
to the rail early, became headstrong in mid-backstretch tugging the rider to be just behind the leaders under restraint, settled down nicely on the rail waiting
to move around the turn, moved in, switching to the inside at the furlong marker but could not squeeze on through on the fence in deep stretch for the win.
SECRET LOAD travelled in mid-division along the backside, kept pace behind the tracking threesome through the turn, shifted to the three path in upper
stretch, drifted inwards at the furlong marker and finished up determinedly, closing the best in deep stretch to capture third money in a photo. MAGICAL
TRICK settled three deep outside foes in midfield, rallied three wide around rivals commencing at the three eighths marker, loomed a menacing presence in
the five path straightening out for the drive, was gaining mildly to the wire but was out finished for the show award. PRIMA hounded the pace outside down
the backstretch, chased the pacesetter with runners on either side midway on the turn, was in the hunt for a piece of the prize in the three path turning for
home but had nothing for the drive. LADY XI trailed the field down the back straight, saved ground but could not get interested throughout the turn, lacked a
rally in the stretch and was not a factor at the wire. TALKING WONDERS was ahead of one rival down the backside, was coaxed for more three eighths out,
made little progress around the bend and had no finish to offer down the stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #6 WILDFIRE AGAINST #1 MAXIMUM FIFTY

TRUEBELIEVE lacked room heading up the backstretch in behind runners and lost ground dropping back toward the rear, was allowed to settle and steadily
advanced on the turn inside, angled five wide in upper stretch, gained steadily, just edged past rivals late. AIM FOR THE SKY stalked three to four wide into
the turn, clipped heels in behind at the three-eighths, bid in upper stretch, kept on between runners but missed. LIGHT THE LAMP was well-placed two wide
stalking the early pace, was forced out by an inside rival at the three-eighths clipping heels and stumbling, recovered and was put to solid urging by upper
stretch shifting back in from three or four to two wide, attempted to split foes nearing the furlong grounds bumping the inside rival and bothering that one, got
through and finished strongly but missed. BOLD RELOAD bumped a rival at the start, was quick to the lead, set the pace from off the rail, faltered in the
stretch. SHEKKY SHEBAZ was bumped at the start, settled off the pace, checked badly and was forced out near the three-eighths, angled eight wide in
upper stretch, was gaining fast but too late. SPITE STORE was off the leaders four to five wide on the turn coming out a bit for the drive, went one-paced
and was not a threat. JAZZ HANDS was strongly urged from the start, tracked up close inside, came out a path abruptly near the three-eighths then moved
back nearer the rail, attempted to bid inside in upper stretch, was bumped and put in tight quarters nearing mid-stretch and steadying just past the furlong
marker, was not persevered with late. COURAGEOUS COPPER bobbled slightly at the start, lacked early speed, raced outside into the turn, was forced out
badly by troubled horses near the three-eighths, fan on. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF JAZZ HANDS AGAINST LIGHT THE LAMP
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY FOCUSED ON THE STRETCH RUN AND AN INCIDENT NEAR
THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE, SEVERAL ACTIONS WERE TAKEN. FOR COMING OUT AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS CAUSING LIGHT THE LAMP TO BE
FORCED OUT AND CLIP HEELS THEREBY CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION AFFECTING SHEKKY SHEBAZ AND THEN COURAGEOUS COPPER,
JAZZ HANDS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SEVENTH AND PLACED EIGHTH BEHIND COURAGEOUS COPPER. THEN, FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH, LIGHT THE LAMP WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED EIGHTH BEHIND JAZZ HANDS. DUE TO THE DOUBLE
DISQUALIFACTION.....THE REVISED OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH IS 2/8/5/4/7/6/1/3

Footnotes
RAT PORTAGE hopped on the break to trail early, recovered quickly travelling four deep outside, pulling the rider past foes along the backstretch to stalk in
mid-division by the half, while in hand, smoothly circled the field three wide on the turn, was full of run in the six path straightening out for home, moved to
the lead at the sixteenth pole and under a hand ride through the stretch drew off when crossing the finish line. CLAYTON hopped then was checked at the
start, trailed the field when carrying his head high at the half mile marker, began to pass rivals two wide outside at the quarter pole, swung out widest
reaching for more ground at the top of the lane in the seven path and one by one went by horses but was no match for the dominant winner at the wire.
GIANT TEDDY broke in to begin, tracked under a tight rein on the rail in the early going, waited to move sitting behind the leaders around the turn, pounced
four wide to bid for the lead in upper stretch, briefly was in front but was no match for the winner at the eighth pole and faded some to lose the place share
late. LIFE IS HARD settled in between horses in mid-pack down the back straight, was roused three furlongs out, but was going the wrong way around the
bend, weaved through rivals smartly in the lane and had a strong late rally but was on the losing end of a three way finish for the place share at the wire.
SPEEDY HANS travelled four deep outside horses in midfield along the backstretch, improved position to track two wide outside foes in the second flight at
the three eighths marker, was urged right-handed by the quarter pole, offered little rally, angled out five wide in the stretch drive but was one paced to the
finish line. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN settled near the rear down the backstretch, saved ground while keeping pace with rivals around the oval, was looking
for a seam just behind the embattled leaders straightening out for the drive, finally had a clear path on the fence at the eighth pole but failed to fire in deep
stretch. BLACKTECA was unopposed, loose on the lead down the back straight, set the pace while hounded outside around the bend, battled on the rail
upfront with two foes to his outside at the top of the stretch, had little left to give down the lane and faltered at the eighth pole. COMPETITIVE TOUCH
stumbled on the break, recovered quickly, while under a snug hold watched the pacesetter along the backside, turned up the pressure outside throughout
the turn, dueled with rivals on both sides in the two path at the top of the stretch, could not find more late and retreated at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
RELOAD'S RASCAL tracked in behind off the leaders, lacked room from the five-sixteenths till the top of the stretch having to tap on the brakes twice,
angled four wide at the three-sixteenths, took command in mid-stretch and powered away. HUNT MASTER eased back off the leading pair early, stalked
those two from outside, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on late to secure the place over. POULIN IN O T , who forced the early issue from outside,
dueled till the stretch, kept on but needed more. ESKIMINZIN settled last but one, advanced outside four wide on the turn fanning six deep into upper
stretch, evened out in the late stages. BOSTON TEA PARTY contested the pace from inside foes on or just off the rail, weakened. OLYMPIC RUNNER was
outpaced early, swung seven wide, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MEDIA SENSATION tracked on the outside in the early parts of the race, moved in three wide at the quarter pole when scrubbed on, edged closer on the
outside in the four path by mid-stretch, was urged left-handed switching aleads at the sixteenth pole, found another gear late and got up in the final strides
for the score. GREAT FACES prompted the pedestrian pace down the backside, dueled two wide on the outside on the final bend, fought on stubbornly
bobbing heads for the lead between horses down the lane, for a brief moment had the lead in deep stretch but could not hold off the winner at the wire.
GREEN FLEET took this field into the first turn crawling up front, set a soft pace while hounded outside down the backstretch, battled on the fence clinging
to the lead inside around the final turn, stubbornly dug in at the top of the lane with horses on both sides but gave way grudgingly nearing the wire and
settled for the show money in the end. H C HOLIDAY settled all alone in midfield in the early stages of the race, was nudged to go after the lead pack with
five sixteenths to go, swung five wide for the drive, kept on trying to the finish and got up late for a minor share at the wire. STOP THE HUMBUG tracked the
top pair on the rail into the first bend, continued to save ground tracking the contesting duo down the back straight, waited on the fence in the final turn
behind the leaders, was gaining on the inside down the lane to be in the fray up front at the eighth pole, could not find more late and faded in deep stretch.
CUPID'S CLAWS settled on the rail near the rear in the first turn, closed the gap along the backside but could not improve position, was roused three wide
at the three eighths marker making little headway on the final bend, angled out widest in the six path for the drive but made no impact outside runners down
the lane. MAMBOINTHEFOREST trailed the field throughout, could not get interested down the backstretch and finished up with run to pass a tired foe in
deep stretch. MISTER MESEEKS stalked near the back outside in the two path on the first turn, stalked three deep on the outside down the back straight,
