Footnotes
MRS. KATZ pressed three deep from the outside of foes and finished determinedly to prevail under strong pressure. MOR MOR MUSIC set a pressured
early pace two deep and kept on gamely to the wire. AWESOME BECCA hesitated at the start, raced near the back early on, moved up three wide through
the stretch and improved position. BROWNIE BAY was off slowly, raced two deep around the far turn, angled six wide into the upper stretch and showed
good late interest. PRETTY PRAIRIE rated along early, ridden near the three eighths pole and weakened through the drive. MY SOUTHERN GIRL raced
four wide around the far turn and had no response. SURPRISE SUNRISE was off slowly and never involved. CRITICAL VELOCITY was done early and
eased up on through the stretch.

early on and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. ROCKY BOY raced four to five wide around the far turn and moved up. KNIGHT'S GOLD was under a
hard chase, raced three to two wide and was even with no closing run. WHATTA LIFE raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. THE
