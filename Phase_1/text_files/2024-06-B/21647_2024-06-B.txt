Footnotes
PRODIGIOUS BAY showed the way from the inside into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn while being
pursued by rivals, then drew clear in the stretch to prevail while in a strong drive. JIM NED saved ground in the early stages, then bid on the far turn, angled
out to the four path and closed well down the lane while passing rivals and was up for the place prize. BAREFOOT SAMURAI tracked the pace from the
inside down the backstretch, was in a steady drive on the far turn then menaced in the upper stretch and was up for the show position. PROJECTION
tracked the pace while two wide and in second position down the backstretch, then bid gamely on the far turn in attempt to overcome the leader, lacked the
winning stride and gave way in the end. EMBOITE (IRE) chased the paced while three wide, then rallied leaving the far turn while four wide and came up
evenly in the end. OPTIMAL TRIP was allowed to settle towards the back along the rail, then rallied leaving the far turn but it was too little too late. FROM
THE HEART broke outwardly, then was unhurried early and no threat. BAY BE GONE raced in the middle of the two fields along the rail, was in an even
pace throughout the far turn and needed more in the end. GEORGIA DEPUTY was no menace. SINGING DIXIE failed to rally.

CHASING COYOTES tracked the pace from the inside, remained well rated throughout the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn to vie briefly between
rivals, gained command in the upper stretch and drew clear in the final yards to prove best in the end. XANDER S led the way into the first turn from the
inside, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, was confronted by outer rivals to battle at the quarter pole, was in tight, then steadied, re gained stride
and kept on for the place position in the end. EXPECT GLORY raced in the middle of the packs along the inside, was gaining on the far turn while four wide,
vied with inner foes briefly before being out kicked and was best for the show prize. TIGER MAN MCKOOL tracked the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, then inched up on the far to vie between rivals while in a hard drive, could not retain stride and gave way in the end. SIR LANCELOT RIDGE
was no menace. DOC HENRY RIDGE was impeded on the first turn then failed to rally. MUCHO MACHO CAM was unhurried early, was sporadic headed
into the first turn, clipped heels of rival and unseated rider and walked off in the end. There was an INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION, the rider of
XANDER S claimed foul against the rider of CHASING COYOTES for interference in the early stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made to
the order of finish.

RONALDINHO was reserved early, then bid on the far turn while splitting rivals, gained second position in the upper stretch, then sparred with IN FORM in
the final yards and was up at the wire to prove best. IN FORM stalked the pace while two wide into the first turn, gained command leaving the first half,
cleared the far turn, then was challenged by an outer foe to duel in the final yards and just missed victory in the end. MACHO GRANDE saved ground in the
early furlongs while racing at the tail of the field down the backstretch, then came out five wide leaving the far turn, gained third position but could never
catch the dueling leaders and was best for show. ISLAND CABANA raced in the middle of the fields while maintaining third position down the backstretch,
then menaced on the far turn before giving way in the stretch. I AM ON THE LIST set the pace from the inside into the first turn, then was over taken for the
lead by an outer foe heading into the second half and flattened out in the final stages.

Footnotes
BIG UN angled inwards to show the way from the inside into the first turn, was in a steady hand ride while being pressed by an outer foe down the
backstretch, then pulled away leaving the far turn and held sway down the lane to prove much the best in the end. SKYVIEW DRIVE raced in the middle
pack while two wide down the backstretch, then urged steadily on the far turn, rallied in the upper stretch and gain the place position in the final yards.
RUBY FOO was forwardly placed in the two path headed into the first turn to track the pace down the backstretch, maintained third position throughout the
far turn, menaced in the stretch and was best for the show prize in the end. ARMY KITTEN was bumped at the start, was allowed to settle while two wide
towards the back, bid mildly on the far turn, then continued down the stretch to no avail in the end. TAY TAY'S BABY raced mid pack along the rail down the
backstretch, then menace on the far turn and into the early stretch and needed more in the end. MISS DISTINCTIVE moved from the three path into the first
turn to press the pace down the backstretch while two wide, was in a long drive on the far turn, could not outbid the leader and gave away the end.
TAHITIAN BREEZE was shuffled back at the start, then settled along the inside and was no threat. MISCHIEF ANGEL was no factor. CAFEZINHO broke
outwardly and bumped rival, then raced mid pack while three wide down the back stretch, rallied on the far turn, then flattened out in the stretch. EQUUS
was forwardly placed headed into the first turn, was erratic, then dropped back and was no menace.
