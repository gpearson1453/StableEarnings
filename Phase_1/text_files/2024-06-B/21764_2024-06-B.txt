Footnotes
MERRY BLUE away alertly and dueled for the lead through the stretch the first time from the outside of KARDINAL ROSE, eased off that rival midway
through the second turn before re-engaging from along the inside of that rival when KARDINAL ROSE appeared to shy from something while drifting into the
three path, set a pressured pace into the final turn, before shaking off her pace rival and drew clear under confident handling. PETERSON LANDING
stalked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. KARDINAL ROSE away well and vied for the
lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, took a clear advantage leaving the second turn, but appeared to shy from something soon after
entering the backstretch and shifted three wide, forced the issue from the outside of MERRY BLUE in the run to the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on
that foe through the turn, and just failed to hold the place. FEISTY ELLA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid from along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished from just off the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. CATTY DOM broke sharply and stalked
the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, began to lose position in the run down the backside, and had little to
offer over the final furlong.

Footnotes
SOLARITY broke sharply and was quickly taken in hand and dropped back to trail entering the stretch the first time, tipped three wide and advanced smartly
in the run down the backstretch, collared the pacesetter and quickly took a narrow advantage into the final turn, and held off a stubborn DAPHNE in deep
stretch to prove best. DAPHNE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage through the stretch
the first time, maintained her lead in the run down the backside, was quickly collared and overtaken by SOLARITY entering he final turn, but battled gamely
three wide in the drive to prove easily second best. NEIGHNEIGH stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to get up for a share. LOLA M away well and tracked the leader into
the backstretch the first time while racing two wide, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, but lacked
the needed closing response when called upon. ABOVE AVERAGE tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail,
began to struggle to keep in touch with the leaders in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong while not being persevered with late.

BREEZIN BRIANNE away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the turn, battled through the turn from the inside of
REVEALING SUN, got the better of her pace rival entering the lane, and held off a late surge by MOUNT DOOM to prevail. MOUNT DOOM away well and
chased the leaders from along the rail entering the turn, shifted three wide through the turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive while
gaining late. REVEALING SUN broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of BREEZIN BRIANNE entering the turn, and fought on gamely from

and finished with late interest from just off the rail in the drive. MAK SAYS chased the early pace into the turn while saving ground at the rail, and finished
evenly two wide in the drive. SWEET GYPSY ROSA was devoid of early speed while trailing the field into the turn, but flashed some late interest while
finishing three wide in the drive.

SHOCK THE HOUSE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of WHAT'S SHAKIN
in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and inched clear late. WHAT'S SHAKIN away
well and pressed the pace from the outside of SHOCK THE HOUSE entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, but battled gamely two wide in the drive to prove second
best. RHUMBABA away alertly and stalked the pacesetters into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid smartly with a three wide
bid to loom a danger leaving the turn, but needed more late while finishing one out from the rail to garner a share. EVANDERKEEN unhurried early while
trailing the field in the run to the first turn, saved ground throughout while being devoid of speed, and lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

Footnotes
COUNTERACT tracked the battling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed
steadily two out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. NINE ONE ONE broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of CURLIN ROCKS
entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, got the better of his pace rival leaving the
turn, and finished gamely from along the rail in the drive and just failed to last. GUNFIGHTER settled at the back of the pack while racing out from the rail
entering the backstretch, began to advance three wide midway down rhe backside, continued his bid two out from the rail through the final turn, and finished
gamely four wide in the drive while gaining late. ROCKCLIFFE away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing three wide in the drive. CURLIN ROCKS away alertly
and raced to the lead from along the rail in the run to the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of NINE ONE ONE in the run down the backstretch
and through the final turn, struggled to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and steadied when in tight quarters, but had little to offer late.
Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of CURLIN ROCKS lodged a claim of foul against the rider of NINE ONE ONE
for alleged interference leaving the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed and no change made to the original order of finish.

STAR ENTRY settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn,
and closed with a rush three out from the rail in the drive to get up in the closing strides. BACK SHACK away alertly and tracked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, assumed
command midway through the turn and held a clear advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. CEREBRO broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken midway through the turn, but
closed willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. TIZ VICIOUS away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing two out
from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the
drive. SHARPZAN stalked the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the first turn, held his position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive. PARKER POINT settled at the back of the field while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. I'M
CORFU stalked the early pacesetters while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, loomed a threat while collaring the leaders three wide
entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
