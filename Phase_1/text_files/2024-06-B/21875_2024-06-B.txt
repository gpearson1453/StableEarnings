gate then tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid in the five path at the quarter-pole, drifted out under a left-handed
crop in upper stretch then was switched to a right-handed crop, remained on his inside lead while battling outside the winner in the final furlong and was
outfinished while clear for the place. HOT ROD RUMBLE bumped with a rival at the start while hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in
the two path on the turn, was urged along under pressure passing the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole,

moved out leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, raced between foes in upper stretch, bumped with a rival inside the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response. WRITER'S REGRET broke towards the rear of the field, was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn and failed

Footnotes
BADLANDS RULER got bumped in the hind end by HEARD ON THESTREET and was turned outwards briefly, advanced to establish the front near the six
furlong marker and showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, remained patiently handled and
came under challenge to the outside near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, got directed outwards four
paths to look his main danger in the eye, came out an additional path lightly herding his threat out a path, dug in repelling that rival inside the final furlong to
prevail safe on the wire. HEARD ON THESTREET stumbled badly at the start recovering inwards and bumping the hind end of BADLANDS RULER and
conceded about two lengths to the front, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when tipped out to
the two path, angled four wide into upper stretch latching on the leader, had that rival come out to look him in the eye, got herded one path near the eighth
pole, then got rebuffed inside the final furlong while well clear of the rest for the place honors. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS got steadied at the start when losing
his lane to RETAIL MAN due to pressure outside from BUCKORTWO and inside from the aforementioned foe, conceded three lengths to the front, chased
four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. RETAIL MAN shied
in at the start due to pressure from BUCKORTWO and forced MIDNIGHT EXPRESS to steady when taking over his lane, chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and weakened. GUM ISLAND chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BUCKORTWO
broke in at the start and came under hustling to lead briefly before prompting the pace four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ART OF COURAGE came away in good order then was hustled to the front, moved clear outside the half-mile pole, controlled the action in the two path on
the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and held under a strong hand-ride and a few light taps of a left-handed crop. NANO MAN broke out
but was away fast, moved in while well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a
drive in the stretch and showed good courage to get the place. SPOKEN BLUNTLY was away alertly, pressed the early pace on the outside then tracked
the leader, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and willingly earned the show.
MIZTERTONIC veered in at the start and was off a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
pursued the top three on the outside under a drive to the finish and lacked the needed kick. PRICE IS TRUTH broke in and was off a step slow, settled off
the pace, raced under some restraint late on the backstretch, saved ground while let out on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. IMPULSIVE SPENDING moved in early, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.
PROVEN GOOD broke a step slow then moved in, was urged along near the back, dropped from the two path to the rail late on the turn and showed little.
TWISTED WHISKER was off slow then carried in, raced at the rear, rounded the turn in the three path and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
VALENZAN DAY coaxed from the gate, established the front narrowly and crossed to the two path and then to the inside with one mile to go forcing CO
CONSPIRATOR to steady off his heels and alter out a path, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from that rival's presence to the
outside through the opening half mile, began to shake away thereafter while patiently handled until given a notch with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside
route into upper stretch roused and went clear under a drive to the sixteenth marker when taken back in hand and geared down through to the finish, the
outcome in no doubt. STRONG LIGHT chased just off the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
running on safe for the place honors. CHEEKY TICO two then three wide through the first turn, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. CO CONSPIRATOR broke out at the
start under coaxing and bumped GOLDINI in tandem with WINNING CONNECTION, who broke inwards, raced forwardly placed along the rail and steadied
when VALENZAN DAY crossed to the two path directly outside near the first turn, then steadied again at the one mile marker when that same rival crossed
directly in front, got forced to stargaze briefly before being altered to the two path and advanced on that rival to prompt the pace from the outside, prompted
three then two wide down the backstretch and got shaken off into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. DISAPPEARANCE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at
the half mile pole, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOLDINI got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased along
the inside before tipping three wide into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
WINNING CONNECTION broke in at the start bumping GOLDINI in concert with CO CONSPIRATOR, went three then four wide through the first turn,
chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and faltered. There was a Jockey's Objection
by the rider of CO CONSPIRATOR alleging interference into the first turn against VALENZAN DAY. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result
was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
NEAT went around the opening turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, made a bid in the
four path at the quarter-pole, took the advantage while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead coming to the eighth-pole,
shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, was given one final pop of the crop near the sixteenth-pole and held under strong hand-ride
from that point to the finish. DETERMINISTIC went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, swung five wide
into upper stretch, pursued the leader on the outside into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead shortly thereafter, gained while drifting in into the
final sixteenth, switched back to the proper lead late and missed while clear for the place. MOVE TO GOLD went around the first turn in the two path, was
rated off the pace, tugged on the bit outside the five-eighths pole, was let out along the rail on the far turn then roused near the five-sixteenths pole, made
an inside bid at the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show.
PLEASE ADVISE was restless in the gate, broke very fast then was taken back to the rear early, saved ground while unhurried at the back, was urged along
on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then angled out and failed to threaten. DRUNK ON SAKE sat back at the start and tossed his head,
was off very slow and spotted the front several lengths, moved out then rushed to the lead before being taken under restraint, showed the way in the two
path while in hand, was let out on the final turn then asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and tired.

SUBROGATE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker,
was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride from that point to the finish.
HOWGREATISNATE settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came under the crop outside the quarter-pole and safely secured the place
while no match for the winner. FACTUALLY CORRECT was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn,
was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER chased the pace on the outside
then three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. SHERIFF BIANCO settled between horses near the back, went three wide on the
turn, waited behind horses at the quarter-pole then was roused in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. REPO ROCKS was urged along off the
pace, chased inside on the turn and came up empty. RUNNINSONOFAGUN was hustled from the gate then rated just off the pace between horses,
traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased the winner into the final furlong and tired. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED

INTO IT forwardly placed from the start, settled tracking the leader just off the inside and then along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied, issuing a challenge between foes, split those rivals and seized command just outside the eighth pole,
edged away and came under lone threat to the outside, dug in gamely to stave off that rival to the finish. YO DADDY got bumped at the start by
HEATHGUARD, who broke outwards, raced just off the inside through the first turn and then chased five then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy inside the final furlong latching on the leader inside the final sixteenth but was
ultimately rebuffed to the wire. COLLECT FROM IKE established the front after the start and showed the way crossing to the inside into the first turn,
remained patiently handled until roused taking the two path into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, kept on to
preserve the show honors. HEATHGUARD broke out at the start bumping YO DADDY, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. AZ U CHASE ME chased along the inside under coaxing from three
furlongs out, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. JUST FOR LUCK coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the rail bidding to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late
stages. JHIRSCH just off the inside through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. COVERT KAT three then two wide through the first turn, chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. ADDICTED TO YOU
chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SKELLIG ISLAND just off the
inside through the opening turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
