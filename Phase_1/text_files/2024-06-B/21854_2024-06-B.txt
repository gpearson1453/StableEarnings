SPREAD THE RISK good position to the turn, split horses quarter pole, went clear to the wire. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT crossed over smoothly to rail, lost
position to turn rallied back for place spot. ROYAL HONEY unhurried early, off rail run to quarter pole and outkicked for place spot. KENTE KLARKE no
speed to turn, improved position outside in the stretch run. ROYAL ITCH inside position chasing leader to the stretch, gave in readily. MISS MO MESA
inside speed to quarter pole gave way readily and galloped out through the final furlong while stopping badly, walked off. FLAT OUT FAY had a terrible start
from the gate and lost all chance. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
LAST LEGACY broke sharp to pressure for the lead, took over stretch, cleared. CAUSE IMA ROSE broke well outside lagged back, rushed between horses
for place spot. ALTER THE STARS saved ground throughout battled gamely in the stetch run. GHOST PLAZA inside speed to the front, pressured to the
stretch run and weakened in the drive. PALMILLA'S BET inside trip with no speed to the turn, improved position only. SALTY MAMA had an awkward start
from gate, rushed and ran along evenly outside through the stretch run. MOONLIT MISCHIEF never a threat throughout. KATNAPPING broke well from the
gate, tried to keep up to turn but emptied out. BLOSSOM DIVA brief speed from outside but could not go on from the turn. CHAR had a staggered start from
the gate and never menaced with a wide trip.
