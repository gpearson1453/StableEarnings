Footnotes
MONTEVALLO buckled up front when the gates sprung yet was quick to recover, pressed the leader from the three path, failed to sustain pressure while
chasing turning for home, kept on in pursuit leaving midstretch, closed back in entering the final sixteenth, rebid late and edged an advantage nearing the
wire. COPPER ECHO showed the way a path off of the inside as an outer rival applied mild pressure, inched clear of that one approaching the lane, held
sway through midstretch as that one sustained pursuit, but gave in late. MO RHODES tracked in the three path and between horses, shifted out to the five
path into upper stretch, ran on slowly gaining on the top pair in the late stages but needed more. I'M YOUR MAN took back from between horses entering
the first turn, trailed in the two to four path before swinging to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. HITTING BOMBS stalked in the four
path, chased the top pair under urging around the far turn, lost show to an outer bidder in midstretch and yielded. DR KRINGLE laid off of the pace in the
two path, advanced between horses nearing the far turn, chased while stalling out turning for home and tired. NEW BERN laid close up along the inside, but
weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
SAQEEL bumped an inner rival at the start before being brushed between horses shortly after, tracked in the three path and between horses, was roused in
pursuit outside of the leading trio around far turn, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, sparred with an inner game
rival through the late stages and held. ALL WEST pressed three deep while tugging under snug restraint around the first turn, vied around the far turn, led
tucking two wide entering upper stretch, resisted an outer challenge while drifting in and putting an inner foe in tight at the furlong grounds got headed by his
outer challenger in the process, yet fought on gamely but failed to regain even terms. KAHALA stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the
far turn, crept between horses while pursuing just behind the leaders into upper stretch, shifted in to take aim inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, but
was floated in by that rival and forced to steady, then altered out and kept on. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE was pinched back between horses at the start, laid
off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before moving to the five path in upper stretch, then stayed on along with an outer rival.
HAROLD'S CLOUD stumbled severely at the start, trailed along the inside, moved out of last around the far turn, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, ran
on mildly to bid for fourth in the late stages but hung. GREY STREAK bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, vied
around the far turn, got headed by his outer counterpart while tucking to the inside entering the lane, yielded before steadying when put to cramped quarters
in midstretch and weakened. BIRD KING broke a step slow, lacked speed in the five path, trailed around the far turn before drifting to the eight path entering
the lane, and made little impact. CANDY FOR CARMEL pursued from midpack in the four path and faded around the far turn. HOME RUN TRICK set the
pace inside of a pair of prompters, vied with them into the far turn, got headed turning for home and caved in hand. THE RIDER OF KAHALA CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST ALL WEST ALLEGING INTERFENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
KAVOD transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted out four wide entering the lane, inched closer to
the leader while getting herded out through midstretch, sustained a bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past. CAN'T HUSH THIS tracked outside of the top
pair, bid in the four path passing the three furlong pole, led turning for home, cleared in upper stretch, but drifted out through midstretch and was bested by
an outer challenger late. PIPES AND DRUMS pressed outside of the leader, came under urging to sustain pressure along with an outer bidder at the three
furlong pole, got outmoved by that rival turning for home, yielded to the top pair through the final furlong and saved show. EXPENSIVE CUT was squeezed
and crowded between horses at the start, chased from midpack in the three to four path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, stayed on and missed
show late. BACKSIDE BUZZ broke in and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace early on, vied with a pair of outer challengers while a path off of the rail
leaving the three furlong pole, got headed shortly after and gave way through the lane. READY TO POUNCE was jostled between horses at the start, saved
ground off of the pace to no avail. TAKE THE CHARGE was bumped between horses and crowded at the start, chased from midpack in the two to three
path and failed to factor. ALL IN SYNC broke out and bumped a rival at the start, dropped back in the aftermath, trailed in the three path and got outrun.

Footnotes
MUGEN vied two wide and between horses, led into the turn before an outer pair of rivals prompted turning for home, drove clear in upper stretch and drew
off. TWO SHARP missed the break and was last away, recovered and advanced outside of rivals down the backstretch to stalk four wide into the turn, bid
outside of the top pair while in the four path turning for home, but was repelled and proved no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, then fended off
an inner rival for place through the final furlong. HEY OLIVIA hopped slightly at the start, stalked forwardly two wide, took aim along the inside entering the
lane, vied for place with an outer foe while chasing the clearing leader into midstretch, but was denied that position late. SALLY O'MALLEY broke a step
slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three to four path around the turn before moving to the five path in upper stretch, then ran on willingly
for a minor share. MORINGA pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in the two to three path turning for home and ran on while one paced.
BARSTOOL BABE trailed in the three to four path, swung to the six path into upper stretch and moved up. BEACH BUNNY was briefly fractious in the
starting gate, prompted three deep, then between a pair while in the three path around teh turn, but weakened on her left lead in upper stretch. DREAM ON
STORMY vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner briefly but faltered into the turn. MINK STOLE bobbled soon after the start, lacked speed in the
three path before tucking to teh inside entering the lane, but got outrun. ENDLESS GLOW was antsy in the starting gate necessitating a veterinarian exam
before being cleared to go, reloaded without further incident, chased forwardly briefly but steadily faded into and around the turn. CATHCART leaned out at
the start, got keen early before checking between horses nearing the nine sixteenths pole, laid off of the pace in the four path and tired.

SCALABLE stalked forwardly two wide and between horses, chased the top pair in upper stretch, split them late and edged an advantage in the shadow of
the wire. YES INDEED brushed with an inner rival while off of the pace five wide into the first turn, tucked to the four path rating into the backstretch, then to
the three path to advance between horses approaching the far turn, was roused to take aim outside of the leading trio turning for home, bid in the five path
in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage from an inner rival at the furlong grounds, sparred through the late stages but got outfinished by an inner bidder.
YES TO CHAMPAGNE prompted two wide and between horses, led into the lane, dug in to resist an outer challenge in upper stretch, battled gamely while
narrowly headed through the final furlong and was bested. HERE'S THE SPIDER laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the two path around teh far
turn, shfited out to the five path and between horses at the three sixteenths pole and ran on to reach fourth at the wire. LEMON MUFFIN was brushed
between horses while four wide and off of the pace into the first turn, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, chased in the three to four path in
upper stretch, gained fourth in the final furlong but was caught by an outer rival at the wire. LIUZZA prompted outside of the top pair while keen between in
the four path into the first turn, sustained pressure in the three path around the far turn, bid turning for home, but yielded between rivals leaving upper

leaned in at the start and dropped back early on, raced at the rear two wide, then in the three path and between horses around the far turn, shifted out to the
six path in upper stretch but lacked a rally. VINOBELLO set a pressured pace inside of a pair of rivals around both turns, got headed nearing the lane and

Footnotes
COOKE CREEK stalked from the two to three path around the first turn, bid outside of the leader and from the three path around teh far turn, got floated to
the four path entering the lane before wrestling an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. BIG BLUE LINE took light contact from an outer rival before
being brushed by an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to four path, fanned to the six path into upper stretch and ran on to gain place in the
final sixteenth. FLOKI'S FLIGHT showed the way in the three to two path around the first turn, met an outer challenge around teh far turn, spun back to the
three path entering the lane, but was headed in upper stretch, gave way and lost place late. SANTOS DUMONT brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked
in the two to three path early on, shifted to the five path entering the lane and offered a mild kick but was outkicked for a minor placing by an outer rival in
midstretch. HURRY HURRY brushed an inner rival at the start, trailed along teh inside, then in the three path around the far turn before fanning to the five
path entering the lane, and moved up. BABA VOSS bobbled slightly and bumped an inner rival at the start, lacked speed two wide, awaited racing room
while saving ground turning for home, tipped two wide and between horses into upper stretch but lacked a rally. ONTHESTAGE was bumped by an outer
rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shfited out to the four path entering upper stretch but made little impact. HERN stalked along the
inside, chased around the far turn and weakened. O P FIRECRACKER pursued from midpack in the two path, chased between horses turning for home and
tired.

Footnotes
OTTOMAN FLEET (GB) led from an inner prompter into the first turn, cleared that one and showed the way into the backstretch in the two path with his ears
pricked, met an outer challenge while traveling well in hand around the far turn, swiftly shook free of that prompter entering upper stretch and held well
through the late stages. CHASING THE CROWN trailed along the inside, shifted four wide picking up stride entering upper stretch, rallied to bid for place at
the furlong grounds and edged that position while slowly closing in on the clear leader. STRONG TIDE prompted inside of the pace setter early, eased back
before steadying from restraint at the six furlong pole, settled into stalking stride down the backstretch, chased along the inside around the far turn,
sustained his pursuit to vie for place in midstretch, but got outkicked. WIN FOR THE MONEY laid off of the pace in the two to three path, chased closest to
the top pair turning for home, vied for place with rivals on both sides into the final furlong but yielded. EXAULTED was last away, improved to pursue from
midpack along the inside into the first turn, checked behind a troubled rival around that bend, lost position before pursuing further back from the three path
around the far turn, got floated five wide into upper stretch and failed to factor. JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked in the three path early on, moved to press the
leader down the backstretch, prompted turning for home, but proved no match for his inner counterpart entering upper stretch and weakened between
horses.

Footnotes
SCYLLA broke flat-footed and was allowed to settle at the rear in the three path, unleashed a five wide move to sweep past inner rivals around the far turn,
bid turning for home before floating to the six path into the lane, leaned in and brushed an inner rival while dueling in upper stretch, forged an advantage and
bumped again with her inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, led late and held from an inner bidder at the wire. SHOTGUN HOTTIE stalked behind the
pace setter and from the two path, got outmoved by wide bidder while forced to await racing room behind foes turning for home, committed to a rail charge
in upper stretch, pursued tentatively while aiming up a narrow rail seam through midstretch, managed to slip through whlie running on in the final sixteenth,
closed in on the clear leader late but came up short. TAXED pressed the leader from the three path, forged a narrow advantage tucking to the two path with
three furlongs to run, met bold challenges from a trio of outer rivals turning for home, battled gamely inside of them through upper stretch, but was headed
by her widest confronter in midstretch, fought on into the final sixteenth but was bested by an inner bidder for place late. OCCULT stalked in the three path,
pressed outside of the top pair into the far turn, bid along with a pair of outer rivals turning for home, spun into the lane in the four path, took light contact
from her outer counterpart in upper stretch, sustained the battle before jostling with that rival at the furlong grounds causing her hind quarters to be briefly
knocked off stride, then gradually yielded through the final furlong. XIGERA laid off of the pace four wide, gained along with an outer rival around the far turn
to bid between horses turning for home, transferred light contact from her outer counterpart to an inner rival in upper stretch, jostled with the latter in a much
firmer manner while in tight quarters among foes at the furlong grounds, steadied hard in the aftermath and failed to recover. FREE LIKE A GIRL set the
pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole and weakened inside of rivals entering the lane. THE RIDER OF XIGERA
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SCYLLA AND OCCULT ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
BRILLIANT BERTI pursued from midpack in the four path, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home to bid in upper stretch, struck the front at
the furlong grounds and drove clear. FIRST WORLD WAR tracked in the four path, moved forward to press the top pair at the nine sixteenths pole, vied with
a single inner rival while in the three path into the far turn, sparred as an outer bidder joined the fray in upper stretch, got outkicked by that one at the furlong
grounds, flopped back to his left lead shortly after and secured place. GREEN LIGHT dictated terms while remaining a path off of the inside early on, vied
with an outer prompter into and around the far turn, battled as a wider rival menaced, yielded to those rivals leaving midstretch and saved show. LAGYNOS
stalked along the inside, tipped three wide in upper stretch, sustained a chase through the final furlong and missed show. AGATE ROAD laid off of the pace
in the two to three paths, swung out to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. DEPICTION saved ground pursuing in midstretch, lacked a
response to urging around the far turn and failed to menace. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE pressed the leader from the three path early on, got outmoved by an
outer rival leaving the nine sixteenths pole, chased the top pair from between rivals around the far turn and faded. MOONLIGHT trailed along the inside and
got outrun.

Footnotes
CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR stalked the embattled leading pair from the two to three path, boldly menaced outside of them while entering the lane in the five
path, assumed command and drove clear in upper stretch, then held sway while drifting out in the late stages. ANGKOR chased forwardly in the four path,
shifted to the six path into upper stretch, bumped with an inner rival while vying for place with that one passing the furlong grounds, prevailed for place and
was gaining on the leader late. HOIST THE GOLD broke towards the rear, chased from midpack in the three path, moved to the five path entering the lane,
ran on along with outer rival, bid for place whlie bumping with his outer counterpart in midstretch, vied for that position into deep stretch but was bested.
TEJANO TWIST was last away, trailed in the four path into the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane and rallied willingly. RYVIT dueled for the
lead two wide, got floated to the four path as an outer bidder loomed large entering the lane, got outkicked by that one in upper stretch and gave way.
ANARCHIST dueled for the lead with an outer rival into and around the turn, shifted to the three path as the eventual winner offered a bid entering the lane
and weakened. SPANKSTER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BANGO lacked speed two wide and got outrun. THE RIDER OF HOIST THE
GOLD CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST ANGKOR ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
KINGSBARNS tracked in the four path, bid outside of the top pair turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. PYRENEES laid
close up along the inside, stalked from the two path into the backstretch, pursued between horses with five furlongs to go, took the far turn in the three path
before inching closer in the five path entering the lane, brushed with an inner rival straightening for home, ran on to gain place in the final sixteenth and
narrowly held from an inner challenger. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING prompted outside of the leader and from the four path, moved down to the three path
entering the backstretch, sustained pressure before getting outmoved by an outer bidder turning for home, yielded and brushed an outer rival shifting to the
four path entering the lane, yet sustained stride in the final furlong, came on again between horses late to re-bid for place, but missed. FIRST MISSION set
the pace in the two path as an outer rival prompted, led as a wider rival bid turning for home, got headed by that challenger in upper stretch and gave way
through the final furlong. STEAL SUNSHINE laid off of the pace four to three wide around the first turn, then between horses down the backstretch, lacked a
response to urging in the two path towards the rear around the far turn, yet shifted out to the five path to split foes entering the lane and improved position.
DISARM was studdish in the paddock, broke a step slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order inside of rivals with five furlongs to go,
chased forwardly along the inside around the far turn, but faded through the lane. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY raced at the rear three wide and between horses
into the first turn, backed out and shifted outside of rivals around that bend, chased under urging around the far turn, floated to the six path in to the lane and
tired. DREAMLIKE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, retreated to trail entering the backstretch and never got involved thereafter.

DANCING N DIXIE settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, rallied widest in the
final furlong, closed in quickly on the leaders while drifting out in the closing stages and prevailed at the wire. MO FOX GIVIN pursued from midpack along
the inside, closed in on the leaders around teh far turn before awaiting racing room approaching the lane, split foes three wide into the final furlong, surged
to the lead with a sixteenth to go but was caught by an outer rival at the wire. KATHYNMARISSA bobbled slightly whlie last away at the start, settled well
back along the inside, closed in from the three path and between horses turning for home, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, rallied among foes to
attempt a bid outside of the new leader leaving the sixteenth pole, but was fended off and outkicked for place. POOLSIDE WITH SLIM (IRE) tracked two
wide, inched closer four wide around the far turn before fanning to the six path into the lane, stayed on between horses in midstretch, but flopped back to
her left lead at the sixteenth pole and leveled off. JUST BETTER pressed two wide, bid along with an outer rival turning for home, got outkicked by that one
in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong. MY BRAZILIAN GIRL checked back from between horses reaching the wire for the first time, settled at the
rear in the two to three path, swung out to the seven path in the final furlong, offered a belated kick and missed fourth. SIMPLY IN FRONT stalked along the
inside, tipped three wide and between horses into the far turn, ranged up outside of the leading pair to bid turning for home, gained an advantage in the four
path in upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was caught by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole and faded between horses late. PIPSY (IRE) set the
pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer bidders turning for home, got headed entering the lane and weakened.
