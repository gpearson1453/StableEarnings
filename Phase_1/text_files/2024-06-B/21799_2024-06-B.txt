Footnotes
RUNAWAY CHARLIE took command from the start, was pressed only mildly down the wind aided backside, at the quarter pole was urged right-handed,
opened up a touch on the chasing rivals at the top of the lane and was kept to the task to hold all rivals at bay for the frontrunning score. BEDARD tracked
two wide in the first bend, watched the front duo outside in the backstretch, rallied three wide around foes midway on the far turn, loomed the main threat in
the four path straightening out for the drive but could not get by the winner who had something left in the stretch. BOWMAN'S RUN tracked three wide into
the first turn outside rivals, sat just off the pacesetter outside down the backside, inched closer to the lead with five sixteenths remaining, chased in vain with
runners on both sides in upper stretch and was no match for the top two in the late stages. TIMES A BREEZE broke slowly to see the field in the beginning,
co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, started to pick up rivals shifting out four wide by the quarter pole, was gathering speed outside foes in the five
path straightening for home and closed the best to the wire for a minor role in the end. GUNPOINT was allowed to settle near the back outside horses in the
first turn, co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, made little progress on the final turn, shifted out four wide turning for home and angled inside at the
top lane the lane to pass tired runners in the stretch. REBEL FAITH travelled outside rivals in mid-pack in the beginning, stalked outside in the third flight
down the backstretch, made no headway when asked with five sixteenths from home and could not get involved running in the four path down the lane.
IMPERIAL STAR travelled inside in mid-division on the first turn, stalked in the third flight on the rail down the back straight, made little impact on the fence
in the final bend and could not be a factor in the drive. THE GUNNARSON sat behind the frontrunner while settling on the rail in the early going, travelled on
the fence in the second flight down the backside, kept pace with the lead trio entering the far turn, could not quicken with others at the quarter pole and
retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TOWN'S WARRIOR was content to shadow the frontrunner outside along the backside, inched closer while in hand, measuring the pacesetter throughout
the turn, bid for the lead outside at the top of the lane, opened up by the eighth pole and drew off convincingly in deep stretch. MY MUNNINGS MODEL
settled between rivals in the second flight down the backstretch, waited to move on the rail through the turn, shifted just outside in the two path turning for
home, having a clear run and closed belatedly to best the rest at the finish line. FABELMAN was three deep outside horses tracking in the early going,
watched the top duo outside around the bend, shifted to the three path for the stretch run and got up with seventy yards from home to capture third money.
RED ENSIGN seized the lead inside at the start, set the pace while hounded outside by the winner through the back straight, was headed outside with a
quarter remaining, tried to offer some resistance until the furlong marker and gave way late on the fence to settle on the fringes in the end. AGILE DANCER
tracked the front pair on the rail down the back straight, was shuffled back some entering the turn, could not close the gap through the turn and angled out
four wide but could not be a presence in the drive to the finish line. KILLARY was unhurried to trail the field down the backstretch, caught up to runners by
the three furlong marker but had nothing to offer widest in the five path for the stretch run.

Footnotes
SEDBURYS GHOST had a nice trip tucked in on the rail sitting behind the engaged duo up top, waited for room to move watching the embattled pair on the
turn, shifted out in mid-stretch finding a seam in the three path and went on by reaching for more ground in deep stretch with a quick late turn of foot.
DIALING ARAGORN had a slim advantage down the backstretch, maintained the lead running on the rail by a narrow margin around the bend, fended off
the early speed challenger in upper stretch but could not find more in reserve to repel the late bid by the winner in the final sixteenth. DOADSTER broke
sharp to lead after the break, dueled on the outside down the backstretch, throughout the turn, fought on stubbornly between rivals at the eighth pole but
needed more late to threaten and settled for the show award when crossing the finish line. MOST LIKELY settled outside horses in midfield in the early
going, took closer order to be in the second flight, tracking outside through the turn, was hard ridden with five sixteenths from the wire, could not gain on the
contesting two at the top of the stretch in the three path and weakened outside at the furlong marker for a small piece of the prize. COOLCOLLECTED
hesitated on the break to trail down the backside, caught up to runners outside by the half, offered a brief rally three furlongs out but had too much to
overcome from the poor start and was one paced in the stretch. MEGASTAR travelled on the rail in the middle of the pack by the half, came under a
vigorous ride three furlongs out, made little impression around the bend and lacked a rally in the stretch drive inside. RINGINTHEHOLIDAY settled near the
rear in the beginning, was checked down the backstretch at the nine sixteenths marker, could see the field running around the bend and could not offer a
finished move down the stretch.

Footnotes
MIGHTY SEA exchanged a light bump at the start, settled off the pace shifting in racing inside but off the fence, swung seven wide turning for home, struck
the lead in mid-stretch, edged clear late. QUIET INTENT settled mid-pack inside a foe just off the rail, moved out while advancing up the backstretch racing
between foes in the second group into the far turn, swung out five wide turning for home, made a mild and brief bid in upper stretch, was no match for the
winner but kept on to get the nod for place. SIR SAMUEL was in just a bit tight a few strides out of the gate, was taken back and reserved at the back, saved
ground and advanced inside on the far turn, came out a bit past the five-sixteenths, paused briefly in behind runners seeking room past the quarter pole,
found it in upper stretch between foes three to four wide, gained steadily and slowly but needed more and just missed second. ROYAL HUDSON settled
tracking inside, saved ground on both turns before coming out two to three deep in the vicinity of the quarter pole to pass the tiring pacesetter, ran on
evenly. FLAWLESS RULER was unhurried at the rear racing off the inside part of the course, kicked on mildly late. JAY BIRD exchanged a light bump at the
start, chased the early leader from outside, moved up to prompt the issue coming to the half, dueled into the far turn taking the lead by the midpoint of that
bend, was overtaken at the top of the stretch and weakened thereafter. ENCHANT ME settled outside mid-pack shifting in about three wide heading into the
first turn, was well-positioned on the far turn fanning out from four to six wide, flattened out in the stretch. GOOD RAPPORT was outside a rival mostly three
to four wide and off the pace, was never near enough to threaten. VALLEY VICTORY set the early pace in the clear, was joined by a rival nearing the half,
dueled inside that one, gave way.

REBELIOUS stalked on the rail in the first turn, rated kindly settling into stride near the back along the back straight, edged closer by the half, shifted out
four wide following a rival making a quick move at the quarter pole and under left handed encouragement, closed fast in the final eighth to get up just in time
for the win. MYRA'S BOY was brushed outside on the start, was pushed out six wide in the first turn, improved smartly down the back straight, cruised
around foes four wide midway on the final turn, bid up top in upper stretch, seized the lead at the furlong marker but was caught late by the winner who was
closing sharply. MONDAY MORNING broke in to begin, was fanned five wide between horses in the first bend, settled in midfield three deep along the
backside, was battling for a share in the two path between foes at the top of the lane and gamely with horses on both sides closed for show in the final
eighth. LOST STAR took control from the start, dictated the pace with the wind down the backside unopposed, was still clinging onto the front in mid-stretch
but had little left late and faded in the final seventy yards to be a fringe player in the end. DUBAWI BULL broke outwards on the start, stalked in the three
path between foes on the first turn, settled in the third flight, inside down the backstretch, closed the gap three furlongs from home and finished willingly in
the two path to the wire. ITS TIME TO SHINE tracked three wide outside in the first turn, continued three deep keeping a close eye on the pacesetter down
the backside, took up the chase midway on the far turn when urged left handed, could not find more in the lane and gave way with runners on both sides at
the furlong marker. AWESOME ENTRY was pushed out on the start, travelled on the rear near the back of the pack in the beginning, was scrubbed on three
furlongs out, offered little rally and was one paced to the finish line. REDNECK REBEL was bounced around when in tight between horses in the first turn,
travelled outside runners in the third flight down the back straight, was ridden between foes three furlongs out, lacked a rally and had no finish in the four
path in the stretch drive. GOOD SIN was brushed inside to begin, trailed in the early stages of the race, could not get involved on the final turn and passed a
stopping foe in the stretch. SPEEDY BULLEIT veered out on the break, tracked two wide on the first turn, content to watch outside the pacesetter along the
backstretch, was asked for more three eighths out, had little response and emptied out on the fence at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SWIFT DELIVERY settled outside about mid-pack racing mostly four to five wide throughout, moved closer on the far turn, took over about the quarter pole,
drew off in the stretch. KING ROSSO brushed with a rival lightly at the start, lacked early speed racing at the back off the inside, began to advance and
move out on the far turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, was no match for the winner but secured the place. THOR'S CAUSE saved ground inside
through the first turn, came out off the rail on the far turn moving nearer the lead, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on. OSCARSSON switched out
wide three to four deep into the first turn in behind the leading group, stalked those, fanned out wider for the drive, ran on. SIDE STREET settled at the
back, gained late racing off the inside part of the track but needed more. DIOMEDES was forwardly-positioned into the first turn from off the rail, brushed
with an inside foe early on that bend, eased back and moved out off the rail stalking in behind, was ridden along three wide by the three-eighths, needed
more. BOURBON NORTH was up close three wide stalking the pace, edged nearer taking the lead past the three-eighths, was overtaken outside the
quarter pole, weakened in the final furlong. CONNOR broke awkwardly and slowly, rushed up inside heading to the first turn, brushed with a foe and
steadied about the seven-eighths early on that bend when in tight along the rail, altered out and rushed again between foes to the lead past the
three-quarters, set the pace to the far turn, faltered and faded. ONE LAST KISS brushed with a foe at the start, was off the inside in the two to three path off
the leaders early, was never near enough to threaten and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
HURRICANE CLAIR was forced out on the break, tracked three wide in the first turn and through the backstretch, turned up the heat on the final bend to bid
three wide at the quarter pole and when set down drew off convincingly in the final sixteenth. NIKITA'S GEM pressed the pace between in the beginning,
prompted the issue outside down the back straight, vied between fillies in the far turn up front and fought to the wire to win the place battle in deep stretch.
FOURFIFTYFOUR hopped slightly to begin, took this field on the rail into the first turn, set the pace while hounded outside down the backstretch, dueled on
the fence through the final bend and determinedly ran inside to the wire to settle for the show award. SHARP FLAME was nestled on the rail behind the front
group for the first half of the race, was shuffled back on the fence when she could not quicken with others on the far turn and resurged at the furlong pole
three wide for a minor role in the end. OUR FLAG FLYING travelled on the fence near the back of the pack in the early stages, co-trailed on the inside three
furlongs from the wire, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and finished with purpose passing foes late. SPIRIT BEAR was in tight under the wire for the
first time, settling on the rail in mid-division, continued with the shortest way home along the backside in the third flight and finished up evenly on the fence
down the lane. MORAL TURPITUDE veered out, bumped outside rival causing the rider to lose his left iron briefly, trailed in the beginning, made an early
move going around foes three wide at the half, chased behind the lead trio in upper stretch, shifted out to the four path in mid-stretch but flattened out with a
sixteenth left to go. POETIC AMY broke in at the start, tracked two wide in the initial oval, stalked between horses in the third flight along the back straight,
was hard ridden five sixteenths out but could not get involved in the drive to the wire. GREAT KATE broke inwards to begin, tracked four wide on the first
turn, settled outside three deep along the backside, could not offer a rally three to five wide on the final bend and lacked a finish between horses in the
stretch. CANDID CANDACE was squeezed on the break, was ahead of only the poor starter in the early going, co-trailed outside three furlongs out and was
no factor travelling in the five path down the lane.

Footnotes
JUNIPERO SERRA unhurriedly brought up the rear inside saving ground, began to pick it up on the far turn while moving out, swung eight wide turning for
home, drove past about seventy yards from home. PIERRE was bumped between foes at the start, settled racing three to four wide through both turns,
came out seven wide in upper stretch, kicked on nicely to get up for place. JOKESTAR was urged at the break, switched out off the rail on the first turn, was
about mid-pack, advanced on the far turn making a bid between runners four wide coming to the quarter pole, kept on in the stretch but was simply
outkicked while preserving show honors. CHAMBER MUSIC broke awkwardly bumping a rival, was three to four wide in the early going, gained steadily
outside and in tandem with foes on the far turn making a five wide bid at the quarter pole, needed more in the drive. LEGAL CATCH was unhurried at the
rear outside, shifted six wide in upper stretch, ran on. LUCKY ROMANCE bumped with foes at the start, was coaxed forward in pursuit of the loose leader
racing off the inside and in the clear, converged on that one to make a mild brief bid three wide coming to the quarter pole, could not sustain the effort in the
lane. SMART ALMASTY was bumped between foes at the start, angled to the rail heading to the first turn, settled into stride saving ground, moved out and
came into upper stretch three wide with much to do but failed to menace. FIFTY B M G broke sharply and quickly sped clear, set a lively pace extending the
margin up the backstretch to lead by about a dozen, began shortening stride into the far turn, was engulfed at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch
without being persevered with late. JO DADDY chased briefly two to three wide, steadily retreated, was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
MAAKWA cleared from the outside to take this field on the rail in the first turn, set the pace unchallenged along the backside, was pressed mildly at the
quarter pole outside, spurted away in upper stretch and held off rivals with an impressive front running score. PALACE VIEW (IRE) travelled inside, stalking
in the third tier for the beginning stages, quickened nicely on the rail with five sixteenths from the wire, angled out three wide gathering momentum by the
quarter pole, loomed boldly outside in upper stretch but was denied by the winner who had something left in reserve. SHERIF ALI was away a step slow to
begin, co-trailed inside, started to rally extended his stride midway on the far turn and finished up with good energy in the two path in the final furlong to
close in for third money. CRUMLIN LAD tracked behind the pacesetter in the first turn, continued to sit just back off the leader down the back straight, could
not keep up with the top two by the quarter pole and finished up willingly on the fence for a minor role crossing the line. EXUDE settled on the rail near the
back of the pack, made little progression along the backstretch, ran evenly on the fence in the last turn, shifted to be three wide for the drive and was one
paced in the stretch. MEHLEK co-trailed on the outside early on, edged closer down the backstretch improving his position, kept pace when roused on the
far turn, was in with a chance for a share of the prize in the five path turning for home but levelled off at the eighth pole. PALIO stalked inside in the third
flight in the early stages of the race, was encouraged for more three eighths from home, offered no response around the final turn and failed to menace in
the five path with rivals on both sides to the wire. NINETYFOUR EXPOS watched the lone speed into the first bend, tracked outside two wide down the back
straight, closed in to bid just outside by the quarter pole, was repelled by the frontrunning winner in upper stretch and stopped between horses at the furlong
pole. C MY MEISTER broke out on the break, settled four wide in mid-pack on the first turn, lost position down the back straight, could see the field on the
final turn and lost touch with rivals in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LAC MACAZA travelled on the rail in mid-pack, rated kindly on the fence watching the front group into the backstretch, began to pick up runners inside
seven sixteenths from the line, shifted out, moving well two wide at the quarter pole, bid widest in the five path straightening for home, seized command at
the sixteenth pole and held safe at the finish line. SOUTH BEND stalked four wide into the first bend, settled outside horses in the two path ahead of a
couple rivals down the back straight, closed in when roused three furlongs from home, swung out six wide for the drive and closed fast late but could not
reel in the winner at the finish line. TWIN CITY was brushed on the break, tracked three wide in the first turn, hounded the pace three deep down the back
straight, bid three wide at the quarter pole and tenaciously fought down the lane, was no match for the top two late but did persevere to save the show
award in a three way photo at the wire. COOL KISS made a sharp move from the far outside to save ground going into the first turn two wide off the fence
near the back, made little improvement down the backstretch, was asked three eighths out moving closer to the leaders on the far turn, was full of run late
gaining on horses to the wire in the four path and just missed in a three way photo for the show award. FIGHTER IN THE WIN pressed the pace outside,
vied in the two path between rivals down the backstretch, continued to fight for the lead up front at the quarter pole, momentarily led at the eighth pole but
just faded late, nearing the wire to lose third money in a tight finish. GRANDSON was unhurried near the rear saving ground, started to extend his stride
three furlongs out travelling inside, continued to close on the fence in upper stretch, had to shift three wide off tiring horses at the sixteenth pole and was
finishing well to be involved for the minors in the end. TIZ ROMANTIC tracked five wide outside foes on the first turn, travelled four deep outside horses
watching the front trio down the back straight, bid four wide for the front at the top of the stretch, could not go on and wilted at the furlong marker. DUN
DRUM was nestled behind the pacesetter in the first turn, tracked the front three on the fence down the backside, kept pace inside through the far bend but
needed more late to be a factor at the finish line. RAPID TEST broke out on the start, settled in the two path in midfield in the early stages, offered a mild run
three furlongs out but could not be a presence in the stretch running. MALIBU EDGE took command on the fence in the first turn, continued up front while
hounded outside down the backstretch, was collared outside by multiple runners at the quarter pole but faltered on the fence in the last sixteenth. ON THIN
ICE was three wide near the rear in the first turn, trailed the field along the backside, showed no interest in the final turn and offered little inside down the
stretch. JUMP FOR THE WIN tracked in the two path in the beginning, was at the tail end on the front group along the backstretch, was asked three furlongs
out but was empty and backed through the field in the final turn.
