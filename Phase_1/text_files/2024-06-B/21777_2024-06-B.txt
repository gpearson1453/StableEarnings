Footnotes
SOCIETY JOE seized the lead from the onset, setting a soft pace into the first turn, was headed outside at the half mile pole, dueled on the rail stubbornly
until the furlong marker when he began to edge clear from that pesky rival and was going away comfortably at the finish line. CHANCEL was throttled back
being content to watch the pacesetter in the first turn, turned up the pressure outside at the half mile marker contesting for the lead, inched away up top
briefly midway on the far turn, dueled outside in upper stretch, had nothing left to give by the eighth pole and gave way to the determined frontrunner while
easily besting the rest at the wire. DEVELOPING THE WAY had one rival beaten into the first turn running outside foes, improved position along the
backside, offered a mild rally to close in for the show award by the quarter pole, was no match for the top pair in the stretch and finished up a distant third in
the end. ROBITAILLE trailed on the fence in the beginning, shifted outside horses at the half, made little impression on the final turn and could not be a
menace in the stretch drive. ITS A BIRDIE stalked near the rear in the early going, made no progress down the backstretch, could not get involved inside on
the final bend and passed a weary foe turning for home. CHROME'S ANGEL stalked in third place into the beginning turn, was headstrong fighting the rider
coming up to a rival at the three quarters marker, settled down to have a nice spot watching the embattled front pair at the half, was encouraged
right-handed by the quarter pole, could not keep up to the leaders and faltered between runners in the four path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SARAH'S DANCER was checked mildly leaving the chute, tracked in the second flight between horses, waited behind the threesome up front through the
turn, shifted inwards finding a seam in the two path in upper stretch and closed with a rush to go by the stubborn leader in the final seventy yards. MASON'S
MUSIC vied for the lead with runners on both sides down the back straight, continued to duel between challengers up top maintaining a slim advantage
throughout the turn, was clinging onto the lead with rivals closing in at the furlong marker, dug in, but was no match for the winner nearing the wire. MITOLE
POWER broke alertly to lead at the start, was shuffled back to track the lead trio outside down the backstretch, made a bold move circling four wide at the
quarter pole, bid for the lead in the five path straightening out for home but was outkicked in the final furlong and settled for the show money. DREAMS AND
SCHEMES was hustled for the lead three deep down the backstretch, was scrubbed on three wide, three furlongs out trying to keep up with pair on the lead,
lost position under a ride between foes at the quarter pole in the four path, angled out seven wide for the run to the wire and re-surged to garner a minor
share in the end. FOXY DIVA was away slowly to trail in the early stages of the race, began to rally, going past runners outside at the quarter pole, shifted
inside in the two path turning for home and showed some late interest in the final furlong passing rivals. ROCKET RILEY stalked outside near the rear,
travelled three wide on the bend making little headway, shifted out to the four path for the stretch drive but could not get involved down the lane. LADY XI
forced the pace on the rail down the backstretch, continued to fight on, dueling inside throughout the turn, battled until the furlong marker up front but wilted
between horses in deep stretch. I HAVE AN IDEA hopped on the break, settled on the rail in midfield along the backside, kept pace with the leaders while
saving ground on the turn, took closer order to be in the mix at the furlong marker, could not find more late and folded in the final seventy yards.
CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER was ahead of only one rival travelling four deep on the outside down the back straight, had nothing to offer when roused around
the bend and made little presence in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
SOUPERGIRL had a nice set up, tracking the contesting twosome along the backside, crept closer to the leaders on the turn, shifted to the three path in
upper stretch, poked her head in front at the sixteenth pole and determinedly between horses gamely held for the win at the finish line. MIKELLE stalked
near the rear down the backstretch, made a sharp move around horses, five sixteenths from home, loomed boldly four wide straightening out for the drive
and just missed with a late push at the wire. POP IDOL dueled inside for the lead down the backside, was alone tracking the frontrunner throughout the turn,
reclaimed the lead outside at the top of the lane, fought on until the seventy yard marker and faded nearing the wire to hold for the show award. SHOTGUN
WEDDING settled on the rail in mid-division in the early stages, could not quicken with others while taking the shortest route around the bend, shifted out
four wide turning for home and finished with intent to settle on the fringes in the end. SCAT GIRL was unhurried to trail down the back straight, closed the
gap on the leaders around the turn, angled out four wide for the drive but could not reach contention through the lane. JUST LIKE THAT battled outside in
the early going, edged clear for the lead getting to the rail entering the turn, set the pace around the bend, was collared outside at the top of the stretch, had
little left to give and tired on the fence at the furlong pole. ALTA CALIBRE travelled outside foes in midfield down the backstretch, offered a mild run with
rivals on either side from the midpoint on the turn to the top of the lane, could not find more in the stretch and yielded at the furlong marker.

WELL ACTUALLY brushed with a rival at the start, settled just in behind the leaders tracking inside saving ground, waited from the five-sixteenths till past
the quarter pole seeking room on the far turn, angled out five then six wide leaving that bend with aim on the leader and put to urging, gained steadily
striking the lead a sixteenth out and edging past. FEDALINE stalked just off and outside the leader, was given encouragement at the five-sixteenths,
advanced on the leader making a bid three wide past the quarter pole, floated out four wide into upper stretch and with the lead, was overtaken a sixteenth
out but held place. P. S. RISING STAR was shuffled back heading to the first turn to last but one and switched out, settled at the rear, began to receive
urging past the three-eighths, angled out nine wide leaving the far turn, was gaining steadily but too late. MAKAYLA broke outwardly lightly brushing a rival
after the start, settled between foes in the second flight early, dropped back a bit racing near the rail on the far turn, angled eight wide at the top of the
stretch, ran on but needed more. SMOKEN CHLOE was mostly two wide through the turns and off the pace, ran on in the lane but needed more. TAKE
CHANCES was in just a hair tight after the break then unhurriedly brought up the rear racing off the inside, swung six wide for the stretch run and was never
near enough to threaten. FOREST VIXEN was well-placed mid-pack outside three wide early, swung seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. FOREVER
DANISH moved clear, set the pace from just off the rail, gave way in the stretch.

READY FOR SHIRL was content to shadow the pace along the back straight, closed in to bid for the lead outside with three furlongs remaining, took control
in the three path straightening out for home, relinquished the lead momentarily at the furlong pole but re-rallied smartly inside in the last sixteenth to win
edging clear at the finish line. MISS ROBERTS (GB) veered in sharply to trail by many after the break, was moving erratically seeing the field down the
backside, settled into stride nicely, closing the gap but still at the rear navigating the turn, angled out with momentum widest in the six path for the run to the
wire, lengthened stride but drifted in briefly by mid-stretch, under left handed urging stayed straight to momentarily seize the lead at the furlong marker but
could not continue the sustained run and settled for second best under what was a gallant effort all in all. DESTINY RO travelled outside horses three wide
in midfield in the beginning, rated kindly in the second flight waiting to move through the turn, angled out five wide to be in the hunt at the top of the lane,
was steadied sharply nearing the eighth pole losing her path and recovered late to hold for the show award at the finish. MI CORAZON ran between foes in
mid-pack down the backstretch, sat behind the leaders in the second tier with runners on each side around the oval, had no path behind a wall of horses at
the top of the stretch shifted out five wide for clear run at the eighth pole and finished up willingly to capture a minor role at the finish. AMAZIN QUEEN
travelled on the rail in midfield, kept pace while inside in the second flight around the turn, angled three wide for the stretch drive and finished up mildly,
passing some runners down the lane. ARRIVISTE seized the lead from the start, was headed outside with three furlongs to go, offered little resistance down
the lane and backed away on the fence by mid-stretch. MY SUNNY VALENTINE loped along three deep keeping a close eye on the front two along the
backside, continued to hound the top pair three wide around the turn, was in range of the leaders in the four path turning for home, could not go on with
rivals three sixteenths from home, emptied out by the furlong pole and galloped across the wire. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #2 MISS ROBERTS ON #4
READY FOR SHIRL AT THE FURLONG POLE WAS DISALLOWED. TRAINERS/RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #6 DESTINY RO AGAINST #2 MISS

Footnotes
TIANMA sped clear heading to the first turn and shifted in, set the pace from just off the rail, was given steady but mild urging through the lane and held
safe. DESIGN DIVA was in just a hair tight soon after the break and angled in heading into the first turn, saved some ground on that bend before being
guided out heading up the backstretch, fanned further still to be four to five wide at the top of the stretch and with run, brushed lightly with an inside foe in
mid-stretch, edged past that one and gained steadily on the leader but too late. PRIVACY SETTING (FR) brushed lightly with a foe at the start, rated inside
then soon switched out racing three wide heading to the backstretch, advanced outside approaching the far turn, was within range late on that bend,
brushed with an outside rival in mid-stretch and had no extra for late but was best of the rest. DUVAL STREET was in tight and brushed lightly a few strides
after the start losing the path, thereupon unhurriedly raced at the back near the inside, came out five wide for the stretch and ran on well but needed more.
SAVE THE DATE was well-placed stalking the leader two to three wide, was within range on the far turn but failed to rally. DIXIE TIMBER brushed lightly
with a foe at the start, moved out entering the first turn racing three to four wide, was not pressured up the backstretch settling toward the rear, swung out
six wide for the drive, was unable to menace. MRS. HOT SHOT was up close tracking inside, steadily faded. TIPSY'S EMPIRE was in tight after the start
brushing with the outside rival, raced mostly three to five wide and off the pace and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
LITERATE tracked the leader on the rail in the beginning, had an ideal set up tucked in on the rail behind the duo up front, waited for running room with five
sixteenths to go, angled out in the four path straightening out for home, was full of run and drew off when set down in deep stretch. BEAUTIFUL SKY
tracked three wide on the first turn, hounded the pace outside down the back straight, took the lead midway on the far turn, battled inside turning for home
and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the final sixteenth while besting the rest. VUCCHELLA tracked two wide between foes in the first bend, watched
the engaged pair tracking outside down the backstretch, moved in to bid three wide two furlongs from home, was no match between the top two down the
lane but finished up willingly to hold for the show award. SOLO MISSION was slammed inside on the break, trailed the field in the early going, began to pick
up the bit three furlongs from the wire, smartly split runners three wide at the quarter pole and finished up evenly down the stretch for a minor role in the
end. PAINTED GLORY broke out, bumping outside challenger on the start, had one rival beaten down the backstretch, put in a mild run four wide at the
quarter pole, shifted to the five path at the top of the lane but stalled running to the finish line. EMPIRE'S TREAT travelled on the rail in midfield on the first
turn, made little progress along the backside, ran evenly around the far turn and was one paced to the wire. HELIOCENTRIC stalked in the third flight
outside horses down the backside, was asked to quicken with others making a move three furlongs out, offered no response, angled five wide for the drive
to the line but could not be a factor. HOULIHAN assumed command from the break, set the fractions while pressed outside down the back straight, was
headed outside with five sixteenths remaining, had nothing left to give and retreated on the fence at the quarter pole. RYO AMAZING settled in the third
flight inside foes along the backstretch, offered a brief rally three eighths from home, could not keep going between runners in the three path by upper
stretch and folded through the lane.

Footnotes
DANCING DUCHESS got away well and had the very early lead before relegated to second pressing up the backstretch from outside, moved to a short lead
three furlongs out, drew clear in mid-stretch under urging and was kept busy to the wire. UPHILL DANCE settled at the rear tucking in but off the rail, fanned
six wide leaving the far turn, edged past rivals late to be a clear second best but was no match for the winner. CREED'S GOLD brushed a rival lightly after
the start, stalked from between the second flight, moved out four wide for the drive, kept on well to get the nod for show in a three-way photo. ZO LEE was
bumped at the start and prominent in the very early going before being taken back to track in behind the leading pair and inside foes in the second group,
kept on three wide between runners in the stretch but missed show. KARAYA bumped the inside rival at the start, moved forward between under mild
coaxing, gained the lead soon after and forced the pace from inside, could not kick on with the top one and was outfinished for the minor awards. ROSA
was brushed lightly after the start, stalked from outside, advanced three to four wide on the turn, bobbled or appeared to jump past the five-sixteenths
coming to the top of the stretch, floated out a couple paths, was not persevered with late once clearly beaten.

Footnotes
FINAL DRAFT tracked the front two outside going nicely in hand down the backstretch, was forced to move three wide at the three furlong marker, quickly
pounced to the lead by the quarter pole and was kept to the task right-handed to the wire to just hold on for the victory at the finish line. KIN'S CONCERTO
was situated on the rail tracking the front duo down the back straight, waited on the far turn on the fence behind the leaders, had clear running room on the
rail entering the stretch and finished up strongly inside but could not get up in time surging at the wire. LOOKIN TO CONQUER co-led on the outside
entering the first turn, was alone up front down the backside, was collared outside by the quarter pole and stayed on willingly between the leaders to hold for
the show money crossing the line. MY GIRL DELLA settled three wide near the back on the first turn, travelled evenly under a snug hold along the backside,
was let loose moving well four wide around foes at the three furlong marker, threatened five wide under a vigorous ride down the lane but stalled with a
sixteenth left to settle on the fringes. A LITTLE FRISKY was off a step slow to begin, trailed down the backstretch, caught up to the field three wide between
runners three eighths from home, shifted out to the five path for the stretch run and was gaining at the wire but could not improve position in deep stretch.
CINNAMON BITS co-led on the rail into the first turn, was relegated to a chasing role along the back straight, was asked between foes at the quarter pole,
could not hold her position and weakened in upper stretch. INUDATION stalked near the rear on the rail in the early stages of the race, made little
movement inside down the backstretch, was roused midway on the far turn when the field bunched up but lacked a finish in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ROMANTICA broke outwards on the start, settled alone in the third flight around the turn, shifted out five wide extending her stride at the top of the lane,
threaded the needle with three sixteenths to run, bursting between foes for the lead and was kept to the task left-handed late to hold safe for the win.
ROYAL ASCOT broke inwards on the start, was gathered up to trail in the beginning, travelled inside near the rear with three quarters to go, began to go by
runners inside three furlongs out, angled out with five sixteenths from home, was stuck in the seven path behind horses in upper stretch having no room,
finally had a clear lane six wide at the eighth pole and closed smartly late to take the place share. NANTUCKETS DAY stalked in the third flight between
foes along the backstretch, took closer order tracking the front threesome around the bend, angled outside six wide to be in the hunt turning for home, was
bumped slightly in upper stretch and chased the winner home in the final furlong to settle for the show award at the wire. MIDSUMMER MO was allowed to
settle at the rear getting to the rail with three quarters left to run, began to uncork a rally passing foes on the fence three furlongs out, was gathering good
momentum inside turning for home, shifted outside to the two path going by the early frontrunner at the three sixteenths marker, moved into second briefly
at the sixteenth pole but stalled late and settled for a minor role at the finish. SHAKSHUKA sat just behind the leader on the rail down the backside,
continued to comfortably watch the front three around the turn while nestled on the rail and finished up willingly in the two path to the wire. IDYLLIC was on
the outside in the second flight down the backside, kept pace with the lead trio going three wide on the turn, swung out to the seven path for the drive to the
wire and was one paced through the stretch. ENGLISH JUBILEE settled near the back of the pack three deep outside horses, made little headway three
wide throughout the turn, angled out widest in the nine path for the running down the lane but failed to fire at the furlong marker. LEMON SWEETS chased
the frontrunner down the backside, moved in to vie between horses for the lead three furlongs out, briefly had her head in front in upper stretch, could not
match strides with others closing in and yielded in mid-stretch. QUEST TO BE PROUD stalked between horses near the back in the early stages of the
race, could see the field two wide entering the turn and passed tired runners in the stretch. MOMUNNYFOR RO broke in a tangle to begin, settled alone in
mid-pack down the back straight, made no progression three wide around the bend and could not get interested in the drive to the finish line.
ENCOURAGEACHOTHER was brushed inside on the break, seized control soon after the start, was headed outside three eighths from the wire, fought on
until upper stretch, had nothing left to offer and faltered on the rail with three sixteenths left to run. MCKENZIE ROAD broke sharp to lead early, tracked the
pace outside three deep down the backstretch, closed in to bid three wide outside foes, three furlongs from home, battled between runners in the five path in
upper stretch, could not continue on and stopped by the furlong marker.
