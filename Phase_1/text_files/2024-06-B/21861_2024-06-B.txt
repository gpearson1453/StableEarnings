Footnotes
CHENTI saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and kicked clear. SPOKEN CODE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, saved ground early, settled in the middle of the
pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path and improved position in the lane. SEAVILLE raced in the
four path early, dueled on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path and chased on to the wire. OUR
MAJESTIC hit the gate leaving it, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, saved ground around the far turn
and passed tiring horses in the stretch. NORTH OF BALI raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, swung out to the five
path coming around the second bend and never truly threatened. MIDNIGHT AVENGER veered out leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, stalked
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and tired in the lane. DONEGAL MOONSHINE bumped with the
horse to his inside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and
faded in the final furlong. PATRIOT HILLS raced in the four path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the second turn and was empty in the stretch. CATHY'S BOY was squeezed back leaving the gate,
raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the five path and was never a factor.

SAINT GABRIEL was squeezed back leaving the gate, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, gained
ground late and got up for the win in the final strides. STARRY EYED pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the bend from
the two path, dueled in the stretch and was caught late. REDDINGANDLEE raced off the pace through the early going, continued around the turn in the
three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. PURRRFECT RHYTHM trailed the field up the backstretch, came
around the bend in the three path and made up some ground in the lane while never threatening the top finishers. SUMMERTIME PEPPERS led the field
from the rail racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. TRIPPIN ON BEAUTY tracked the leader on the
outside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch. TITANIUM DEAL raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the lane. JOSAN raced at the back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the three path
