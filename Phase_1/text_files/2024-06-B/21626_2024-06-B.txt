Footnotes
HAGRID'S FLAME settled between horses then was coaxed along on the outside before the five-eighths pole, came under stronger encouragement in the
four path on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, rallied outside while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead inside
the eighth-pole, closed fast to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then went clear and was eased up late while much the best. ACCIDENTAL BID was
reluctant to load then broke a step slow, settled on the outside, dropped back with five furlongs to run, went three then two wide on the turn, found his best
stride in the final furlong and finished willingly to get the place in the final stride. SORORITY PRANK bumped solidly with a rival at the start, showed the way
while inside of a foe, was asked along the rail on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, fended off two challengers while showing good courage
under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole then lost the place at the finish. IRON MAN IRA lost his footing
slightly but broke near the front, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe
around the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. TINEBAR bumped solidly with an opponent at the start, was rated just
off the pace, gained leaving the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, brushed with a rival near the
three-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SAKA SHOCKA was rated just off the pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch,
chased inside for most of the turn, moved to the two then three path late on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A POSSIBLE TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
MR. PAPAGIORGIO coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of DARK DEVIL from the outside four then three wide before tucking to the two path into the
turn and advancing on that rival to duel through the bend coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung seven wide into upper stretch straightened
away, dug in under a right handed crop and came in about two paths taking command a furlong out and carrying in DARK DEVIL, had that foe come under
a left handed crop and traded leans on one another in the final strides and gamely held on to prevail. DARK DEVIL brushed the off side stall and then
JAXOSN IS BACK, showed the way in hand just off the inside under prompting from the aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked to the rail and came
under increasing pressure and knocked heads through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was headed a furlong out getting carried in two paths before the rider switched his crop from right to left a sixteenth from home, then traded leans with
his main rival in the last jumps and was ultimately just denied at the end. GUILE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors when dueling with TRUE CONNECTION through
the stretch to the finish. TRUE CONNECTION chased along the inside advancing at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. REMEMBER THE CHIEF coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. GET IT TO MATTHEW struck the near side stall at
the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing midway, continued in the inside
route into upper stretch and made no impact. JAXSON IS BACK got brushed at the start by DARK DEVIL, chased five then three wide coming under a drive
at the seven-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish.

Footnotes
CARA'S TIME pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the two path midway through the turn, shook clear in the three path into upper stretch,
responded well in the drive and held under strong urging. GONE AND FORGOTTEN was urged along on the outside, gained in the three path on the turn,
pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to get the place. ATHENA BEACH was hustled to the front,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead with three furlongs to run, dropped back into upper stretch and proved no match
for the winner then just missed the place while clear for the show. TRUE EMPRESS settled off the pace under some urging, saved ground on the turn and
failed to rally. JACKSON'S DIXIE was urged along in the second flight, gained in the two path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.
VOLEUSE was urged along towards the back, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. HARLAN'S BOND was urged along near the back, rounded
the turn in the two path and was no factor.

UNIT ECONOMICS (GB) away to the front, settled just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, advanced on that rival through the far turn taking
over narrow command when set down spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, edged away under a drive, then held safe to the finish over a closing
rival. STORM READY coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick. FINAL EDITION (IRE) just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. THEN got bumped between foes and pinched at the start, chased just off the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. CUANDO broke in at the start bumping and
pinching THEN in tandem with KICK A BUCK, established the front into the first turn and showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside
near the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge to the outside, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch and
was displaced from command, then weakened in the late stages. KICK A BUCK broke out at the start bumping and pinching THEN in concert with
CUANDO, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. HOULTON

upper stretch and offered no response. BOURBON OUTLAW chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung two to three wide into
upper stretch, made no impact. DIRECT CHANNEL along the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then just
off the inside through the far turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. DIVER shied in
at the start filling the space left by the breaking inwards CUANDO, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five

Footnotes
MENTEE came away in good order, angled in while going to the front, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage coming to
the quarter-pole, drew off under a hand-ride into the final furlong, remained clear under confident hand-urging into the final sixteenth, was roused while
threatened by the runner-up late and just held. COLLOQUIAL was urged along off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn, climbed some behind horses
near the five-sixteenths pole then angled to the three path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, found his best stride in the final furlong, closed fast on
the winner late and just missed while clear for the place. MAGICAL BETTE chased the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, pursued the winner in the
three path on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the drive and proved no match for the top two while clear for the show. NUDGE chased the early pace
then dropped back, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. MY MITOLE was ridden along on the far outside, went six then five wide on
the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and tired. T KRAFT was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, dropped back in the five path under
extra left-rein pressure leaving the backstretch, was guided to the two path before the three-eighths pole, moved to the three path later on the bend then
dropped back in and failed to respond. RAVENITE broke in and hit the gate, brushed the rail while dropping back early, saved ground on the turn and was
no factor.

Footnotes
MARCO T. got bumped at the start by UNICORN CAKE due to pressure from QUICK POWER NAP, raced three then two wide in pursuit coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied outside rivals to take command a sixteenth from home, then inched clear to the
finish kept to task. QUICK POWER NAP broke out at the start bumping UNICORN CAKE into MARCO T., and then had UNICORN CAKE win the lane and
was forced to steady in behind STOLEN FUTURE when bounced back inwards, conceded about four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure
the place honors. STOLEN FUTURE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive running on to procure the show honors. SUPERS LUCKY LADY vied briefly and led early on briefly before chasing along the inside in closest aim of
the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. ACT OF CONGRESS vied
briefly before establishing sole command inside the five furlong marker and showed the way three then two wide through swift splits under pressure from the
aforementioned foe to the inside, got roused spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, then
weakened and was out-finished in the late going. UNICORN CAKE got bumped at the start by QUICK POWER NAP breaking outwards and in turn bumped
the hind end of MARCO T., before coming back inwards to bump QUICK POWER NAP behind STOLEN FUTURE, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. GRAM chased along the inside under coaxing
from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. CAPITAL GAL chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered no response. BERN ROSEY BERN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, tipped three wide at the top of the stretch, weakened. MIM coaxed from the start, chased along the inside and then
briefly just off the inside, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened.

moved clear under good handling. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE went three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path while between
foes on the far turn, was asked after turning into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly for the place. MAGICAL WAYS

able to get the show. CALL ME HARRY stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, made a bid on the far turn, gained a short lead outside the furlong
marker, lost the advantage into the final furlong and was outfinished. RUSE rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back, dropped
back under urging with three furlongs to run, saved ground on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DUDE N
COLORADO (GB) angled in while hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage inside the
three-sixteenths pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and gave way. PAROS went around the opening bend in the two path, lagged at the rear,
moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CONMAN went three wide on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, raced between foes near the three-sixteenths, was
taken in hand while crowded between horses and tiring near the furlong marker then capitulated. BODECREAM was hustled from the gate, traveled three
wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, chased three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and tired. VACATION DANCE went four

Footnotes
ACCEDE veered out at the start forcing both MORNING MATCHA and JUST KATHERINE to steady in behind when taking over their lanes and bumping
FLYING CONNECTION at the start without correction, ranged up to take brief command from BEGUINE six furlongs from home before being displaced from
command and settling three then two wide in aim, remained patiently handled through the turn and got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch with a clear lane, rallied on through to take command a furlong from home, then dug in being directed out to get a look at JUST KATHERINE closing
outside and held on by a neck at the wire. JUST KATHERINE got pinched and forced to steady at the start when ACCEDE veered out directly in front and
conceded four lengths to the front before recovering, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and closed well with good courage to latch on the top one inside the final seventy yards but was ultimately staved off. HOT FUDGE broke out at the
start bumping SHIDABHUTI, chased in the overland route eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. SHIDABHUTI got bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. FLYING CONNECTION got bumped at the start by the veering out ACCEDE, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. LEAVE NO TRACE seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and bid under coaxing midway, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. MORNING MATCHA got squeezed and forced to steady at the start when ACCEDE veered out directly in front and conceded five lengths to the
front before settling into stride, chased five then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.
APPLE PICKER bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside and then along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and weakened in the late going. BEGUINE showed the way early on six paths off the inside, got headed for the front near the five-eighths
marker and then came again to take back the front near the half mile pole and tucked three wide through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under challenge and got displaced just after shying in from a right handed crop near the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. BIG POND
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, tired.

Footnotes
LATEST EDITION was forwardly placed on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid into upper stretch, inched clear into the final furlong
and held under strong urging. FANCYPANTS JULIANA bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished with good courage to get the place. U SHOULD B DANCING bumped with a rival at
the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, shifted out in upper stretch, came out for room and
nudged DUSK out outside the sixteenth-pole, moved out a bit more then jostled with that foe at the sixteenth-pole and missed the place while clear for
unofficial third position. POSEIDON'S MIST settled near the back, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and improved position.
DUSK was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out while roused in upper stretch, chased the winner
into the final furlong, was nudged out by U SHOULD B DANCING outside the sixteenth-pole, jostled with that rival when she came out a bit more then
checked in tight between horses and lost her best chance. BEACH CRUISER was carried out after the start, settled off the pace, was roused four wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased the leader in the drive and lacked the needed kick. CITY BLOCKS settled off the pace, traveled three wide
on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. KANT CALL IT went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside
on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. VALENTINE GIFT settled towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn and was no factor.
MAGGY'S PALACE hit the outside of the gate at the start, raced well back on the outside, went five wide on the turn and also was no factor.
GHOSTBUSTIN came outwards after the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch and faltered.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF DUSK CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST U SHOULD B DANCING ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
SIXTEENTH-POLE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, U SHOULD B DANCING WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH.
