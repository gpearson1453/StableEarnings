Footnotes
CONFISCATED away alertly, showed early speed then stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, gained a short lead,
then drew clear in the final sixteenth. COAST ALONG dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, yielded to the top pair at the furlong marker, then dug in
gamely on the rail and battled back for the place spot. LIVEHAPPY dueled three wide for the early lead, then between rivals on the turn and into the stretch,
dug in gamely and was outfinished for second. HOLD OUT raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole and lacked a stretch rally. LUCA IL CAVALLO
off a bit slow, outrun early and did not factor. MAXIMATCH dueled between rivals for the early lead, then chased on the turn and gave way.
