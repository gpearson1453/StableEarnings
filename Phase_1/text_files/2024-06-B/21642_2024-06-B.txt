BAK TO LIBERTY away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, quickly collared the pacesetters entering
the final turn, and just as quickly took command and drew clear while being ridden out late to prove much the best. GROOVIN' IS BAK settled at the back of
the compact field while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering he final turn, steadied while looking for room
from between rivals leaving the turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. EXTRA INNINGS away alertly and pressed
the pace from the outside of PENALTY TO RANGERS entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide into the final turn, was quickly
overtaken by BAK TO LIBERTY, and while no threat to that rival, finished determinedly three wide in the drive to garner a share. BARBERRY BANDIT
settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in
the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. PENALTY TO RANGERS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, was overhauled entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

GO away well and settled off the lone pacesetter while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and
finished willingly from along the rail in the drive. I'M SEEING RED dropped back to trail the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. HIGHLINER broke sharply and sprinted to a clear lead
three wide entering the first turn, maintained a clear advantage in the run down the backside, was quickly overtaken leaving the turn, and tired late.

Footnotes
AVANA broke sharply and was taken in hand and allowed to settle at the back of the pack entering the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, quickly took command midway through the turn, and drew clear late while being ridden out in deep
stretch to prove much the best. LONIE MO settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced smartly
midway down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to get up for the place. VIVA LA DIVA was
bumped in the opening strides, but rushed up to vie for the early lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to garner a share. BAKBURNER away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of
VIVA LA DIVA entering the first turn, continued to force the pace two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished three wide in
the lane. FOOTHILLS BLVD. away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside through the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing at the rail in the drive. AMERICAN TSUNAMI was bumped in the opening strides and raced into
a stalking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

AUGUST RAIN broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn,
and closed steadily three wide in the drive to prove best. WEALTHY TEXAN away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
controlled the pace in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while proving second best.
VECTOR away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, saved ground through the final turn while awaiting room,
and closed evenly two wide in the drive to garner a share. MONEYSHOT settled off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. WESTMINSTER was a step slow into stride, and
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly two out from
the rail in the drive. DIOCLES stalked the leader while in tight quarters at the rail entering the first turn, continued to save ground throughout, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. NEWHART unhurried early while dropping back to trail, saved ground through the final turn, but failed to mount
a late bid.

TEXAS LEGACY broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the
final turn, held the narrowest of leads into the lane, and fended off STRIKING VALUE late to prevail. STRIKING VALUE unhurried early while dropping back
to trail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive to just miss. DRILL BABY DRILL away alertly and stalked
the pacesetter into the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the lane to
garner a share. VALERIE VALESKI away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch, held a narrow advantage into the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. ISLAND LIVING stalked the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside from a tracking trip through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon.
