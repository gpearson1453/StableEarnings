Footnotes
BERTACCHI sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, set a contested pace into the turn
and carved out moderate fractions while off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and pulled
away as much the best in deep stretch. CONEJO MALO prominent away from the start, engaged with BERTACCHI in the early running and pressed the
pace outside of that rival heading to the half-mile marker, contested the pace from the three path into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker,
outkicked by BERTACCHI into upper stretch, was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch for second. BEAU BRUME
broke alertly, was forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the early pace from inside of the leading pair, was well placed into the turn and chased
the moderate pace two wide nearing the quarter marker, shifted three wide into upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker, needed more into the
final sixteenth and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. TRIANGLE got squeezed at the start and was off slowly, rushed up in the early
stages and tracked the moderate pace from the inside, raced along the two path into the turn and chased approaching the quarter marker, lacked a
response into the stretch and passed a tiring rival in the final furlong. TOP WOLF raced close up to the moderate early pace while a bit keen, tracked three
wide into the turn, weakened in the stretch drive and could not muster a late response. UPDRAFT lacked early speed, was guided two wide along the turn
and was outrun to the quarter marker, swung wide for the stretch drive and did not factor in the late stages. HE'S TRUE BLUE broke in at the start and
bothered a neighboring rival, lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn and was outrun. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
KEEP MOVIN' ON was allowed to settle into stride then held up through the first turn, tracked the two leaders from the four to five path down the backstretch
always traveling well, was nudged a little to get closer to the leader and responded then was set down in earnest to challenge RIGHT HAND RYDER at the
top of the stretch, found that rival resurgent, kept on under strong handling, gained the upper hand inside the final sixteenth and prevailed. RIGHT HAND
RYDER was sent for the lead from the break and joined ROLLIN DICE through the turn to set the early pace, took command coming out of the first turn and
led the field through modest fractions down the backstretch, tried to sprint away from the field from the five-sixteenths pole but was tackled to the outside by
KEEP MOVIN' ON, battled that foe the length of the stretch and gave way grudgingly just yards from the wire. ADIOS NICANOR raced close up on the
inside through the first turn, settled into a stalking position mid-race, moved a bit closer going into the last turn, had to wait behind horses approaching the
three furlong pole and lost some position, ran on when asked, swung five wide into the stretch, was no threat to the top two but gained third with large
margin back to the next horse. TOUCH OF ZEN settled near the rear of the compact field through the first half-mile, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths
marker, came into the stretch five or six wide then lugged in sharply in upper stretch then raced erratically the rest of the journey under right handed urging.
WESTERN CAPE was last into the first turn then raced in the back of the field but not far from the front in a tightly bunched field, attempted to launch a bid
from the five-sixteenths pole but was unable to make any headway, was kept to task but was no threat down the stretch. ROLLIN DICE broke through the
gate before the start, reloaded then veered outward shortly after the start, went to the front, traded punches with RIGHT HAND RYDER through the early
going then gave way midway through the far turn, was eased through the stretch drive and walked off under his own power. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GOOD LOVIN broke alertly, assumed early command then was engaged by DRIVE BY and contested the moderate pace with that rival heading to the
half-mile marker, was well rated while disputing the pace three to four wide into the turn, shook free into the stretch, edged away in the final furlong, was
hand ridden into the final sixteenth and was geared down in the late stages to hold sway. BOLD ENCOUNTER broke a step slowly away from the start,
recovered to be forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate pace while saving ground into the turn, loomed along the inside nearing the
quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in the late stages for
second. MR BIG BUCKS allowed to settle in the early stages while never far back, tracked the moderate pace two wide into the turn, angled out into the
stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and outfinished DRIVE BY in deep stretch to secure show honors. DRIVE BY
hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early running and contested the pace inside of GOOD LOVIN nearing the half-mile marker, took a narrow
lead along the bend and disputed the pace two to three wide and between rivals nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked into upper stretch, weakened in
the final furlong and was outfinished for third. DRUM BUNNY broke out at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early running, guided two to
three wide nearing the quarter marker, advanced into the stretch but could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth. HOT CAKE prominent away from the
start, chased the moderate early pace from the outside, was well placed approaching the turn and ran in pursuit four to five wide nearing the quarter marker,
could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CORACORACORA tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was guided to two path into the turn and loomed nearing the quarter marker, vied for the
lead into upper stretch, took command then drifted out approaching the furlong pole, held a narrow lead past mid-stretch, dug in into the final sixteenth and
kept KNIGHTWITHLOUIS at bay in deep stretch to determinedly prevail. KNIGHTWITHLOUIS chased the decent early pace, went four wide into the turn
and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, was crowded approaching mid-stretch by the drifting
CORACORACORA, gamely battled that rival into the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for
second. RUNNIN ON PROMISES showed good early speed away from the start and assumed early command, sped to a clear lead and set a decent pace
into the turn, was pressured while between rivals nearing the quarter marker and was overtaken into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch drive and was
clear at the finish for third. RECYCLEYOURHEART a bit slow into stride away from the start, chased the decent pace from the outside heading into the turn,
gained ground five wide nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch and could not muster the needed response in the final furlong.
BEACHLEY lacked early speed, was guided two wide into the turn and did not threaten. CHATTY LEROYBROWN took back off of the decent early pace,
raced greenly approaching the turn, saved ground into the bend, shifted to the two path nearing the quarter marker and trailed through the stretch drive.
THE RIDER OF KNIGHTWITHLOUIS LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF CORACORACORA FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SMILING LADY stumbled coming out of the gate, recovered quickly and was sent to the front, rated kindly on the lead racing in the three path while always
keeping the others a length or two behind, turned for home still in hand, responded when roused passing the three-sixteenths pole and won clear geared
down in the end. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) settled behind the leader racing in the four path, waited until the quarter pole to launch a challenge but proved no
match for the winner while being kept to task to hold on to the second position. WORK TO LIVE tracked well behind the pacesetter racing in the three to four
path, bided time and held position to the far turn, made a mild late run to gain the third spot but was otherwise never a threat. SHANGHAI MIST got a
perfect on the inside about two off the rail, was still in contention at the top of the stretch but was outkicked down the stretch. TURIAF was unhurried from
the break and took an inside path through the first turn, then was content to race at the back of the compact field down the backstretch, began to lose
contact with the field after passing the half-mile marker, stayed to the inside, was kept to task passed one in the final furlong. KIKI KRAZY stumbled at the
start then was caught three wide going into the first turn, went mid-pack down the backstretch still racing wide, tried to rally from the three furlong pole but
did not go on and tired in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TESORO allowed to settle, raced inside mid-pack, saved some ground through the turn then bid with several others passing the quarter pole, got a nice
seam to run through at the top of the stretch produced a grinding finish under steady handling and intermittent urging and wore down MURPHYS TIGER just
yards from the finish line. MURPHYS TIGER was away alertly and took up a tracking position behind the dueling leaders, made a bid to challenge for the
lead near the quarter pole turning four wide into the stretch, took the lead at the sixteenth pole, finished well but could not hold off the winner. IDAHO ONCE
broke sharply and dueled inside of DRIVER'S ED to the turn, was taken on by a trio of challengers at the quarter pole, responded when roused passing the
quarter pole and came into the stretch with a short lead, gave up the lead passing the furlong marker but kept on under good courage to hold third.
TRINIDAD lacked any early speed and was far behind in the early going, stayed to the inside through the turn, made a mild rally into contention up the rail in
the stretch but lacked the winning punch. DRIVER'S ED broke well and dueled through the early fractions to the outside of IDAHO ONCE, was beset by
challengers near the quarter pole and did not go on as the field turned for home and had little to offer down the stretch. LOVE CANDY reserved from the
break, raced near the rear of the field early, went into a drive before the three furlong pole, encountered a wall of horses in upper stretch, was unable to
switch to the outside, checked near the furlong marker and lost all chance at that point. YES HE CAN broke a step slow but recovered to race with the
tracking group but out in the five path down the backstretch, continued wide through the turn, launched a rally from the five-sixteenths pole but could not
sustain the bid and was outfinished down the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

maintained an inside path into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was full of run past mid-stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, came within aim
in deep stretch and got up in the final strides to prevail. CLARINA showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a solid pace
while pressured nearing the half-mile marker, set a contested pace while two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and led to
the furlong marker, was kept to task and dug in while leading into the final sixteenth, was caught in deep stretch by the winner and held safely at the finish
for second. PERKINS prominent away from the start, pressed the early pace from the outside, was guided three to four wide into the turn and disputed the
solid pace nearing the quarter marker, chased CLARINA into the stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held clearly at the finish for third. ANN
LOVES MARK was forwardly placed in the early running, chased the solid pace into the turn and advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, could not
keep pace at the furlong pole, mildly re-rallied in the final sixteenth but needed more in deep stretch. CLARE'S BABY rated off of the solid early pace while
never far back, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, angled out into upper stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, re-rallied in
the late stages but needed more. PARTHENA tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, ran in pursuit three wide nearing the quarter marker, was
outrun into the stretch and lacked a late response. ARA was forwardly placed in the early running, chased the solid pace and was guided three wide into the
turn, advanced at the quarter marker, dropped back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. GIRL ON HOLIDAY lacked early speed, was guided two to
three wide along the turn and did not factor. LIGHTS OF LONDON tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and was
guided two wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and stopped in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ASCENDANCY broke well but opted to cede the lead to LIBERAL LADY then was patiently ridden in close attendance to the slow pace for the first half-mile,
saved ground through the far turn then tipped out a path to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, dueled with a resurgent foe to deep stretch while being
floated out to the middle of the track, gained the upper hand in the final yards to prevail. LIBERAL LADY broke well, got to the lead before the first turn and
attempted to slow down the pace, kept a length or two ahead of PRINCESA DEL TIGRE and ASCENDANCY turning down the backstretch, held the lead
through the far turn while quickening the pace, met the challenge posed by that same pair of rivals at the quarter pole, had a short lead in the stretch while
drifting out under left handed urging then gave way inside the final sixteenth. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE stalked the slow pace set by LIBERAL LADY through
the early stages while racing in the three to four path, advanced through the far turn then was on the outside as three horse bid for the lead passing the
quarter pole, checked briefly and altered course in deep stretch could not recover but easily held third. DELUSIVELY raced at the rear of the leading group
through the early stages, started to lose some ground passing the half-mile pole as the pace of the race quickened, went into a drive and finished evenly
towards the inside but was not quite good enough despite a solid effort. BOLD DAUGHTER had no early speed and dropped far behind before the first turn,
continued to lose ground as the race progressed could do no better than chase the field home. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BIG SPIN unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the far turn, got
caught in tight and checked nearing the quarter marker, angled four wide into upper stretch, split rivals and gained command at the furlong pole, dug in
while under pressure from CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN into the final sixteenth, kept to task into deep stretch and held the runner-up at bay in the final strides to
determinedly prevail. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN allowed to settle in the early running, maintained a two wide path into the first turn and advanced along the
backstretch run, raced three wide into the second turn and loomed nearing the quarter pole, was carried out a bit into upper stretch and swung five wide for
the drive, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, gamely battled BIG SPIN past mid-stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final sixteenth and
was clear at the finish for second. MR. T'S THIRSTY was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early leading pair from a three wide position
along the first turn, well placed nearing the half-mile pole, was roused four wide into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, vied for the lead
into the stretch, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the top two in deep stretch and held safely at the finish for third.
MOTHER'S PRAYER allowed to settle in the early going, advanced along the backstretch, mounted a four wide bid into the far turn, chased five wide into
the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, could not muster a final response and flattened out in deep stretch. STONE'S RIVER broke alertly and
assumed early command, set a pressured pace from the three path into the first turn, carved out moderate fractions while prompted to the half-mile,
maintained a three wide path into the far turn and lost the lead at the quarter pole, chased into the stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong marker and
gave way in the final stages. BIG FLAME unhurried in the early running, raced three wide into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, was guided
widest into the far turn and mounted a four to five wide bid at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
TRIBAL NATION hustled away from the start, was prominent into the first turn and contested the early pace from a two wide path, prompted the moderate
pace along the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn and disputed the pace nearing the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch, stopped in
the final furlong and was not persevered with in the late stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE ACTIONS OF BIG SPIN AND
CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN ALONG THE SECOND TURN. IN A MAJORITY DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN
THE ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THOSE ACTIONS. THERE WAS ALSO A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CONTRARY
CHIEFTAIN AGAINST THE RIDER OF BIG SPIN, AND THAT OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
