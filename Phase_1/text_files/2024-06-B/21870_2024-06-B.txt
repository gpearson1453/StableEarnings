Footnotes
BREVILLE was fractious in the starting gate, broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the solid pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker,
advanced into the turn and pressed the pace three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch and took command nearing the
furlong pole, drew to a clear lead into the final sixteenth and held safely in a drive at the finish. HARNEY LANE was a step slow leaving the start, chased the
solid early pace from the inside, shifted outside of rivals and chased three to four wide along the turn, ran in pursuit while widest into the stretch, closed into
the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was second best. CHANNEL OF LOVE sent to establish the early lead, set a solid pace
heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms from the two path into the turn, was pressed by BREVILLE nearing the quarter marker and met that rival's
bid into upper stretch, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole, faded in the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. MOON RUSH hustled away
from the start, chased the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn, lost position at the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the
stretch and gave way. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BROTHER O' BRIEN was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the early pace four wide into the backstretch run, stalked the modest pace from
between runners nearing the half-mile, maintained a three wide path while between rivals into the far turn, drifted out a bit into upper stretch and battled for
the lead heading to the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, wore down rivals in deep stretch and won the nod on the wire to prevail.
IT AINT OVER unhurried in the early going, raced widest into the first turn and went four to five wide into the backstretch run, tracked the modest pace while
widest through the backstretch run, chased four wide into the second turn and was asked for run at the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch,
took a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker, drifted in inside of the sixteenth-marker, dug in into deep stretch and was nailed on the wire for the win, while
holding for the place honors. REGAL REDWOOD broke alertly and assumed early command, set the pace from the three path into the first turn, set modest
fractions into the backstretch run and extended the lead at the half-mile, was pressured into the far turn and battled into upper stretch, lost the lead nearing
the furlong pole, fought on stubbornly into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. GATO DE
VEGAS tracked the early pace from an inside position, settled along the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the far turn, chased the modest pace
from the two path approaching the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch and did not offer a late response. This race was originally hand timed and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MAJOR TOM away from the gate a step slowly, rushed up and contested the decent early pace outside of MY DOMINATOR, pressed the pace from the
three path entering the turn and kept close attendance nearing the quarter pole, battled MY DOMINATOR into upper stretch, dueled past the furlong marker,
drew to even terms into the final sixteenth, wore down MY DOMINATOR in deep stretch and got up in the final strides to prevail. MY DOMINATOR sent
leaving the start, assumed early command then was engaged by MAJOR TOM and set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the
turn while inside of MAJOR TOM, held a narrow lead over that rival into upper stretch, dueled on even terms with MAJOR TOM into the final sixteenth, was
gamely bested in deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for second. MY BUCKET LIST away in good order, took back off of the moderate early pace
and tracked the leading pair heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed into the turn and stalked the pace three wide nearing the quarter marker,
chased into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong pole, could not impact the top two in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. HALF THROTTLE
threw his head at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not factor in
the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GERLACH'S was allowed to settle into stride the pushed some to keep close to the pace, kept to the inside through the turn then came into the stretch to
the inside of EVENEREEVENWORSE, took command in upper stretch and won clear under steady handling and intermittent urging. ESTABLISHED lacked
speed despite being pushed hard from the break, raced mid-pack through the turn still behind ridden to keep pace, tipped out to the six path for the stretch
run, continued to advance under a drive and was along in time to gain the place. EVENEREVENWORSE broke outward and made light contact with OUR
BOLD PRINCE but was still quickest away and opened up a clear lead before going a furlong, held sway while racing in the three or four path well off the
rail, left the inside open for GERLACH'S, battled back briefly when that one came to challenge at the top of the lane, but was unable to go on, weakened in
the final yards and was passed for the place. OUR BOLD PRINCE took a bump at the start from EVENEREVENWORSE then lacked early speed raced
near the back of the tracking group, kept that path through the turn then finished willingly but just missed out on a minor award. HONEYMOONZ OVER was
prominent to the quarter pole made a mild bid, could not keep up then came up empty in the stretch. RUNKERRY stumbled badly at the start, spotting the
field a head start, chased to the turn, could not make an improvement but kept to task in the stretch but could not improve. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUPERNAL away in good order, took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground while never far back heading to the half-mile marker, shifted to the
outside entering the turn, stalked three wide nearing the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the stretch and loomed nearing the furlong pole, collared
TIGER IN MY TANK at mid-stretch, kept to task into the final sixteenth and edged away while clear into deep stretch. TIGER IN MY TANK forwardly placed
away from the start, stalked the decent early pace outside of the leading pair, chased three wide into the turn, advanced to press the pace along the bend,
gained command at the quarter marker and led into upper stretch, was confronted then overtaken by SUPERNAL nearing the furlong marker, could not
match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well for second in deep stretch. NAFTIS stumbled sharply at the start and was off slowly,
trailed in the early stages and was unhurried nearing the half-mile marker, was guided three to four wide into the turn and trailed approaching the quarter
pole, widest into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, could not make further headway into the final sixteenth and was well clear at the finish for
third. THIRSTY THURSDAY prominent away from the start, chased the decent early pace from between rivals, contested the pace entering the turn, lost
position leaving the three-eighths and chased from the inside heading to the quarter pole, gave way into the stretch and could muster a late response. KING
AND COUNTRY sent to establish the early lead, set a decent pace while pressured heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn, was
overtaken by TIGER IN MY TANK nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into upper stretch and faded in the drive. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MARK LOVES ANN got bumped by MAJESTIC COTTON at the break but set out after that one pressing the pace all the way to the stretch, took a short
lead then ducked out sharply approaching the furlong marker then ducked in sharply trying to correct, managed to hold on to win despite the detour.
MAJESTIC COTTON veered out after the break and bumped MARK LOVES ANN then was hustled to the front with MARK LOVES ANN in close pursuit to
the outside, tried to break away from that one near the seven-sixteenths pole only to have that foe re-engage, did battle the rest of the way, weakened a bit
mid-stretch but held on well to hold second. HOT GOBLIN tracked the dueling leaders on the inside of the trio sitting just behind, raced between horses
down the backstretch and through the turn then tipped out in to the clear in the four path for the stretch run, finished evenly under a steady drive but was not
quite good enough. FINCAIRN took the better part of the first furlong to get into a good rhythm then made mild improvement through the turn, had clear run
turning for home but could not improve while under heavy pressure down the stretch. FORD FLYER raced close up on the outside of three horses tracking
the pacesetters, was set down with about three furlongs to run but did not respond and ran one-paced the rest of the way. HARTMAN stumbled at the start,
dropped far behind early, trailed throughout, saved ground to no avail and was never a factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
