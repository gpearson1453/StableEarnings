Footnotes
J L PAC MAN sped off to a quick early lead, widened the advantage while setting a rapid pace, drifted out down the lane and just held on. MICHAEL'S
MOON tracked the leader through the turn, rallied from five wide in the stretch, steadily gained ground on the winner and came up just short at the wire.
WAY OUT FRONT stalked the pacesetting winner through the turn, rallied in the lane to be gaining but did not have enough and was out-finished in deep
stretch. RITE ON SAM raced mid-pack in the clear from four wide and failed to mount a closing bid. KANT CONQUER ME went evenly lacking a closing
kick. STAR APRIORITY hesitated at the start to be last away and lacked a response when called upon on the bend. OUTWORKALLDAY slow away from
the gate to give the field several lengths early and was never a threat. CUPCAKE COWBOY was never a factor.

Footnotes
ROLL GYPSY ROLL tracked the leaders from three wide into the turn, rallied on the bend to engage the leaders at the head of the lane and continued to
advance steadily to pull clear in the lane. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW stalked the pace from the inside, cut the corner turning for home to loom boldly in upper
stretch and was outkicked in the drive. MISS DARLENE unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, angled six wide in upper stretch and mounted a good
belated rally. FASTED rated in mid-pack and mounted a mild bid in the lane. DRE ME LESS pressed the pace to midway on the turn, assumed command
nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. RYAN'S GRACE went evenly without imapct. MACEE dueled on the lead for a half mile and came up
empty. HOLY WAR was not a factor.

Footnotes
ONE LINE RULER pressed the pace from the rail to midway on the turn, assumed command before the quarter pole, pulled clear in upper stretch and held
the challengers safe through the lane. TALKABOUT reserved well off the pace in the early going, angled seven wide turning for home and rallied gamely on
the outside to be up for the place. ADIAMONDINTHESTORM rated in mid-pack through the turn and made a steady gain from between rivals to close
willingly. ANSLIE'S GUMDROP rallied on the turn to gain position, angled five wide turning for home and continued to advance grinding through the stretch.
RAISE THE ALARM stalked the pace from three wide to the head of the lane and flattened out. TAKEN IT slow early to drop back well off the pack and
passed tiring rivals in the lane. SHARE THE DOE pressed the pace to the quarter pole and gave way. CHARGED UP ROSE flashed brief speed to be the
pacesetter and came up empty.

Footnotes
EL ORIENTE (CHI) tracked the leaders to the far turn, ralied four wide on the bend to take command and drew away in the lane unchallenged.
SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE stalked the pace from a clear pocket down the backside, was set to an early drive on the far turn and kept trying in the lane to be
second best. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE reserved off the pace to be near the rear of the field down the backside, rallied on the turn splitting horses to be
prominent in upper stretch and finsihed evenly unable to sustain the rally. KENTUCKY PEERLESS dueled on the lead for five-eighths, battled on while
unable to go with the winner and weakened late in the drive. BIZZY LEGS pressed the pace from the fence through the first turn, continued to press down
the backside and tired on the final turn. GOTTATAKEHIMTO was not a threat.

Footnotes
CHARLI MICHAEL sped to the lead down the backside, widened the advantage when called upon turning for home and drew off unchallenged. LIKEN IT
prompted the pace to midway on the turn, could not go with the winner but kept-on willingly through the lane to be second best. HOORAY AUSTIN steadied
at the start when he lugged in to be off his inside rival's heels, raced mid-pack while reserved to midway on the turn and made a steady gain through the
stretch. FLOWER CAT stalked the pace through the turn and lacked a closing bid. UNFATHOMED unhurried in the early going, saved ground with a mild
bid without impact. MARK THE MOOSE went evenly lacking a closing rally. AMERICAN SMOOTH was one-paced. SECRET VISTA was not a factor. VERB
tracked the pace from a contending position to the quarter pole and gave way.

COCAL slowly away to trail early, remained unhurried for the run down the backside, swept up from four wide to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and
prevailed in a determined drive. CLASSIC RUNNER reserved off the pace for the first half mile, rallied up the fence on the far turn, tipped out three wide
splitting rivals and closed well through the lane. ZIPPY TOGA unhurried in the early going, rallied on the far turn circling five wide and finished willingly in the
lane. STRUTTIN APRIORITY rated in mid-pack to the final turn, saved ground cutting the corner turning for home and made a mild bid in the stretch. TALK
OF THE TOWN raced in mid-field down the backside, was urgerd early into the turn and showed some interest in the stretch. TRIPLE RED ACES pressed
the pace early, assumed command into the final turn, kept-on to mid-stretch and weakened late in the lane. WELCOMETOARKANSAS tracked the leaders
from three wide and failed to sustain. GONE ELVIS tracked the leaders from the inside and flattened out. KING OF SONG rushed to the lead from the rail
for a hlf mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
COURTMAN tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied five wide to engage the pacesetters in deep stretch and prevailed late in the drive. DRILLING REPORT
reserved off the pace through the turn and closed well belatedly through the lane to be second best. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN pressed the pace from two
wide to mid-stretch and was out-finished late in the lane. GUITAR DOCTOR set a pressured pace to midway down the lane and weakened late. KAJUN
KARMA trailed to the top of the lane and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. HARDLY ABLE stalked the pace from the fence and faded through the lane.
BIND FAITH rated in mid-pack down the backside, made an early bid rallying four wide and flattened out coming home. TRUVY'S BANDIT was not a threat.
