Footnotes
SIXWILLBERICH showed the way in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, inched clear of that one approaching the lane and held firm from an
inner bidder. QUEBRANCHO stalked close up along the inside under a snug hold around the first turn, took aim inside of the leader in upper stretch, inched
closer to bid in the final furlong but was kept at bay. MASTER OF THE NITE prompted outside of the leader and from the four to three path around the first
turn, came under urging to sustain pressure with three furlongs to go, failed to do so nearing the lane, lost place to an inner rival leaving the furlong grounds
and kept on through the late stages. AMERICAN RAIDER settled off of the pace in the four to three path and between horses around the first turn, tucked to
the inside around the far turn, improved past an outer rival entering the lane, shifted out to the four path entering upper stretch and ran on. COAL BOSS
tracked two wide and between horses, chased the top pair form the three path around the far turn and tired. SKY KEY broke a beat slow, pursued from the
five to four path around the first turn and faded around the far turn. RIGHT ON TARGET broke a step slow and was last away, tugged keenly behind horses
while trailing in the two path around the first turn and was through early.

Footnotes
PURSE THIEF transferred light contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, raced forwardly along the inside, backed off an outer pair of rivals to
chased outside of them around the turn, ranged up in the four path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds and
inched clear. CONCRETE CRUISER took a brush from an outer rival at the start, tracked the main flight from the two path, cut the corner entering the lane,
advanced shifting to the three path in midstretch and ran on to gain place at the wire. BEIJING BOSS brushed an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside
of a pressing foe into the turn, disposed of that rival as a wider bidder took aim entering the lane, dug in to resist that one's bid in upper stretch, but yielded
to him in the final furlong, lost place in the shadow of the wire and narrowly saved show. BRERETON'S BAYTOWN broke a step slow while last away,
advanced outside of rivals approaching the turn, bumped an inner rival while tucking from the seven path entering the bend, chased four wide turning for
home before floating back to the five path entering the lane, then kept on mildly but missed show at the wire. AKINMUSIRE was reluctant to load, then broke
a beat slow, trailed in the three path into the bend, advanced between horses turning for home, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and willingly
sustained progress. FINANCIAL WHIZ prompted outside of the leader but faded between horses entering the lane. REB raced off of the pace, bumped with
an outer rival entering the turn in the five path, got floated from the four path to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. TURNBUCKLE pursued
from off of the pace in the six path, was bumped between horses and steadied back into the turn, trailed in the five to seven path around the bend, drifted in
entering upper stretch and made little impact. NO MOR STONES tracked in the four to three path into the turn, but faded between horses turning for home.
SPIRIT RAGS saved ground off of the pace and made little impact.

Footnotes
END OF INNOCENCE set a clear pace into and around the turn, met an outer challenge entering the lane, repelled that bidder in upper stretch and drove
clear. DESPO'S DREAM chased from midpack along the inside, then ran on to edge place from an outer rival in the shadow of the wire. BOLD APPEAL
stalked outside of the clear leader, ranged up to bid entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch and lost place to an inner bidder in the closing
stages. PATTY VAN TWINKLE was off a bit awkwardly and forced outwardly by an inner rival at the start, tucked to pursue along the inside, advanced
tipping two to three wide turning for home, inched show entering the lane, but vied with an inner rival for that position in upper stretch, lost it at the furlong
grounds and flattened out. HEDGE THESE BETS was floated out and forced to bump an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted
to the five path entering upper stretch and failed to factor. GALADINI came out multiple paths at the start, tracked tucking two wide into the turn, then faded
between horses entering the lane. SWEET LILIBET broke a beat slow and was bumped by an inner rival soon after the start, trailed in the four path and got
outrun.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE TARGET pursued from midpack in the three to four path and between horses around the first turn, shifted outside of rivals and to the five path
with five furlongs to go, came under urging at the three furlong pole, sustained pursuit entering the lane, shifted down four wide while inching closer at the
furlong grounds, ranged up to bid in the final sixteenth and edged past in the closing stages. BLACK POWDER pressed the leader from the three path, bid
along with an outer rival at the three furlong pole, forged a narrow advantage turning for home, vied with inner rivals into midstretch, but had a hind heel
clipped by a trailing rival leaving the furlong grounds, fought on gamely between horses but got outfinished. PHANTOM RIDE stalked along the inside,
awaited racing room behind the leaders and in the two path around the far turn, inched closer to bid inside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, vied into
deep stretch, but got outfinished by a wider bidder and missed place. INEXORABLE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, took closer order with
five furlongs to go, searched for racing room just behind the leaders into midstretch, got hemmed in by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, clipped the hind
heels of a leading rival leaving that station, steadied yet recovered quickly passing the sixteenth pole, and kept on to gain fourth. BACKGROUND set the
pace in the two path, vied with a pair of outer bidders while getting headed turning for home, fought on through midstretch as an inner challenger joined the
fray, but yielded when put to tight quarters between foes at the sixteenth pole and lost fourth late. MASTER GAME trailed in the four path, shifted to the six
path into upper stretch and moved up. O P FIRECRACKER laid off of the pace along the inside, awaited racing room behind rivals around the far turn, but
lacked a rally. PERFECT FLIGHT pursued from midpack in the four to five path, tucked back to the four path at the five furlong pole, bid outside of the top
pair around the far turn, but yielded in upper stretch, checked hard when crowded among foes at the furlong grounds and weakened.

Footnotes
LITE IT UP LOUIE tracked from midpack in the three to four path, ranged up to take aim on the new leader entering the lane, bid and wrestled an advantage
passing the furlong grounds then inched clear. SHERBET FOUNTAIN broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, swept
past them leaving the three furlong pole to draw clear turning for home, but hung on her left lead as an outer rival menaced in upper stretch, got caught by
that one leaving the furlong grounds and was second best. MOTOWN MIKA bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path whlie
a bit keen down the backstretch, pursued in the four path turning for home, gained show entering the lane and secured that position. QUIERO DINERO
broke a touch outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the lane, moved up
between horses in upper stretch but leveled off leaving the furlong grounds. VIRASANA was sandwiched between horses at the start, laid off of the pace
shifting to the five path into the turn, then ran on mildly but failed to menace. R QUEEN CANDY broke a step slow, stalked along the inside, got shuffled
back behind a tiring rival turning for home, shifted two wide entering the lane and lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. COLLECT A LIL broke slowly,
trailed in the three path, swung out to the eight path into upper stretch and failed to factor. ALMOND FUDGE vied along the inside clinging to a short
advantage into the turn, got headed by an outer bidder at the three furlong pole, chased that clearing rival turning for home and faded. DO YOU REALIZE
bobbled subtly and leaned outwardly upon recovery at the start, vied two wide, got outmoved by an outer bidder at the three furlong pole and weakened
between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
PURE FORCE set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure into the turn, disposed of that one before a wider rival challenged entering the
lane, repelled that bidder in upper stretch, shook free and drew off under a drive. DISCREET MISCHIEF settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to
the seven path to bid outside of rivals entering the final furlong, then offered a late kick to reach place in the closing stages. EDIFIED broke a step slow,
stalked outside of the leading pair and from the four path, ranged up to bid entering the lane, but was turned away by the eventual winner in upper stretch,
vied place between horses through the final furlong but got outfinished by an outer bidder. RISK IT stalked along the inside, vied for place with outer rivals
while chasing into midstretch, but was bested. MISSION BEACH broke a step slow, tracked in the four to five path, chased drifting to the six path in upper
stretch, got outkicked by an outer rival in the final sixteenth and lacked a bid. EPIC BATTLE pressed the leader from the three path, got outmoved by a
wider bidder turning for home and gave way between horses entering the lane. MAGIC GRANT trailed in the four path and got outrun.

GRAY'S FABLE pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked in the two path around the far turn, swung out to the six path to take aim outside of the
leaders in upper stretch, ranged up and wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, then held from an inner persistent rival. RECKONING FORCE
tracked two to three wide around the first turn, ranged up in the five path entering the lane, bid along with an outer rival reaching midstretch, but got
outkicked passing the furlong grounds, fought on gamely thereafter but was kept at bay. GEORGIE W set a clear pace, dug in to resist outer challenges
while in the three path in upper stretch, got bested by a pair of them at the furlong grounds and secured show. DEER DISTRICT stalked outside of the clear
leader, bid in the four path in upper stretch, vied as an outer pair joined the fray nearing midstretch, got outkicked by them at the furlong grounds and
yielded. GENTLE SOUL rated at the rear two wide, shifted from the three path to the five path while between horses entering upper stretch, and moved up.
EL KABONG saved ground well back to no avail. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) tracked along the inside, chased in the two path entering the lane and gave way.
RISK MANAGER was slow into stride, trailed along the inside, tipped to the four path entering the lane and failed to factor. AMERICAN DIAMOND laid off of
the pace in the two to three path, drifted out to the five to six path in upper stretch and faded.

UP ON THE EDGE stalked three wide, bid outside of the clear leader in midstretch, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole and inched ahead. GEORGIA
ON E'SMIND set the pace along the inside, held sway through midstretch, but was collared at the sixteenth pole and got bested. QUEEN ANNA T bumped
