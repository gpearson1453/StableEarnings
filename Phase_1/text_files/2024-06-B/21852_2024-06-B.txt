Footnotes
HOT OMELET watched the engaged duo at the half, sat all alone measuring the contesting pair on the turn, loomed a menacing presence in the three path
straightening out for home and wore down the leader in the final strides for the win. HOBBIE CLASS seized the lead from the break, dueled outside for the
front by the half, continued to press outside around the bend, poked her head in front with rivals on either side at the furlong marker and gave way
grudgingly in deep stretch. HEKLA'S AURA could see this compact bunch in the two path with four furlongs from home, had to be throttled down for a few
strides at the quarter pole losing momentum, angled out to the three path for the drive and was closing smartly on the leaders in deep stretch but had to
settle for the show money in the end. THATSITTHATSALL was off just a slight step slow compared to the rest, tracked on the rail down the backside, settled
on the fence stalking in the third flight through the bend, was in range just behind the leaders in upper stretch shifting out to the three path but could not find
more and was one paced to the wire. TIME TO WATCH poked her head in front on the rail at the half mile marker, dueled inside maintaining a slim
advantage around the turn, battled briefly inside at the top of the lane but yielded on the fence in the final sixteenth. ROOKIE COURT was five deep outside
rivals at the half in a stalking position, settled on the outside near the back three wide through the turn, split runners finding a seam in the two path with two
furlongs to go but failed to reach contention running down the lane. PRACTICAL GIZMO tracked between horses in the four path down the back straight,
travelled three wide outside foes stalking in the third flight around the bend, was ridden for more by the quarter pole, swung out widest in the five path
turning for home but lacked a finish in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CLEOMENES was nestled on the rail in midfield down the backstretch, began to inch closer on the dueling pair through the turn, shifted to the four path at
the top of the lane and surged late to outfinish others in deep stretch to get up in time for the victory. NORTHERN RUBY watched the frontrunner down the
backside, pressed the issue outside around the bend, bid three wide up top entering the stretch between rivals and fought on gamely to the wire, just
missing at the finish line for the win. LOIS LEN was under a snug hold while loose on the lead down the backstretch, set the pace while hounded outside on
the turn, was determinedly clinging onto the lead inside in upper stretch, was no match for the closing rivals late and faded at the seventy-yard pole to save
third money at the wire. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE was ahead of one rival along the backside, had a quick turn of foot moving well throughout the turn, angled
out widest in the six path to threaten straightening out for the drive, could not sustain the rally and stalled in deep stretch. MIZZEN ASH was checked briefly
leaving the chute, regrouped to track in mid-division three wide outside horses by the half, took closer order three wide around the bend, shifted out five
wide with horses on both sides to be in the hunt turning for home but had little left by the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. ANTIGONE tracked the
pace three wide between foes down the backside, was roused three eighths out but was going the wrong way on the turn, swung out widest in the five path
for the drive but had no finish to offer down the lane. GABBY SQUARED was unhurried to trail the field on the rail down the backstraight, could not get
interested taking the shortest way around on the turn and could not be a factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH TALK tracked outside in the first turn, comfortably watched the top two rivals along the backside, closed in three wide to bid at the quarter pole,
seized control in the four path turning for home, did not switch leads until late but still won going away through the lane. MOMENT OF PEACE to command
from the start, set an even pace down the back straight, was collared outside midway on the far turn, was no match for the big favorite winner by mid-stretch
but did stay on to best the rest easily at the finish line. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN was ahead of one foe in the early stages, started to mount a rally on the rail
five sixteenths out, shifted to the three path extending his stride at the top of the lane and closed in the stretch to be a distant third at the wire. SCAT
FACTOR stalked outside in the third flight into the first bend, was encouraged left handed seven sixteenths from the wire, made little run on the final turn
and finished up mildly to re-rally for a minor role in the end. CANTUCCI settled on the rail behind the leader in the first turn, travelled on the fence in mid
pack down the backside, could not keep up even though was urged three furlongs out and had little to offer in the stretch drive. PERFECT PLAY was
allowed to settle, trailing in the first turn, continued at the rear down the backside and passed a weary runner in deep stretch. NOVA FOLHA was content to
keep a close eye on the frontrunner in the early going, moved in between foes to battle for the lead with five sixteenths from home, dueled through upper
stretch, had little left to give by the furlong marker and emptied out with a sixteenth to run.

LIKE THE KING exchanged a light bump at the start, settled mid-pack inside, saved ground on the turn, came out four to five wide in upper stretch, surged
late to get up near the wire. IRONSTONE bumped with a foe at the start, was well-placed inside close to the lead, continued to track in behind late on the
turn seeking room, came out three wide in upper stretch, made a bid in mid-stretch, led till late but was outfinished. JOURNEYMAN settled outside off the
pace, swung six wide into upper stretch moving out a bit further then angling in as rivals continued to drift out, kept on late but needed more. RAPTOR'S
(BRZ) bumped with a rival at the start, was prominent early between foes then eased back and switched out stalking three wide into the turn, bid at the
five-sixteenths with the lead, drifted out throughout the stretch and was outkicked. SKY'S NOT FALLING stalked outside mid-pack into the turn, began to
advance three wide on that bend reaching striking distance by the top of the stretch and having swung five wide, was carried out by a drifting foe through the
lane and had no extra. LUCKMAN unhurriedly brought up the rear, angled out at the top of the stretch, was never a threat. CLEAR DESTINATION raced
toward the back, swung seven wide turning for home, failed to menae. J P HELLISH exchanged a bump at the start, set the pace from off the rail, gave way.

Footnotes
SUMMER SNOW led from the onset, dictated terms with only mild pressure coming from the outside around the turn, spurted away at the top of the stretch
and under a hand ride held safe by a diminishing margin for the score at the finish line. GIVE ME THE BOOTS tracked on the rail in the beginning, was
reined back off the front pair at the half, kept pace on the rail in the turn, shifted just outside for the drive to the wire, was gaining through the stretch but
could not reel in the frontrunning winner who had built up a lead at the top of the lane. HARD TO CAPTURE stalked near the rear down the backside,
started to rally four wide around horses at the quarter pole, split rivals in the four path in upper stretch and was reaching for more ground down in the
stretch, to get up late for the show money. VALLEY GIRL co-trailed on the inside in the early stages, began to pass runners on the rail midpoint on the turn,
was in range in the two path at the top of the lane, ran on willingly and just missed out on holding for third money at the finish line. ALA TURKA was brushed
outside to begin, co-trailed on the outside down the backside, could see the field on the turn, angled three wide straightening out for home but could not get
involved late. TAMANA broke out on the start, settled in midfield all alone down the backstretch, offered a mild run three wide around the bend, drifted out
widest in the seven path for the stretch drive, had little to offer and could not be a menace to the wire. DEMURELY hopped slight on the break, tracked
between horses in the two path along the back straight, could not keep pace with the lead trio at the half and backed away through the field by the quarter
pole. SUGAR IS GOLDEN broke inwards to begin, tracked three deep early on, chased the pace outside throughout the turn, was in the hunt three wide in
upper stretch, could not go on and faltered by the furlong marker.

Footnotes
STOLEN trailed the fail along the backside, saved ground on the turn at the rear, started to go by runners inside smartly at the quarter pole, angled out in
mid-stretch to the four path, was full of run late in the final furlong , veered inwards at the wire but got up just before the finish line for the late running score.
CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) settled in mid-pack down the backside, waited behind the chasing pair through the turn, burst between rivals finding a seam in
the two path at the quarter pole, had a chance for the win turning for home, drifted out under left handed encouragement in deep stretch and got up just at
the wire for the place share. SILVER BULLET LADY under a tight rein took this field along the backstretch, improved the advantage through the turn, led by
a good margin at the furlong marker, switched back to the wrong lead at the eighth pole when urged right handed , changed back to the correct lead by the
seventy yard pole but gave way late to settle for third at the wire. CRUMLIN BEAST broke in on the start, stalked near the rear on the outside, was ridden
for more three wide outside foes at the three furlong marker but made little headway on the turn, angled out to the five path for the drive and passed weary
foes in the stretch. KNOW HOW (GB) tracked inside down the backstretch, tried to close the gap on the pacesetter around the turn but to no avail, fought
until the eighth pole then yielded on the fence in the last sixteenth. CLASSY IMAGE chased the frontrunner along the backside, was scrubbed on for more
three eighths out, could not maintain forward position through the turn and wilted in the four path down the stretch. STEWRADS INQUIRY THROUGH THE
STRETCH REGARDING #2 CARDIO PRINCESS AND #4 STOLEN RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
TATOOSONMYSOUL travelled in hand tucked in on the rail watching the frontrunner in the beginning, moved confidently between horses with five
sixteenths to go, seized command inside at the quarter pole, drifted out under the drive at the furlong marker but held on for the win from the surging rival
outside late. SUMMER HOLIDAY broke tardily to have only one beaten down the backside, began to rally on the rail at the quarter pole, swung out
gathering momentum in the five path turning for home and closed in strongly down the lane but could not get there in time. CLASSIC GLORY stalked near
the rear in the early going, was roused three furlongs out keeping even with the leaders on the turn, split foes in the six path commencing a run in upper
stretch and was running on end to win the show battle at the finish line. CHICAGO TYPHOON tracked between rivals in the two path down the backstretch,
could not match strides with the top two leaders midway through the turn but did stay on determinedly to the wire to share for a minor role in the end.
QUEEN SAHARA tracked four deep outside runners in the back straight, circled four wide around horses in the turn, bid three wide up top at the quarter
pole, battled with the winner at the top of the lane until the sixteenth pole while on the wrong lead and faded in deep stretch losing a couple of placings
nearing the wire. RING IT UP veered out on the break, trailed the pack getting to the rail at the half, took the shortest way around the turn seeing the field
and finished up with purpose to close smartly between foes in the five path in deep stretch. MOET MONET broke outwards on the start, settled inside in
midfield down the back straight, began to edge closer behind the tracking group at the three eighths marker, was in range for a share of the prize in upper
stretch but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. BLING D'MONEY HOME tracked three wide between runners in the early going, could not keep up with
others starting a run while travelling three wide between horses with three furlongs to go, was checked mildly in midturn and had little response to offer
afterwards. COINS UNLIMITED bobbled on the break, regrouped quickly to lead this field along the backstretch, was collared outside by the winner at the
quarter pole, offered no resistance and folded on the fence at the furlong pole.
