Footnotes
ALY'S NATION was chasing the leader, bid inside on the second turn then made steady progress when that one lugged out and was along in time.
MISCHIEF MAME pushed to the front, widened on the backstretch then lugged out on the second turn and could not stall the winner. ELLE VICTOIRE had
no speed, responded two wide to the stretch and was advancing steadily in the drive. HEAVENS TO BETSY also chased the pace three wide but came up
empty when roused. CHIQUITA PIQUITA pressed the pace for three eighths then tired.

Footnotes
RAY OF THE SEA was unhurried to the backstretch, shifted off the rail, rallied through the drive and held late. LEAD ACTRESS was a bit awkward to begin,
trailed, was two wide to the stretch then made a late run on the rail. BANDON BRIDGE tracked the leaders to the second turn, pushed to the front between
calls into the stretch but was unable to sustain the needed bid. MACHO CHROME dueled outside a rival, brushed then bumped with TOO TALL TO CALL
on the second turn, lost his action into the stretch and weakened. TOO TALL TO CALL was inside while dueling to the second turn then brushed and
bumped with MACHO CHROME, took up and gave way. A claim of foul by the rider on TOO TALL TO CALL against the rider on BANDON BRIDGE for
alleged interference on the second turn was not allowed by the stewards.

SPEEDY TOM zipped clear early, set all the pace then responded on the second turn and held driving. FOOLISH TO DECEIVE chased the winner
throughout, saved ground and held second. NATIONHEART was outsprinted, got fanned four wide on the far turn and was making up ground belatedly.
MYSTIC WOOD FORCE also chased the winner, came three wide to the stretch and just missed the show. HYDROGEN had no speed, was off the rail to
the stretch then lacked the needed late response. LOOKIN FOR GOLD was outrun early then saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SAINT HELEN dueled for the lead to the backstretch, responded to pressure on the far turn then kicked away in the final sixteenth. DASHINGMOONLIGHT
was on the pace early then pressed the winner to the stretch while saving ground but could not impact that one while besting the rest. JEWELED AGAIN
settled mid pack to the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and was up for the show. ZEPHYR CAT stalked the winner two wide then drifted out into the
stretch and weakened. MIGHTY GYPSY saved ground throughout but could not make an impact. MORDIGAN had no speed and was never a factor.
HOLDMYGOLDMISSY was bumped at the start, had her rider lose his irons and never recovered them. MANUELS TABLE was through early.

Footnotes
LIVE A GOOD LIFE was well placed behind the leader, moved up to challenge into the second turn, took over and held driving. COWLITZ set the pace, was
collared on the second turn then battled on to hold second. GENERAL THAYER chased the top two, was two then three wide to the stretch and could not
get the place. CABALLERANGO was outsprinted, chased to the second turn then saved ground but lacked the needed late response. STANLEY RYDER
was always outrun.
