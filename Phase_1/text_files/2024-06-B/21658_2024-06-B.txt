Footnotes
FANCY AZTECA broke in brushing the near side stall and then crossing in front of SHE'S AWESOME forcing that foe to steady and then COLLECT DATTT,
forcing that rival to briefly get taken in hand, crossed to the inside and showed the way in hand, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three
then two wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive shying out a bit being shown a left handed crop while well clear to the finish. SHESALITTLE EDGY
coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top
one while keeping on clear for the place honors. I'M BUZZY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SHE'S AWESOME got steadied at the start when FANCY AZTECA crossed directly
in front and conceded about three lengths to the front, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper
stretch offering up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. COLLECT DATTT steadied very briefly at the start when FANCY AZTECA crossed
in front conceding about two lengths to that rival, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
GUN MAESTRO was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, extended the lead late on the backstretch, drew off in the two path on the
turn, opened up a very large advantage, was put to a strong hand-ride while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop
inside the furlong marker and proved much the best while continuing on his inside lead under a drive to the finish. CANDY TYCOON settled off the pace,
was urged along late on the backstretch, dropped from the four path to the two path early on the turn, moved back to the four path late on that bend and
safely secured the place. CHEEKY TICO settled on the outside, was urged while moving from three to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response
while best of the rest. HOLDTHEFLIGHT bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground
on the turn and failed to respond. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY bumped with a foe at the start, dropped back then angled out at the rear, went five wide on the turn
and was no factor. HORN OF PLENTY broke out and brushed with a foe while corrected by the rider, tracked the leader while off the inside, fell further
behind that opponent late on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the three path under urging early on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
THE BIG TORPEDO coaxed from the start, pulled on the bit down the backstretch in the early stages while along the inside advancing to be just off the
leader half a mile from home, settled better into the turn with cover of that rival and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, angled in to the rail straightened away roused and rallied up the inside to seized command over a pair of rivals a furlong out, then edged clear
to the finish to prevail. COURTLY BANKER prompted the leader from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors. BUSTIN AWAY established the front after the start and showed the way
in hand along the inside under pressure from the aforementioned foe, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat from flanking challengers and was collared a furlong out, ran on to the finish to preserve the show honors. FIDELIGHTCAYUT
coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GRAND
OPENING broke out at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPS got brushed at the start by RETAIL MAIN, who broke in a step, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. RETAIL MAN broke in at the start brushing the aforementioned foe, chased two to three
wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, tipped four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. FREEDSDALE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped three to our wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
CRUISE TO CATALINA showed speed then disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dueled with the runner-up in upper
stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. GRANADILLA bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed then
disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dueled with the winner into the final furlong then proved no match while clear for the
place. PAULAS STAR SISTER leaned out and brushed the gate, showed speed then chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the four path
and tired while clear for the show. GREGORIAN SOLO was urged along off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, was taken up when the loose
horse caused trouble inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. SANTAGATA broke a bit slow, raced
outside at the rear under urging, was carried well out in the track by the loose horse late on the backstretch, went eight wide early on the turn then dropped
to the three path, remained in the three path through the second half of the turn and failed to threaten. MARY UNION AVE raced off the pace under urging,
was carried well out in the track by the loose horse late on the backstretch, went seven then six wide on the turn and was no factor. FOCUS POCUS lunged
at the start and was off a bit slow, was urged along towards the back, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, checked while well behind the
leaders when the loose horse caused traffic inside the furlong marker and had nothing left. WELCOME BACK BABE stumbled on the second stride from the
gate and unseated the rider then was walked off after being apprehended by an outrider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
DANCING DEAN settled along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied and shied in under a right handed crop twice from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole and bumped
with SUNDAY TIFF due to pressure from COIF coming out a furlong from home, then came under a right handed crop once more and shied in clear of those
rivals near the sixteenth marker while surging home, seized command seventy yards from the finish and prevailed edging away at the end. LA
SALVADORENA coaxed from the gate, got eased off to track STAMP OF APPROVAL along the inside, remained patiently handled as those rivals in front
quickened and lost position through the latter portion of the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied along the rail unable or
unwilling to go by the leader through a tight seam and then came on through when that rival drifted slightly and ran on to get up for the place honors in the
final jumps. STAMP OF APPROVAL established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled through sensible splits, got let out
taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat through the final furlong, got collared seventy yards from the finish and kept on to
preserve the show honors. SUNDAY TIFF just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had COIF come outwards just as DANCING DEAN came inwards and was bumped between foes at the
eighth pole, then kept on to the finish. SISSINGHURST coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the end. COIF three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, had the rider peer outside and came out under a drive a furlong out and bumped SUNDAY TIFF into the
coming inwards DANCING DEAN at the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. FADE TO GREY chased along the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, offered no response. AMERICAN KESTREL chased just off the inside from just off the
pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. JUST SO PRETTY a bit fractious in the gate prior to
the start, raced forwardly placed three wide into the first turn tossing her head under restraint, settled tracking the leader from the two path midway on the
first turn and into the backstretch, continued in closest aim and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive. ARMADA RISING (IRE) just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs
out, continued four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on DANCING DEAN and
SUNDAY TIFF. After review, the result was allowed to stand before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
ENGLISH CONQUEROR moved in down the opening straightaway, was well placed on the inside, came under urging late on the backstretch, chased inside
on the far turn, shifted to the two path into the stretch, gained under a drive to make a bid into the final furlong, fought outside the runner-up into the final
sixteenth then was brushed by that foe and got up under strong handling to prevail. BEUYS (IRE) was hustled from the gate, showed the way while inside
on the turns, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop nearing the furlong
marker, swapped back to his inside lead after being switched to a left-handed crop around the sixteenth-pole, came out some then brushed with the winner,
fought determinedly with that foe to the finish and just missed. CRABS N BEER settled at the rear on the inside, moved closer on the far turn, was roused
near the quarter-pole, gained into upper stretch, chased behind horses into the final sixteenth, found clear space in front late and finished with good courage
to just get the show. DRIPPING GOLD bumped soundly with a foe at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled just off the pace on the
outside, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, pursued the leaders in the stretch and just missed the show. DAUNT rounded the first turn in
the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. CHULAINN went three wide
on the first turn, was reserved near the back on the outside, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide
into the stretch then quickly moved further out and failed to threaten. BODE'S MAKER bumped soundly with an opponent at the start, was coaxed to
establish forward position early, raced in the two path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue near the seven-sixteenths pole,
chased in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired.

RESERVE CURRENCY coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the three-sixteenths, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. THANK
YOU JON dueled three then two wide with PINEAPPLE MAN to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and seized narrow command spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one while running on
to secure the place honors. UNSTABLE PRINCE broke in at the start taking over the lane of NINETEEN OYSTERS, chased just off the inside and then
along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. SKI COUNTRY chased five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, tipped five wide into upper stretch
and kept on to the finish. DEBATE broke a half a beat slow, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. MR. SWAGGER bobbled at the break, chased three tof our wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide for home, came up empty. PINEAPPLE MAN bobbled at the break, dueled from the two path with
THANK YOU JOHN to his outside while lightly coaxed along, tucked inside through the turn, got displaced from the front and took the inside route into upper
stretch and weakened. FLASHY ALEX coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went four wide into
upper stretch and tired. NINETEEN OYSTERS broke a half a beat slow and was briefly taken in hand when UNSTABLE PRINCE broke inwards and
crossed directly in front, came under light coaxing and chased three then two wide from the tail of the field, got nudged along and lost ground into the turn
and was grew detached from the rest of the field, went three wide into upper stretch under his own power and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
BEETS was hustled from the gate then strode to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action
while inside on the far turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, remained on her inside lead while under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch,
swapped to the proper lead at the furlong marker, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging.
STRIFE tracked the pace while saving ground, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased inside on the far turn, moved out in pursuit of the winner in
upper stretch and willingly earned the place. DAZZLING CRUISER went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, saved ground while
roused on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch the moved further out and improved to just get the show. LATTE LIZZIE rounded the first turn in the
two path, settled on the outside, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick then just missed the show. GOODNIGHT MY ANGEL traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the front on the outside,
moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into upper stretch and tired. STREET VIEW steadied
along the rail near the seven-eighths pole, settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and lacked the needed response. PRIVATE PROPERTY
(IRE) saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. PAY THE BILLS (FR) settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turns and was no factor. BELLIQUEUX went three wide on the turns, came five
wide into the stretch and showed little. ASCENSION raced in the two path on the turns and was outrun.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF NORMANDY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside through to the seven-sixteenths, tipped to
the two path at that station and remained patiently handled through the turn, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a
drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well kept to task. SAMBURU (GB) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors by a nostril over a rival on the wire. OPERATION TORCH
saved ground near the rear of the field early on, made steady progress to mid pack midway on the far turn when placed to coaxing, tipped to the two path
near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick tussling with the aforementioned foe through the final furlong but was
ultimately just denied the place honors while along for the show. RAMBLIN' WRECK broke a half a beat slow at the start, tracked the pace along the inside
from near the rear of the field, tipped to the three path half a mile from home, went three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled out seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. MASSIF three then two wide through the first turn, chased three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ROYAL SPIRIT saved ground in pursuit from
mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped out to the two path near the five-sixteenths as BETTERDAYSRCOMING checked along the rail,
angled five wide for home and stayed on one paced to the end. BETTERDAYSRCOMING (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, had BARRAGE angle in and was forced to check along the rail at the five-sixteenths and lost three lengths of ground in position and
momentum before coming under urging to recover, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BARRAGE coaxed from the gate, raced three
wide through the first turn, tracked the leader in close aim just off the inside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and came inwards forcing
BETTERDAYSRCOMING to check off his heels at that station, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. HARRY HOOD coaxed from the start,
raced forwardly placed among a quintet and was forced six wide into the first turn before being able to tuck five wide briefly and then four wide through the
remained of that bend, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before making his way to the two path at the seven-sixteenths, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. AL'S ROCKET four then three wide through the first turn, chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. SCRAMBLE five wide into the first turn, went four
then three wide through that turn before racing two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
