Footnotes
O'BABE chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, dueled between horses in upper stretch and got up for
the win late. SAINT SARENA led the field on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss.
VOW tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and dueled to the wire to just miss. TWELVE
STARS raced off the pace on the inside early, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late.
CHASING SHADOWS trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made up some ground in the lane but never truly threatened.
CLUBHOUSE SAINT raced off the pace on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. SEA LEVEL raced in
the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHORT STRETCH raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained ground on
the outside and kicked clear. BANGO'S HEAT chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, dueled in upper stretch
and was caught late. CALY BALI raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and improved
position from there. GODDESS OF WAR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the two path and
chased on in the lane. GIRLS A LEGACY led the way on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path, dueled in upper stretch
and weakened late. ALEXANDRA'S SONG raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and
was outkicked in the stretch. ASTERN MAID reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE ONE, ASTERN MAID, HAD A FAIR
BEGINNING AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

ALWAYS SMILING chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole
and kicked clear. SAVONA dueled on the inside early, saved ground around the bend, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and chased that rival
home. SCREAM MACHINE hit the gate leaving it, was pinched back and forced to take up in the first strides, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on to the finish. SHY SHY raced off the pace through the opening stages, navigated the turn from
the three path and passed tiring horses in the lane while never threatening. HOTASAPISTOL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path, was forced to check near the sixteenth pole when FIRENSPICE veered into her lane and was
outkicked from there. WHEN JUDY CALLS trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no bid. FIRENSPICE
dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming around the bend, switched outside in midstretch, then veered
sharply out approaching the sixteenth pole before fading. WINGS FROM ABOVE pressed the pace on the outside through the early going, navigated the
bend from the three path and tired in the stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE STRETCH RUN. ADDITIONALLY, THE RIDER OF

Footnotes
MISS CARMEN CIBO saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path and
dug in in the lane to just hold the win. NORTHERN ANGEL raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three path and dug in gamely in the lane to just miss. GO LEE ANN GO raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of
the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the three and four path coming around the second turn, began a bid passing the quarter
pole, gained ground in the stretch and could not get by the top two. WITHHERBOOTSON saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and kept on to the wire. ON SPEED DIAL raced in the two path around the first bend, settled in
the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path and finished evenly. STRABELLA raced at
the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far bend and made no bid. BLUES CROSS raced in
the three path early, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and showed no
kick. SASSY MAMA raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path
and was empty in the lane.
