BRIGHT FUTURE tracked on the inside, was shuffled back along the rail midway on the far turn, moved back up entering the stretch, commenced a rail rally
passing the furlong marker, then closed strongly to win going away. COASTAL MISSION raced four wide early, then pulled two wide into contention, vied
two wide, dueled on the far turn, gained a short lead, then dueled with MOVISITOR in the stretch drive and dug in gamely for the place spot. MOVISITOR
was steadied in the early stages, raced four wide on the first turn, then stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled through the stretch and dug
in gamely to the end. STAGE RAIDER raced three wide off the pace, advanced four wide on the far turn and finished evenly. OSCAR ECLIPSE vied inside
for the lead, dueled on the far turn and faded. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT bobbled at the break, stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn and tired. ARTORIUS
raced off the pace between and failed to respond. SHERLOCK'S JEWEL raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
