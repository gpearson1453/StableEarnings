PRIME SHOPPING rated close off the rail the first turn, started his bid nearing the three eighths pole, closed for the nod past the eighth pole, raced clear
toward mid-stretch and was steadily handled to draw off. MEGS GOLDEN BOY rated the pace inside, was met and dueled with a slim disadvantage leaving
the half mile pole, recovered the edge at the three eighths, drew briefly clear midway on the far turn, but gave up the lead passing the eighth pole and and
just lasted for second. RUDD'S ROCKET raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and just missed second in an even finish. TOWN HOT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn near the rail and showed little more. A FAIR NOTION stalked two deep the first turn, challenged and took the lead passing the half mile pole, was
caught and pressured the runner-up from the three eighths, but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and weakened. CASTLE OF CORK raced in
the four path the opening turn, chased outside leaving the half mile pole but faded past the three eighths.

passing the three eighths, opened up at rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. LOVE NOTION saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, drifted a bit approaching the top of the stretch and was not a match in the lane. TIDBIT stalked the early pace from the three path,
challenged passing the half mile pole but dropped back leaving the three eighths and faded in the three path on the far turn. FEATHER WISH ducked out
leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn and bid only mildly toward the three eighths pole. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS stalked off the rail the first
turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. MONSTER SUMMER raced in the four path the first turn and never

TRUE BUCKPASSING angled to the inside and set a pressured pace, contested the edge at the rail on the turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and held
well under steady handling. S S CASINO GIRL pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn then
relented in the duel through the stretch. SPIRIT ON THE WIND chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BLUSHING BIP BOP
gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and passed some rivals in the lane. ANOTHER FINE JUBA chased, raced at the rail on the turn then
flattened stride leaving the turn. STORMI VANNA ducked in and made contact with MISS INTENSITY leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch,
raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane. The latter exchanged contact with Stormi Vanna leaving the gate, was not a factor and raced
in the four path on the turn. GREY FLAMINGO gave chase, raced two deep on the turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SIMPLY JACK saved ground on the first turn, started his bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep nearing the head of the lane,
dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and dueled clear in late yards. CAPTAIN CREED saved ground well back from early contention, bid into the
backstretch and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and finished well to take second the final strides. MON GATEAU ducked in
leaving the gate then surged to the front while angling in and raced at the rail on the first turn, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, was met
toward the head of the lane and dug in from that point, but flattened late yards. SCHMEAR raced well back about the three path the first turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and passed rivals in the lane. JUDY'S ARMY ducked out and made contact with HIALEAH
NATIVE leaving the gate then settled off the rail the first turn, eased out and picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three
path and showed little more. The latter was bumped at the break then shuffled back, raced off the rail the first turn and proved no factor. NICKEL NICKEL
rated off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced in range of the lead in the three path on the far turn, but
weakened leaving the turn. BON BUENO raced well back. RUBYS FLASH settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole but faded
at the rail on the far turn.
