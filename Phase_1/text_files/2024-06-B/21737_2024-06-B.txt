PIP SQUEEK chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, rallied three wide in the stretch and wore down rival to be best in the end. JAYDYN CAT
set the early pace, drew off into the turn then was in a long drive but could not withstand PIP SQUEEK in the final strides. NEW DESTINY was saving
ground on the turn then rallied in upper stretch making a bid but was no menace in late stretch. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA was unhurried early then raced
four wide on the turn turning for home, was gaining ground but was no menace. NATURALBORNSENDER was three wide on the turn then failed to
menace. CHERRY STAR chased the early pace while three wide, was used up then gave way. THAT'S MY MAMA trailed throughout.
