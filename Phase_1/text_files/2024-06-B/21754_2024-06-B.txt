Footnotes
ONCOMING TRAIN showed the way inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one approaching the lane, inched an advantage while shifting off the inside in
upper stretch, held sway through midstretch, but drifted out as his outer counterpart edged closer in the final sixteenth and held late.
WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER prompted outside of the eventual winner, vied turning for home, but failed to sustain even terms while shifting out in upper
stretch, yet kept on into the final furlong, closed in once again as the leader tired in the final sixteenth, rebid in the closing stages but missed at the wire.
JAHEZ stalked the top pair from the three path and chased them home. LEGENDARY LORE tracked along the inside, lacked progress through the lane and
yielded. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was slow into stride, lagged well behind down the backstretch and got outrun.

SISTER LOU ANN ranged up alongside in upper stretch, bid along with that one at the furlong grounds, sparred thereafter but was herded inwardly by her
outer counterpart in the final sixteenth and was bested. NOT SO CLOSE was fractious in the starting gate, showed the way along the inside, vied with an
outer bidder approaching the lane, got headed by that one in upper stretch, fought on while getting outkicked by an outer pair of wider bidders at the furlong
grounds, and proved no match for those two while reclaiming show. BLING was antsy in the starting gate as an inner rival got fractious, pressed outside of
the leader, bid turning for home, wrestled a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer pair of bidders at the furlong grounds and tired
between horses. NEVERWALKALONE (BRZ) stalked along the inside while tugging under snug restraint around the first turn, settled into stride down the
backstretch, chased the leaders while shifting out to the three path in midstretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SWIFTWIND was bumped between horses at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between rivals, checked subtly into the turn, stalked with run turning
for home, tipped to the four to five path in upper stretch to take aim outside of the leaders, ranged up at the furlong grounds to offer a bid, drove past at the
sixteenth pole and edged clear. MELITTLEFROSTGIRL prompted two wide into the turn, vied turning for home, gained an advantage entering the lane in
the four path, shifted in while inching ahead in midstretch, but flopped back to her left lead while meeting an outer challenge leaving the furlong grounds and
was bested by that bidder with a sixteenth to go. FLASH WEAR brushed with an outer rival soon after the start, laid close up along the inside, stalked
around the bend, committed to a rail charge while slipping through a tight inside seam in upper stretch, but chased the top pair leaving midstretch, tipped out
and ran on. WHITELICK ROAD was unruly loading, set the pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that one while entering upper stretch in the two
path, then weakened between horses reaching midstretch. COMBATTANTE bumped an inner rival at the start creating crowded quarters for a handful on
inner rivals, tracked three wide, floated to the five to six path in upper stretch and gave way. MERCY OTIS transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner
foe at the start, laid at the rear in the three path, brushed with an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, fanned to the seven path into the lane and made little
impact. INDY'S UNIVERSE was bumped between horses soon after the start before steadying out of crowded quarters early on, raced at the rear in the two
path, brushed with an outer rival turning for home before swinging to the six path entering the lane, but was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
WINDY WALK stalked the top pair leaving the chute, shifted out to the five path at the five furlong pole, inched closer in the three path around the turn,
swept past the leaders entering the lane, took over and drew clear. OUTOFNOTHINGATALL was brushed by an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide
leaving the chute, vied down the backstretch and dueled around the turn, but was swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane, sustained her chase
and secured place. WINDY BAY showed the way early on, dueled with an outer rival down the backstretch and around the turn, but offered no resistance to
a wider challenge entering the lane, yielded and saved show. CHIQUITA MOSCA bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace three to two wide
and between horses, swung outside of foes and to the five path in upper stretch, then ran on to miss show at the wire. THORNY was bumped between
horses at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, improved three wide around the turn and tired. LADY MERCEDES saved ground off of the pace
around the turn, but to no avail.

Footnotes
BOSTONTONIAN vied outside of the leader and from the three path, led as an outer rival loomed a danger entering the lane, maintained a margin while
delaying his lead change until midstretch and held sway through the final furlong. DEEPLY HIDDEN stalked the top pair from the three to four path while
creeping closer turning for home, ranged up to take aim outside of the new leader entering the lane, but was fended off by that one through the final furlong.
MISSED THE TURN chased from midpack along the inside, shifted out to the three to four path while pursuing around the turn, tipped to the five path in
upper stretch and stayed on. OPTICAL lacked speed in the two path, rallied inside of foes in upper stretch, shifted two wide in the final furlong and sustained
progress to gain fourth late. SWEET FANTASY vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that one and a wider bidder nearing the lane
and faded. MISTER WOODFORD chased forwardly in the two path and gave way. COMING IN HOT was off awkwardly, pulled while rank behind foes down
the backstretch, steadied into the turn, pursued from off of the pace in the two path before swinging to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally.
SERGEANT CAPPS pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses and failed to factor. MENDELLO was reluctant to load, raced off of the
pace in the five to seven path and made little impact. SAND CAST broke slowly, trailed along the inside and got outrun.

OUTADORE vied outside of a rival while tucking from the three to two path into the turn, dueled around the turn before forging an advantage in upper
stretch, then drove clear with a sixteenth to go. BUSHIDO brushed an outer rival at the start, vied inside of the eventual winner around the turn, got headed
by that one in upper stretch, yielded at the sixteenth pole and held place. B D VALESKI hopped slightly and was off a step slow, trailed in the two to four
path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, rallied to reach show in the final sixteenth and needed more for place. CHISELER stalked along the
inside, chased in the two path leaving upper stretch but lost show to an outer bidder in the late stages. RITHM NIC took back from between horses reaching
the half mile pole, laid off of the pace in the three path, gained in the four path turning for home, then ran on mildly between horses. ZOOMBIE brushed with
an inner rival before brushing an outer foe at the start, then saved ground off of the pace to no avail. CLEAR THE AIR took light contact from an inner rival
at the start, tracked forwardly two wide and between horses, checked while keen among foes at the half mile pole, was subtly put to crowded quarters
between rivals turning for home, yielded in upper stretch, altered out and kept on. COUNTERSTRIKE stalked four to three wide into the turn, chased in
upper stretch then tired between horses in the final furlong. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
VAHVA stalked the clear leader from the four to three path before inching closer to apply pressure into the turn, prompted before bidding entering the lane,
took light contact while vying in upper stretch, bumped her counterpart while forging an advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear. POSITANO
SUNSET laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and ran on late to gain pace in the shadow of the wire. SOCIETY
showed the way unchallenged in the three path early on, tucked to the two path before feeling pressure from an outer rival into the turn, met that one's
challenge entering the lane, leaned out and initiated contact with her counterpart in upper stretch, traded blows before taking contact while getting headed at
the furlong grounds, yielded and lost place late. CHI TOWN LADY was a bit reluctant to load, then broke half a step slow conceiting multiple lengths to the
leaders, trailed in the three path, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, surpassed a tired rival and failed to factor. ROYAL SPA broke a beat slow,
advanced inside of rivals to achieve inside stalking position with five furlongs to go, but came under urging chasing turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
CHILLED pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked two wide around the far turn, bumped rivals to split them in the three path in upper stretch,
powered through and kicked away. GENETICS tracked in the three path, ranged up outside of the top pair and in the four path around the far turn, bid and
vied entering the lane, but was bumped while getting outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch, then held place late. CARARRA lacked speed in the
three to five path, then ran on to gain show late. SUSTANCIA pressed the leader from the three path, led in the two path as an outer foe ranged up turning
for home, vied with that outer bidder entering the lane, but was bumped and headed by a foe-splitting rival in upper stretch and gave way. KISS ME AGAIN
showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer prompter and a wider bidder turning for home and faded through the lane. NOT GUILTY broke a
step slow, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, shifted out to the five to six path in midstretch and failed to factor. QUEEN OF PARIS was restless in
the starting gate, pursued from midpack two wide, came under urging chasing in the four path turning for home, then yielded between horses. MURPHY'S
GIFT stalked along the inside, chased turning for home and faded. JOELMA trailed along the inside and showed litlte.

MINK'S PALACE tracked two wide and between horses, took aim floating four wide in upper stretch, bumped with an inner rival while ranging up in
midstretch, kept that foe in tight while forging an advantage nearing the final sixteenth and drew clear. HERE U COME AGAIN vied for the lead with an outer
rival, clung to an advantage in the long battle into midstretch, but was outkicked by a wider bidder in the final furlong and narrowly saved place. SHE
CALLED vied two wide, sustained the long battle through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the final furlong, kept on between horses
late and missed place. BLUE SQUALL stalked along the inside, floated an outer rival wider to take aim outside of the top pair at the three sixteenths pole,
but took contact from her outer counterpart whlie attempting to inch closer entering midstretch, was kept in tight quarters leaving the furlong grounds, drifted
out after her outer counterpart cleared and missed place. AMY Z laid off of the pace four wide, floated five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. TIPSY
TAMMY stalked three wide, but floated four wide into the lane and tired. GEORGE'S HONEY trailed in the two to three path, swung six wide into upper
stretch but got outrun.

HAPPY IS A CHOICE pressed the leader from the three path, bid and forged an advantage entering the lane, then drove clear leaving upper stretch.
SCOTLAND stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the turn, tipped to the three path moving forward between horses in upper stretch,
edged place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds and willingly chased the leader home. SURVEILLANCE tracked in the four path, chased between
horses in upper stretch, vied for place with an inner rival through midstretch but was bested. TRACK MATE broke slowly and leaned in at the start, tracked
in the three path and between horses, then sustained a chase but lacked a bid. RADICAL RIGHT hesitated and spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the
start, laid off of the pace in the four path, gained ground swinging to the five path entering the lane, but leveled off nearing midstretch. EYE WITNESS set a
pressured pace while remaining a path off of the inside, got headed by an outer presser entering the lane and weakened. PAYNE trailed in the three path
and made little impact.

Footnotes
MIRANDA RIGHTS stalked two wide, bid turning for home and drove clear. SCOOBIE QUANDO tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path into
upper stretch and sustained gradual progress to gain place in the final sixteenth. OUT OF DEDUCTIONS tracked three wide, gained place in upper stretch,
chased while losing place in the final sixteenth and lasted for show. CLYDE'S GOT A GUN lacked speed in the three to five path before drifting to the seven
path entering upper stretch, then rallied but needed more to reel in show. HARLOCAP laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked two wide and between
horses around the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. TRES SOLES pursued two wide and between horses, came under
urging around the far turn and failed to factor. BAKWENA trailed in the two path and made little impact. FAIR DINKUM showed the way along the inside, but
was headed by an outer bidder nearing the lane and weakened. LINCOLN HIGHWAY steadied when getting rank into the first turn, tugged in the four path
leaving that bend, then faded around the far turn.
