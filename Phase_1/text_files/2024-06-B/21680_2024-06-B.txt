Footnotes
MAN O ROSE pressed the pace from inside then ceded command and dropped back to stalking position, raced a bit off the rail then took aim two wide into
the lane, drew alongside and took over at the eighth pole and drove clear under left handed urging. UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) set the pace outside
MAN O ROSE then cleared approaching the half-mile pole, showed the way along the inside through the turn, overtaken by MAN O ROSE at the eighth pole
and stayed on to hold second. FIRST PEACE broke in and brushed, chased from inside out of range, cut the corner into the stretch, followed with striking
distance into the final furlong but finished evenly late. MOTORIOUS (GB) sat off the pace outside a rival, rounded the bend in the two path, moved out in the
lane and kept trying to earn a minor award. TURN ON THE JETS (IRE) tracked off the rail, went three wide into the turn, spun two wide into the stretch and
weakened down the lane. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN traveled outside a rival at the back, took the turn two wide, tipped three wide into the lane and failed
to menace. WAR AT SEA brushed by outer rival at the start, settled at the back inside a rival, saved ground through the turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BAD SNEAKERS broke well and was forwardly placed on the inside then moved into the two path on the clubhouse turn, drew alongside the pacesetter on
the backstretch, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear late on the bend, drifted to the inside despite left handed urging and remained clear to the
wire. MUCINO antsy in the gate, sprinted clear and angled to the inside entering the first turn, took pressure from BAD SNEAKERS in the middle stages,
lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up late on that bend, kept on through the final furlong and was clearly second best. DE' MEDICI
broke out and bumped, stalked three deep around the clubhouse turn, came under a ride still traveling three deep leaving the backstretch, drifted out and
bumped rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole, kept to task through the lane and regained third. MISCHELOF (CHI) raced outside a pair of rivals in the
second flight early, moved out four deep on the backstretch, got bumped by DE' MEDICI at the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and
flattened out in the final furlong. MONGOLIAN ALTAI stumbled and bumped in the beginning, settled two wide then cut to the inside early on the clubhouse
turn, raced inside a trio of rivals leaving the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch, came off the rail and could not make an impact. PIONEER PRINCE
stumbled and got knocked into outer rival at the start, chased two wide then between rivals, moved to the rail once clear of inner foe on the far turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
MONTANA broke well and was allowed to settle at the back three then two wide early, lagged behind up the backstretch, on the move along the rail then
two wide on the far turn, rallied between at the eighth pole and took control shortly after, fought inside a pair of rivals into the final sixteenth, drifted out late
and prevailed. ARROGATES SPIRIT forwardly placed five wide outside a trio of rivals into the first turn, went four wide into the backstretch, chased three
wide through the far turn, bid in the lane, bumped with ELECTOR at the sixteenth pole, bothered again shortly after and finished gamely to the wire.
ELECTOR showed early speed four wide and three deep into the clubhouse turn then pressed from outside, chased after the pacesetter in the middle
stages, closest in pursuit from the two path around the far turn, challenged with a furlong remaining, fought between and bumped ARROGATES SPIRIT at
the sixteenth pole, then took up when crowded late. SEATTLE BREAKOUT hustled from inside and showed speed in the two path then stalked around the
clubhouse turn, went two wide into the second bend, angled out to the four path, came out into the stretch, chased within striking distance from the middle
portion of the track but flattened out in the late stages. JOHN DUNBAR settled along the rail, drew closer on the backstretch, ridden along while saving
ground on the far turn, raced in range at the eighth pole and failed to respond. MAN OVERBOARD fought three wide into the first turn, took control around
the bend and moved into the two path, cleared on the backstretch, showed the way on the inside to the stretch, clung to a slim lead at the eighth pole,
yielded midstretch and faded to last. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING A TRIO OF RUNNERS IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ELECTOR INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH ARROGATES SPIRIT AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND ALTHOUGH
MONTANA DID DRIFTED OUT LATE, IT DID NOT ALTER THE ORDER OF FINISH AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
FINAL BOSS controlled the pace along the rail, remained unchallenged through the far turn, roused into the lane, met the bid from BLUE EYED GEORGE in
upper stretch, responded nicely by turning away the runner-up when asked left then right handed and remained strong to the wire under strong handling.
BLUE EYED GEORGE stalked from the rail into the first turn then eased over to the two path, closest in pursuit to the far turn, ridden along from the two
path to the lane, drew alongside in upper stretch but was turned away inside the eighth pole and stayed on to secure second. BRITISH ISLES stalked in the
two path outside GOLD FOOT, came under a ride on the second bend, tipped three wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed response but kept
on and managed to save third. SEA SINGER (IRE) reserved in the early going and tucked inside at the back, shifted to the two path near the quarter pole,
steered out into the lane and could not get by BRITISH ISLES for third. GOLD FOOT pulled early tracking along the inside, hugged the rail through the far
turn, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE GAMBLE stepped to the front and moved inside, showed the way clear from SMART MO, inched away leaving the backstretch, opened up
under coaxing on the far turn, remained well clear under hand urging through the lane and coasted in the last fifty yards. CLOONEY bumped with SMART
MO in the beginning, chased three wide around the first turn then dropped well off the pace, ridden along two wide then along the rail on the second bend,
chased in tandem with COALINGA ROAD down the stretch and edged that rival for second. COALINGA ROAD stalked along the rail into the first turn then
angled out to the four path around the bend, raced far back outside a rival on the backstretch, came under a ride chasing outside CLOONEY on the far turn
and lost the battle for second to that rival. SMART MO bumped with CLOONEY leaving the gate, raced up close from outside and was closest in pursuit up
the backstretch, dropped back two then three wide on the far turn and tired. TAISHAN bobbled leaving the gate, coaxed from inside, ran up on heels and
had to check into the first turn, raced inside a rival at the rear in the middle stages, trailed two wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
PLANETARIO (BRZ) allowed to settle at the back and moved to the inside, chased inside a rival first time through the stretch, shifted to the two path and
went between rivals on the last turn, roused at the top of the lane, asked right handed midstretch, surged outside ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) in the final
sixteenth and drove past late. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) pulled to a forward position early, stalked along the rail then in the two path down the hill, tracked two
wide to the final turn, tipped out and bid three deep leaving the bend, took over and cleared with a furlong left to run, led clear over PLENETARIO (BRZ) into
deep stretch but was overtaken in the closing moments. RIMPROTECTOR sped clear then ceded command early, stalked in the two path around the
clubhouse turn, drew alongside the pacesetter in the middle stages, kept the pressure on through the far turn, fought between briefly in upper stretch and
flattened to third. BEE CATCHER broke well and ceded command then went up to take control into the first turn, cleared inner rival approaching the dirt
crossing, moved over to the inside, pressured by RIMPROTECTOR on the backstretch, resisted through the far turn, yielded in upper stretch and weakened
in the furlong grounds. OFFLEE NAUGHTY stalked two then three wide early, raced outside a rival at the back first time through the stretch, continued two
wide to the final turn, chased three deep around the bend and lacked a response when called upon. ORDER AND LAW stalked three deep into the first turn,
angled over to the rail around the bend, rated along the fence, hugged the rail to the stretch and faded out of contention. FIRST QUARTER FRACTION

Footnotes
CASE HIT sent clear and steered across to the inside, showed the way two wide into the lane, grew weary in deep stretch but held safely in the end.
INFAMOUS ANGEL traveled in mid-pack well off the rail, moved into the three path entering the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, finished well and
gained second. NAP raced in range three deep, got brushed by inner rival early on the turn, closest in pursuit three wide into the lane, could not produce a
bid but kept on to save third. STYLE CAT chased outside a rival then between foes into the turn, got bumped by inner rival early on the bend, chased two
wide into the drive, kept trying in the final furlong and missed the show honors. CHARMZ AWAY broke a step slow, raced near the back early, cut to the
inside approaching the turn, came back out around the bend and chased four wide into the stretch, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late.
KEEP DANCIN NICK sat off the pace, raced along the rail into the turn, eased out to the three path and never got involved. JUST TRUST ME chased under
coaxing from inside, raced inside a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, drifted out and bumped early on the turn, remained on the fence to the stretch and
weakened. IT'S THIRSTY TIME broke slow and dropped far back, saved ground to the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BIG BET JAFINSAFA off slow in the beginning, settled at the back on the inside then eased out on the first turn, gained three then two wide on the second
bend, angled out and rallied six deep, fought five deep late and got up. KERRY GOLD was rank early on the first turn then stalked on the fence, chased two
wide then along the rail on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out for a clear path past the eighth pole, rallied and got outkicked by the winner.
FLY THE SKY chased four then three deep around the first turn, bid three deep at the halfway point, dueled from outside leaving the backstretch and far
turn, took over into the lane, fought gamely through the final furlong but was overtaken by the top pair late. CITY OF ANGELS tracked two wide then
dropped back off the pace in the middle stages, came two wide into the lane, rallied five then four deep in the final furlong and got outclosed. HANDSOME
RED puled the rider along racing outside the leader, had to take a bigger hold early on the backstretch and ceded command, confronted the leader again
between rivals at the half-mile pole, dueled from inside leaving the backstretch, fought along the rail and lost command into the stretch, stayed on well into
deep stretch and yielded late. BIG GEORGE became fractious in the gate, broke a step slow, traveled in the two path off the pace and could not make an
impact. HACKING IT UP stalked three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, raced outside a rival at the half-mile pole, chased three deep into the far turn,
remained three wide into the lane, launched a bid but flattened in the late stages. WINE AND WHISKY pulled from inside and ran up on heels into the first
turn which caused the rider to check hard, traveled inside a rival at the back in the middle stages, passed a tired rival on the far turn and was not a factor.
ANASTASIO'S SECRET showed early speed and moved inside while under pressure, dueled with outer rival then cleared early on the backstretch,
confronted by a pair of rivals at the half-mile pole, lost command and chased leaving the backstretch, checked into the far turn along the rail, dropped back
quickly around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MOBE TOWN showed the way inside PICKING IT UP early then made a clear lead, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, roused and asked right
handed nearing the eighth pole, switched to the left hand for the final furlong and drew away. THALES bumped inner rival at the start, raced in range off the
rail then angled in for the turn, lacked room early on the bend and got boxed in along the rail before finding room approaching the stretch, rallied in the drive
to gain second but could not threaten the winner. THE BIG CHEESEOLA stalked MOBE TOWN from outside, was closest to the leader three then two wide
around the bend, lacked a bid in the stretch run and flattened to third. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK tracked outside a pair of rivals early, navigated the turn four
wide and could not rally. OUTGUNNED tracked between foes then went three wide into the turn, continued in that path to the stretch and failed to respond
when called upon. PICKING IT UP got bumped around between rivals leaving the gate, chased two wide into the turn, moved to the inside briefly then came
back off the rail around the bend and faded down the lane. KAHUNA MAGIC bumped with PICKING IT UP at the start, sat off the pace, traveled outside a
rival at the back on the turn then trailed four wide into the lane and was always outrun. CAROL'S COMIC broke a step slow and trailed early, raced inside a
rival on the turn then tipped out with a quarter mile remaining and failed to menace.

in upper stretch then was forced to steady when the winner drifting inward and weakened in the final furlong. ZITI (FR) stumbled and bumped leaving the
gate, trailed on the inside then steered outside a rival around the clubhouse turn, chased four deep at the five-sixteenths pole and passed tired rivals in the
lane. BLUE FASHION broke out and bumped ZITI (FR), reserved after and moved inside, trailed leaving the backstretch, gained along the rail then got
stopped behind a rival and lost positions around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and could not regain momentum. HIGHLY DESIRABLE (IRE)
stepped to the front on the inside, dueled past the half-mile pole, chased the new leader past the quarter pole and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
CUPID'S CRUSADER settled off the inside out of range, advanced three wide around the bend, steered out wide in upper stretch, closed well and reeled in
the runner-up late. SEATTLE SURF dueled inside SUMMER CHIEF then vied with a pair of rivals at the half-mile pole, continued to battle around the turn,
cleared VILIFIED in upper stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth but was run down by the winner. VILIFIED chased briefly then went up to vie three
deep at the half-mile pole, fought through the turn and dueled two wide into the stretch, lost touch with SEATTLE SURF in upper stretch and stayed on well
for the show honors. SUMMER CHIEF dueled for the lead from outside then between foes past the half-mile marker, fought back through the turn then lost
touch with the top pair past the quarter pole, moved out in upper stretch and kept on trying through the final furlong. IGNATOWSKI sat well off the pace in
the early going, raced outside a rival into the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and improved position. WINSITWELL asked early chasing off the pace,
driven four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. MI CABO EXPRESS hustled from the gate, chased in range to the turn, went two wide
around the bend and faded in the drive. MONGOLIAN FROST sat off the pace on the inside, cornered nicely into the lane and failed to menace. SQUARE
D' ORO well placed early tracking the top trio, lost ground on the inside around the bend and faded down the lane. TOO WILD TO TAME off slow and broke
into the hind-quarters of MONGOLIAN FROST, lagged behind early and passed a tired rival in the stretch. ONLY ALLEGED chased widest up the
backstretch, came six wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

WHIM got forced out and put in tight, then had to take hold when running on heels early, chased two wide around the bend, moved out and chased between
rivals in the lane and lacked a rally. KING APOLLO sat off the pace in the early stages, traveled along the rail then came off the rail a bit on the turn, ran into
