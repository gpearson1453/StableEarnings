WESTONS WILDCAT settled nicely while tracking the top two leaders through early stages, moved up mid-way around the turn, engaged BRAHMS IMAGE
for the lead, vied past the quarter pole then shook free turning for home, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. MEDICINE TAIL was forwardly
placed in early stages, hustled along past the quarter pole, came three to four wide into upper stretch, sustained a solid bid but had to settle for second best.
HIDE THE DEMON was allowed to settle through early stages, hustled up four wide into upper stretch, ran on and captured show in final stride. BRAHMS
IMAGE led the way in early stages, took on the challenge of WESTONS WILDCAT mid-way through the turn, vied for the lead, could not match strides at
the head of the lane, weakened and got nipped for show. K C ROCKET showed interest in opening stages, weakened along the inside around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
BARBERSHOP tracked the top pair up the backstretch, crept closer approaching the quarter pole, came three paths wide into upper stretch, shook the reins
then tapped once left handed, responded willingly, swept by nearing the furlong marker and drew off while ridden out. LAZARUS sped to the lead at the
start, took on the challenge of WICKED PRINCE near the quarter pole, vied into upper stretch, was no match when the winner swept by approaching the
furlong marker, stayed on and dug in gamely to capture place. WICKED PRINCE pressed the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with LAZARUS near
the quarter pole, vied into the head of the lane, got overtaken by the winner past upper stretch, stayed on, dug in gamely for second best and got nipped for
position on the wire. LUCKY'S SECRET raced off the clear early leaders, chased three to four wide around the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and
lacked a needed rally for impact. EZ FITZ raced off the pace, saved ground and never menaced. SINGING GROOM hopped and came away slow at the
start, trailed through early stages and failed to move into contention. PRIZED TAP raced well off the early pace and was never a factor.

TAP THE BRAKES was forwardly placed in early stages, raced in close contention late on the turn, hustled along two to three wide into the lane, ran on
determinedly and got up late. HOOKED ON DREAMS set a pressured pace through early stages and around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch,
stayed on gamely then got overtaken late. DEER RUN raced off the early pace, hustled along two to three wide around the turn, edged closer then shifted
out a path mid-stretch, closed with response and just missed place. ROWDY RAY tracked the early pace, raced up close three wide late on the turn then
flattened out in the lane. JUSTASTROLLIN raced in range just off the top two flights, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and ran on evenly. A BRUSH
OF LUCK raced in the back, saved ground then swung five wide into upper stretch and never threatened. FRANKLYGREAT raced in contention along the
inside, cut the corner entering the lane, ran on to the eighth pole then quickly retreated.

Footnotes
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was well rated sitting just off midpack up the backstretch, picked up the pace along the outside late on the turn, given cue four wide
at the head of the lane, responded and drove clear in late stages. DOUGHTY tracked up close through the backstretch, hustled up three wide entering the
lane, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. DODGEBALL sped to the lead at the start, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, then cleared the
lead entering the turn, saved ground entering the lane, led the way into the final furlong then got overtaken late. REINA DEL SUR lagged in the back
through early stages, swung five wide into the lane and improved. SAYAAD AIN'T SO pressed the pace up the backstretch, ran on up close two wide
around the turn and into upper stretch then gave way. JACKIE FLASH raced off the clear top trio in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn,
came four paths wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. HERE AND VOW raced near then in the back and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CYBERTOWN was forwardly placed around the first turn then moved up to engage SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR entering the backstretch, continued to duel
for the lead around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane, drifted out wider under left handed pressure then straightened out and pulled away.
TEXTHELEGEND secured inside position around the first turn, settled off the pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo along the rail around the far
turn, tipped two wide for the drive, finished with response and second best. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR led the way around the first turn, vied inside of
CYBERTOWN up the backstretch and around the far turn, could not move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane and weakened to show. FORCED
RANKING rated off the clear top trio up the backstretch, hustled along three wide in upper stretch and needed more for late impact. SEASIDE BOY lacked
speed, trailed in the back and had no late response. DAVIDIC LINE stumbled badly at the start and lost all initial momentum, steadily picked up the pace
and moved into contention around the first turn, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, loomed up close mid-way around the far turn, came under a ride but
failed to move on and faded in the lane.

HANKS GIRL vied outside of SISTER SWEDE for the lead up the backstretch, shook free entering the turn, hustled up three to four wide into upper stretch,
widened advantage and finished clear. JADA was well placed sitting just off the embattled pair, made a move for HANKS GIRL entering the turn, came four
paths wide into stretch stretch, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of the eventual winner but had to settle for second best. SHANNON K tracked the top trio
up the backstretch, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, kept on and just lasted for show. RED SANGRIA got bumped back at the start and trailed up
the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the turn, hustled up into the stretch run and just missed show. SISTER SWEDE dueled inside of eventual winner
up the backstretch, could not match strides entering the turn but ran on, and came up empty a furlong out. MISSION MAKER raced off the early pace and
saved ground, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. NEW YEAR'S BELLE broke out and bumped foe at the start, raced off
the early pace and had no late response. WICKED HOT FOOT failed to move into contention.
