Footnotes
BRICKLAYER raced at the rear two wide, tugged subtly moving between horses entering the backstretch, inched closer to the leading trio turning for home
in the three path, tipped to take aim outside of them entering upper stretch, lacked progress through midstretch, but gradually closed in on the bumping
leaders in the final furlong and forged an advantage at the wire. PRINCE OF POWER stalked outside of the top pair, flagged his tail entering the
backstretch, bid three deep turning for home, dueled with inner rivals entering the lane, brushed an inner PUBLICITY in upper stretch, exchanged firm
contact with that one at the furlong grounds, bumped again sparring into the final sixteenth, led late but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. SEVEN
TAYLORS bumped an inner rival at the start before being sent inside of rivals to show the way into the first turn, led as an outer pair of rivals challenged
around the far turn, got headed by them nearing the lane, yet fought on thereafter and reclaimed show while getting outkicked by an outer rival in the closing
stages. PUBLICITY pressed two wide, vied between horses turning for home, took light contact from his outer counterpart in upper stretch, exchanged
firmer contact with that one at the furlong grounds, bumped again battling into the final sixteenth but yielded late. BOUNTEOUS was bumped by an outer
rival at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, shifted two wide to surpass a tiring rival nearing the lane and failed to menace. TAPITORO pursued four
wide, checked when he subtly took contact from a rival's tail-flag entering the backstretch, came under urging chasing outside of rivals around the far turn
and tired. ROCKET NIGHT was eased back to tuck behind foes entering the first turn, tracked along the inside but tired turning for home. A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REVIEWING THE ACTIONS OF PRINCE OF POWER AND PUBLICITY IN THE STRETCH RUN RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
THERESASILVERLININ led from an inner prompter into and around the turn, then shook clear in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. DE' ANS
EIGHTY laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced inside of foes entering the lane, shfited out four wide nearing midstretch and sustained his rally to
gain place at the sixteenth pole. WUPKAR prompted inside of the eventual winner, gave way to that one in upper stretch, lost place to an outer challenger at
the sixteenth pole yet fended off a different outer bidder for show. PUNCHY GIRL tossed her head and leaned inwardly at the start, stalked three wide,
chased through the lane, got outkicked for place by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, ran on to vie for show thereafter but hung. COEXIST broke slowly,
trailed in the three path, swung out to the six path into upper stretch and improved position. BIRDIE ROSE tracked four wide, chased around the turn and
faded. CAUMSETT chased from the two path and weakened.

Footnotes
KEEP IT EASY set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure, shook clear of that one entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch and was kept to task via
hand urging. TAP INTO THIS broke inwardly, then checked to avoid the inner rail entering the backstretch, pursued from off of the pace along the inside,
advanced inside of foes entering the lane to gain place at the three sixteenths pole and proved second best. VOODOO DADDY laid off of the pace in the
three path, shifted out to the five path approaching midstretch and offered a belated kick to gain show late. NORMANDY COAST brushed with an inner rival
at the start, laid close up along the inside early on, chased from the two to three path around the turn, bid for place in the four path entering the lane, but
was outkicked by an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, yielded while hanging on his left lead and lost show late. SANDMAN prompted outside of the
eventual winner, came under a drive to sustain pressure turning for home, but yielded in the three path entering the lane and faded between horses. HIGH
LIMIT raced off of the pace in the four path, retreated to trail while tucking to the three path into the turn and was outrun thereafter. ALTOBELLI brushed with
an outer rival leaving the gates, tugged and advanced inside of rivals at the nine sixteenths pole, tracked the leaders from teh four path around the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
GLORIETTE set the pace a bit off of the inside as an outer rival prompted, drew clear in upper stretch, came under a drive at the furlong grounds and was
kept to task. RED HOT JEANIE brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, claimed place from an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole
and chased the leader home to be second best. THE BIG CALHOUNA pressed the eventual winner from the three path, gave way in upper stretch and
lasted for show late. SMART WITH HEART brushed with an inner foe leaving the gates, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path
turning for home and stayed on willingly. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA tracked in the four path and faded. ROYAL BLOOD laid off of the pace along the inside,
moved to the three path around the turn and failed to factor. WHAT'S CRACKIN broke outwardly, trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
GLACIAL POWER set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge in upper stretch and held firm. SEND CASH stalked two wide, bid in upper stretch
but was kept at bay through the final furlong. BEER RUN took light contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the top
pair with multiple lengths to find in upper stretch and chased willingly. SURF CITY laid off of the pace two wide, swung out to the seven path into upper
stretch, ran on while hanging on his left lead in the final furlong and edged fourth passing the sixteenth pole. CAFE RACER chased from midpack in the
three to four path, pursued between horses entering the lane, briefly encountered traffic passing the three sixteenths pole, then stayed on between horses.
WENDELSSOHN brushed an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but lacked the needed kick
between horses in the final furlong. TROUBLE'S ROARING pursued from midpack along the inside, then chased through the lane and lacked a bid. D DAY
bumped an outer rival upon leaving the gates, tracked three deep, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, leaned inwardly chasing into midstretch and
yielded between horses nearing the sixteenth pole. EXCELLENT CHANCE broke a step slow, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, shifted out to
the four path into upper stretch and failed to menace. NYTTIME STORY was bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and got
outrun. HE'S ELUSIVE tracked two wide and between horses, then faded through the lane. LUCKYASIWONSWAS was slow away and showed little.

Footnotes
GLOBAL SENSATION set the pace inside of a prompting rival into and around the turn, shook free and shifted out in upper stretch, then lasted from a pair
of outer bidders late. TIMELESS BOUNTY laid off of the pace, came under urging chasing in the four to five path around the turn, then sustained steady
progress in the final furlong, offered a late bid as an outer rival ranged up alongside, but missed between horses. BEYOND BEST trailed along the inside,
shifted out to the four path entering the lane, closed in on the rest before tipping out to the six path at the sixteenth pole, surged late but ran out of ground.
PURE PANIC stalked three wide, came under urging in the four path turning for home, chased between horses into the lane, flopped back to his left lead at
the furlong grounds, ran on along with outer rivals late but needed more. PRINCIP popped the stall doors open pre-race, tracked from the two path, chased
into the lane and gave way. MAC DADDY TOO prompted outside of the eventual winner and from the three path, bid entering the lane, but was turned away
in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MO FIGHT set the pace in the two path, led from an outer prompter around the far turn, then drove clear in upper stretch. SUN THUNDER laid off of the
pace along the inside, advanced inside of rivals leaving the three quarter pole to stalk with nine sixteenths to go, awaited racing room around the far turn,
edged place from an outer rival in midstretch and chased the clear leader home. SHOPPER'S REVENGE stalked in the four path, moved forward to press
the leader from the three path approaching the backstretch, sustained pressure around the far turn, but yielded in upper stretch, lost place to an inner rival at
the furlong grounds and kept on. BOURBON RESOLVE tracked from the two path, was surpassed by an inner rival with eleven sixteenths to go, pursued
two wide and between horses into the far turn, awaited racing room briefly turning for home, then lacked a rally. GLEN AIRY laid off of the pace in the three
to four path around the first turn, trailed down the backstretch, inched closer five wide into the lane, but brushed an inner rival straightening for home and
flattened out. GAME WARDEN tracked in the three to four path around the first turn, came under urging chasing around the far turn, got brushed by an outer
foe entering the lane and yielded.

Footnotes
GHEE FOR THE WIN stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch and drove past passing the sixteenth pole. WHERE IS
SHE set a clear pace around the turn, but was caught with a sixteenth to go and remained well clear of the rest. BELLA ESTRELA saved ground off of the
pace, stayed on to offer a late inside bid for show and prevailed. ELLIOTT MOON tracked four to three wide into the turn, chased in the two path turning for
home, but was bested for show by an inner bidder in the late stages. MAYLEN lacked speed along the inside, shifted out three wide into the turn causing
trouble for an outer rival in the progress, crept closer four wide around the turn and stayed on mildly. TEAMANYMARTUNIES broke a step slow, chased
from midpack in the three path and failed to menace. IUKA MISS raced at the rear three wide, steadied hard when an inner rival shifted across his path into
the turn, tucked to the inside shortly after and improved position. DAME MAUDE CHARDIN broke a step slow and failed to factor from the five path.
TALAVERA raced forwardly three to two wide and between horses, but faded among foes around the turn. TAPWRIT WARRIOR made little impact from the
five path. NOTHING BUT TIME raced forwardly two wide and between horses down the backstretch, but was done early.
