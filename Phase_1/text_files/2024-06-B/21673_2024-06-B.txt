UP TO PARTY, got away third best while breaking out three paths, down a neck early to BIG HURT, asked right handed early, grabbed the lead before the
gap, asked again passing the gap, opened up a half length lead on MY BUDD, asked again when stablemate Ultimate Battle challenged, responded well
and kept to a drive to the wire. ULTIMATE BATTLE, away with rival UP TO PARTY, leaning in a bit early, leveled prior to reaching the gap, asked passing
the gap, made mild progress while never threatening the winner to the wire. DEVILS TOWER, away cleanly while breaking out two paths, quickly was down
three quarters, asked twice at the gap while being down a length and a half, and kept to a drive the rest of the way, while making up ground to get up for
third in a photo. LAREDEAUX, away well, asked right handed early, asked again approaching the gap, drifted out a path, and kept to a drive in the final
sixteenth while drifting out three paths. MY BUDD, away best, asked left handed approaching the gap, barely drifted out, but that was enough to make
contact with NORCO, bumped twice, and bobbled a bit from the contact, asked right handed, and drifted out when LAREDEAUX drifted out in the final
sixteenth. FEAR N FRIDAYS, rider hit by assistant starter, quickly down three quarters early while lugging out three paths, lightly asked right handed early,
mildly drifted in while switching leads passing the gap, and kept to a hand drive to the wire. NORCO, down a half at the jump, weaved in and out early in
between rivals, lugged in to right handed urging, then crowded and pinballed when rival BIG HURT lugged in and made contact at the eighth pole, kept to a
hand ride to the wire while drifting out. BIG HURT, away best and up a neck early, lugged in a path approaching the gap, asked twice right handed and
lugged in to bump rival NORCO, turned sideway passing the eighth pole, quickly asked right handed after the contact, and weakened, while being floated
out by NORCO. ROBS REASON, rubbed outer part of the gate, then shifted in to be quickly down a length at the start, asked right handed early, leveled,
asked right handed again, and lugged out passing the gap, shifted out another two paths, when rider was about to ask again right handed, attempted to shift
out yet again late and corrected hard, and not asked final hundred yards. JESS SEND KEVIN, was moving head to the right when gate was being opened,
causing the flipping halter to hold the gate closed, came away slow and lost all chance. STEWARDS INQUIRY, ON JESS SEND KEVIN S
