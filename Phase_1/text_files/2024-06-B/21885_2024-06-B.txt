Footnotes
GOLD PLUS pressed two deep from the outside of rival and finished strongly to edge away under steady pressure. OCEAN JET was hustled along early,
raced two to three wide around the far turn but was no match for the winner. ACCELERATEDVICTORY dropped in to save ground through far turn and
finished willingly in the wire racing four deep. MONTANA'S ANGEL was shuffled back at the start, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and moved up
mildly to improve position through the drive. CRITICAL VELOCITY showed good early foot and faltered the final eighth of a mile. DON'T BE BOSSY raced
two deep near the quarter pole, shifted out five deep into the lane and never was a serious threat. AVIE J raced from the outside of Don't Be Bossy, fanned
six to seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SHELBI'S STAR was bumped soundly at the start and never menaced. KRAFTY TAFFY
raced six wide into the upper lane and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
R T'S CAJUN LADY dueled three deep from the outside of rivals and finished strongly to edge clear under steady pressure. EASY BET was bumped
soundly at the start, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and rallied willingly to the wire three deep. DIAMOND COUNTRY dueled near the rail and
weakened a bit late. MAGICAL DEAL raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. FIVE LEAF CLOVER was squeezed back at the
break, had an inside run and never threatened. HARD CANDY KISSES raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. MICHELINE
GAIL was bumped at the start, vied between rivals and tired readily.

Footnotes
KING OF CONTRABAND rated off the early pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch and surged up late under strong handling. SINGLE SHOT stalked
the pace, moved up three wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. CARTHAGE CAJUN pressed the pace from the inside and gave way
grudgingly late. CHECK ME OUT pressed the pace from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ANOTHERBOTTLE dropped back early, raced
along the inside near the quarter pole, angled out and never threatened. WHITE ICE dropped back early and failed to respond. FREE FROM GUILT trailed
early on, swung out into the upper stretch and was eased up on.

LONE WARRIOR pressed the pace near the rail and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. RAYDEN AND REMI raced two deep near the
quarter pole, drifted through the and finished gamely late to edge up for the place position. RUNNING RAGGED set a pressured early pace two deep and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. TAP THE TEQUILA swung wide into the lane, raced from the far outside and had not enough. BOX OF CANDY raced
along the inside around the far turn and had no response. SEVEN DIGITS dropped back early, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a
bid.

into the upper stretch and had no late rally. JOEY'S LIGHTENING stalked the pace three deep and faded in the drive. TAKEOVER FIFTYFOUR raced from

Footnotes
ORDER UP was unhurried early on to race off the pace, advanced from the outside through the far turn, swung wide into the upper stretch and surged up
late under strong handling. LOVELY SASSICAIA was sent to a clear early lead and was caught near the wire to just miss. SPEIGHTFUL ONE chased the
pace, saved ground through the far turn and kept on to the wire. EL DEAL ME ACES raced two deep near the quarter pole, angled out and flattened out in
the drive with no closing run. BACK BAYOU was under a hard chase two deep and faded. CALIBRACHOAMATTERS was urged along early, raced three
wide around the far turn and weakened through the drive. GATSBY'S FORTUNE raced from the inside, was in tight, shuffled back near the three eighths
pole and weakened through the drive. Jockey of Gatby's Fortune claimed objection against Speightful One for interference and stewards ruled no change.
HUFFS TAZ A BOO was bumped, checked at the start, raced wide around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. HARPES HILL raced from
the outside in the lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CUSTOM DESIGN rated back off the early dueling pair, made a four wide through the far turn and finished well to prevail late under strong encouragement.
A RUNNIN AFLEET raced off the early going, swung wide into the lane, surged late and missed. CANKTON'S COWGIRL dueled two deep from the outside
of foe, cleared off nearing the eighth pole and missed in a game effort. R T'S GEM raced mid pack early on, was four wide between through the far turn and
had not enough in the drive. SWEET ALEXIS stalked the pace along and had no final winning bid. RED WHISTLE dropped back early on, raced from the
inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, angled near the eighth pole and had no late rally. SWEET LITTLE ROSE raced near the inside past the
five sixteenths pole, angled out and lacked a solid bid. JET ROCKET chased three deep and gave way. MY ROYAL PRINCESS broke in a tangle, raced off
the pace and never was a factor. CAJUN CATALINA dueled for the early lead and stopped.
