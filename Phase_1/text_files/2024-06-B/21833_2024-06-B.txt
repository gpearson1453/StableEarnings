leaders, rallied in the stretch dueled the winner and held on gamely. APEROL SPRITZ prompted the pace outside, took over at the quarter pole, rallied clear
then yielded. CANNY LAND angled inside early, rated to the stretch, angled out bid then flattened out. LA BELLA BOROBETA set a pressured pace inside
then proved empty in the stretch. CHRISTIETALOFVERVE dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. LADY GABRIELLE dropped back inside and
lacked a response. MELODY'S KISS raced far behind throughout. I'M A LUCKY GIRL lacked speed and weakened steadily.

advanced inside through the stretch to just gain place. BADBADBOBBY moved closer into the far turn, vied briefly then weakened. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN
lagged far behind then passed rivals while no factor. CALL ME NOW pressed the winner along the rail for half mile and gave way. I'M NOT A BABY settled

RUNANDSCORE led under rating hold, shook loose nearing the quarter pole, drew away and lasted under modest urging. TRAFFIC MASTER settled close
up inside, went after the winner into the stretch with a gradual gain. SUPREME BEING underwent shoe repair in paddock, trailed early then offered late
energy wide. NOT THISTIMERANDY saved ground off the pace and continued willingly in the stretch. FERRARI KID pressed winner for three quarters and
gave way. GAME SEVEN prompted pace three wide then stopped midway on the final turn. NONEEDTOWORRY lacked speed and gave way losing
contact with his field.

Footnotes
SWING OIL quickly sprinted clear, widened to the eighth pole and remained clear in another convincing score. DISTURBED advanced inside on the turn
then narrowed the gap through the stretch while unable to threaten winner. HOMETOWN HERO lacked speed, raced wide early, angled inside with a mild
rally. COMMINGLING raced between rivals in second flight and weakened. DUDLEY DICKERSON was urged off the pace three wide and faded.
BOOSTER SHOT chased very wide throughout and lacked a response. GAMERUN hit the side of the gate at the start causing rider to lose his irons and
any chance.

AMALFI LADY eased back off the pacesetters and chased between, bid inside in the lane and was up in the late stages. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA broke
awkwardly and trailed, rallied wide, loomed a threat but was outfinished. RITAAN advanced three wide after half a mile, moved clear quarter pole then tired
in the final eighth. CULPA BLANCO angled inside early and stalked pace then faded on the final turn. GRYPHON'S WINGS prompted the pace outside then
along the rail and gave way in the stretch. GORMLEY GIRL saved ground behind the leaders and faltered. NO MORE DIAMONDS led under pressure
inside for five furlongs and stopped.

TYRONA stalked the pacesetters outside, bid on the turn, collared the leader and pulled away through the stretch. LOVE TO EAT controlled the pace inside,
was collared into the stretch and was no match for the winner. TEMPEST RISING settled in the two path then finished well in the final furlong. FROSTED
DIAMOND bumped early, advanced inside and failed to menace. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS prompted the pace in the opening quarter then weakened steadily.
ROYAL PARTY trailed far behind then caught a fading rival late. PINK ROSE chased wide down the backstretch and gave way readily.

Footnotes
THE GATEKEEPER quickly moved clear, widened on the final turn and stayed safe under a steady drive. SILENT MODE settled close up inside, faded on
the final turn then came again for the place. LEVEL UP pursued the winner to the final furlong and weakened. WHITEWALKER lacked speed, made a brief
bid after half a mile then flattened out. KING SWANSBORO dropped back early and lacked a rally. FENWICK JACK broke slowest and was always outrun.
LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind inside then passed fading rivals. MENDELSFLY raced within striking range early then stopped abruptly. MAMA
BANNED ME chased far behind throughout. PER RULING ECM2024-234/ECM FROM HIWU THE GATEKEEPER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO
UNPLACED FOR A CONTROLLED MEDICATION RULE VIOLATION.

Footnotes
SOUPER FLY OVER broke a step slowly, angled wide on the turn, split foes late and was just up in a determined effort. FAST BOB dropped back early,
advanced inside, rallied but was edged in a tight finish. EGO MAN went after the pacesetter on the turn, loomed a threat but was outfinished.
JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF broke alertly and sprinted clear, was collared near the quarter pole, resisted then tired slightly. JOVA chased along the inside and
never a factor. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS trailed far behind and was never in contention. TAP IN FORMATION chased in clear wide, moved closer before half
a mile then came up empty late.

Footnotes
DREAMWITHINADREAM settled off the pace, bid in midstretch and wore down the leader in the final sixteenth. STAY FUNNY soundly bumped about at the
start, rushed to contention, led clearly in midstretch but tired. MY BOY TULLIO dropped well behind then narrowed gap too late. BIRTHDAY BOND ROB
lacked speed then finished well in the final furlong wide. PACIFIC STATES broke alertly then dropped back and rallied mildly. WHY STOP THERE forced
the pace in the opening quarter then began tiring on the turn. LOVE IS FOREVER earned a narrow advantage early, vied through the turn and faltered.
BRASI flashed speed inside then gave way readily. THIS TIME BLUE chased in midpack and lacked a response. GOLD BLING trailed far behind
backstretch and was always outrun. JSK CROWNPRINCE dropped back early then stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.
