MIGHTY GYPSY was hustled to the front, set all the pace under pressure to the second turn then pushed away through the lane. DASHINGMOONLIGHT
pressed the winner throughout, was two wide to the stretch then drifted inward in upper stretch, crowded and bumped ZEPHYR CAT in deep stretch and
held the place. ZEPHYR CAT was outsprinted to the backstretch, saved ground and made a bid inside of DASHINGMOONLIGHT into the stretch but was
crowded and bumped by that one nearing deep stretch and finished evenly. MORDIGAN tracked the pace three wide early then saved ground on the
second turn but lacked a closing bid. JEWELED AGAIN broke a bit slow then was fanned out to the five path on the first turn, trailed to the stretch and was
never a threat. PARTY TIME GAL chased the pace three wide for three furlongs then weakened. Following a steward's inquiry into the stretch run, #3
DASHINGMOONLIGHT was disqualified and placed third for interference to #! ZEPHYR CAT in the stretch.

XTRAFINE XTINA went right to the front, set all the pace inside then drifted out slightly while holding steadily. SIMONSITO tracked the pace to the second
turn, bid three wide to the stretch then was easily second best. CABALLERANGO pressed the winner for three furlongs, was outkicked on the second turn
and finished evenly. CORAZON DE LUCIA had no speed and was never a threat. MR MEMPHIS chased the pace three wide but came up empty.

Footnotes
LORD OF LIGHT hurried early to contest the pace to the first turn, inched away on the backstretch then responded to kick clear in the drive. ROJO
PEQUENO had good speed, dueled outside the winner early, pressed that one to the stretch then saved the place. FOYT was fanned four wide to the
backstretch, stalked to the second turn, got outkicked in the drive and could not get second. LUCCA'S LEGACY was also four wide early, chased to the far
turn then came up empty. SMOKENSILVER had no speed and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT DADDY got outsprinted then saved ground to no avail.
LONGFORD was never a threat.

Footnotes
RAY OF THE SEA dueled for the lead outside a rival for a half mile, lugged out five wide on the final turn then continued to lug out, bumped ANTICIPATED
repeatedly in the drive then got the nod. ANTICIPATED stalked the pace for a half, bid three wide then was carried out six wide by the winner to the stretch,
was battling that one while being bumped repeatedly in the drive and just missed. SIR LAUGHALOT settled early, made a run a half mile in, was outside
rivals and carried seven wide to the stretch then was outfinished by the top two. MASHHAD FLATS pressed the pace for five furlongs then got outkicked on
the far turn and finished evenly. BOB'S SNIPER dueled from the rail for five furlongs then tired. LOOKIN FOR GOLD had no speed and was not a factor.
DANCE COMPANY was always wide and never a threat. Following a steward's inquiry, RAY OF THE SEA was diisqualified from first and placed second for
interference to ANTICIPATED. Also a claim of foul by the rider on SIR LAUGHALOT against both RAY OF THE SEA and ANTICIPATED was not allowed.
