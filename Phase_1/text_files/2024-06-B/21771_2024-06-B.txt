Footnotes
PRANCINGTHRUPARIS dueled from outside, four deep at the three-eighths pole, lost ground and chased the top trio approaching the five-sixteenths pole,
entered the lane six wide, came back on and drove clear in the final sixteenth to win going away. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE got put in tight between foes
early, bid between on the turn, got floated out a bit into the lane, fought to midstretch, could not match the winner late but stayed on to regain second.
ANDIAMO RAGAZZA was off slow to begin, moved up on the inside, challenged inside rivals on the turn and took a short lead, drifted into the lane, cleared
midstretch, yielded to the winner in the late stages and lost second. ACT OF SERENDIPITY tracked off the rail, had to pause when running on heels
nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, went two then three wide on the turn, moved inward in the lane and chased within striking distance but could not find the
needed late kick in deep stretch. REALLY THIRSTY dueled for the lead off the rail inside a rival, vied three deep on the turn, got floated out into the stretch
and weakened in the drive. DON'T WORRY BOSS broke a step slow on the outside, moved into range quickly, chased widest through the turn, drifted
inward in the lane and weakened. BLACKJACK BETTY forwardly placed outside the top pair early, got crowded between rivals near the seven-sixteenths
pole, trailed three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn, rallied from inside and drew alongside the leader in the final sixteenth, took
over late and held over LISA'S ANGEL in the closing moments. LISA'S ANGEL tracked well off the rail then moved into the four path on the turn, angled out
into the stretch, finished well from outside but was outclosed by the winner. FUNKY GREY dueled from outside then cleared inner rival early, showed the
way along the inside on the turn then two wide into the lane, remained unchallenged to the eighth pole, held a diminishing lead approaching the sixteenth
pole and yielded to the top pair late. ILA VEIW TOO bothered a bit by FUNKY GREY at the start, chased from off the pace, between rivals into the turn,
went two then three wide around the bend, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch, moved to a clear path and kept on for a minor award. CROWN OF HOPE
chased outside rivals out of range, went three deep into the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened. BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY had early speed
between the top pair then ceded command, stalked the leaders two wide into the turn, eased out and came four wide into the stretch and also weakened in
the drive. PLUM CREEK went up to duel briefly from inside then chased after FUNKY GREY at the nine-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend along the inside
then two wide into the drive and tired in the final furlong.

CORALGABLESKAYLIN brushed leaving the gate, showed speed between foes early then steadied at the half-mile pole, challenged from outside at the
five-sixteenths pole, got floated out into the stretch, took over shortly after, led clear into the final furlong, lugged out near the sixteenth pole, straightened
out quickly and held late. LIL' BOOM BOOM chased off the rail, three wide on the turn, moved out and came five wide into the lane, moved out further then
rallied inside the leader late and got denied. I HAVE A DREAM vied three deep then dueled from outside past the half-mile pole, cleared early on the turn,
tested again at the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out into the stretch, yielded to the winner and flattened to third. SWIFT HARMONY vied inside a pair of rivals
then dueled past the half-mile marker, could not keep up with I HAVE A DREAM on the turn and came off the rail to give chase behind the top pair, stayed
within striking distance into the final furlong but weakened in the late stages. SWEET ELLA RAE brushed lightly with outer rival at the start, chased off the
pace, entered the lane two to three wide and could not rally. PROMISE ME KAT broke slow and came in at the start, trailed up the backstretch, angled in to

Footnotes
ACE ACE BABY hit the gate to lose a step, chased from outside, closest in pursuit three wide into the turn, took over around the bend and cleared at the
five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the stretch and held safely. DIXIE BLAZE got crowded between early, chased two wide into the turn, spun four
wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. SENT BY ANGELS forwardly placed early, chased two then three wide around the bend and
finished evenly for the show honors. BRUINS MASTERY forward placed up the backstretch, angled out on the turn, exited the bend five wide and lacked a
rally. SPICY SPOUSE sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, drifted out a bit and lost command and chased the new leader past the
five-sixteenths pole, then weakened down the lane. CY'S SILKSTOCKING got crowded between foes then climbed badly and had to take hold, trailed on
the inside to the stretch and passed tired rivals. R MARILYN LONHRO stumbled in the beginning, laid off the pace, came five wide into the stretch and failed
to menace. BETTER B WORTH IT chased between and got put in tight quarters early, went six wide into the stretch and faded. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
STORMY SAMURAI set the pace outside BEING BLESSED to the turn, cleared that rival around the bend, led three wide into the stretch and remained
clear under urging to the line. BEING BLESSED pressed the pace from inside early, chased after the winner on the turn, kept on through the lane and
regained second. BIG CHEDDAR chased the top pair to the turn, took aim three, four, then five wide on the turn, closest in pursuit entering the final furlong
but was edged for second. DR. TROUTMAN tracked four wide into the turn, moved out and came six wide into the lane and finished evenly in the furlong
grounds. WHOA BUDDY tracked from inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to threaten. FEROCIOUSLY chased five wide leaving the backstretch,
drifted seven wide leaving the bend and lacked the needed response. WORTH LOOKING trailed well off the inside in the early going, raced six wide on the
turn then got carried eight wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CRYPTO CRAZE set the pace under pressure from outer rival, cleared on the turn, showed the way three wide into the stretch, held a comfortable lead
entering the final furlong, grew a bit weary late but churned on to secure the victory. PETESOLDFASHIONED chased out of range four wide into the turn,
moved into the two path and split rivals, closed well through the drive and outfinished GOSTOSO for second while gaining on the winner. GOSTOSO gave
chase four wide into the turn, eased out and came six wide into the lane, finished well in the late stages but got edged by the runner-up for second.
MIDNIGHT MOJO stalked off the rail then moved to the inside, saved ground around the bend, cut the corner into the stretch and finished evenly late. POP
D'ORO pressed the pace from outside, could not keep pace with the winner around the bend and chased four wide into the drive, then flattened in the late
stages. EMBERS OF GOLD tracked from the five path leaving the backstretch, moved inward and came three wide into the stretch before weakening down
the lane. VEGAS MOON dropped back and trailed early, took the turn three wide then angled out into the stretch and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
DOTHRAKI broke alertly, prompted the pace from outside, took over around the bend, cleared under confident handling in upper stretch, coaxed along
entering the final furlong, drifted inward while asked right handed approaching the sixteenth pole, dug in late to hold off rivals on both sides in the closing
moments, bled following the race and was transported off the track via equine ambulance. SCHWARZMEIER fractious in the gate, broke a step slow, went
up to take control and set the pace under pressure from DOTHRAKI, relinquished the lead to that rival on the turn, fought from inside to the top of the lane,
lost contact in upper stretch, came back on in the final furlong but got denied. MONGOLIAN GOLD laid off the pace in the early going, traveled along the rail
then two wide on the turn, steered out in the lane, closed fast from outside but ran out of time. SEMPER INVICTUS broke slow on the inside, trailed well
back early, also raced along the rail then two wide on the turn and kept on for a minor award. MENDELSSOHNS MUSIC chased the top pair four wide
leaving the backstretch, steered down to the two path then went three wide into the lane and weakened when called upon.

Footnotes
COURT SNORT sat off the pace, angled five wide around the turn, surged late from outside and drove clear near the wire. WOODBINE WAY set the pace
off the inside, took the turn two then three wide, raced clear into the final furlong but was run down by the winner late. INDY'S STAR stalked from outside,
loomed four wide into the stretch, continued within striking range at the furlong marker but faltered in deep stretch. DREAM PRINCESS climbed a bit and
was taken out into the clear early, rounded the bend in the three path and passed tired rivals in the lane. FAMILY TRIPS forwardly placed to the inside of the
leader to the turn, saved ground and cut the corner into the drive but weakened under urging. BELLA RENELLA stalked between early, moved inside for the
turn, came two wide into the stretch and weakened.

leaving the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch, challenged from outside midstretch, drifted inward under the right hand, dueled with LOVESICK

the backstretch, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took over in upper stretch, drifted inward while dueling with NONE ABOVE THE LAW and yielded
grudgingly late. DONT FIGHT THE FED went up to duel from inside and drifted out a bit around the first turn, continued to fight head to head with COWBOY
MIKE to the far turn, fought inside a pair of rivals at the five-sixteenths marker, stayed on to the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. COWBOY
