Footnotes
ONACOUNTA lugged in some leaving the chute, crowding those inside, was settled outside, commenced her bid four wide on the bend, steadily angled out
to stay clear of VIVA VIOLENCE in the stretch and edged ahead in the waning yards. VIVA VIOLENCE pressed the early speed from just outside, gradually
drifted out in the lane, had the advantage briefly with a sixteenth left, held a straight path in the late going but did not have enough left. ABBMAR set a
pressured pace from inside but slowly wore down inside the final furlong. MISS MIA forced inward leaving the chute, lost ground four to five wide taking the
bend, passed tired ones upper stretch then leveled off. BEE A WINNER was forced inward trying to stay clear of ONACOUNTA leaving the chute, was a
brief contender between horses but faded three wide on the turn. PRINCESS MANDII prominent from inside, yielded two wide on the bend. HIDDEN
FIGURE bobbled from the rear at the start, was checked behind MISS MIA leaving the chute and never a factor. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start
but no action taken after their review.

Footnotes
DURANGO CHROME rated in midpack from outside, advanced five wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, engaged C C RITHMS inside
the sixteenth marker, fought on even terms but got the nod at the wire. C C RITHMS stalked the early speed from just outside, floated out to path five
entering the lane, moved clear, was challenged in the late going and had to settle for second best in a game effort. KNUCKLE without early speed, lost
considerable ground widest through the turn, made a strong move the final furlong and got up for third. CUTADAY came into contention four wide on the
bend but began to wear down inside the last eighth. LORD ZEKE chased from off the rail, lost ground fanning to path six into the stretch, lodged a mild bid,
angled in for a clear path with a sixteenth left and made up minor ground. DRINKING TOUR advanced along the rail to have a striking position with a furlong
to go but leveled off instead. LELAND JOHN shared the lead outside PLAY THE BLUES for a little more than half a mile then gave way. MARK'S BUDDY
JACIN chased from inside, fanned out some for the drive but had little to offer. PLAY THE BLUES displayed early speed from inside but quit after a half
mile.

Footnotes
VASARIAH'S IMAGE settled well off the inside, commenced her bid widest on the bend, was all out in the lane and got up in time under a well-measured
ride. AIR GERRI shared the lead outside W W GRAND FINALE, moved clear and took the rail upper stretch, gradually wore down in the late going and was
narrowly outfinished. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE caught in crowding, jostled briefly with GREEN GRACE just after entering the main track, prompted the
pace from just outside, rallied the last furlong but was a bit too late. THE LAST THRILL raced in contention toward the outside, did not keep up four wide
through the bend then also rallied belatedly deep stretch. W W GRAND FINALE displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with AIR GERRI leaving the
turn, angled out some for a clear path in the lane then altered inside the latter as she closed the gap on the weakening leader in the waning yards. GREEN
GRACE jostled briefly shortly after entering the main track, was boxed in behind the early speed on the backstretch, had the rail on the bend, fanned out
behind HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE for the stretch run and was closing the gap late. HARPER BRIANA advanced three wide on the turn, swung five wide for
the drive and also showed a willingness to run deep stretch. ZOEY ATTACK chased from inside, angled out through the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and was making up ground the last furlong. SKIP TO BALI was an early factor but faded along the rail on the bend. I'M INTERESTED chased from between
rivals, was in path three into the lane then steadily yielded.

Footnotes
STUD LOVIN reluctant to load, set a pressured pace between rivals once the race began, came into the stretch from path then gradually lengthened
command under steady handling. JOYFUL GHOST prominent three or four wide, took over second upper stretch, did not have enough to threaten the
leader in the late going but proved easily second best. SWISS GUARD well back, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail some for the stretch run, rallied
the last furlong, split rivals two wide in the waning yards and got up for third. BRIANS WAY was also well back early, in path three on the bend, lost ground
fanning widest into the lane, altered in upper stretch when his path was taken and showed some interest in the late going. VALIANTLY DISCREET pressed
STUD LOVIN from just outside then weakened for the drive. MAJESTIC ATTACK was well placed just off or along the rail for a half mile then began to yield.
DRAMA CRITIC in contention early from outside, was four wide taking the turn, began to fade leaving the bend, angled out widest upper stretch and
continued to give way.

Footnotes
LATE BLACKSMITH shared the early lead from just off the rail, moved clear when allowed on the bend, widened command upper stretch then kept
DIAMONDONICE at bay under steady handling. DIAMONDONICE forwardly placed from outside, made his bid four wide on the turn, lacked the extra
needed deep stretch but was clearly second best. HAND OVER MY HEART well placed from inside, did not keep up on the bend, regained third upper
stretch, was no match for the top pair but maintained his position late. SHEBA'S PAL vied for the early lead from outside, did not stay with LATE
BLACKSMITH leaving the turn and weakened for the drive. DOUBLE DRIBBLE caught in tight quarters, was jostled briefly near the five-furlong pole, two
wide on the bend, angled out five wide upper stretch and had no late bid. RED ROIL chased while toward the outside, retreated three wide on the turn,
swung widest for the stretch run and had little to offer. CHEF RAY WILEY chased from paths two or three and was never a factor. SPEEDY OWENS
improved position along the rail on the turn, swung out five wide for the stretch run and failed to have a significant response. FIVEO'CLOCKCHARLIE
showed little in a ground-saving trip. WIN THE CUP altered in trying to keep a clear path nearing the end of the first furlong, jostled briefly with DOUBLE
DRIBBLE then began to fade three wide on the bend. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

LILY'S WOOFY broke on top, was rated on the front end off the rail but inside rivals, took the rail into the turn, floated out some leaving the bend, battled in
close quarters inside TRIPLE SCOUT, brushed the latter with a sixteenth left, edged a bit more ahead, drifted out with seventy yards left and was drawing
off near the wire. TRIPLE SCOUT shared the lead outside LILY'S WOOF from the beginning, dueled with that one in the lane, retreated slightly with a
furlong to go, was brushed at the sixteenth marker, retreated a bit more, checked off LILY'S WOOFY'S heels seventy yards out, altered in and just lasted for
second. LIL BIT TIPSEY raced in contention outside the top pair from the start, had every chance to rally in the stretch but finished evenly. BETHY saved
ground and also lacked a stretch rally. NOT TO BE DENIED failed to menace. The rider of TRIPLE SCOUT lodged an objection claiming interference from
LILY'S WOOFY deep stretch. After their review, the stewards disqualified LILY'S WOOFY for coming out without being clear of TRIPLE SCOUT and placed
her second.

Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY stalked the early speed from just outside, took over when allowed into the bend, came into the stretch from path three, lengthened her
lead then continued to widen command as she gradually drifted out the last furlong. I LUV THIS BAR prominent from outside, went for the lead outside
BEIRUT BEAUTY on the turn, floated out further entering the stretch, was no match for the latter but was unchallenged for the place. WARM BEAUTY
hesitated then was checked behind ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE at the break, trailed just off the inside, angled out seven wide upper stretch and rallied to gain
third late. BAILESTON LASSIE pressed the pacesetter from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up into the turn, gradually angled out, came into the lane
four wide, moved clear for third, angled in some after entering the last furlong and slowly wore down. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE broke outward, chased from
just off the inside, was three wide entering the stretch and showed late interest between rivals. ORNERY ANGEL chased from outside, advanced four wide
on the bend, swung six wide for the stretch run and lacked a significant bid. WITCHING was an early factor between foes but began to fade three wide on
the turn. SUPERTRIX also hesitated at the break, was steadied briefly behind traffic and showed little in a ground-saving trip. SWEET NELLIE displayed
early speed from inside but gave way before finishing a half mile.
