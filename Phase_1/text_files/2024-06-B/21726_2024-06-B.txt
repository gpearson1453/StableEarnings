Footnotes
HIGHEST MEMORIES broke inward, vied between foes, dueled around the far turn, was clear in the drive and won under strong urging. INCLINED vied
inside, took back on the far turn, bid late and faltered. DATTTS LIFE was bumped and was squeezed back at the start, was unrushed in the three path,
rallied at the three-eighths pole, then faltered in late stretch. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS bore out at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, vied three wide
and gave way in the stretch. THEO'S PROMISE vied in the three path and lacked a late bid. KNEEDEEPJUSTICE bore out at the start, stalked the pace in
the three path but faded in the stretch. MYSTERY IMPACT saved ground to no avail.
