Footnotes
PEGGY RULES was forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn, took a slim lead upper stretch and kept
clear. SWEET STROLL stalked the pace two wide up the backstretch, picked up the tempo late on the turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch,
sustained a steady bid and got up late for place. FLAT OUT ROSE broke on top and quickly cleared the lead, crossed over to the inside, set the pace by a
comfortable margin through early stages, held a slim lead late on the turn, got collared by eventual winner in upper stretch but ran on and cleared the rest.
SING LUCY SING raced off the clear top trio into the turn, saved ground entering the lane and lacked a needed rally for impact. I THINK I KNOW YOU
raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the turn and had no response. KID BIZ lacked speed, raced in the back and steadily faded.

Footnotes
WAR MUSIC raced three paths wide heading into the first turn then settled in good position just off the top pair, remained nicely settled tracking the pace up
the backstretch, moved up closer late on the far turn, given cur three wide at the head of the pane, swept by the embattled pair approaching the furlong
marker and pulled away. RUNNINTHESTREETS was allowed to settle off the early pace, began to pick up the pace along the rail on the final turn, shifted
four paths wide for a clear path in upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and captured place. FEARLESS KRISTIE pressed the pace around the first turn,
continued to force the issue into the far turn, vied for the lead going by the quarter pole, battled on into upper stretch, was no match when the winner swept
by approaching the furlong marker, stayed on and outnodded rival for show. ROSE PARADE set a pressured pace around the first turn and up the
backstretch, then vied inside of FEARLESS KRISTIE at the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch then got overtaken by the winner approaching the
furlong marker, ran on and got edged for runner up spots in final strides. MARSHSIDE MAMA raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into
upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
ROCKIN THE DAD BOD raced up close two wide up the backstretch, moved up to race on equal terms with TOSKA turning for home, took over the lead
approaching the furlong marker and kicked clear. SHIPS ON FIRE was forwardly placed through early stages, remained in close contention along the inside
late on the turn, shifted three wide at the head of the lane, finished with response and cleared second best. TOSKA'S RULER sped to the lead at the start
and crossed over to the inside, set the pace with duo sitting not far behind, took on the challenge of ROCKIN THE DAD BOD leaving the turn, could not
move on with eventual winner past upper stretch and steadily weakened. JAYSKER raced off the clear top trio up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn, cut the corner entering the lane and failed to move into contention. SECRET BLARNEY raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide into upper
stretch and had no rfesponse. CHINLEE raced off the clear top trio, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
BETTY JO tracked the top trio in early stages, picked up the pace mid-way around the turn, came three to four wide into upper stretch, roused for more,
responded gamely and kicked clear near the sixteenth pole. SCOOT ALONG pressed the pace in early stages, took over the lead entering the turn, widened
to a clear advantage, remained clear with a furlong left to run then got overtaken late. SOPHIE'S STAR had no early speed and trailed the field, continued
far back entering the turn, saved ground then found another gear, closed fast down the lane and cleared a share. I GOT A NAME raced off the pace saving
ground, hustled up two wide at the quarter pole, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to move on. WUMPMUG raced two wide in close contention,
ran on through the turn then tired in the drive. GANGSTER AMERICANO set a pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared by rival entering the turn and
steadily weakened along the inside. SONG OF PRAISE raced off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and had no response.

AMERICAIN JOEY tracked the clear leader up the backstretch, edged up into contention near the quarter pole, took over the lead in upper stretch and
finished going away. MEGATAP was reserved and raced well off the pace in a strung out field, continued with a lot of ground to make up entering the far
turn, kicked in four wide at the head of the lane, surged down the lane and captured place. ONE TIME GEM rated off the early pace, saved ground around
the far turn, angled out three wide, gained position and cleared the rest. POKER PLAY set the early pace, continued clear entering the far turn, got collared
upper stretch and gave way. RESOLUTIONIST raced near mid-range in a strung out field, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch and never
threatened. GINGER RULES stalked the pacesetter, urged along the inside heading into the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole and gave way. U S
NAVY CROSS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUGAR BELL tracked the top pair up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn, given cue three wide in upper stretch, edged up closer under right
handed pressure, dug in late and got up in time. MUSICAL DIVA set the pace in the opening quarter, took on the challenge of PLEASINGLY at the quarter
pole, vied to the furlong marker, dug in gamely, shook free then got denied late. PAT'S RIDE settled off the early pace, hustled up inside around the turn,
shifted out four paths wide in upper stretch and finished with good response. PLEASINGLY was forwardly placed stalking the early leader, moved up to
challenge MUSICAL DIVA at the quarter pole, battled two wide for the lead to the furlong marker then flattened out. FULL SPIRIT rated near midpack in the
early going, hustled up three wide around the turn, came four paths wide at the head of the lane and failed to rally. BAYSHORE FOXES raced off the early
pace, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and never menaced. FOOLISH INTENT raced in the back, saved ground and had no response.

Footnotes
CHARMONTE was nicely rated sitting off the clear top trio in the opening quarter, picked up the pace and edged closer late on the turn, came under left
handed urging at the head of the lane, shifted out wider, dug in gamely under firm handling and forged clear in the final sixteenth. CHOJO tracked in good
position sitting just off the embattled pair, moved up to challenge at the quarter pole, took over the lead in upper stretch, continued to lead the way into the
final furlong then got overtaken late. TOFFEE settled off the early pace, hustled up along the inside around the turn, shifted out three wide top stretch,
sustained a steady bid and cleared the rest. ARRESTED was reserved racing in the back, came two wide into the lane and improved position without
threatening. CANDY'S A DANDY raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide entering the lane and failed to threaten. AN AWESOME LEGACY vied
outside of DESERT GAL up the backstretch and into the turn, got collared at the head of the lane and gave way. SNUGGLE BUNNY raced off the pace and
failed to move into contention. DESERT GAL vied inside of AN AWESOME LEGACY up the backstretch and around the turn then tired in the drive. PER
RULING ECM#2024-232 FROM HIWU, CHOJO HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
