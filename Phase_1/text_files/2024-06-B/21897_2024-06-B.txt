Footnotes
MISCHIEF RIVER broke alertly to take then front then chased after GENERAL JACKSON leaving the backstretch, brushed with PRIVMAN and altered in
from behind the drifting leader approaching the five-sixteenths pole, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths marker and remained
strong to the wire. PRIVMAN chased greenly early from outside, gained four wide on the turn before getting carried wide by the leader, drifted inward in the
lane and finished willingly for second. CURVINO veered in and bumped rival at the start, tracked off the rail then moved inside for the turn, churned on down
the lane and held third. GENERAL JACKSON raced up close from inside then cleared into the turn, drifted out around the bend, lost command at the top of
the lane, bothered by PRIVMAN midstretch and weakened in the late stages. SHOW OF FORCE broke inward, chased five wide into the turn, moved into
the four path then ran five wide into the stretch, asked in the lane and could not rally. FREEDOM OF SPEECH came away slow, raced in the second flight,
took the turn two wide, tipped out into the lane and failed to menace. GAME WARRIOR got bumped inward leaving the gate, traveled on the inside at the
back, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. CANYAHEARMEKNOCKIN hit the gate and was off slow in the beginning, settled off the pace, went
five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path around the bend and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
WRONG TURN CUPID sped clear from outside, led two then three wide around the turn, moved out a bit further into the lane, met the challenge from TAPIT
DOUX with a furlong remaining, drifted out out and made light contact and held gamely to the wire. TAPIT DOUX broke inward, chased off the pace, took
the turn three wide, angled out and challenged into the final furlong, drifted in slightly then got floated out and brushed by WRONG TURN CUPID and could
not get by. VELLA trailed up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, angled to the rail then tipped back out approaching the stretch and was along for
the show honors. KEEP YOUR COIL tracked from inside into the turn, came off the rail a bit around the bend and could not produce a bid in the late stages.
MODERA raced in range off the inside, drifted out a bit on the turn and came five wide into the stretch, then weakened down the lane. JACRODRA'S DEVIL
bushed between rivals at the start, chased four wide outside a rival into the turn, came six wide into the stretch and faded out of contention. THE RIDER
ABOARD TAPIT DOUX LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST WRONG TURN CUPID FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THERE WAS
ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME MATTER. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WRONG TURN
CUPID DID DRIFT OUT SLIGHTLY AND MAKE LIGHT CONTACT WITH TAPIT DOUX BUT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

CHASING RAIN pressed from inside then fought head to head to the turn, eased off the rail around the bend and dueled three wide into the stretch, put
away CHARLOTTES DELIGHT at the quarter pole while meeting the challenge from DADDY JUSTIFY, maintained a short lead into the final furlong and
drew clear in deep stretch. DADDY JUSTIFY chased wideset up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, ridden along while moving out, bid six wide
into the stretch, pressured CHASING RAIN into the final furlong but got turned away in the last sixteenth. AUDIBLE SILENCE chased between rivals into the
turn, rounded the bend in the two path, paused when DADDY JUSTIFY drifted over at the top of the lane, tipped out to a clear path but weakened in the
furlong grounds. TOPSTITCH broke a step slow and lost path in the beginning, move up quickly then steadied behind the leader at the nine-sixteenths pole,
drifted slightly and steadied again entering the turn, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. CHARLOTTES DELIGHT bobbled leaving the gate, went
up to grab the lead then dueled outside DADDY JUSTIFY, drifted out while fighting for command, came five wide into the lane, lost touch with the winner a
quarter mile out and weakened. RINGTONE hit the gate and broke in, trailed in the early going, saved ground at the back on the bend and was not a factor.

into the stretch, cleared at the three-sixteenths marker and held well to the line. SMART KITTEN vied three deep in the early going, chased from outside
around the bend, came four wide into the stretch, kept on willingly in the furlong grounds and finished a clear second. AWESOME TAYLOR trailed on the

angled to the inside for the turn and could not rally when needed. KEYCHAIN GIRL vied for the lead between rivals then pressed inner rival past the

Footnotes
IT'S MY HOUSE brushed in the beginning, sped to the front two then three wide on the first turn, led along the rail leaving the backstretch, showed the way
three wide into the drive, carried a comfortable into the final sixteenth, grew weary late and held safely in the end. NAUVOO bobbled and brushed with the
winner leaving the gate, stalked three then four wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled outside a rival on the second bend then moved inward once in the
clear, came with a mild late bid to earn second but was not enough to reach the winner. TAISHAN chased in the four path entering the first turn then moved
into the three path around the bend, traveled two wide leaving the backstretch, moved back out to race wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally but
needed to find more late. HAPI HAPI chased three then four wide early, remained off the rail up the backstretch, came five wide into the stretch and
improved position. DEPARTURE was closest in pursuit along the inside then moved off the rail around the first turn, rounded the second bend two to three
wide and weakened when called upon. MARKS HIP keen two then three wide in hand early, saved ground on the second bend and tired down the lane.

UR IN TROUBLE set the pace under pressure then cleared outer rival, came off the rail and showed the way three wide into the lane, then drew away under
right handed encouragement. DORIE MILLER bumped leaving the gate, chased under coaxing, raced along the rail then two wide into the stretch, finished
willingly and bested the rest. NANCI GRIFFITH pressed from outside early, chased two, three, then four wide around the bend, could not summon a bid in
the final furlong and got edged for second. NEEZER DALTON stumbled and broke inward, tracked three wide into the turn, moved out around the bend and
spun five wide into the stretch, then failed to rally in the final furlong. DISRUPTIVE ARTIST broke a step slow, chased two wide off the pace into the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BIG CELEBRATION got bumped and shut off leaving the gate, trailed well off the rail early, went four
wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide and was not a factor. MS MOAB broke in and bumped, stalked off the inside then angled to the rail to save
ground on the turn but weakened in the stretch run.

CREATIVE OM sped clear quickly to take control, showed the way along the inside then came off the rail to enter the lane three wide, remained
unchallenged into the final furlong and held safely under right handed urging. TAKAMAKAHARA stalked between rivals, ridden along two wide leaving the
turn, closest in pursuit with an eighth of a mile left to run, could not find the needed late kick in deep stretch but was clearly second best. COMMANDER D
stalked off the inside then three deep, remained outside a pair of rivals around the bend, turned four wide into the stretch and weakened in the furlong
grounds. MUCHO SUERTE chased in the four path, came five wide into the lane and also weakened. DRIVE FOR SHOW gave chase three wide into the
turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened when called upon. IGNATOWSKI broke a step slow, stalked from inside, ridden along while cutting the corner
into the drive and faded.

Footnotes
WYNSTOCK stalked in the three path around the clubhouse turn, dropped out of range while coaxed along in the middle stages, stayed off the rail through
the far turn, spun four wide into the drive, closed steadily while drifting inward, confronted CORNELL with a sixteenth remaining, dug in late and won the bob
at the wire. CORNELL stalked from inside through the first turn, closest in pursuit of CURLIN'S KAOS into the far turn, came under a ride along the rail then
eased off the fence and came three wide into the lane, moved out to launch a bid in the lane, rallied to the front past the eighth pole, dueled with
WYNSTOCK late and lost the bob on the line. CURLIN'S KAOS tracked two wide on the first turn, angled to the inside for the second bend, moved off the
fence in the drive, needed to find more to threaten in the final furlong but churned on to regain third. TAPALO took control early and showed the way two
wide then along the rail, opened up on the field in the middle stages, continued well clear around the far turn, lugged out in the lane and held a diminishing
lead approaching the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and weakened in the final sixteenth. KAMAINA CRUISER chased two wide into the first
turn then moved out to give chase three deep around the bend, trailed up the backstretch and far turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
STELLAR CAP got bumped hard leaving the gate, floated in shortly after, chased under coaxing up the backstretch, went two then three wide around the
bend, closed in from outside, drew alongside the leader and shifted in to brush that rival with a furlong remaining and drew off in deep stretch. DONITA
ROSE broke in then came in early, went up to duel for command, lost contact with the leader early on the turn, kept trying in the final furlong regained the
place honors. FLY AT KNIGHT got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, bumped with inner rival again early, switched outside the leader and went up to
duel for the lead, cleared early on the turn, led off the the rail into the lane, challenged approaching the eighth pole, got brushed and shied from the winner
shortly after and flattened to third. PANCHO BARNES broke in and bumped, settled off the pace, ridden along three then four wide on the turn and kept to
task for a minor award. DANZINGWITH MAXINE got bumped from outside early, chased along the rail then two wide into the lane and weakened. G'ORO
got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, trailed early, passed a rival two wide on the turn, improved position further in the lane but failed to menace.
SHOOT FOR THE SKY took a bump from outside in the beginning, traveled near the back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty.
TOM'S STAR veered in to bump rival then lost his path at the start, traveled near the back two wide into the bend, came four wide into the stretch and could
not make an impact. KAVORKA sat off the pace outside rivals, navigated the turn four wide and had little left for the stretch run. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT AT THE EIGHTH POLE AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH STELLAR CAP SHIFTED IN AND MADE
SLIGHT CONTACT WITH DONITA ROSE, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.
