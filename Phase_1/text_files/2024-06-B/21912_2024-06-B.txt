Footnotes
FOLLOW THE FED raced off the pace two and three wide between foes, steadied near the quarter pole, shifted further out in upper stretch, surged through
the final furlong and was up in the final strides. SPIRIT OF VICTORY tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained in the stretch, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole and led until the final strides. ZOYA'S FAITH was bumped between foes at the start, set the pace in the three path, angled down to the two
path late on the turn, led to the sixteenth pole and held well enough for the show. MOONLIGHT VISION had her head turned at the start, advanced two wide
between foes around the turn, gained between in upper stretch, was in tight near the sixteenth pole and dropped back. PRINCESS OPAL was off a bit
slowly, trailed in the three path, swung seven wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. FINAL NOTE bumped at the start, raced up close three wide
and faded in the stretch. QUEEN HONESTY failed to menace while racing four wide. COUNTRY ECONOMICS was bumped at the start, vied at the rail
around the turn and tired in the drive. AIR FORCE BABE chased the pace from the rail and had no closing bid.

Footnotes
SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL pressed in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and
kicked on to inch ahead of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. MYWIFEKNOWSITALL set the pace in the three path, was roused into the turn,
opened slightly from the two path passing the quarter, dug in while tipping out to the five path passing the eighth pole, but was edged out in the final
sixteenth to place. VAYESTA raced off the pace in the three path, was driven into the turn, and kept on from the six path down the lane for show. RED HOT
SPARK bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, but flattened in the final furlong.
MOONSHINING rated inside, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, but did not factor. AVE FENIX trailed in the two path, floated out to the
five path midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and failed to bid. CHASING SILVER bumped with an outer foe at the
start, tracked in the two path but weakened in the stretch.

CAPISCI dueled two wide between foes and dug in gamely to prevail. IRON SHIELD pressed the winner three wide, dueled through the lane and was
unable to get by. NEW BABY settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide turning for home and gained the show. COOL TRICKS saved
ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. BARBARESCO BABY dueled inside of the winner and weakened in the
drive. BLACK AND SILVER raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. NOUVEAU RICHE was outrun inside.
STARSHIP DYNASTY played no factor while racing three wide. OUR MAGIC PRINCESS threw head at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BLAST RADIUS led in the three path for the opening quarter, allowed an inner foe to take over pace-making duties passing the five-eighths pole,
re-engaged with that foe to bid entering the turn, took command under rousing passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and
drew clear. TAPARINO bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed out in the seven path, merged to the three path under a ride going into the turn, drifted
out under left handed urging down the stretch, and chased on for place. RAMESSES raced off the pace in the six path, fanned out to the eight path under a
drive turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. ANNOINTED chased in the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but
flattened. EXPERT WITNESS bumped with foes on both sides at the start, moved up to takeover pacesetting duties from the two path passing the
five-eighths pole, was challenged entering the turn, lost the lead along the inside midway around the turn, and faded. POWER OF JUSTICE bumped with an
inner foe at the start, rated in the two path but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
I'MBIGGERTHANILOOK set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe while ridden out. LOU raced off the early pace, steadied
near the seven-sixteenths marker, moved up in the two path around the turn, angled four wide turning for home and ran on outside.
STRENGTHNGUIDANCE prompted the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch. ZIZKA had early speed between foes,
was impeded near the seven-sixteenths pole, took some awkward strides, nearly unseating the rider, angled out into the four path while regaining the left
iron, chased outside and stayed on evenly in the lane. TO THE MAX prompted the pace two and three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and faded.
GREY SHADOW had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. ROCKVILLE trailed inside, checked near the
seven-sixteenths pole and was never involved. RUIZ JUNIOR clipped heels nearing the turn, lost the rider but stayed on his feet, completed the course
riderless and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND TOOK NO
ACTION.

SHANKAR set the pace in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter, kicked away from the two path in upper stretch, and held sway. CASPIAN SEA
(GB) laid in range in the three path, was roused midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and chased on for place.
HONESTO trailed in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path rounding the far turn, got stymied turning into the stretch, but kept on to get up for
show. GLOBES had an awkward start and chased in the four path turning into the backstretch, was driven around the far turn, but was one paced from the
six path down the lane. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE tracked in the three path, came under a ride between foes passing the three-eighths mark, but faded.
HARRINGTON rated in the two path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
IT'S ONLY WORDS tracked the pace in the four path, bid leaving the eighth pole and powered clear through the final sixteenth. SAND WEDGE stalked the
pace in the clear in the three path, bid between foes leaving the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. LIGHTNING DUST set the pace in the two
path, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened through the final furlong. VERINA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace five wide and
passed tiring rivals. DANNEEL hit the starting gate, raced well back two wide and improved position in the lane. FOR THE THRILL saved ground and failed
to menace. APPLE SAUCY chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. DIVINE CHASE was bumped between foes at the start, saved
ground and was never in contention. JURASSIC CHICK was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. FUTURE FORTUNE played no
factor while racing three wide. PRACTICAL VALE broke outwardly, raced five wide in midpack and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ROLLING ON broke in and bumped with an inner foe, prompted the pace in the four path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, bid while
being floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, stuck his head in front passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. RHUM SAINT ESPRIT bumped
with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, angled into the two path at the top of the lane, and ran on
for place. SMOKIN CLOUD set the pace in the two path, was coaxed in the three path midway around the turn, tipped out to the six path at the top of the
stretch, but evened out for show. EMBRACE THE DREAM bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path and was one paced from the four
path in the stretch. FROSTED FAITH bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated inside but flattened in the stretch. BLACK SEAL bumped between foes at
the start, raced off the pace in the four path and never menaced. INTO YOU bumped between foes at the start, and always trailed around the two path.

BELLY OF JELLY bumped with KARAOKE at the start, tracked the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew off upper stretch and
held safe late. LAS OLAS settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to gain the place. KARAOKE
was bumped twice at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside. HECHICERO set the pace in the two path, yielded near the
five-sixteenths pole and kept on for a minor award. CANDY STREET steadied off heels early, raced three wide in midpack, advanced four wide around the
far turn but failed to sustain the bid. FAST CHAD was bounced around soon after the start, trailed despite a hustling ride, raced three and four wide, spun
widest into the lane and never threatened. BREAK THE ICE saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and was no threat. GO GO
GE chased the pace inside and faded in the stretch. SHIPWRECK chased the pace inside and retreated after six furlongs. RED'S REVENGE pressed the
pace three wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole. MALIBU MIKE was bumped after the start and never reached contention while racing two and three
