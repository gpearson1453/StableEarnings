Footnotes
AMBITIOUS LASS seized control from the onset, dictated the pace unopposed around the turn, opened up on rivals turning for home, was kept to the task
to the finish line and cruised home for the front end score. SALT tracked the leader on the fence in the early going, kept pace with rivals chasing the winner
up front through the bend, skimmed the rail at the top of the stretch and was gaining mildly late but was just second best on this day. READY FOR CANDY
was off a step slow to begin, tracked in the three path down the back straight, was shuffled to last with three eighths remaining, moved quickly when finding
a seam three wide at the quarter pole, shifted out gathering momentum in the five path straightening out for the drive and extended her stride smartly
through the lane to be a solid third at the finish line. SNATCHED trailed the tight pack at the half, made an early move circling four wide around runners
three furlongs from home, was in the thick of things in the four path at the top of the lane, could not sustain the rally, faded late and settled on the fringes in
the end. D'AURUM travelled four deep outside foes in mid-pack along the backside, was nudged three eighths from the wire, could not maintain positioning
on the turn, trailed the field by the quarter pole, angled out six wide for the stretch run but made no impact running to the wire. MOBULA hounded the
frontrunner outside in the beginning, chased the pacesetting winner in vain throughout the turn, could not find another gear in the stretch and wilted at the
furlong pole between horses. CAN'T BUY CLASS tracked two wide with runners on either side along the backstretch, was hard ridden between foes midway
on the turn but could not make any headway around the bend, shifted to the three path for the drive but had nothing more to give by the furlong marker.

Footnotes
STEALIN'TIME had a poor start when off slowly, then was bumped soon afterwards, was allowed to settle into stride trailing down the backstretch, waited
for room midway on the turn, weaved through runners smartly turning for home, flew home while not switching leads in the four path down the stretch and
got up just before the wire with an impressive debut performance. PRETTY GOOD JOKE broke outwards on the start, prompted the pace five deep down
the backside, moved in to bid three wide by midturn, seized control in the three path at the top of the stretch, drifted in slightly driving to the wire at the
sixteenth pole and could not fend off the winner who was surging late. GOLDEN BOSS tracked behind the front group at the half, was checked mildly
behind a wall of runners nearing the three eighths marker, shifted to the two path finding a seam at the quarter pole, lacked room again straightening out for
the drive, sharply split foes with a furlong to go and closed strongly to capture the show award. ELHUBOOB was pushed out/squeezed on the break,
emerged from the pack to have a narrow lead at the half, maintained a slim advantage into the turn, was collared outside by the quarter pole, dueled inside
down the stretch, was checked briefly at the sixteenth pole and faded late for a minor role in the end. HALEY'S HONOR tossed her head on the break,
stalked near the rear in the beginning, made a brief rally three wide outside foes at the quarter pole, was in range for a share of the prize six wide at the top
of the lane, could not find another gear late and stalled at the eighth pole. KIKITSA was in the four path in the mix for the lead down the backstretch, dueled
up top with horses on either side midway on the bend, could not find more in the three path by upper stretch and yielded with a furlong to go.
TENTOMIDNIGHT veered out on the start, was ahead of only one rival down the backstretch, made little progress four wide under a tight hold around the
bend, angled seven wide for the drive to the finish line but offered little run through the stretch. NO LAYUPS pressed the pace three wide between foes
down the back straight, could not stay with others making a move with three furlongs remaining, backed away by the quarter pole and could not factor in the
stretch running. FIREBOLT broke sharply to begin, chased the pace inside in the early stages of the race, had little left to offer on the fence turning for home
and folded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
INDIAN MUSIC was hustled to seize the lead down the backside, set the pace while not really pressed throughout the turn, was headed outside while in the
three path turning for home and stubbornly dug in to prevail at the wire in a exciting stretch duel. SOCIETY'S KAT settled on the rail tracking the frontrunner,
closed in on the fence through the turn, shifted outside at the quarter pole, bid for the lead four wide straightening out for home, determinedly battled to the
wire outside but was denied at the wire in a photo. SOUPER FLASHY tracked outside foes three deep in the beginning, edged closer three wide on the turn,
was in the hunt in the five path at the top of the lane, was no match for the top duo in the stretch but still ran on willingly late to hold for a non threatening
third at the finish line. WICKED MERCURY was checked leaving the chute to trail down the back straight, was on hold waiting for room travelling on the
fence around the bend, had a clear path on the rail at the top of the stretch but could only finish up mildly inside for a minor share in the end.
CANADIANSWEETHEART had a stalking role ahead of only one rival down the backstretch, made little progress near the back of the pack outside foes on
the turn, shifted out widest in the six path for the drive to the line but could not get involved through the lane. SOUPER PECAN settled in midfield between
horses, was hard ridden keeping pace with others around the bend and lacked a rally in the stretch, finishing up one paced to the wire. SHOWGIRL LYNNE
B chased the pace on the rail along the backside, came under a ride between foes trying to maintain position on the turn, had little left for the stretch drive
and faltered at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
MISS VYVYANNE was coaxed from the break and quickly made the lead, set the pace from off the rail, was clear by the half, led them into upper stretch
with others in pursuit and under urging, was all out to the wire and just lasted in a blanket finish. CARA CARA was forwardly-positioned inside the pacesetter
and eventual winner early, eased back and switched out about the half to stalk from outside, was three to four wide in the stretch under an all out drive,
gained steadily but slowly and just missed. I'M INTO MISCHIEF saved some ground mid-pack inside early on the turn, tipped out past the quarter pole, was
four wide in mid-stretch with aim on the leader, bid between foes late but missed. GLORIANNIA settled off the pace, saved ground, rallied up the rail in the
stretch and missed. VERDEJO settled at the back, angled eight wide turning for home, was flying late but missed. PERSONAL PURSUIT was off the
leaders racing five wide through the turn, moved out seven to eight deep for the drive, was gaining late and missed. LUZ DE LA LUNA stalked four wide on
the turn, came into upper stretch five to six deep, was outkicked. OL' BLONDIE was put to urging by the three-eighths racing four wide, swung out six deep
for the drive, made no bid. SACRED DANCER failed to threaten after racing toward the back and off the inside.

Footnotes
LIFE'S JOY was hustled from the start to lead down the back straight, continued up front going comfortably while under little pressure from rivals around the
bend, had something left in reserve down the lane and held off all rivals to the finish line. ONELLA watched the frontrunning winner along the backside,
chased the leader in the turn, was in the thick of things up front with rivals on both sides straightening for home, determinedly fought on but could not get by
the winner through the lane. BOTTA SWING tracked the front duo inside, shifted out three wide closing in on the leaders at the quarter pole, loomed boldly
outside in the three path in upper stretch, was gaining mildly down the lane but needed more late to pose a threat at the wire. YOU BE THE JUDGE was
unhurried to trail outside horses down the backstretch, burst between rivals starting to mount a rally at the quarter pole, was full of run late, angled out off a
rival at the sixteenth pole for clear running room and got up for a small piece of the prize at the finish line. GOOD AS GONE broke outwards to begin,
tracked the front two outside down the back straight, was roused four wide by the quarter pole but could no match strides with others making a move,
evened out in mid-stretch, was bumped inside at the sixteenth pole and could not factor at the wire. MASTER ARAGORN was brushed inside to begin,
stalked outside horses in the early going, was asked for more run three eighths out, offered little response throughout the turn, shifted out five wide for the
drive but failed to fire outside foes driving to the finish line. FIRING BULLETS lacked early foot inside to stalk on the fence, saved ground on the turn but
could not close the gap on the winner and failed to reach contention running inside horses down the stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM

Footnotes
SABATINI was patiently tucked in on the rail behind the front two early on, rated kindly behind the contesting duo with four furlongs to go, was under a snug
hold on the fence waiting to pounce at the quarter pole, moved quickly in the four path to take control between rivals turning for home and when asked at the
furlong marker drew off smartly for a dominating win. CREVALLE D'ORO stalked close to the back of the pack in the beginning, travelled on the rail in the
third flight down the back straight, waited to move while still near the rear with five sixteenths remaining, found a seam extending her stride in the four path
when angling out at the furlong marker and closed well late but could not reel in the winner who had plenty left for the drive. WITWATERSRAND settled
near the back three wide on the first turn, closed the gap along the backside while travelling smoothly in hand, started to go around foes three wide midway
on the far turn, circled five wide turning for home, posed the threat in upper stretch, could not find more by the eighth pole and evened out late to be a clear
third at the wire. GOLDEN GHOST (GB) travelled in mid-division outside rivals, kept a close eye on the contesting duo at the half, seized command for a
moment three wide at the quarter pole, dueled between horses in upper stretch but settled on the fringes when fading late at the furlong marker. SHAMANS
GIRL trailed the field for the majority of the race, finished up with some late energy and passed weary foes in the stretch drive. RED SAMURAI broke in on
the break, was quickly straightened out, pressed the issue inside on the first turn, was reined back midway in the first turn, re-engaged outside at the half
mile marker, briefly poked her head in front five sixteenths from home, was collared outside at the top of the lane and folded inside by mid-stretch. WAVES
OF MISCHIEF was eager at the start to take the lead into the first turn, cleared to the rail three quarters from home, was headed outside by the half, could
not find more vying for the lead on the fence at the quarter pole and backed away on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) was between foes in the very early going then eased back off the leader to stalk from outside, took closer order on the turn, bid at
the quarter pole, was in command in deep stretch drawing clear a sixteenth out under steady handling. WITTY settled outside racing about mid-pack into the
turn, went three to four wide on that bend, swung out a bit further for the drive, kept on late and got up for place in the final strides. STEP FORWARD moved
quickly to the lead setting the pace from off the inside, was engaged late on the turn by an outside foe, dueled with that one till mid-stretch then yielded
grudgingly and was outfinished for place. OCEANIC broke outwardly bumping and forcing another rival out, was up close tracking from inside, raced behind
the leaders leaving the turn seeking room, moved out four to five wide at the top of the stretch, kept on evenly and missed show honors. SECRET
RESERVE settled off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, ran on in the stretch but needed more. SARATOGA FLASH was forced out and exchanged
repeated bumps at the start, angled in heading to the turn, saved ground on then just off the rail on that bend, came out a couple paths for the stretch, ran
on. COUNTY FINAL steadied when in tight in the early going as rivals came in, raced at the back through the turn, swung nine wide for the stretch run, was
never near enough to threaten. OLD CHESTNUT exchanged repeated bumps after the start, settled off the pace outside a foe, angled seven wide turning
for home, failed to menace.

Footnotes
PARAMOUNT PRINCE took the lead from the onset, set a soft pace for these runners into the first turn, cantered along unchallenged down the backstretch,
continued to dictate terms comfortably up top around the far turn, was finally let out a notch to open up straightening out for the drive and there was no
doubt through the lane, holding off all rivals under only mild urging to the finish line. STANLEY HOUSE tracked two wide between rivals, watched the loose
frontrunner sitting just behind the leader down the backside, edged closer to the front on the far turn, chased the winner valiantly in upper stretch and
determinedly stayed on to save the place share at the finish line. WICKED DJANGO was in the two path ahead of one rival in the first turn, was content to
gallop along near the rear down the backside, offered a smart turn of foot, circling three to five wide around foes on the final bend, loomed menacingly in the
five path widest for the drive and battled to the wire but was outrun for the place share. PALAZZI was situated near the rear in the first turn, made little
headway along the backside, began to pick up the bit when ridden two wide with horses on either side three furlongs out and showed good late energy,
bursting between foes late in deep stretch to get up for a minor role in the end. SKYRO settled in the middle of the pack three wide in the first bend, travelled
outside horses in the third flight down the back straight, inched closer to the leader between horses by the quarter pole, fought between challengers in the
two path for a placing turning for home, could not find more late and faded at the sixteenth pole. TYSON tracked three wide outside horses in the early
stages of the race, was hard ridden three wide three eighths from the line, could not narrow the margin on the pacesetting winner through the far turn,
dueled in the four path for the runners up share at the top of the stretch but was one paced to the wire and could not be involved late. QUADRA ISLAND
trailed the field three wide entering the initial turn, continued to see the pack along the backstretch, caught up to rivals outside at the quarter pole and could
not be a factor driving to the finish line. COLLECTIVE FORCE tracked on the rail behind the leader in the first turn, stalked inside in the third flight down the
back straight, kept pace with the leaders while taking the shortest way around in the final bend, was in range for a share on the fence in upper stretch but
lacked a rally to the wire. JIM'S HOPE travelled five wide near the back of the pack outside horses in the first turn, settled in midfield along the backside,
shifted inwards to the rail entering the far turn, made little progress saving ground with five sixteenths remaining and failed to be a presence in the stretch
running.

Footnotes
ESSEX SERPENT was brushed inside to begin, contently tracked the pacesetter on the first turn, moved to the lead assertively when nine sixteenths from
home, was going easily on the front end on the final turn, finally was set down when encouraged right-handed at the furlong marker and held off all
challengers in deep stretch for the score. CAMEO PERFORMANCE settled near the rear on the rail, had one foe beaten along the backside, shifted out
three wide starting a rally three eighths from the line, circled foes smartly by the quarter pole, posed the main threat in upper stretch in the three path but did
not have enough late to reel in the winner at the finish line. MIDNIGHT MASCOT was unhurried to trail in the early stages, began to go past foes on the
outside with five sixteenths remaining, continued to gather momentum swooping five wide at the quarter pole and closed mildly outside to be a non
threatening third at the wire. NATIVE LAND was situated close to the back of the pack three wide in the first bend, made an early move three deep along the
backside to track the winner at the half, chased the leader but to no avail around the far turn, switched leads late when jumping tire tracks at the sixteenth
pole and held for a small piece of the prize in the end. PIPER'S FACTOR travelled in mid-division on the rail in the early going, moved between horses in
early backstretch to be more forwardly placed at the half, came under a ride five sixteenths out making little progress and could not get involved three wide
with rivals on each side in the stretch running. BABBO broke out on the start, led this field in the first bend, was relegated to the chasing role when the
eventual winner seized control in mid-stretch, could not keep pace when roused trying to stay with the leaders midway on the far turn, shifted three wide
between foes at the top of the lane and had no finish to offer in the stretch. MAXIMUS MAGIC tracked inside in the two path in the first turn, lost positioning
travelling down the backstretch to settle in midfield by the half, was scrubbed on inside three furlongs out, had little to offer around the far turn and emptied
out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
IMPLICATED settled off the pace about mid-pack racing in the two path into the turn, moved out four wide in upper stretch seeking room, took aim on the
leader and soon obtained the lead in the vicinity of the furlong marker, drew clear under moderate urging. FEV ROVER (IRE) was forced out and appeared
to lightly brush with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was outside foes on the turn racing three to four wide, swung out seven deep for the drive, closed
mildly but was only second best. MILLIE GIRL settled at the back, raced inside a foe but off the rail on the turn, fanned eight wide turning for home, kept on
well while widest but couldn't quite get the place. FULL COUNT FELICIA broke outwardly, moved forward between foes two to three wide to contest the
pace, took over a narrow lead racing off the rail then moved clear by the seven-sixteenths, had no extra for the lane. FOREVER DIXIE settled at the back
racing off the inside, was mostly two to three wide, gained mildly late. SAFEEN moved through inside to briefly vie for the early lead, dropped back slightly at
the five- and one-half, continued close up in behind while being guided out three wide coming to the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick and
weakened in the final furlong. FAST AS FLIGHT got away alertly and had the early lead while racing very wide, shifted in to regain contact with the others in
pursuit four to five wide headed to the turn, weakened in the stretch. DEVIL'S BIT angled in after the start, settled off the pace inside saving ground through
the turn, failed to menace. DANA'S BEAUTY was lightly brushed at the start, had good early position stalking three to four wide, weakened in the stretch.
CAIRO CONSORT settled outside at the back, fanned seven wide turning for home, failed to menace.
