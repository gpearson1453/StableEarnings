BREAKTHROUGH sprinted to the front quickly, well handled throughout held sway. FAMILY FACTOR slow into stride from inside, rallied along steadily up
rail late. ALL JOKES ASIDE off rail to stretch, split horses in the late going for show spot. WAUHATCHIE good position to the stretch with no late kick to the
wire. EL GAVILAN pressured winner to the turn, floated wide into stretch with no gain. THE PINK Z never menaced throughout. CHIEF BUCKEYE had an
awkward start while bearing out sharply from outside, never a threat thereafter.
