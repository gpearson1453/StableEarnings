Footnotes
MISS FABIANA got away well, set a pressured pace and inched clear in the drive under steady urging. CHAMPAGNE DANCE pressed the pace two
across, fell back in the upper stretch, lacked the needed late response and finished second best. SHORT OF DINERO was taken off the rail, stalked the
pace, failed to rally, settled for show and was clearly best of the rest. MS GLORIA JEAN was never far back, was roused on the turn, went five wide entering
the stretch and weakened in the drive. ONLY GIRL was off a step slowly, saved ground, bid along the rail leaving the turn and lacked a stretch response.
PINK SUNSET lagged early in an outside trip and lacked a bid.

GEAUX YOSHKA broke out to be last away, steadily advanced along the rail, assumed command entering the stretch and drew off. MONEY SONG moved
up inside to set the pace in hand, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, was outclosed and no match late. JOHN'S PROMISE vied early, fell back to stalk the
pace, went five wide entering the stretch, leveled off in the drive and settled for show. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN was void of early speed, dropped inside to
save ground, bid off the rail leaving the turn and lacked a stretch response. LITIGANT got away well, raced mid pack, fell back on the turn and had no
further response. CLASS ACTOR was never far back, raced outside, was through early and stopped.

SPEIGHTFUL SIS vied inside early, fell back to stalk, rallied on the turn, got a head in front mid stretch and drew off. DULCE KIARA was slow early, rallied
around the turn, found her best stride late and got up for place. DELTA CHARM stalked the pace in a steady effort, lacked the needed late rally and was
caught for second. ABOVE THE LIMIT vied two across early, drew away for a clear lead into the turn, was headed mid stretch, pushed in at the gap and lost
position late. HIPNOTIZADA reared at the start to be off slowly, put in a steady effort and improved position. KITTY QUICK lagged in an even effort, bid
inside on the turn and lacked a stretch response. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO had brief speed only. ROYALLY BLUE broke slowly and was steadied at the
start, saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
RAD PAISLEY set the pace, was under pressure throughout and held under urging. AFTERNOON HEAT settled off the pace, bid five wide, was carried out
mid stretch, closed willingly and was gaining late. PRINCE MARCO pressed the pace two wide, came out mid stretch under left handed urging, went
willingly to the wire and didn't have enough late. LORD BERRIER was never far back, put in a steady effort and gained late. DESERT RULER came in at
the start, was taken outside, went widest in the drive and lacked the needed rally. REBEL EMPIRE saved ground, had nothing left for the drive and was not
urged late.

for the drive, bid six wide and finished well to get up for show. SPENCER TIARA pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn,
stayed close, went evenly late and was caught for third. LOTTIE DENO pressed the pace while racing four wide, challenged on the turn, fell back and
leveled off. STREETCORNER flashed speed, fell back and lacked a bid. MOOSE MANDY lacked a response and trailed the field.

FOR FLYING (BRZ) stalked the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, got through, angled out for the drive, surged and got up late. SAL'S BLUE
JACKET set the pace, veered in a bit at the gap, led to deep stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. PRIYANKA was checked early, raced mid pack
near the inside, angled out on the turn, closed well and got up for show. A NEW PEACE was unhurried early and trailed the field, angled out in the upper
stretch and found her best stride late. STERN CHASER pressed the pace, bid willingly, hung late and lost position. IN A SPIN was slow early, saved
ground, bid along the rail on the turn to get within range and came up empty late. INANNA'S QUEST was in tight early, raced close to the pace towards the
outside, bid five wide and flattened out. MISS DELICIOUS was outrun in an even effort.
