Footnotes
TZEDAKAH sped top the lead at the start, led the way around the turn, widened advantage in upper stretch and kept to task under steady urging. BIG
SWAG raced up close from the onset, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid for the winner and finished second best.
MAVERAMA lagged briefly in the back after the start, then quickly picked up the pace along the inside, angled out near the quarter pole, ran on three wide
through the lane and secured a share. TIME TO FLY was forwardly placed along the inside, sustained bid around the turn, cut the corner entering upper
stretch and steadily weakened. HEY raced in range three wide around the turn, stayed three to four wide and ran on evenly through the lane. KING OF
SWING raced in the back throughout. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

THAT'S OUR VISION was allowed to settle through early stages and save ground, edged up closer late on the far turn, hustled along three wide into upper
stretch, poked a head in front a furlong out then widened advantage and kept clear. C'MON LUCKY stalked the pace around the first turn and up the
backstretch, came under right handed pressure three wide near the quarter pole, swung four paths wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and
secured place. BIZ B QUICK was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried up the backstretch, picked up the pace three to four wide near
the quarter pole, came five paths wide into upper stretch, stayed on with response and cleared show. SIMMERING pressed the pace around the first turn
and up the backstretch, vied with GISELE'S MAP around the final turn, fought back into upper stretch then gave way past the furlong marker. GISELE'S
MAP set a pressured pace around the first turn, continued with a slight edge up the backstretch, dueled with SIMMERING around the final turn then came
up empty in the final furlong. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

ALLO ENRY sped to the lead at the start then quickly came under pressure from DILLON ROCKS, vied for the lead up the backstretch and into the turn,
shook free approaching the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane, responded willingly when called upon and pulled away. DISCREET INVASION rated
off the early pace, hustled up three wide late on the turn, angled in a couple paths past upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best.
DILLON ROCKS vied for the lead with the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match strides approaching the quarter pole, ran on into upper
stretch, flattened mid-stretch and stayed on for show. HULEN hopped and came away slowly at the start, quickly advanced into contention, raced three wide
in aim at the quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. ONCE UPON A DREAM settled and saved ground through early stages, urged for response
mid-way around the turn, angled out entering upper stretch and failed to kick on. HEZA WILD RIDE raced in range in the opening quarter, flattened a bit and
ran one paced under a ride around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

KANJENG sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, held clear around the turn, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch, widened advantage
and kept clear under steady encouragement. DIXIE SURPRISE raced in range through the early going, saved ground along the rail around the turn, tipped
two wide for the drive, sustained a solid bid and finished clearly second best. NO RHYME OR REASON raced in early contention, chased three wide around
the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong and held show. GOTTA LOVE LIFE raced off the early pace, was ridden two to
three wide around the turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch and needed more for impact. ENCHANTED ANGEL raced off the pace, saved ground
and improved position without threatening. CRIMSON TAPESTRY chased the pace along the inside and had no late response. STROLL WITH CLASS
raced just off the leader in opening stages, stayed on around the turn then tired in the drive. SATADANITE SPECIAL raced in the back and had no
response. THE SECOND FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

DIAMOND OF EKATI took the lead leaving the half mile marker, held firm around the turn, hustled along the inside turning for home, widened advantage
and kept clear. GLAMOROUS LIFE raced near midpack, edged closer late on the turn, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, sustained
response and got up late for place. TAP ME A TEXT led the way to the half mile marker then edged back and angled off the rail, launched a two wide rebid
late on the turn, ran on through the lane and cleared the rest. BREW CASA was not too far back saving ground then flattened around the turn, tipped two
wide for the drive and improved position without threatening. EUROWENDI raced in the back, hustled along two wide around the turn and never threatened.
MUSTANGMAGNA was forwardly placed up the backstretch, ran on three wide in close range around the turn then faded in the lane. BLOW SUM SMOKE
raced off the early pace, urged four wide around the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CASEYS MEMORY was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, engaged COMMANDER REX for the lead entering
the far turn, shook free leaving the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane, widened advantage, tapped once left handed in the final furlong then finished
wrapped up. COMMANDER REX led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with CASEYS MEMORY around the
final turn, could not match strides past the furlong marker but ran on and secured place. JUSTICE ONCE tracked the early pace along the inside, hustled
along two wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and cleared the rest. THREE FOR THREE raced in the second flight up the backstretch, was ridden two
wide around the far turn and failed to move on. WARRIOR'S RUN was reserved racing in the back, was ridden along the inside around the far turn, angled
out upper stretch and failed to make an impact. PIZZA CHARLIE raced off the early pace, came three to four wide into upper stretch and steadily faded.

Footnotes
SKYLAR'S FIRE vied inside of MY FOUR POINT OH up the backstretch and battled around the turn, shook free entering top stretch and kept clear. MY
FOUR POINT OH vied outside of SKYLAR'S FIRE in opening stages and continued to battle around the turn, could not match strides with rival at the head
of the lane, but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. HOODWICKED raced up close four wide through the backstretch, loomed three
wide at the quarter pole, ran on into upper stretch, then weakened off the top pair and just lasted for show. R N B BABY raced near midpack, was ridden
three wide around the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and just missed show. PISTOLPACKINGAL raced off the second flight mid-way up the
backstretch, came under a ride four wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. ASHLEIGH' BACK raced up close in the opening quarter, weakened
around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. SKIPER STROLL raced in range along the inside, chased along the rail through the turn then faded in the
lane. SHADOW BANNED got pinched back and steadied at the start, dropped back, continued near the rear and failed to move into contention. ZOE
NATION lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground and steadily retreated.
