Footnotes
JOLLY BOSS , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was under brisk urging in mid stretch and eagerly pulled away. CORRECTED
PEDIGREE remained along the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. NO CENTS NON CENTS bumped
SIMON'S CHOICE when bearing in a the break, prompted the pace outside the winner around the turn, raced on his left lead in the stretch and weakened.
BERMUDA RUN lacked speed, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch, angled in near the eighth pole and rallied inside rivals. BOX OF ROCKETS
, three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive and drifted out late. LADDIE DANCE , a forward factor in the two path around the turn,
weakened through the lance. SIMON'S CHOICE , bumped leaving the starting gate, came into the stretch in the three path and failed to be a factor. TAJI
MIKE , steadied on a rival's heels near the five eighths pole, circled the turn three wide and gave way. SAIL ON HOME stayed along the inner rail around
the turn and was outrun. LEGEND'S THUNDER broke very sluggishly and trailed.

Footnotes
TUBTIMSIAM , nudged to the front, set the pace under a light hold towards the inner rail while being shadowed by ENTRUST, was coaxed clear of the that
one leaving the far turn, turned away an outer threat entering the stretch while guided three wide, responded to strong handling and steadily pulled away.
LAW OF THE JUNGLE , urged up to contention then dropped near the seven eighths and stalked, held a forward spot inside of rivals leaving the five
sixteenths, came out past mid stretch and finished up willingly to just nab the place. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD settled off the pace and off the inside,
gained four wide under a ride past the five sixteenths then loomed into the lane, drifted in with pursuit in mid stretch then flattened out. EDGE OF GLORY a
bit unruly pre race, stalked three wide, moved closer under a ride near the five sixteenths, chased between runners soon after, failed to punch on past the
three sixteenths and faded. ENTRUST prompted the pace outside the winner, was under pressure into the far turn, gave futile pursuit between runners
leaving the five sixteenths then weakened. OROCOVIX was rated back from between rivals into the first turn, dropped in, failed to respond leaving the far
turn and faded.

Footnotes
MAGICALLY VANISHED tracked patiently while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn and responded when given her cue, rolled up alongside the
leader near the five sixteenths then spurted away into the lane, opened up under strong handling leaving the three sixteenths, eagerly increased her
advantage through the final furlong and was kept alert to very late. ITALIAN WAR CRY bobbled outward at the break, corrected and moved up outside rivals
into the first turn to take command, dropped in towards the rail and set the pace under some rating, failed to contain the winner leaving the three sixteenths
but stayed on with some effort to be well clear of the rest. BATTLE TESTED was steadied nearing the backstretch, regrouped and edged up between rivals,
stalked three wide into the far turn, gave chase from the five sixteenths then faded. MINIME stumbled at the break, recovered and saved ground, remained
in range to the far turn then began a retreat. EXTRA DIRTY , three wide stalking the early pace, failed to go on under a ride leaving the far turn, faltered and
was eased in the final furlong. URBAN DANCER , off the pace while saving ground, faltered nearing the lane and was eased through the last eighth.

THE LAST SCIP stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, rallied outside foes, drifted out in the drive and got up at the finish. MAJESTIC EAGLE ,
three wide entering the first turn, moved to the inner rail when going clear into the backstretch, remained along the rail and dug in stubbornly. THE KING
CHEEK stalked the pace while saving ground, eased out to the two path for the drive, closed between the top pair and just missed. CANNON'S ROAR
bobbled entering the first turn, saved ground the far turn, swung to the four path in mid stretch and was gainiing late. U S CONSTITUTION , well placed
down the backstretch, raced in the two path leaving the far turn and came up empty. PRINCE KHOZAN , no factor, stayed along the inner rail on the far
turn. MINT GAME , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the far turn. EYE ON THE CANDY , steadied entering the first turn, lost ground on both turns and
was no factor. TOP BOSS chased the pace to the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
FASTER GATOR was nudged from the gate and took over towards the inside, handled outside pressure while nicely rated mid turn, was coaxed clear into
the stretch while about two wide, opened up under solid handling in mid stretch then held firm while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. TOJO'S
MOJO , three wide early, steadied briefly into the turn, regrouped and angled five to six wide making a run into the lane, straightened away and moved up
outside rivals, had his rider lose whip near mid stretch, drifted in while clear and finished up well. LIAM'S THE GREAT , three to four wide with pursuit,
gained under a ride mid turn, shifted out soon into the lane, chased between runners in mid stretch and kept on with effort. STORMY FLIGHT rated between
rivals early, dropped in around the turn, edged up to the inside of rivals in mid stretch then flattened out very late. UP IN FLAMES forced the pace outside
the winner, shifted four wide with chase into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. CURAHEE tracked under rating while saving ground, tipped
out three wide with a run into the stretch, pursued past mid stretch then faded. STREET HOCKEY broke slowly, regrouped and ranged up five wide outside
rivals mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch after shifting in and gave way. RESPUNZEL dwelt at the break, moved up a bit into the turn, chased and
gave way. WHENEVERUREMEMBER bobbled at the break, was urged up between runners early, angled in and faded.

LIFELOVENLAUGHTER stalked the duel down the backstretch while along the inner rail, advanced in the two path to take command leaving the far turn,
was well off the rail in the stretch and lasted. CHELICHNA saved ground around the first turn, moved up in the three path between horses leaving the far
turn and rallied outside the winner. NAVAL EMPIRE far off the lead down the backstretch, followed the winner in the two path around the far turn, was taken
to the inner rail in upper stretch and flattened out. DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT lacked speed, hugged the inner rail turning for home, angled out in mid stretch
and gained late. NEXT GIRL , kept outside horses, floated five deep mid way on the far turn and lacked a rally. ATLAS STRONG stalked the pace down the
backstretch, raced in the four path on the far turn and faltered. ESPERANNNA , sent to the early lead, disputed the pace along the inner rail and faltered
entering the stretch and was eased. SULTRY SALLY H , sent into contention leaving the starting gate, dueled outside ESPERANNA, faltered and was
eased.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS saved ground within range into the turn, dropped back a bit while under a ride past the five sixteenths, eased out picking up
some steam in upper stretch, dropped back towards the rail for the final furlong, closed relentlessly under strong handling and just got up. BUCKIN' GREAT
outside a rival early on, was guided inward and edged up nearing the lane, shifted back out to gain leaving the three sixteenths, was floated out a bit when
engaging the drifting leader near the sixteenth pole, gained a slim advantage in deep stretch, kept on gamely but was nipped at the wire. SUSAN'S MULE
sped clear early and set a sharp pace under some coaxing, maintained a clear advantage two wide into the lane, wandered outward when joined by
BUCKIN' GREAT near the sixteenth pole, battled on between foes late then gave way grudgingly. GO SHERRY GO showed speed then chased the leader
two wide, was carried out some by BUCKIN'S GREAT when that one worked outward in upper stretch, straightened to pursue through the final furlong and
continued on with effort. FIRSTLADY ROSALYNN , off the pace and off the inside, angled in making some progress in upper stretch but failed to seriously
sustain through the last eighth. UNION SUIT broke a bit outward, corrected and stalked three wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, gave way
leaving the three sixteenths and drifted a bit. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out nearing the lane but came up
empty.
