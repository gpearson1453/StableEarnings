Footnotes
ALTRUIST broke best and went to the front, joined in short order by LAST BABY, those two went well clear of the rest through the first quarter mile, worked
from the two to the four path down the backstretch, put the rival away approaching the quarter pole and finished well under steady handling and intermittent
urging to win clear. MR. FIGHTER was outrun from the break and dropped back to last in the compact field before the turn, started a sustained run from the
half-mile pole, saved all the ground through the turn, angled out sharply near the furlong marker causing CHELSIESDANZIGLITE to have to check, was no
match for the winner but gained the place. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke well but was not quick enough to contest the early lead, worked over to the inside
down the backstretch and was having to be ridden some to keep close, saved a little ground through the turn then tipped out a path to set up a rally but had
to check when MR FIGHTER took the path before the eighth pole, lost some momentum but carried on to hold third. RUNNIN UTE threw his head up at the
start, spotting the field a head start then took the better part of a half-furlong to get into rhythm, advanced into contention through the turn then bid four wide
turning for home, could not sustain the bid and was outfinished down the stretch. LAST BABY was sent hard from the break to get forward position and
dueled through the initial stages with ALTRUIST, gave way before the quarter pole and had nothing left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
POLE TO POLE broke a step slowly leaving the start, showed good speed in the early going and assumed command heading to the half-mile marker, set
decent fractions while clear into the turn, was well handled along the bend and set the pace while off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, raced greenly into
the stretch but was able to kick clear at the furlong marker, continued to show greenness into the final sixteenth but drew away in deep stretch to prevail in a
good debut. NEPHELE broke alertly, assumed early command then ceded the front to POLE TO POLE, stalked that rival through decent fractions heading
into the turn, was guided three wide nearing the quarter marker and ran in pursuit of POLE TO POLE into the stretch, could not make headway on the
winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. PROWLING CAT stumbled at the start, recovered and chased the decent early pace from between
rivals, ran in pursuit four wide into the turn, could not keep pace with the top pair into the stretch and was clear at the finish for third. BIG CROWD chased
the decent early pace from the outside, advanced five wide into the turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

path entering the turn, took command into upper stretch, shook free at the furlong marker, drew away into the final sixteenth and was hand ridden to the
finish to prevail as much the best. TOM'S TREASURE showed good speed away from the start, contested the moderate early pace from the outside,

lost ground into upper stretch and chased to the furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for
third. PRINCESS LUC chased the moderate early pace, was guided three wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, was outrun into the

Footnotes
EL MAGA broke a half-step slowly, was hustled in the early going and engaged with NIJINSKY HALO to dispute a decent pace heading to the half-mile
marker, dueled outside of NIJINSKY HALO into the turn and took a slim lead at the quarter marker, battled on even terms into the stretch, wore down the
game runner-up into the final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch for a determined win. NIJINSKY HALO broke alertly and assumed early command,
was engaged by EL MAGA soon after the break and disputed a decent pace with that rival heading into the turn, dueled through moderate fractions along
the turn, battled with EL MAGA into the stretch and raced on even terms nearing the furlong marker, fought gamely to the final sixteenth, was bested in deep
stretch and was well clear of the rest for second. THIRSTY VISION took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and chased the
leading pair nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, could not impact the leading pair in deep stretch but closed into the final
sixteenth and was a clear third. JEFFREY ON THE RUN lacked early speed, ran in pursuit of the leading pair two to three wide nearing the quarter marker
and could not muster a response in the stretch drive. JAZZY BULL HORN unhurried in the early stages, was guided widest into the turn and raced three to
four wide nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and did not factor. CALIFORNIA DREAMIN was allowed to settle, saved ground
into the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
BIG DON'S SMILING hustled away from the start, assumed early command then was well rated while contesting the pace inside of a pair of rivals, disputed
the moderate pace from the inside entering the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, battled into the stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong
marker, dug in while under pressure into the final sixteenth, was fully extended into deep stretch and determinedly lasted for the win at the wire. IMPLICITLY
allowed to settle while never far back in the early stages, was guided two to three wide along the turn and was well placed approaching the quarter pole,
swung widest into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed fast into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and just missed for the win,
while besting the rest. THUNDER OF ZION prominent away from the start, contested the moderate early pace from between rivals, disputed the pace from
the two path and between runners into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took a narrow lead into upper stretch and battled BIG DON'S
SMILING approaching the furlong marker, fought gamely into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and held safely at the wire for third. JERRY
JEFF WALKER broke alertly and assumed early command, ceded the lead and pressed the leading pair from the outside heading to the half-mile marker,
disputed the pace three wide into the turn and vied for the lead while between runners nearing the quarter marker, battled into the stretch, could not match
strides with the leaders into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for third. AMANOFMYSTATURE threw his head at the start
and was off slowly, trailed in the early going and saved ground into the turn, maintained a ground saving path into the stretch and advanced at the furlong
marker, could not sustain that run into deep stretch and finished evenly. CONTINENTAL UNION raced forwardly leaving the start, took back to track the
moderate early pace from the outside, chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, gave way into the stretch and could not muster a late response.
REFI NOW bobbled at the start then was squeezed by neighboring rivals and was away slowly, rushed up in the early going and raced close up to the
moderate early pace, chased four wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter marker, lost ground at mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final
sixteenth and faded.

Footnotes
FANTASTIC DREAM was content to track the dueling leaders from three to four lengths behind while holding an inside path through the early stages, lost
some position on the turn but found renewed energy when put into a stiff drive past the three furlong marker, got a dream run into the stretch, gained the
lead by mid-stretch, drifted out a bit but pulled clear in the late stages and won driving to the wire. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY reserved near the back of the
trailing group and remained there to the far turn, started to advance from the seven-sixteenths pole, came about three wide into the stretch then squeezed
through a very narrow seam between horses just past the three-sixteenths marker, finished willingly under a stiff hand ride and gained the place in the final
yards. OH GREAT (IRE) dueled to the outside of PRECENDENT LUKE from the first turn, went on when that one tired before the quarter pole, took a short
lead into the stretch while racing in the four to five path, kept on under left handed urging and saved the third placing. STAY LIT broke in at the start and
bumped mutually with DANZ TILL TEN, tracked three wide in the middle of the tracking group, moved to the head of that group down the backstretch, came
under a ride from the seven-sixteenth pole, finished willingly but could not crack the top three. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY broke out at the start and
bumped lightly with FANTASTIC DREAM, lacked early speed but stayed to the inside throughout and saved all the ground, had a brief burst of speed at the
top of the stretch but could not sustain the bid and was outkicked to the finish. RULER OF ANGELS settled close up in the tracking group, raced between
horses in the three path down the backstretch, was the first to break free of the tracking group and went to challenge the pacesetters near the
five-sixteenths pole, had every chance at the top of the stretch but weakened and was outkicked in the final furlong. BIG DIFFERENCE raced in the five or
six path through the first turn, continued wide down the backstretch, tried to launch a bid just before the three furlong marker, could not make any
improvement through the turn, kept to task, finished one-paced and managed to pass a few in the stretch. WILD WAGER was outrun from the break, raced
some distance behind the tracking group with only DANZ TILL TEN behind for the first half-mile, was put into a drive before the three furlong pole but
finished one-paced and was outrun in the stretch. DANZ TILL TEN broke a step slow, went about five paths wide through the first turn, then was far behind
as the field headed down the backstretch, continued to trail well behind the field yet raced out in the middle of the track, came into the stretch in the eight
path and struggled home in the middle of the track. PRECEDENT LUKE broke well and got inside position and vied for the early lead with OH GREAT (IRE),
went together setting reasonable fractions through the early stages, then tried to quicken away passing the half-mile pole but was outkicked by that rival,
began to tire passing the quarter pole then took up sharply just before the furlong marker and lost all momentum. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DETERMINED THAT NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH WAS WARRANTED.
