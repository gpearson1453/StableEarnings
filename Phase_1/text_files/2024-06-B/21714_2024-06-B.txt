Footnotes
SHELL FIRE unhurried for five and one half furlongs, responded readily when set down through the far turn, circled his field six wide under right then left
handed urging, was well handled while lugging in a bit through the final furlong and got up in time. OPEN OUT forwardly placed inside, rallied two wide into
the stretch and gained second. VENETIAN DREAM pressed the early pace three wide, made the lead two wide after a half, set the pace until deep stretch
while drifting four wide and was outfinished. IT'S FATE trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late seven wide. UNIDENTIFIED MAN threw
his head at the start, rushed to contention, was in tight between rivals near the five eighths pole, remained a sharp threat into the stretch while five wide and
faded late. KLAATU set the early pace, gave up the advantage after a quarter, came on again nearing the furlong marker then weakened late. JACK'S
ADVANTAGE had speed from the start along then rail, made the lead before a half, set the pace into the far turn, kept on into the stretch then was used up.

Footnotes
ANIMO ROBERTO unhurried early, circled his field five wide under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. NO MAS CERVEZA always within
striking distance, rallied along the rail through the stretch to make the lead near the sixteenth pole then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner LITTLE
RONS ROCKET broke sharply, set a pressured pace until deep stretch and was outfinished. ORVILLE B vied for the lead five then four wide and went
evenly. DANES HEART pressed the pace three wide into the stretch and weakened late. ONE STEP ASIDE was no factor. ORLEANS STORM had good
early speed along the inside and was through after a half. RIVERS OF DENIRO was never close, lost contact with his field on the turn and was eased to the
wire.
