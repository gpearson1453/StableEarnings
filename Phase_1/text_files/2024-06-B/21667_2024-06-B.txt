Footnotes
MISS HOLLY was off a step slow, trailed inside early, angled three wide to advance between foes near the five-sixteenths marker, split rivals five wide near
the quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch and drew off while lugging in through the lane. ELYANNA hit the starting gate, sped to the front, set the
pace in the two path to upper stretch and was clearly second best in the lane. BEAUTY TO BEHOLD stalked the pace two and three wide, bid near the
quarter pole but was unable to match strides in upper stretch and just lasted for the show. TAKE YOUR POINT raced off the pace four and five wide, made
progress outside of the winner around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out. DANNEEL chased the pace inside and weakened
in the lane. FUTURE FORTUNE raced in range four wide around the first turn, lugged in and dropped back down the backstretch, saved ground around the
far turn and was no threat in the lane. LADIDA saved ground and failed to menace. I LOVE IRELAND played no factor while racing two and three wide.
CITRUS BELLE chased the pace three and four wide and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
YES I'M A BEAST showed the way in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path midway around the turn, opened slightly approaching the
quarter, and drifted out to the seven path in upper stretch while continuing to draw clear. DOUBLE PLAY KING chased in the five path, came under right
handed urging in the four path midway around the turn, and chased on from the six path in the stretch for place. ALL ABOUT LUCKY broke on top and
prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed between foes from the three path passing the three-eighths pole, but flattened down the lane for show.
SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE tracked in the six path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. LUNAR ROCKET threw his head
and hopped awkwardly as the gates opened, dwelt, then was pulled up leaving the gate, and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THER
STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO DETERMINE IF LUNAR ROCKET HAD A FAIR START.

MY SWEETHEART DANI stalked the pace three wide, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and held safe late. BLACK AND SILVER saved ground off the
pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied outside and just missed. VANISHING WISH set the pace in the
two path and yielded near the sixteenth pole. MRS. CASH MAN saved ground in range, angled three wide in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip
nearing the eighth pole, continued on the left lead and flattened out. I LOVE VENEZUELA chased the pace in the two path, angled to the rail in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. NOMOREBILLLS trailed in the three path.

LOVE HER LOTS rated in the three path, came under rousing inside of foes going into the far turn, kicked on to bid from the two path at the top of the lane,
and inched ahead of the outer pacesetter in the final strides. SILVRETTA (GB) got rank rounding the first turn to set an open pace in the two path entering
the backstretch, came under a drive approaching the quarter, floated out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and dug in, but was edged out in the final
strides by an inner foe to place. TYPEY tracked in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the far turn, got carried out to the six path at the top of
the lane, and kept on for show. ON THE NILE chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, but flattened from the six path in the
stretch. C. S. VIVACE was held up along the inside around the first turn, trailed in the three path down the backstretch, and did not factor. CLEOPATRA'S
NILE bobbled at the start, raced off the pace in the five path but never threatened. MAMA MARIA stalked in the three path but faded between foes around
the far turn.

R AWESOME SAUCE tracked in the two path, was nudged along while looking for room rounding the far turn, angled out to the five path to bid between
foes at the top of the lane, drew past an outer foe around the sixteenth, and held firm. FUNTASTICA had a slow start, laid off the pace in the five path,
ranged up to bid midway around the far turn, swept to the lead from the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on, but was caught by an inner foe around
the sixteenth to place. ANONYMOUS SOURCE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was unhurried in the three path early, cued while angling out to the
five path entering the far turn, fanned out to eight path at the top of the lane, and chased on for show. PALACE ZIP got caught five wide rounding the first
turn, rated in the four path down the backstretch, bid under rousing midway around the far turn, but flattened between foes passing the eighth pole.
NIGHTSABER (GB) set the pace along the inside, came under a ride when challenged by an outer trio midway around the far turn, but faded down the lane.
QUEEN AIKO stalked in the three path but backed up around the far turn. SHINKA bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the two path
but weakened entering the stretch.

DOWNING STREET was off a bit slow, trailed inside around the first turn, moved up three wide around the far turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole,
surged outside and drew off late. NEVER SAY NEVER set the pace in the three path around the first turn and in the two path around the far turn, led past
the eighth and held for the place. ATOMICO saved ground in midpack, ran on inside and just missed second. GAMBLIN GEORGE was bumped at the start,
raced off the early pace inside, angled out to make a middle move down the backstretch, pressed the pace in the three path around the far turn and
weakened in the final furlong. PARAKEET (IRE) broke out and bumped GAMBLIN GEORGE at the start, had speed in the two path, settled back when
NEVER SAY NEVER was intent on the lead around the first turn, chased the pace three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. FLAT CAP was
outrun while racing three and four wide and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNCLE ARMANDO chased in the four path, was driven into the far turn, tipped inwards to the three path turning into the lane, bid between while brushing
an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and drew clear in the closing stages. FORWARDLY raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, got
bumped out to the six path turning into the stretch, and rallied for place. TIZ A PRINCE set the pace inside, was roused early around the far turn, dug in from
the two path in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer duo in the final sixteenth to show. MOMZA stalked in the five path, bid under coaxing from the
three path passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, brushed with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly.
COACH ABERNATHY trailed in the two path early, was driven around the far turn, drifted out to the four path bumping an outer foe turning into the lane, and
made no impact. AMERICAN PURE was prompted from in range in the three path, angled to the rail around the three-eighths point, but flattened in the final
furlong. BURNING MAN raced wellback in the five path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and did not factor. PLUMA ROJA laid up close in
the four path, but got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe turning into the stretch, and was eased. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR tracked in the two path,
but had to check along the rail around the three-eighths mark, and yielded.

Footnotes
EL PRINCIPITO stalked the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and dug in between foes to
prevail. ETENDRE raced in range inside early, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch but was kept at bay.
ONE SHARP COOKIE pressed the pace two wide, led between foes around much of the turn, vied inside of the winner past the eighth pole and weakened
late. FAR FROM A STAR set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. RAGING FURY hit the starting gate and was away well last, raced four and five
wide and never threatened. KING FALIERO played no factor while racing three wide. CAJUN FOOL was outrun inside.

Footnotes
REVOLU broke well to prompt the early pace from the two path, was roused approaching the quarter, bid while being bumped out to the seven path at the
top of the lane, took command passing the eighth pole, and held sway. SPIRIT OF VICTORY tracked in the two path, was coaxed from the three path
midway around the turn, but got carried out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. COOL TRICKS trailed in the four path, was
coaxed along rounding the turn, and kept on from the five path down the lane for show. AIR FORCE BABE was hustled from the gate to lead in the three
path before tipping to the rail entering the turn, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, but drifted out to the five path and bumped the outer
eventual winner turning into the stretch, and faded in the final furlong. MOONLIGHT VISION had an awkward start, chased in the three path, was ridden in
the four path around the turn, but got floated out to the nine path turning into the lane, and flattened. LADY LYLA raced off the pace along the inside but
never menaced from the three path in the stretch.
