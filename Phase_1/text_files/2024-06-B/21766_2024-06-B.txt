Footnotes
THUNDERSLAM stalked from the three path then challenged into the backstretch, dueled to even terms three wide midway on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to hold off SENSUAL CHOCOLATE, who stalked the early pace two deep and challenged between horses into the backstretch, dueled to even
terms leaving the quarter pole but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. TIZAWINNER settled off the rail the first turn, eased out and gave chase
into the backstretch, raced in the five path on the far turn and finished evenly while improving his position. BRAVE SAND RIDER rated the pace inside,
came under pressure leaving the first turn and was met at the rail past the quarter pole, remained a factor into the stretch but flattened the final sixteenth.
DOWSING ROD rated close inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. SUPER
BUSTER was reluctant to load then settled in the four path on the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase, but to no avail.

SOCIAL CHIC rated close off the rail the opening turn, started his bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms three wide midway on the
far turn, dug in determinedly leaving the turn and took the nod in the final strides. DONTMESAWITHME stalked two deep then challenged at the seven
sixteenths pole and took the nod past the three eighths, was met at even terms nearest the rail midway on the far turn, dug in gamely under steady handling
leaving the turn but grudgingly ceded in the final strides. MUAD'DIB saved ground into the opening turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and
raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and finished well to take third later yards. O'CONNER SUNSET stalked from the three path,
bid leaving the three eighths pole and challenged at the five sixteenths, raced at even terms two deep while between horses midway on the far turn but
started to flatten stride nearing mid-stretch. CURLIN'S MALIBU settled in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY rated a short lead inside, came under
pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the three eighths, dropped back at the rail leaving the five sixteenths and faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
LUCYLOU WHO quickly took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, pulled away at the rail on the far turn and was geared down in the lane.
CHANGE THE WORLD saved ground, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second best. SENECA
ROCKS settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the
lane. AZZURRA settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch but flattened in the five path on the far turn. SOMEDAY IS
TODAY became anxious in the gate and raced in the four path the first turn, raced toward the outside entering the backstretch and showed little response.
BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD raced in the six path the first turn, left the turn outside and was not a factor. BOUNDTOBEOK stalked off the rail the first turn,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
DENIZETTI steadied between horses into the first turn then stalked off the rail, dueled to the lead approaching the three eighths pole, drew off at the rail on
the far turn and was kept sharp in the stretch. COLONIAL ROAD raced well back off the rail the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, squeezed
through at the rail entering the stretch and settled for second best. I'MLIVINGTHEDREAM became a bit edgy in the gate then steadied at the start, rounded
the first turn in the four path and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and was along to take third
mid-stretch. HERE'STHEBREADMAN rated close inside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn and
showed little in the lane. CEDAR RUNS FIBER took the lead nearing the three quarter pole then angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met toward the three eighths and faded at the rail on the far turn. YAREAKH settled in the three path the first turn,
gave chase passing the half mile pole but gave way into the far turn. MALEKES MAGIC stalked three wide the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened. FAPPIANO HALO raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and
showed little response. GOGO GADGET became fractious in the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path then faded readily through the backstretch.
