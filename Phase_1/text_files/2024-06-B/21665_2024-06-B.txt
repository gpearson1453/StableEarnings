AMONG THE ROSES settled off the pace, closed the gap on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up in time. TACHYON SPEED
was in range and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. KNOTTY AND NICE was up close and dueled on
the turn but weakened in mid stretch. AMI'S GIRL was in touch and a factor from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
failed to fire. SHES HOT TO TROT was hustled early but chased on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SEEDS OF GRANDEUR was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch drew clear. EYE GOT IT GOOD set
a pressured pace and had the lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. STOLE THE RING was in mid pack and
had a bid on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. DOODLE DANDY was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and
passed tired foes through the stretch. SPRING HIGH forced the early pace and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. SILENT BUT VIOLENT was in range but chased on the far turn and was not a factor. PERFECT PROVISION was up close but lost ground on
the far turn, eased through the stretch and walked off.

A GAL FOR T J was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. REMEMBEROLDTYMES forced
the early pace, dueled on the turn and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner. PACENZA was in mid
pack, roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. LOUEMMA was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. KATCHY NAME was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but faded. FRESH DREAMS had no
speed and showed little in a dull effort. EASY ACCESS was up close early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
GAMBLER'S POSE was in mid pack, roused from the inside on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
TANGERINE TWIST set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but with the lead in mid stretch was outgunned. ALWAYS MY FAULT was unhurried
early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. SUGAR DROP was in touch and saved ground on the
turn but had no late kick. ROYAL CHROME tracked the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no
real threat. WAR VOW had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch lacked a rally. THIRSTY DATE was
off the pace and showed little while outrun. LOTS OF LEGACIES was up close early but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
was empty.

GRAND AMBITION showed speed from the outside, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BAJAN
BULLET was in mid pack, had a good position on the turn and was up for place. I LIVE BY FAITH stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. WILBERFORCE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE
settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but was not a factor. JUSTIN'S WAY was in range and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top
of the stretch had no response. SANTIAGO SALSA was well back, showed little and from the four path at the top of the stretch was never a threat. MAD
MOCHA was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but failed to fire.

PRINCESS ALESKA set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. TURF AND SURF was in mid
pack, raced evenly from the inside on the far turn and was second best in a good effort. LULU'S LULLABY stalked the early leader from the inside and was
a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. MENAGERIE was off the pace, moved up from the inside on the far turn
and finished well. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no real
threat. LOADED SECRET was in range and had a good position on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch weakened. SPEEDY JOHNY
was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact. T'PRING was in touch early but lost
ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
CANT BEAT THE KATZ set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. FOREST B forced the
pace and dueled on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. J M R GEMMA was in mid pack and moved up on the turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. LOADED QUESTION was in range and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch had no response. SHEBATOWN was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes.
BELLASPINA was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but was no real threat. GLITTER BAY was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but
failed to fire. SPIRIT BELLE was hustled early but chased on the turn and was not a factor. SILVER CANDICE was in touch, had to check going into the turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact.
