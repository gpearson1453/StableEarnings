MAJESTIC STREET sat in striking range while three wide, moved up to challenge the front leaving the backstretch, gained the lead at the quarter pole, and
held under a late drive. TUCKER TIME unhurried early, drove four wide at the head of the lane, loomed boldly into the stretch but was unable to stall the
winner. ESCROW STYLE trailed the field early, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, and closed late. TRUMP UM contested the early pace outside of
AMUSING WAY, was overtaken in the final turn and flattened out. AMUSING WAY contended the pace from the rail, and faded early.

CHARLIE'S COPY saved ground early inside, shifted out to the three path then swept the lead, and won driving. PASSAGE tracked from the two path,
rallied three wide entering the stretch, and closed with good energy. TENDER LOVE sat just off the pace, lodged a bid between foes in the final turn, and
lacked a kick that was needed. OOPS (GB) lacked early speed, took closer order leaving the backstretch, and failed to menace. WORKIN FOR THE MAN
set the early pace, was overtaken and yielded. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

MIDNIGHT GARDEN trailed the field early, swung out four to five wide into the final turn, closed steadily and prevailed under a drive. BEAUTIFUL BABE
stalked three wide, shifted out to the four path into the far turn, rallied three to four wide at the head of the lane, continued under strong encouragement, and
was outfinished. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY pressed the early pace from the five path, chased the leader into the final turn, rallied through the stretch then
weakened in the final sixteenth. CHATTY GAL set the pace from just off the rail, moved clear approaching the final turn, was showing signs of tiring nearing
the stretch and yielded late stretch. WHISKARITA tracked outside, and lacked a closing response. ENTITLED STAR saved ground and lacked a bid.

IT WORKED unhurried early, dropped back leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly inside in the final turn, shifted out to the three path, and won going
away. COMMON KNOWLEDGE chased the early pacesetters, angled five wide in the final turn, rallied outside while drifting in slightly at the head of the
stretch, but was no match for the winner and inched up for place honours. FAST EH sent for early speed in the three path, held a slim advantage nearing
the stretch and weakened. PERDITION chased from the back of the pack, and lodged a late mild bid. FIRECRACKER STAND pressed the early pace, and
had nothing left in reserve. LIL ZAPPER was outrun.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN hustled inside, held a short advantage entering the far turn, responded gamely to challenge from ISLE OF SKYE, was kept under
handling through the stretch, and held on. BRATTON stalked the pacesetters from the rail, lodged a rail bid then shifted out at the head of the stretch,
closed outside and missed after a good effort. JUMEIRAH COAST chased leaving the backstretch, rallied inside inching up for show. ISLE OF SKYE
pressed the early pace, moved up menacingly outside of BEHIND THE CURTAIN at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner and was edged out for
show. SMARTY RIVER PANTS chased outside and lacked a kick. RUNNINFORCOVER was never involved.

Footnotes
LITTLE CHICAGO reserved well off the pacesetters, gained closer order inside nearing the final turn, was roused at the three sixteenth pole then swept the
lead, was under attack late, dug in under a late drive and held on bravely. GIVE EM HECK BECK settled outside in stride, sat in striking position leaving the
backstretch, fanned four wide at the quarter pole, rallied steadily outside then flattened out deep stretch and just missed. CALI CONQUEST saved ground
inside, was asked to quicken in the final turn, closed steadily outside then hung late. BIG AL'S VISION hurried to the front, showed the way through the
backstretch, was overtaken into the stretch, and wilted. SMART CAT stalked the pacesetter, moved up alongside BIG AL'S VISION to challenge the front
but was unable to move on with the field entering the stretch and gave way. UPO was gapped early, and passed a tiring rival. FORGOTTEN VOWS was
carried out in the opening turn, and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CLASSY ROSE prompted the pace from the three path, gained the lead at the three sixteenth pole, turned back a challenge from SIZZLIN ROSE, and held
firm. SIZZLIN ROSE tracked inside, shifted out to the three path, loomed boldly late stretch but needed more late. SALTY CAT set the pace from the two
path, was overtaken in the final turn and weakened. CHICTIME sat midpack, and rallied belatedly. ANNA'S GIRL offered a late mild bid.
SWEETSINGINGANGEL fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid entering the lane, and retreated in the final sixteenth. CARO'S MAGIC
unhurried early, and bid belatedly. RUN MYA RUN failed to menace. LIGHTERANQUICKER flashed early speed outside, and had nothing left in reserve
late. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL offered little.
