four wide into the turn, five wide out of it and rallied. SHINE MY TIARA Broke slow, close inside, angled out four wide into the lane and finished with interest.
REGENERATOR Vied for the lead along the three path, tracked into the lane and weakened. JOYFUL DEPARTURE Stumbled badly at the start, saved
ground and tired. EDDIES ROCKET Stumbled at the start, close four wide and tired. JOHN'S GEM Three path on the turn, was outrun.
