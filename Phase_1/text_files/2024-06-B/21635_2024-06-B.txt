Footnotes
OUTOFQUEMADO was reserved early, raced five wide though the second turn, made a bid on ARIZONA DAVIN, dueled with that rival to late stretch and
prevailed for the win. ARIZONA DAVIN was unhurried early, raced four wide though the second turn, took a brief lead, met the bid of the winner, dueled to
late stretch and finished second best. BENNY BUCKETS stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the first turn, checked off heels, settled, raced
three wide out of the second turn, angled in mid stretch and flattened out. STREET MINISTER set a clear early pace from off the rail and faded.

TORPEDO AWAY was outrun early, saved ground into the turn, angled out early stretch, was closing steadily, took control late and edged clear. BLAZE OF
DREAMS tracked the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. MR. FIREBALL set a pressured early
pace, raced three wide through the turn, gave way late and finished a game third. REGULATION DAZED was unhurried early, advanced six wide out of the
turn and offered a mild late rally. ALL THE KING'S MEN was allowed to settle early, angled out to the five path out of the turn and never fired. LIL MIRACLE
MAN pressed the early pace from the inside and faded. PISTOL POWER was void of any early speed from the inside and never was a factor. WESTERN

turn, angled out early stretch, then drifted late and offered a mild late rally. ROCKY BAY RAE was unhurried early, raced four wide and finished evenly late.

rivals into the turn, then raced along the inside through the turn and gave way. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN AROUND THE

Footnotes
CANDIED LUTE tracked the early pace, raced four wide through the turn, took control stretch, and drew off as an easy winner. DENNARD was void of any
early speed, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out to the five path out of the turn, was gaining and finished second best. ATOMIC CANDY was
unhurried early, angled out to the five path through the turn and was along for third. GOLDEN COWBOY pressed the early pace, raced three wide into the
turn and gave way. WHOS DALLINS DADDY set a pressured early pace from the inside and tired.
