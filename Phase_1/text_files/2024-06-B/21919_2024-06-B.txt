LOTS OF MISCHIEF chased the pace extending four wide down the lane surging clear in the final yards. OLD FORTY FIVE a step slow early rallied in
upper stretch splitting horses on the inside late. STUNNING HERO set the pace being hooked on the turn digging in down the lane ceding grudgingly late
along the inside. TRADER PRICE drew even on the turn dueling in upper stretch ceding late between horses. BIG WAY chased through the turn weakening
in upper stretch. JOYRIDE slow early raced wide down the lane. ANGELUS DIAMOND pressed early fading along the inside to upper stretch.
COMMISSIONER H gave a mild move on the turn then gave way in upper stretch.
