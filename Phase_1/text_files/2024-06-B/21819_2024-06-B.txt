Footnotes
PLUOT pressed the pace two wide and made a three wide bid off the turn and had a long drive and then dueled for the lead by the sixteenth marker and
prevailed late to prove best under a drive. LORD IT'S CHILLY was taken back early, moved out and advanced on the outside on the backstretch, then
dropped down and advanced two wide on the far turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid to gain a short lead by the furlong marker, but
hung in the final furlong. HE'S FANCY FREE was four wide into the first turn, settled three to four wide and came five wide off the turn and closed well.
SOCIAL JOE was reserved early and ridden along on the inside on the far turn, advanced by the quarter pole and moved out leaving the turn and then
lugged in by the furlong marker and hung. UTILITY was well rated on the inside, cut the corner and then was blocked by the three sixteenths, looked to
move out and steadied by the furlong marker and then angled out and had some kick. TACTICAL HUMOR set the pace on the inside and was headed
nearing the furlong marker and weakened. LUCKY DOUBLE ZERO was four wide into the first turn, reserved three to four wide and had no rally.
SEYMOUR FASTER prompted the pace three wide and tired. TEN AND CHANGE settled early and tired. VOLODYMYR failed to menace.

Footnotes
SIREN set the pace and drew clear on the turn, then widened the margin off the turn and was given a few pops left handed to stay off the rail and then was
wrapped up late to prove much the best to score. SILK PRINCE checked early on the inside first time by the finish line, then settled and advanced on the
inside on the far turn and finished well to gain the place. WORK FROM HOME was rated along early, advanced on the inside on the turn and tipped out
three wide leaving the turn but had no kick, bested rest. LOVE SHAQ was settled back early and saved ground and had a mild late kick. EAST AURORA
was five wide into the first turn, tracked the pace four to three wide and faded. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE was six wide into the first turn, settled on the outside
and had no rally. WOW WHATA PARTY prompted the pace two wide and weakened. SO SMOOTH failed to menace. STARFORCE failed to respond.

margin off the turn and proved much the best under mild crop urging. BONITA LASSIE prompted the pace and made a mild bid three wide on the far turn
but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. CAR LADY was taken back early, came three wide into the lane and had a mild late rally
to best the rest. MIKEY'S JEWEL chased the pace and had no rally. INCONTROVERTIBLE stalked the pace four wide and weakened. HI HEELED

MIGHTY MINION was rated along on the outside early, advanced by the half mile marker and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and shook clear by
the furlong marker and drew away to prove best under a drive. LANGLEE AVENUE stalked the pace three to two wide, then dueled for the lead on the
inside on the far turn and angled off the inside in the furlong grounds and held the place award. MUSKOKA GIANT chased the early pace and then rated
back and was towards the inside on the far turn, angled out by the three sixteenths and finished willingly to just miss the place award. DON'T QUESTION
ME chased the early pace from between rivals, then tracked the leaders three wide on the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. LAPINSKI UNION was
allowed to settle early towards the inside, four wide on the far turn and had no response. EL POLICIA set the pace on the inside and then went bad leaving
the half mile marker and was pulled up, was transported off of the track via the equine ambulance. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WARRIOR BERNICE broke outwardly at the start, dueled for the lead three wide and made a bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then remained
clear by the furlong marker and sixteenth marker then held on late to prove best under a drive. ZIFFY BUG chased the early pace and made a four wide
move on the turn to loom boldly, then hung a bit and then finished well the final sixteenth to just miss. MITI FAST FLOWER dueled for the lead on the inside
and faded in the drive, held the show award. BUILT'IN ABILITY was well placed early, chased the pace on the inside on the turn and then moved out in the
lane and faded while just missing the showa ward. EARLY was bothered at the start, settled on the outside and had no rally. SMILEY JONES was settled on
the inside and tired.
