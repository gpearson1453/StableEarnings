ATLANTIS QUEEN shifted out and rallied into the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under encouragement. PHLYING
PHYLLIS was pushed in at the start, pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn, came again and got up for place while no threat to the winner.
BEAUTIFUL BLOME broke awkwardly, veered out and was off a bit slowly, swung wide leaving the turn, bid willingly and was outnodded for second.
UPTOWN MISS broke in, was taken back from tight quarters early, bid along the rail on the turn and came up empty. LINO AND ME set the pace, drew
away for a clear lead, fell back on the turn and stopped mid stretch. WHY NOT GRACE was never far back, raced outside and lacked a stretch response.
SWEET AND FEISTY broke in, was pinched back and checked after the start, crowded along the rail on the turn and lacked a bid.

duel and drew off to prove best. COURT CONTENDER settled off the pace, saved ground, bid inside to contend, came up empty late and finished second
best. MY HANDSOME MAN lagged early while never far back, put in a steady effort and was along for show while no threat to the top two. SUPER

raced close to the pace off the rail between horses, tired into the second turn and stopped. OMAR COMIN led early, fell back to stalk the pace, tired into the

RETURN FIRE set the pace, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, came out near the gap and held under pressure. RUM TUM TUGGER held a
good position, bid willingly, was pushed out, crowded near the gap and got up late for place. DOMINGUEZ raced mid pack, angled in on the second turn,
bid along the rail, lacked room mid stretch, shifted in at the gap and finished gamely. BOURBON EXPRESS pressed the pace, challenged on the second
turn, dueled for the lead, came out near the gap and was outfinished in a good effort. DOWNPATRICK was unhurried early, saved ground, rallied between
horses on the second turn, went four wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. DARVESH lagged early, raced outside, went five wide entering
the stretch and lacked a bid. HOT ON YOUR HEELS stalked the pace while saving ground, tired on the second turn and stopped. WALKER'S GAP bore out
on the first turn and trailed the field. PER RULING ECM2024-229 FROM HIWU, RETURN FIRE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1ST TO UNPLACED DUE TO

Footnotes
STRUGAR pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn and drew clear under urging. KENNY HAD A NOTION stalked the pace while racing
outside, rallied into the turn to loom a threat, didn't have enough left and earned place while no threat to the winner. INTER MIAMI set a pressured pace to
the turn, fought back when headed, came up empty late and settled for show. SUNSET TOWN showed speed to the turn, fell back and flattened out.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA dropped back quickly to trail, saved ground and passed a tiring rival. WEGOTTAGUY had brief speed only.

MEGACITY set the pace, was under pressure late and held on gamely. AMERICAN UNITY raced close to the pace, advanced on the turn, bid off the rail,
angled in and surged late. WICKED FINN stalked the pace, bid along the rail on the turn, angled out for the drive, closed willingly and was out finished.
CLINT MAROON (GB) lagged early, rallied around the turn, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. SAGRADA RAY was rated back early,
stalked the pace, leveled off in the drive and faded from contention. WHO'S COUNTING raced in the back and improved position in an even effort. SACRED
RIDER saved ground, was through early and was not a threat. ZERO GRAVITY trailed the field. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DANCING BEAUTY set the tempo into the turn, unchallenged around the bend, kicked clear upper and held sway driving. HER LUCKY LOTTO chased the
speed from along the rail, angled out for the stretch run, running on her left lead gained ground through the final sixteenth, unable to catch the winner. DARK
DUTCHESS slow away from the gate, four wide bid around the turn, angled inside for clear running room, and finished willingly to the wire. FLORINE three
wide journey around the bend, loomed a threat nearing the quarter pole, and gave way through the wire. LOU'S IRISH LADY chased the pace from along
the inside, lost momentum when in tight quarters nearing the three eighths pole, unable to recover weakened through the stretch. SMOKIN SISTER broke
sharp, settled off the early pace, chased between around the bend, no threat through the stretch.
