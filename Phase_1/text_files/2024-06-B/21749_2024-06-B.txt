kept on to the finish. VINTAGE VINO two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild bid. STOP THE PRESS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside early on and then just off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide
through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BRITISH SEA hustled from the gate,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ISOMARSHALL coaxed
from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. GARDEN LEAVE

Footnotes
CERTIFIED LOVERBOY was coaxed to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear approaching the
quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off under steady urging into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the
best. STORMING CHROME was hustled from the gate, contested the pace, was asked in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner nearing the
quarter-pole and proved no match but just held the place. PRINCIPE D'ORO bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the
five path on the turn and tired. GUT FEELING dropped back while showing no speed, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. WARRIOR RICHARD
stumbled at the start but broke with the field, dropped well back under urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. TIMAEUS bumped
with a rival at the start, prompted the pace between horses, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths pole, spun five wide
into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
JACKIE THE JOKER chased the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, took the lead outside the
quarter-pole, shook off the runner-up into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. WILLFUL DESIRE moved in while going to the front,
showed the way with a clear advantage, vied inside while challenged on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole, battled with that
foe in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to get the place. BANK ON ANNA was urged from the gate then taken in hand briefly while crowded
between foes then dropped back under more urging, moved from the rail to the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and improved for
the show. FONTANAFREDDA lost her footing some at the start then tossed hear head slightly but broke with the field, steadied when CONDIMENT GIRL
came in some nearing the five-eighths pole then dropped back, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. VIOLENT VIXEN was urged
along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out twice in the stretch and failed to threaten. CONDIMENT GIRL was hustled from the
gate, chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch then
moved out in the drive and came up empty.

Footnotes
DADS GOOD RUNNER broke out at the start bumping SOMAMA BEACH, showed the way in hand just off the inside under prompting from that same rival
to the outside, tucked inside into the turn given a notch more to work with, steadily shook away through the latter portion of the turn and swung three wide
into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive to prevail. MESSI THE MAGICIAN brushed the off side stall at the start under hustling, chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on clear of the rest for
the place honors. BONNE CHANCE broke out a step at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. MUAZARAH coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed four then three wide coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. PICCOLO DIAVOLO broke out at the start, chased five then four wide
under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SOMAMA BEACH got bumped at the start by DADS
GOOD RUNNER, who broke outwards, prompted the pace of that same rival from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn and went three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INSTAMATIC settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, rallied outside to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, shook clear into the final
furlong, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. FINAL DENILE was reserved off the pace, moved in near the
nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good
energy to get the place. HEYMACKIT'SJACK settled off the pace then between horses, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted to the four path at
the quarter-pole while asked then moved to the five path into upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. YOUR MAN ALEX was hustled from the gate,
moved up to race just off the pace then was rated, went two then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed
kick. KREESA settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and improved
position. WAR TERMINATOR settled off the pace then between foes, dropped back with three furlongs to run, went three then four wide on the turn, came
six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. COLLECTED SPECIAL bumped with a foe at the start, moved in while going to the front, set the
pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn and gave way. BRENNAN'S WAR was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up,
angled in at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ALLIED ATTACK pressed
the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader late on the backstretch, shook clear in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost
the advantage inside the three-sixteenths and tired. JIMMYTHETOOTH was urged along at the rear on the outside, went around the turn in the two path,
moved out in the final furlong and was no factor. GOLDEN ARM competed without front shoes, raced just off the pace, dropped back with three furlongs to
run, went three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. KERN RIVER broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged early then
settled off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, went three to four wide early on the turn, dropped to two path then rail late on that bend and failed to
respond. GOLDEN ARM RACED WITH NO FRONT SHOES

outside in upper stretch, closed fast while remaining on her inside lead in the drive, gained the advantage coming to the sixteenth-pole then drew clear
under good handling. VINO ROUGE brushed with a foe at the start, settled on the inside, was urged along on the second turn, moved out in upper stretch,
remained on her inside lead while gaining in the drive and willingly earned the place while no match for the winner. MACANGA brushed with a rival at the
start, dueled on the inside of a foe while along the rail, shook clear with a quarter-mile to run, opened up while shortening stride in upper stretch, led while
tiring significantly coming to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but held the show. AWESOME CZECH went around the first turn in the two path, settled
near the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn, moved off the rail while put to the crop in upper stretch, dropped in inside the furlong marker and
improved position. GALA BRAND bumped hard with a rival at the start, was taken in hand along the rail early, went around the opening bend in the two
path, was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. CHANTILLY ROAD
dueled on the outside in the two path, was urged along on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. CURLIN'S GIRL bumped hard with
an opponent at the start then was hustled, was taken in hand between foes early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the back, was urged along
late on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
YOUR MISSION coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch settling in mid pack,
tucked back to the inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
sixteenth from home and edged clear to the finish. A LISTER coaxed from the start, vied early on with a pair through the first turn from the two path before
shaking away to spurt clear along the inside into the backstretch, drifted slightly out to the two path before heading back inside through the far turn, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and angled four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under growing lone threat from the aforementioned foe and
was caught a sixteenth out, ran on clear for the place honors to the wire. TEMPLE CREED brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside
and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. WAFLR
lunged at the break and then brushed with SWEET TONE, chased just off the inside through the first turn before tipping three to four wide down the
backstretch, tucked back to be just off the inside when placed to coaxing at he three-eighths, tipped three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to
the finish. COUSIN ED took an awkward first step from the gate and then bumped and traded leans with IN MY SHADOW for a stride or two, vied five then
four wide through the first turn before chasing the spurting away leader three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four wide at the
quarter pole before continuing outwards to be six to seven wide straightened away into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ARCO AUGUSTA
coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. NEPTUNE BEACH coaxed from the start, went three then two wide through the first turn before chasing three to four wide down the backstretch,
came under coaxing tucked to the two path at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made no headway. SWEET TONE broke in at the start
brushing the near side stall and then brushed with WAFLR, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs out, angled out six to seven
wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. DANCINGINTHEPARK broke a half a beat slow, went just off the inside through the first turn before chasing
three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the far turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went four wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. HOLDER CLOSE broke out striking the off side stall and then got taken in hand to not make contact with YOUR MISSION,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tucked to the rail and was brushed by IN MY
SHADOW and made no impact. IN MY SHADOW got bumped at the start by COUSIN ED, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted in and brushed with HOLDER CLOSE near the three-sixteenths and tired. JEFFERSONS OCEAN three
wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and proved no factor.
