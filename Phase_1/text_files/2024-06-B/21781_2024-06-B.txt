three path and improved position in the stretch. HIDDEN PROFIT bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to duel from the rail up the

the winner home in the stretch, no match for that rival. RUNAWAY READY raced in the three path around the first bend, settled off the pace on the inside for
the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position in the stretch. SPECIALSORTASTORM raced in the three path
around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, led the field while saving ground around the second turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED WARRIOR pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and kicked clear in the stretch.
CENTRAL PARK led the field on the rail up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend and chased the winner home in the lane. DEFLATER
tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the four path and kept on to the finish. TACTICAL ATTACK hopped
up leaving the gate, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. REEF'S
DESTINY raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and never threatened. MARTINI BLU stalked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. IN THE ARCH raced off the pace on the outside
through the early going, came around the turn in the five path and showed no kick. STORMIN HONGKONG trailed well behind the field throughout, raced in
the two path around the turn and was never a factor.
