Footnotes
SHE'S ALWAYS ROSIE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, bumped with a rival at the start then was coaxed to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch and
held under steady urging. I'M THINKING bumped with rivals at the start, stalked the leader on the outside, was given he cue in the three path on the turn,
came out a bit into upper stretch then straightened away, pursued the winner to the finish and was second best. COST CONTAINMENT settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the top two while outside in the drive and lacked the needed kick but was
clear for the show. SHOP LIFTING bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand off heels early then angled in with five furlongs to run, raced just off
the pace, was asked while saving ground on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response.
BOURBON SERENGETI steadied in tight between foes early, came under urging before the five-eighths pole, moved from the two path to the four path on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MAGGY'S PALACE was well placed down the backstretch, chased while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch,
pursued the leader into the final furlong then made a bid, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. ENFUEGA
was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the lead while inside early on the turn, saved ground through that bend, fought on
well to regain the advantage into the final furlong but was overtaken by the winner while able to get the place. FIVE TO TWO was asked leaving the gate
then taken up while in tight along the rail early, dropped back quickly then moved out, was urged three then four wide on the turn, gained six wide into upper
stretch and willingly earned the show while flattening out. NEWSDLEY was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went three then four wide
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved in around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. FRANNIE LEW pressed the pace
on the outside, took the lead inside the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the two to three path on the turn, fought with the winner under a drive in upper stretch,
lost the advantage into the final furlong and gave way. GEORGE'S VICE pressed the pace down the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the turn,
spun five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
Z DANCER bobbled awkwardly on his first step from the gate coming under coaxing to be forwardly placed tucking over to the two path into the first turn,
attended the leader latched on to the outside patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the three-eighths, took over command inside that station, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and gamely fended them off to inch away in the late stages. SIX FORTYFIVE four then
three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
threatening through the stretch to the finish but was ultimately repelled while running on to secure the place honors. MISSION HILL tracked from just off the
inside and just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge a
furlong out, got rebuffed inside that station and kept on to the finish. WIND DANCER chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on through to the wire. TIZ THE PRINCE got bumped at the start by ALL GOOD HERE, who broke inwards
and then shouldered that foe back in response soon after, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no kick. SORORITY PRANK established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths when under challenge to the outside, yielded the front inside that station and took the inside route into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. ALL GOOD HERE broke out at the start bumping TIZ THE PRINCE, and then got bumped by that rival coming back, chased along
the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no headway. GOD LAUGHS
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired. ME WISE MAGIC chased just off the
inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and made no impact. SAFFREDI struck
the near side stall at the start, then got checked off the heels of Z DANCER and SORORITY PRANK when losing a lane between those foes under the finish
line the first turn, went four then three wide through the first turn before chasing two to three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coaxed
along from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CUPID'S HEART tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up to make a bid in the three path on the turn, battled with the runner-up under a drive in the
stretch and proved best under strong urging. ST. BENEDICTS PREP broke in and bumped with a rival then was hustled to the front, vied inside while
challenged on the turn, fought with the winner under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for
the place. NIKITIS was bumped at the start, raced off the pace under urging, went two then three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, chased
the top two into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. BELLE OF THE BALL was urged along off the pace, dropped to the inside early on
the turn, saved ground through that bend and failed to rally. RISK FREE had her bit adjusted behind the gate, settled at the rear, was urged three wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MY GIRL JAL was ridden along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch, drifted in late and failed to threaten. PITCH CLOCK chased the pace, made a bid in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and capitulated.
