Footnotes
STREET WARRIOR led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane. MACH
TWO pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the bend from the three path and chased the winner home in the stretch, no
match for that rival. MY BOY BOMBER raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane while
never truly threatening. WHODOESITBETTER trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick. BER CHER stalked
the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and faded in the lane. MAKE IT BURN raced off the pace on the
outside through the opening stages, came around the bend in the two path and was never a factor.
