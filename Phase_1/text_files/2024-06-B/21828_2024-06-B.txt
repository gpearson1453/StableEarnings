Footnotes
COME BET broke back, moved up steadily along the inside to press the issue into the turn, dueled while continuing to save ground through the bend, held a
narrow advantage turning into the stretch, slowly edged away in the run to the wire to prove best. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE moved up between horses to show
the way up the backstretch off the inside, dueled outside the winner turn, could not match that one through the stretch, clearly second best. IRA CHAMP last
to leave, continued to lack early early speed, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, not a threat to the top pair. MOJITO went one paced throughout
while racing four wide. MAGNA PUNCH flashed some brief speed inside the runner up a and between horses, fell back. WILLET KINDA NIGHT in the
second flight for three furlongs while three wide, came up empty for the drive. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC BOSS prompted the early leader from the inside, continued to apply pressure past the wire the first time and through the second turn, moved to
the outside onto the backstretch, went after that same rival late on the backstretch, took over and held that one safe through the stretch run. WILD WING
asked to make the advantage out of the gate, set a pressured pace just off the inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner with just over a quarter mile
remaining, but stuck around in stubborn fashion to the end. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ within striking distance early, fell back after a half, had nothing for the
top two thereafter. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
REVEREND AJ took control after the start, set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way into the stretch, dug in when challenged from along the
inside, turned that foe back in a game effort. AWESOME OUTLAW forwardly placed early toward the inside, fell back a bit in the turn, rebid while continuing
along the inside late, denied. MYSTERIOUS TALE pressed the winner in the three path up the backstretch and into the turn, asked along while still off that
one's flank into the stretch, lacked a winning punch late. UPTOWN SOCIAL broke with the field, steadied in tight quarters to be shuffled back exiting the
chute, continued back in failing to rally. ROBERT WHO finished early, trailed home. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BRING IT ON BABY moved up to show the way out of the chute, edged clear in the run through the first turn, continued to hold the advantage up the
backstretch and into the far turn, extended that margin steadily while under steady handling in the drive. GYPSY ROSE in the second flight outside, four
wide into the first turn, chased the winner up the backstretch, remained closest to that one through the final bend, proved no match through the lane, clear of
the others. SING CHARMER SING off a bet slow, trailed for a half, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest, no threat to the top two. INTO CLASSIC in
the second flight while between horses early, had little for the stretch run. MAMASHAVNAHOTFLASH within striking distance while along the inside,
continued in a forward position for a half then staged a steady retreat. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

COIN PURSE broke in but on top, showed the way into the first turn by a wide margin, continued to hold a considerable advantage up the backstretch and
into the far turn, not threatened to the wire while being kept to task. SUGAR COATED chased the winner in vain throughout, no match, remained clear of the
other runner. MS. BUZZINGA a bit reluctant to load, fell back to trail after the start and was never a factor. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction
and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SKY ECHO broke back, continued to race unhurried early, began a winning move four wide midway on the backstretch, took over far turn, clear into the
lane, not threatened to the wire. SPLITSECONDECISION broke back with the winner, settled in the second flight while between horses, rallied down the
stretch to earn the place, no a threat to the winner. SLICK CITY GIRL away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage
after a half, began to weaken soon after when headed by the winner, also proved no match for the runnerup, managed to save the show. CREES
VALENTYME made little impact while saving ground to no avail. YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN broke out a bit, alternated up front off the inside, first to blink
late backstretch, wide into the lane while continuing to tire. FLY FENIX FLY floated out a bit at the break, was straightened to race forwardly and three wide
for a half and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
JUST OKIE broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight inside, asked along far turn when beginning to move closer, challenged between horses a
sixteenth out and finished with good resolve to prove best. LOCK UP YOUR PETS dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed late in
the final turn to be clear into the stretch, could not contain the winner late proved game in preserving the place. OOEY GOOEY CHEWY chased the dueling
leaders off the inside, moved closer late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through the final sixteenth, outfinished for second spot while widest of
the first flight at the wire. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MINGUS AGAINST OOEY GOOEY CHEWY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE
FIRST TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED. MINGUS back off the early pace, steadied briefly in the first turn, fell further back, improved position with some mild
late interest while never a serious threat. AMMENTHEDESTROYER off a step slow, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. YOU'REOBADBOY dueled
up front outside the runner up, faltered late in the final turn, continued weaken when backing up down the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

STOLEN KISSES broke with the field, shuffled a bit past the wire the first time, fell back to trail the middle three furlongs, began an inside run through some
traffic late in the final turn, continued to good mettle to the finish to prove best. PREDICTING off a step slow in breaking outward, lacked any early foot,
moved a bit closer after two furlongs, came four wide for the drive, up late for the place while unable to match the winner in the final strides. STONE COLD
LOVER closest to the dueling leaders, moved closer three wide then challenged turning for home, held the advantage a sixteenth out, outkicked by the top
two late. SHESPUN broke best of all, dueled up front along the inside, shook off the other speed midway on the final bend but had little left in the run to the
wire. GOSPEL SISTER fractious in the paddock saddling, broke with the field, four wide in the first turn, came up empty when asked for the drive. SHE'S A
PLAYER set or forced the pace in the two path for a half then gave way midway on the final bend. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MEGA SHACK broke on top, narrowly showed the way under the wire the first time, continued to show the way onto and up the backstretch, spurted clear
far turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. SWORD OF GOLD void of early foot
while off the inside, began to advance late backstretch, squeezed through a narrow opening turning for home, set down, slowly getting to the winner late.
DETERMINED LOVER within striking distance after brushing with a foe at the break, saved some ground into the lane, went evenly in lacking a closing
punch to finish up best of the rest. CATALE HURRYCANE brushed at the start, chased the winner and weakened in the drive. MR PELOTON in tight at the
start, failed to menace while going four wide through both turns. SEARCHIN SAFARI was finished after a half, trailed home. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
