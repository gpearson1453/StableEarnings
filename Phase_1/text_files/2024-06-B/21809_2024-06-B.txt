DANCER never far back, gained position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead late and
was outfinished. BEAR CREEK tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled in, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. GET EVEN well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then
flattened late and held a share. GINS AND TINS stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short lead through the turn, held sway to the furlong marker and

Footnotes
LESLIE CHOW rated on heels early, angled out and pulled to contention outside, gained a short lead three wide through the second turn, shook clear into
the stretch, drew off and was kept to the task. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the
stretch and had a mild late gain, and held the place. SHIMMERING LEROID unhurried, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch, evened out and held the show. YARDMAN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch and
ran evenly. GRAEL well placed and outside, moved up to stalk the leader through the second turn, bid between, making tight quarters for HUNTIN' THE
RUT, then had no stretch rally. HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to quarter pole, then steadied in tight quarters and
faded.

Footnotes
HOUSEBUILDER eased to the lead, shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. LITTLE BIG mid pack, moved up two and three wide
through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, closed well and lacked the needed late kick. AESTHETICALLY unhurried, moved up on the two path
through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled in for clear racing room, then weakened the final yards and held the show. ARAK
stalked the pace outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch and flattened the final furlong.
LEGIO loop three and four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. BLUEBERRY rated back early, lost position through
the turn, came through inside of rivals, regaining some position, then had no rally. MUTTLEY ran evenly.
