Footnotes
RICK'S DANCER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch while
racing out from the rail, maintained his advantage into the final turn, and widened that margin in the lane while being kept to task. BORROWED EQUITY
was squeezed at the start, and forced to take up in the opening strides before settling off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down
the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. NU SOUP FOR BABY
broke inwards at the start, and chased the leader in the run to the first turn, before the rider had his saddle slip forward, the rider lost his irons approaching
the turn, tracked the leader three wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to hold on for a
share, while the jockey was never able to recover from losing his pedals. SHOWMAN broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BE SPARKY unhurried early
while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was only able to pass a tiring rival late while finishing two out
from the rail in the drive.

THERE GOES MY HERO settled off the quick early pace while racing just out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail
entering the final turn, slipped through along the rail after straightening for home to assume command, and held off a late surge by BARNEY GOOGLE to
prevail. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping well off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, launched
his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed full of run five wide in the drive to just miss. C C SUNRISE away well and stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to garner a share. LEFT
THE BAR broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, and into the final
turn, drifted off the rail entering the lane, and faded in deep stretch. WICKED NIGHT away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, chased the leader two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while being taken in hand late. SLEW'S
DA BOSS settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, was steadied hard while lacking room
in deep stretch and lost position late. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of WICKED NIGHT lodged a claim of
foul against the rider of C C SUNRISE for alleged interference in mid stretch. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish

DIVAANY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing from between rivals, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and
closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. STANFORD NORTH away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and just failed to last.
BARBERRY BANDIT dropped back to trail in the run to the first turn while saving ground at the rail, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, was taken in hand while awaiting room leaving the turn, and closed smartly from along the rail in the drive while gaining late. DAPPER DON stalked the
leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. RANCHO
RED tracked the leader from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
in the late going. ATOMIC HAZE away alertly and stalked the leader into the first turn while racing two out from the rail, continued with a three wide bid into
the final turn, but tired over the final furlong.

PINEAPPLE TIDBITS stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained a staking trip in the run down the
backside, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, shifted three wide entering the stretch, assumed command in mid stretch and inched clear late. ICE

entering the second turn, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place. RICHARDS
COMMAND away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained her position into the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive. TEXAS HUMOR broke sharply and pressed the pace from the
outside of STAR FINALITY through the lane the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside, disposed of her pace rival
approaching the final turn, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and fought on bravely from along the rail in the drive to just miss the show spot.
CARLA'S HONOR settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced her bid from along the inside
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the lane when called upon. ZETAMARIE unhurried early while dropping back to trail
entering the first turn, continued to bide her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished
two out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. BAKZONE stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first
time, struggled to maintain her position in the run down the backstretch, and failed to respond when called upon. STAR FINALITY raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the lane the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, was overtaken approaching the final turn, and wasn't
persevered with late.
