handling. PRANCIPANTS trailed for six furlongs, closed willingly outside the winner five wide and finished second best. PRINCESS HALIME set the pace
for three and one half furlongs, gave up the lead, kept pressure into the stretch and was outfinished. CHESS NOT CHECKERS trailed from the gate, slipped
through along the rail to make the lead near the nine sixteenths pole, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. MISS FUSSY PANTS pressed
the pace two then three wide through the far turn, swung wide and gave way.
