Footnotes
GOTCHA LOOKIN paused at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried while never far back in the early running, was guided three to four wide into the
turn and advanced at the quarter marker, roused five wide into the stretch, chased R HEART OF GOLD to the furlong marker, took command past
mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. R HEART OF GOLD prominent away from the start, stalked the moderate early pace while outside of the
leading duo, was guided four wide into the turn and advanced to vie for the lead at the quarter pole, took command into the stretch and led to the furlong
marker, was overtaken by GOTCHA LOOKIN past mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was a clear second best.
GOLF DRAMA fractious prior to the start, was away in good order, engaged with BIG STICK and contested the moderate early pace with that rival,
contested the pace from the two path into the turn and came under pressure at the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and chased to the furlong
pole, weakened past mid-stretch and held for third at the finish. BIG STICK contested the moderate early pace from between rivals, disputed the pace from
the three path into the turn, could not keep pace at the furlong marker and gave way in the drive. THE FUSS allowed to settle away from the start,
maintained a two wide path along the turn and trailed nearing the quarter pole, swung wide into the stretch but could not muster a late response. This race
was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CATALINA COCKTAIL broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the pace three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path through the
backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, was roused three wide into the far turn and took command at the quarter marker, drew away
into the stretch, was kept to task to the sixteenth-marker and was geared down in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. SPARKLE SWEETLY assumed
early command leaving the start, showed the way into the first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, was prompted through moderate fractions
nearing the half-mile marker, was overtaken by CATALINA COCKTAIL nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and held
for second at the finish. GOLDEN SKYLINE tracked the early pace from the inside, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace
nearing the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, could not muster the needed response in the stretch drive and just missed for second
at the wire. TOBACCO HONEY hard to load prior to the start, was forwardly placed away from the gate and stalked between rivals into the first turn,
prompted the modest pace along the backstretch run, was outrun along the far turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off
under her own power. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT tracked the pace in the two to three path not far back, bided time to the far turn, moved gradually through the far turn then bid four wide just
past the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch and lengthened the margin down the lane. POUR ON THE COLE broke well but went three wide into the
first turn, took up a stalking position behind LYING GHOST allowing that rival to dictate some very slow fractions on the front end, went to challenge for the
lead near the quarter pole and was two off the rail as four horses fanned out across the track, finished well but could not match strides with the winner down
the stretch while holding second in a good effort. CHIEF JACKSON broke well but got in a bit tight into the first turn, was fighting the rider a bit through that
turn but settled down for the backstretch run, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths marker, went four to five wide into the stretch loomed a threat in upper
stretch then flattened out but kept to task to gain the third spot. GALLANT WARREN off a bit slowly and was last into the first turn, continued to lag behind
down the backstretch then came under a ride while launching a two to three wide bid with three furlongs to go, made a mild rally down the stretch and was
able to improve one position at the wire. LYING GHOST was hustled to the front and managed to slow the pace down to a crawl, held sway to the far turn,
then battled back briefly when beset by challengers near the quarter pole, gave way in upper stretch and was all out but unable to hold fourth at the wire.
WALKING BOSS lacked speed, raced at the rear of the field with only one behind going into the clubhouse turn, saved all the ground to no avail, lost
contact with the field in the stretch and was not persevered with late. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

HAY JUAN showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a quick pace heading to the half-mile pole, controlled the pace into
the turn and maintained a clear lead at the quarter marker, extended the lead into the stretch, had the margin cut into a bit into the final sixteenth but kept a
clear lead into deep stretch and held sway. MY DOMINATOR forwardly placed away from the start, took back off of the quick early pace and tracked
between runners heading to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit three to four wide approaching the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed willingly
into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner into deep stretch and outfinished ALMANERA in the final strides to secure the place honors. ALMANERA
(IRE) chased the solid early pace, raced three wide into the turn and inched closer to HAY JUAN nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch
and lost ground at the furlong pole, stayed on and re-rallied into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in the final strides and held safely at the wire
for third. MISSED CALL allowed to settle away from the start, was guided four to five wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, raced widest
into the stretch and offered a mild late rally. MAJOR TOM raced close up to the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and lost position nearing the
quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, made a mild gain in the final sixteenth but needed more.
TOO MUCH INFO unhurried in the early going, saved ground approaching the turn, was guided two wide heading to the quarter marker, offered a mild
response in the stretch drive but did not factor in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

VIOLET THUNDER settled just off of the early pace and tracked four wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and was
well placed nearing the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the far turn, loomed into upper stretch, closed determinedly past the furlong marker, wore
down MINERAL RIGHTS in the final sixteenth and edged away in deep stretch to prove best. MINERAL RIGHTS hustled away from the start, vied for the
early lead along the first turn then assumed command into the backstretch run, set decent fractions heading to the half-mile marker, led into the far turn and
showed the way to the quarter pole while in the two path, dug in into upper stretch and held foes at bay nearing the furlong pole, grudgingly gave way to
VIOLET THUNDER into the final sixteenth and was a clear second best. MISS PERU unhurried away from the start, trailed into the first turn and saved
ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide along the far turn and swung widest for the stretch drive,
offered a mild rally in the final sixteenth and gained third in deep stretch. ADJUST THE HEAT broke alertly and vied for the early lead, contested the pace
with MINERAL RIGHTS into the first turn then ceded the lead to that rival into the backstretch run, stalked MINERAL RIGHTS through decent fractions
heading to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide into the far turn and chased the pacesetter approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked at
mid-stretch, weakened into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third in deep stretch. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE allowed to settle in the early stages,
never far back through the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the far turn and advanced at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not
sustain her run into the final sixteenth and faltered in deep stretch. HANG ON prominent away from the start, settled just off of the early pace and tracked
from the two path into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace from between rivals approaching the half-mile
marker, chased three wide into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. PEGGY THE COLONEL tracked the early pace three
wide and between rivals into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and chased the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, dropped

Footnotes
TOM'S REGRET broke well then ceded the lead to CHANCERY WAY as that one came out into the path near the five furlong marker, then was put in tight
passing the three furlong pole, altered course to the inside, took advantage of a hole along the rail, slipped through, gained the lead at the head of the
stretch while drifting out a bit then drew off in the final furlong to an authoritative victory. SCARY FAST RIDE broke best but was allowed to settle into stride,
was between horses down the backstretch then made a forward move on the turn as was three wide as all four horses fanned across the track at the top of
the stretch, emerged with the best chance to run down the eventual winner but could not reel that one in but finished well to hold the place. CHANCERY
WAY bobbled coming out of the gate then sped to a clear lead under some restraint, was let loose passing the three furlong pole, then beset by the rest of
the field at the top of the stretch, drifted out some in upper stretch and made light contact with SCARY FAST RIDE before the furlong marker, was unable to
match strides with the top two in deep stretch but finished on good courage to hold third. SMILING MOLLY allowed to settle while never far back leaving the
start, tracked outside of rivals nearing the half-mile and was well placed heading into the turn, chased four wide to the quarter marker, raced widest into the
stretch and could not muster a response in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
GIANT KID allowed to settle away from the start, was content to trail in the early going while never far back, guided three wide into the turn, advanced at the
quarter marker and mounted a five wide rally into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, closed fast and took command into the final sixteenth,
was kept to firm hand urging in deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages. GREATFUL ATTITUDE raced close up to the moderate early pace, chased
outside of rivals into the turn and loomed four wide nearing the quarter marker, drew to even terms with LUNA LINDA into upper stretch and battled that rival
to the furlong marker, took a narrow lead at mid-stretch, was overhauled by the winner into the final sixteenth and was a clear second best. HOT BETTY
chased the moderate early pace, was well placed into the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker while two wide, was outkicked into the stretch,
stayed on into the final sixteenth and outfinished LUNA LINDA for show honors. LUNA LINDA showed good speed away from the start, assumed a narrow
early lead and set a contested pace heading to the half-mile marker, dueled inside of BLURSDAY into the turn and held a slim lead at the quarter marker,
shook free into upper stretch, met the bid of GREATFUL ATTITUDE nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep
stretch and was outfinished for third. BLURSDAY broke alertly and vied for the lead away from the start, contested the moderate early pace outside of rivals,
pressed three wide and between rivals into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. LADY WOLF ducked in at the start and
was off slowly, rushed up in the early stages and disputed the pace from the inside, was outrun along the turn and tired in the stretch drive. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
