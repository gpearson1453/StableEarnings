drew clear. SIMMS saved ground, swung four to five wide at the head of the lane, and closed with good energy. GIVE EM HECK BECK sat in striking
position while three wide, was roused at the quarter pole, and was outkicked. UPO trailed the field, and bid belatedly. FLASHIN ACES offered little. BIG
AL'S VISION set the pace from the two path, and tired early.

EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE was in tight then steadied into the far turn, waited for running room then lodged a bid at the quarter pole, dueled inside of THRILL
OF THE NITE, and edged clear late. TEXAS TIDELANDS trailed the field at the head of the stretch and closed late to score second place. BOOTIFUL
ROSE reserved off the early pacesetters, rallied inside and was bested late. THRILL OF THE NITE set the early pace, responded to a challenge from
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE, and weakened in the final yards. NIGHT FLYER offered a late mild bid. ROYAL STATUS contested the pace leaving the
backstretch, but came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
JOY IN GRACE broke alertly then quickly went to the front to lead the way through the backstretch, responded gamely to a threat from OUT FRONT at the
quarter pole, and won going away. OUT FRONT sat in striking position while four wide, loomed at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner and
finished with good energy. STOLEN JEWEL rated well off the pace, chased through the stretch and was unable to improve position. WHISKARITA offered a
mild late bid. DAZZLING CHIC passed tiring rival. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY offered little.

Footnotes
BEHIND THE CURTAIN sent for outside speed, set the pace while four wide, turned back a challenge from FAST EH in the final turn, drew clear and held
safely. COMMON KNOWLEDGE tracked the pace while four to five wide, launched an all out bid into the stretch but was unable to reach the winner and
finished evenly. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS lagged early, improved position into the stretch and was vanned off. ZOFFA trailed early, and rallied belatedly.
MUCHO MAGIC reserved off the early leaders, rallied through stretch and weakened late. FAST EH sat just off the pace from along the rail, moved up
menacingly at the quarter pole and yielded in the stretch. BRATTON sat in range early, and had nothing left in reserve.

Footnotes
SALTY CAT quickly went to the front then saved ground while showing the way, responded to outside rivals at the quarter pole, and held under a long drive.
ALBERTA sat in range while five wide, moved up menacingly at the head of the lane, but was unable to get by and evened out late. PARZANNI tracked four
wide, set down from between foes leaving the final turn, but lacked the rally needed. RUN MYA RUN stalked inside, dropped back in traffic while leaving the
backstretch, was roused at the three sixteenth pole, and improved position. CARO'S MAGIC bid belatedly. SWEETSINGINGANGEL tracked the pace, and
lacked a closing response. ANNA'S GIRL stalked the pace while three wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and faded. ISLA VIEW no impression.

FIRECRACKER STAND quickly took command then angled down to the four path, responded gamely to pressure from ISLE OF SKYE, and held safely.
ISLE OF SKYE brushed leaving, settled just off the pace from the three path, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole, but was unable to stall the winner.
CASHLINGS tracked inside, rallied through the stretch and held on for show. TUCKER TIME brushed EXPLODE leaving the backstretch, raced four wide in
the far turn, was set down near the stretch, but was unable to threaten in the drive. JUMEIRAH COAST trailed racing into the lane, and offered a late mild
bid. EXPLODE was brushed leaving the backstretch, came under urging at the head of the lane, and flattened out in the stretch. DUNE D'ORO chased early
and tired. SMARTY RIVER PANTS jostled leaving the gate, and was outrun.

MOHAYMEN DAY contended the early pace from outside, overtook the leader nearing the quarter pole, and drew away late stretch. HENRY'S GAMBLE
stalked wide through the backstretch, moved up closer setting sights on the leaders, drifted in entering the stretch, and finished well for second. COUNT ON
IT chased from the rail, and rallied for show. LINAHASPECSHOES raced at the back of the pack, swung wide into the final turn, and closed gradually
outside. BAKFIRE BABY dueled for the early lead, was overtaken into the final turn, and gave way. LITTLE HARPER sat in range, and came up empty in
the drive. LUCKY HALO was outsprinted to the turn, and had nothing left with two furlongs remaining.

LITTLE GROOT broke outward, contended the early pace from the three path, reclaimed the front in the final turn, turned back a challenge from JULIUS
THE GREAT and stayed clear under a strong hand ride. TIGERITO jostled leaving the gate, stalked the pace from the four path, rallied five wide entering
the stretch, and inched up to score place. JULIUS THE GREAT brushed away from the gate, tracked inside, loomed boldly into the stretch but was unable to
stall the winner and was edged out late. AMUSING WAY broke inward then bumped TIGERITO, moved up to challenge the lead, was overtaken and
flattened out in the stretch. RUNNINFORCOVER broke alertly, chased wide leaving the backstretch, shifted inside in the final turn, and lacked a kick.
LIGHTENING ANNA raced wide leaving the backstretch, and failed to menace. HANDCARVED raced five wide into the far turn, and had no response.
DREW was never involved.
