Footnotes
MR. SQUEAKY WHEELS well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, led four wide into the stretch, then drew off and was ridden out.
TIME FOR RESTRAINT tracked the pace, angled out four wide into the stretch, then closed well for the place. DANCING ON AIR broke sharply from the
gate to lead early, stalked the pace through the turn, bid three wide between, then weakened the final furlong. BRAGGART JOE unhurried, moved up on the
two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and improved position. SNOWSTORM set the pace on the inside, veered in into the
stretch, straightened and had no rally. AND THATS MY STORY was never involved, inside.

SPAN OF CONTROL unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late. ON AN
ISLAND stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path, bid outside the leader gaining a short lead into the stretch, held sway to
the final yards and was outfinished. VERY DEBONAIRE never far back, moved up inside through the turn, came through on the two path into the stretch,
was blocked, angled four wide, then closed well for the show. MR. BONES void of speed, moved up while angling out through the turn, came widest into the
stretch, evened out and gained a share. STONE'S THROW mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, then
faded the final furlong. SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then faded in the stretch.

MARZ EXPRESS tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn to gain a short lead, dueled with WATERLOO SUNSET the final furlong and
held the advantage. SO MOXIE well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out, made a
steady gain and missed. WATERLOO SUNSET well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into
the stretch, dueled with that one the final furlong, weakened late and held the show. ULTIMATE BARONESS allowed to settle, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. DOWN TO EARTH unhurried, looped three and four wide through the
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had a mild late gain. WILD LOOKER mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into
the stretch and ran evenly. SONG OF INDY hopped at the start, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had no
