Footnotes
CELTICS WILDCAT led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn and just held off a closer to the
wire. RUBYSA stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the four path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained
ground late to just miss. LONG MONDAY hit the gate leaving it, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the bend in
the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. CHILD PROOF chased the leader on the inside early, navigated the
bend from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. CATO'S LADY raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend and made no bid. FOLK HERO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and faded
in the lane.
