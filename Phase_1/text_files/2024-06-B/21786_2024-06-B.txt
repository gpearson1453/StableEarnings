HERE'S THE THING was settled for three furlongs, rallied four wide into the second turn, pushed to the front and held driving. CHIEFS LIL PEARL stalked
the pace inside, shifted off the rail leaving the quarter pole, bid three wide to the stretch but was outkicked for the win while second best. BELLS AND
WHISTLES chased the pace from the rail, closed a gap on the second turn but lost her punch in the drive. DODROPIN had no speed, bid three wide to the
stretch and had a mild late bid. HER PERFECT VISION hustled to the front, set the pace to the second turn then was overtaken and tired. CAL was always
outrun. The trainer of #1CHIEFS LIL PEARL lodged an objection against #6 HERE'S THE THING for alleged interference on the second turn but it was not
allowed by the stewards.

RODEO ROSE was never far back, bid two wide nearing the second turn, took over and drew clear in the drive. MO SUGAFOOT was rank and throwing her
head a bit to the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and was second best. YANKEE PANKEE broke in, bumped SENSATIONAL CITY, had good speed,
set the pace from the rail for three furlongs then was overtaken by the winner and weakened. SENSATIONAL CITY got bumped by YANKEE PANKEE at
the start, chased to the backstretch then was three wide and did not rally. LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN stalked the pace for three furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
MACLEAN'S RHYME was outrun to the backstretch, eased in and advanced inside on the second turn then eased off the rail while rallying into the stretch
and finished willingly to prevail. PULPITS POWER tracked the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and closed determinedly to grab
second by a snostril. ROMAN RUSH set all the pace from the rail, resisted rivals to mid stretch then was nailed on the line for second. MATTAWA N THAT
pressed ROMAN RUSH to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then got outfinished in the drive. BETHEL RIDGE tracked the pace two wide which
allowed the winner a rail rally and lacked a closing bid. HAKUNUI had no speed and was never a threat. KEEN JAMES chased for three furlongs then gave
out.
