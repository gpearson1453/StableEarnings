I'M HIM inside run to turn, rallied along easily in stretch run much best. NATIONAL STORY lunged and bore out start, lost best chance, regrouped and was
running on too late. SAMURAI WAY slow start, raced along evenly with a wide run into the stretch. MR. HIGH POCKETS quick speed to the front, dueled to
the turn, empty in the lane. ROCKET LAUNCHER had a staggered start while never far back throughout with no late response when needed. ROLLIN MY
WAY dueled briefly from inside with nothing left into the turn, empty.
