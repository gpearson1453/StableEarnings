Footnotes
PRINCESS SOIREE pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a clear lead and
drew off through the lane. INFO'S TREASURE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not reach the
winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. RATIONAL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a
contending position but failed to gain in the drive. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after
going three-quarters. MINI MAGS was away alertly to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going a half. REDHAWK settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

TRY TO CAPTURE broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off as handy winner.
FLYING CHARLIE chased the leaders while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. BID IN THE BACK
showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. LOTSA LENA was away in good order to dispute the pace with the
winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. THE THIRD RING settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. ROADSIDE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
MARINO HEAT raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
RED NOVA was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, vied with BOLD REY after going a half, drifted out through the lane and gamely
held that rival safe in the drive. BOLD REY pressed the pace from between rivals, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, vied with the winner, was carried
out through the and just missed in a game effort. SHES GOT THE POWER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second
turn, angled in late and finished with good energy. LA ROSA DRIVE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive.
WISHFUL WON settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. DAME DANGEROUS
showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to offer a bid. DON'T RUB IT raced off the leaders from
the inside and gradually weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF BOLD REY LODGED AND OBJECTION
AGAINST RED NOVA CONCERNING THE BEING CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE STRETCH BY THAT FOE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE

Footnotes
THORN HILL CAT tracked the leaders from the inside, moved between foes in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards. GORDY'S RULES was away in
good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch and gave way grudgingly to that rival late.
REAL GLITTER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late
energy. PLAYOFF BOUND was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, gained a brief lead into the stretch and gave
way in the drive. MR. PICKLES showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late.
GABO'S MACONDO was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. EL BORRACHO was void of early speed, saved
ground through the second turn and was not a factor. TRASK pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. CREATIVE PLAN
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.
