Footnotes
SON OF AN EX chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, advanced to take command inside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide
into upper stretch and edged clear under a drive to prevail. FEATHERS ROAD chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn getting placed
to coaxing three furlongs out, swung four to five wide for home and kept on to secure the place honors. MOM'S EYE CANDY three wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along midway on the turn, continued three wide for home and weakened while along for the show honors. DREAMPOINT forwardly placed at the
start, advanced inside to take command five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front inside the five-sixteenths and
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. GOT THE GOLD chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four
wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired in the stretch. RUSH TO HONOR led early on from the two
path before being displaced from command with five furlongs to go, prompted the pace through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just
off the inside for home in retreat and faltered.

Footnotes
WATERS OF MEROM showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her inside, moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the
two path, was asked under threat outside the quarter-pole, shook off LANFRANKOPHILE in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. KINGDOM
QUEEN was urged along off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, advanced more late on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn,
dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under the crop and earned the place while no match for the winner. LANFRANKOPHILE
was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths then switched to the outside, chased in the
three path on the turn, made a bid under strong urging at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and weakened while far clear for
the show. SARATOGA KISSES settled off the pace, was urged along in the three path on the turn and failed to respond. BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE settled
on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn and also failed to respond. LUZ hit the outside of the gate at the start, was slowest into stride
then angled out significantly early, raced on the far outside, rounded the turn in the four path, floated six wide into the stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
MARATHONER broke in at the start bumping ANALYSIS and pinching that foe back lightly in tandem with ANY MINUTE, chased four wide lightly coaxed
along down the backstretch and through the turn advancing on the top pair through the latter portion of the bend before swinging five wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, went clear under a drive drifting in despite correction to the rail to prevail. ANY MINUTE got
bumped at the start by ANALYSIS, who broke inwards, chased briefly inside before tipping to the two path, advanced in tandem with ARANJUEZ on the
leader and took over narrow command three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared near the eighth pole, proved no match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. R BOY CHEEKUM six paths
off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and
improved position for the show honors. ANALYSIS broke in at the start bumping ANY MINUTE, then got bumped by the breaking inwards MARATHONER
and was pinched back lightly between foes, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. ARANJUEZ four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths advancing to apply pressure to ANY MINUTE to the
outside as that rival took command, swung four wide into upper stretch getting shaken off straightened away and tired. CREATIVE MAGIC chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the midway point on the turn, went four wide for home and made no impact. LOOKING TO HEAVEN chased just off the
inside until tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. PIPITO
crossed to show the way in hand just off the inside before making his way to the inside five furlongs from home while safely clear early on, had a pair of
rivals begin to advance outside half a mile out, came under coaxing approaching the three-eighths marker and was displaced from the front at that station,
chased along the inside into upper stretch and folded. Please note that R BOY CHEEKUM wore a mask.

Footnotes
GUNS BLAZING bobbled some at the start but came out in front, angled in while quickly moving clear, remained well clear while inside through the turn,
responded well when set down in upper stretch and held under steady urging. BIG Q settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn and
earned the place while no match for the winner. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH dropped back under some restraint, settled at the back, was urged along in the two
path on the turn, turned three wide into upper stretch under a drive and missed the place while clear for the show. RAINBOW GAL dropped towards the
rear, went four wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TAPPANZEE was unsettled in the gate, raced off the
pace under coaxing, went three wide under stronger encouragement around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, moved out while dropping back outside
the furlong marker and faltered.

EXFILTRATION dueled four then three wide with INCONTROVERTIBLE to her inside, shook off that rival nearing the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, got roused with three-sixteenths to go and edged clear to inside the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. REELEY PSYCHED four wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be along well clear of the rest and
second best. INCONTROVERTIBLE dueled from the three path with the top one to her outside, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off nearing the five-sixteenths, spun four wide for home and weakened. CINNAMON DREAM chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. ELEGANT LAOBAN chased just off the inside
isolated near the rear between the main body of the field and one lone rival well behind while just off the inside, came under coaxing two to three wide with
seven-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. FLIGHT FORWARD detached at the tail of the field four
paths off the inside, tucked inside placed to coaxing with half a mile to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. EMERALD
BANKER chased six wide under a prolonged drive from the seven-sixteenths, cornered five wide for home and tired. ETHEL'S DOCTORATE chased five
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, faded midway on the turn and went four wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the wire.

BLUSHABLE settled on the far outside, ranged up five wide on the turn, made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths marker, took the lead in the four path
into the stretch, came in some under a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, switched to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, shook clear inside
that marker and drew away under strong urging. KERIK tracked the pace, dropped back while urged four wide on the turn then was driven six wide into
upper stretch, brushed with a rival near the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner. SWEET MISSION bumped soundly with a
rival at the start, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused nearing the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch,
brushed with a foe around the sixteenth-pole and missed the place while clear for the show. ALPINE QUEEN bumped soundly with an opponent at the start,
moved up leaving the chute to press the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch between horses, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. CHLOE ROSE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage under urging
inside the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN was taken in
hand early, moved up near the three-quarter pole, established a good position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, dropped back late on that bend
and faltered.

JUST READ IT four wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched
on EASY TO BLESS straightened away, dug in to wear down that rival taking command a sixteenth from home, then inched away in the late stages to the
finish. EASY TO BLESS chased along the inside, tipped out to the two path and split foes using an open seam three furlongs from home to engage the
leader and take command with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish
to secure the place honors. ROYAL MEGHAN took the overland route six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five to six wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be along for the show honors. PATTY H
stumbled badly at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front before able to settle into stride, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and
then along the inside through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late going.
SHESALITTLE EDGY chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. SPUN D'ETAT forwardly placed
two to three wide, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. TRINNI LUCK showed the way in
hand three then two wide before tucking inside near the half mile pole under pressure to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the
front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SUNSET LOUISE bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, angled in while dropping back under urging, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was
held up in the two path outside the three-eighths then came under coaxing, waited behind foes at the five-sixteenths, was roused approaching the
quarter-pole, angled out in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, closed strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth then moved clear under good
handling. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY disputed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, moved clear outside the five-sixteenths,
extended the advantage into upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear
for the place. MAMA SAID NO bumped with a rival at the start, settled outside under some urging, moved closer late on the backstretch, was roused five
then six wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. RCAPTIVATING was urged along off the pace, chased three wide on the
turn and came up empty. CAPE COD CAUSEWAY chased the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and tired. SWEET LIES was hustled
from the start, contested the pace down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths and capitulated. BIG BEAN
CHRISTINE broke a bit awkwardly, was taken in hand while crowded early, moved up outside the five-eighths, took an awkward stride against the rail near
the nine-sixteenths then dropped to the rear, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. DREAM CENTRAL was coaxed along towards the
rear, went four wide on the turn and had nothing left. TONIGHT WE LOVE pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the turn
and faltered.
