Footnotes
BARDOLINO hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace around the turn, drifted out turning for home, was challenged by LITTLE BOLD BANDIT in mid stretch
then responded and drew clear. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT , snugly rated down the backstretch, angled in approaching the turn, saved ground around the turn,
advanced along the rail to challenge for the lead in mid stretch, finished willingly but was second best. PAY THE KID , jostled leaving the starting gate,
circled foes four deep on the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home, loomed in upper stretch and failed to sustain his move. SEIZE THE DAY came out
and bumped PAY THE KID leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. LITTLE BAY , outrun, raced along the inner rail
on the turn. BLOODPROF broke sluggishly, chased the pace while three deep around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. YOU CAN NEVER TELL
showed speed in the two path between horses, dueled for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
KNOWHOWIKNOW leaned in and brushed with a rival at the break, was sent up between foes soon after to entertain the pace, shook clear with four and a
half furlongs remaining, controlled the issue two wide into the lane, kept on under solid pressure through the lane and held sway. ALL FOR LOVE stalked
the winner three wide, took closer order under hearty asking in mid stretch, continued willingly but was kept at bay. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY vied early while
saving ground, eased back off the winner past the five eighths, chased around the turn and into the lane, shifted out in mid stretch but came up empty.
AXXERATOR settled off the pace, angled out to chase outside rivals past the three eighths but lacked a stretch kick. STEVETHEVANDRIVER , brushed at
the break, forced the early pace, chased between rivals mid turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LADY ZETA prompted the pace between horses down the backstretch and on the turn, tried to lug in when taking the lead near the eighth pole then dug in
late to hold sway. JUSTHAPPY stalked the pace down the backstretch, encountered traffic entering the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied.
CIRCLE HOME , taken to the inner rail soon after the start, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch until swung outside near the
sixteenth pole and rallied nicely. ISABELLA'S GLORY drifted out leving the starting gate, lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and passed
tired foes. VIOLET JESSOP , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened through the stretch. ALWAYS MIA showed speed along the inner rail,
remained prominent to the eighth pole and weakened. CROSSTOWN GIRL , steadied in tight quarters near the six furlongs pole, circled the turn three to
four wide and weakened. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , bumped soon after the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
SIERRA LEONA , three to four wide tracking the pace, was coaxed along spying the dueling leaders from the three eighths, moved to command in upper
stretch, kicked clear under a strong drive nearing the furlong, widened and was kept alert. POSTINO'S CHAMPION took over early and set the pace
towards the inside, took pressure past the five eighths, dueled from the far turn to upper stretch, came off the inside and gave way grudgingly. SIMMARD
SHENANIGAN hopped a bit at the break, raced in range while off the rail and under asking past the five eighths, was under a strong ride leaving the far turn,
circled four to five wide into the stretch but lacked a solid response. ARBUTUS broke a step slow then was sent up between rivals, pressed two wide outside
the leader, moved to near even terms after a half mile, sparred to upper stretch then weakened. HETTY G. saved ground stalking the pace, was ridden
along around the far turn, failed to respond and dropped back.

Footnotes
BEAR FORCE WON saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, found ample room along the rail through the stretch, challenged for the lead near the
eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. STROLL SMOKIN sped to the early lead, set the pace two wide on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and raced
tenaciously through the lane. NASHVEGAS bore in leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in the two path on the turn, swung to the five path at the head
of the stretch and flattened out. SATCHEL DE RITCHES prompted the pace outside STROLL SMOKIN around the turn and weakened in the drive. THE
GREAT DANSKY , three wide on the turn and failed to rally. SUBJECT TO CHANGE , pinched back after a slow start, hugged the inner rail on the turn and
was outrun. INTERESTING LEGACY , three wide on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
GIFTED HEART vied in some tight quarters along the rail and brushed with MS HEADLEY near the half mile marker, took a short lead in upper stretch,
came off the rail and shook clear leaving mid stretch, kept on under strong handling and prevailed. OLIVE KAT chased the dueling leaders, angled three
wide leaving the far turn, ranged up four wide in upper stretch, loomed boldly with a furlong to go and churned on. PROPER ATTIRE broke slowly, rushed
up wide and bid three deep to contest the pace, gained a short advantage into the turn, ceded command in upper stretch, fought on past mid stretch then
gave way grudgingly. PARTY AT PAGE'S , off the contested pace, was under a ride three wide into the stretch, chased to the inside of rivals in mid stretch
but came up empty. MS HEADLEY sped to the early lead, vied between runners and exchanged a brush near the half mile marker, dropped off the leaders
past the three eighths, gave willing pursuit near mid stretch then came up empty. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF failed to keep pace.

Footnotes
DOUBLE FIREBALL kept close down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail entering the turn, swung to the three path leaving the bend, closed outside
MAGICAL LUNA, over took that one near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. MAGICAL LUNA showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace, opened
a clear lead turning for home and finished gamely. MARVELLA NASTY circled the turn three wide, was fanned four deep at the head of the stretch and
rallied mildly. CANOODLE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and passed tired rivals. UNREQUITED LOVE disputed the pace two wide to
the stretch and gave way the final furlong. RESPONSE TIME , two wide chasing the pace for a half mile, weakened. LONG DISTANCE LOVE , raced in the
two path on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CONCLUSIVE took over early and set a rated pace towards the inside, spurted clear through the backstretch run, remained under confident handling past
the five sixteenths, kicked away when roused two wide in upper stretch, widened and was ridden out to the wire. NATAGAR steadied when rank off heels
early on, settled soon into the backstretch while three wide, advanced three wide when given his cue around the far turn, gave hard chase from there and
continued with good energy to the wire. WISH ME HOME came out at the break, corrected and edged up to prompt the pace towards the inside, shifted out
for the drive and faded. LORD MIO , off slowly when pinched back at the break, dropped in early to chase the pace, was under asking around the final turn
and failed to respond. UNCLE IRISH , roughed at the break, regrouped and raced off the pace, was under pressure off the rail around the final turn and
faded. RUN ON THE TRAIL came in at the break crowding foes, straightened and moved up to forced the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on leaving
the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
JOANIE'S SUNSET , unhurried early, began her rally along the inner rail entering the far turn, swung to the four path turning for home, closed outside
UNSHAKABLE U and got the bob at the finish. UNSHAKABLE U sprinted to the early lead, set a fast pace off the rail, drifted out a but in upper stretch and
gave way grudgingly. MISS MORENO , along the inner rail on both turns, had a mild rally inside horses. IMAGINE VICTORY lacked speed, raced inside
horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. MARKETABILITY lacked speed, was two wide on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed
to rally. BETCHA BY GOLLY , well off the rail chasing the pace, gave way. HASHTAG LUCKY , three wide both turns, drifted very wide entering the stretch.
