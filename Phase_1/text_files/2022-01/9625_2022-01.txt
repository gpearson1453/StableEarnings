ACE DESTROYER prompted to gain a position from between foes tracking the leaders out of striking distance in the opening stages, shifted to the inside
nearing the turn, advanced along the rail to challenge for command entering upper stretch, then edged forward in the closing stages under firm
encouragement. NICK THE CARDSHARK tracked the leaders outside a rival under light rating racing to the turn, shifted out three deep racing into the lane
while being prompted to advance and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner late. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK, forwardly placed prompting a rival's
pace on the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the turn to gain a clear advantage nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the top pair racing past
midstretch. YAK settled into stride racing a bit off the inside to the turn, angled out in upper stretch but made no impression. CHILL HAZE, urged to the lead
disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail, was headed midway through the bend and gave way between foes nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GENERAL COMMAND broke readily, was urged clear racing well off the rail through the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch,
was kept to pressure past the furlong marker then was taken in hand late. THEJIGISUP, off a step behind the leaders, was urged pursuing the pacesetter a
bit off the inside to the turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. MENELAO tracked the leaders outside from
out of striking distance, altered course midway through the backstretch avoiding a drifting rival, continued outside a rival into the bend and finished well
enough to prevail for a share. BROADWAY RUCKUS came through close quarters just after the break, angled inside tracking the leaders from out of striking
distance racing to the turn and offered no closing bid. HAMMER D, urged briefly to contention inside the eventual winner, drifted out markedly racing
through the backstretch while going a bit erratically and soon dropped out.

TACTICAL RANGE, bumped at the start, tracked just off the leaders inside foes racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper
stretch while being prompted to advance, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. FOLK HERO tracked just off the
leaders between foes in the opening stages, steadily advanced on the pacesetter racing into the turn to press the issue nearing upper stretch, was bumped
by that foe entering the lane but continued with interest to edge that foe for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. SASSY LIKE JULIA swerved
at the start, was quickly righted, then urged forcing the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, dispatched that foe racing into the turn, dueled inside a rival
into the lane while shifting out bumping that foe in upper stretch, then weakened in the closing stages. SCOOP THERE IT IS tracked off the first flight three
deep between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly into the lane while gaining some position. ESTILO DIFERENTE broke outwards bumping the
eventual winner, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace on the backstretch but gave way early. FALL CAMPAIGN was settled outside foes in the
second flight racing to the turn but failed to menace thereafter.

held sway to the end under firm handling. GRANDMARY tracked just off the leaders shifting three deep racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to
advance between foes in that path racing into the far turn and continued with a steady effort into the lane to prevail for the place honors while failing to close
the gap on the winner. LOVIN LIVIN stalked just off the leaders under rating along the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to advance along the rail
when presented an opening racing into upper stretch but was outkicked for second late. TIZ HERSELF settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position between foes late. BE BOP A LOLA was hustled to gain
the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, dueled for command inside the eventual winner
into the far turn and gave way between foes into the lane. CHARGE IT JENN, pulling while held up between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
angled to the inside racing into the far turn while being urged to advance but had no closing bid. JARA stumbled at the start, was righted, then pulled
between foes in the second flight racing in close quarters to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path
racing into the far turn but soon emptied out. SILVER PACKAGE, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, angled outside rivals racing into the stretch
but offered no rally.

Footnotes
MR. SARCASTIC was settled into stride dropping off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance along
the rail when presented an opening approaching the far turn, moved to challenge inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, then came through and went
clear in the closing stages under firm right handed pressure. PHARAOH FANCY PANT was settled outside foes just off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes on the far turn, was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride in the closing
stages to prevail for the place honors. ACTION WARRIOR was urged to the lead while angling over to set the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing
into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing in three path through the backstretch, continued to dispute the issue a bit off the rail
through the far turn to upper stretch but yielded to the winner late. GOLD CZAR raced four wide into the first turn while being prompted to a forward placing,
prompted the pacesetter three deep through the backstretch to the far turn and faded in the drive. SIAKAM, held up between foes avoiding close quarters
racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders in second flight, switched out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance between foes but
offered no rally. MR. EINSTEIN tracked just off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was urged to make a brief bid between foes
nearing the far turn but quickly came up empty. COMMANDER KEITH, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the first turn, dropped back nearing the
second bend while losing terms with the leaders then swung wide into upper stretch while giving way. STARSHIP OREO, pulled hard between foes under
firm restraint while dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted inwards racing through the far turn but offered no rally. RIP IT RYAN proved no
factor.

INITFORTHELOVE was rated off rivals in the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide nearing the second bend
continuing under patient handling, was prompted to advance in that path nearing upper stretch and produced a solid closing bid to go clear under firm
handling. VINTNER was rated off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, came through inside rivals when presented an opening in upper stretch
to challenge for command but proved only second best. OSPREY, reluctant to load, tracked the leaders outside rivals in the second flight racing to the
backstretch, advanced to challenge three wide between foes nearing the lane but lacked the needed final kick. HOLD THE SPICE, reserved between,
angled to the inside racing through the backstretch and continued evenly inside foes to late stages. LION CHARMER, urged to the lead while angling to the
inside entering the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes into the lane and gave way. VIOLENT FIGHT, held up
between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. GOLOVKIN settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. KING ANDRES was prompted three deep to the first turn to gain a forward placing tracking just off the
pacesetter to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid outside that foe on the far turn but quickly came up empty. ROBINSON dropped out early.
PRADO'S PLAYBOY trailed throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MY SARASOTA STAR was urged to the lead racing well off the rail, held sway on a commanding advantage in the three path racing to the stretch and was
kept to pressure while proving much the best. MISS MIAMI tracked the pacesetter just off and inside the second flight along the rail racing to the turn, tipped
out to the three path entering the stretch and edged rivals for the place honors late. TEE UP, urged three wide between foes tracking the leader in second
flight racing into the turn, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. MY BLONDE MARY settled off the second flight racing
between foes to the turn, angled to the rail entering the stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. GLORY ROLL tracked off the second flight
in the opening stages, was urged to advance four wide racing into the turn but had no closing bid. CLEM GEM settled last in early stages, raced five wide
through the turn to the stretch and made no impression. MAMBO DANCER tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes racing to the turn and emptied
out early. ROLLING MO dropped out early. LETS RACE LADYS soon retreated.

Footnotes
MOUNT KENYA was reserved between foes, then outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide through the far turn to upper
stretch to gain terms with the leaders leaving the furlong marker and continued with a sustained effort to prevail under firm handling. AUSSIE PRIDE settled
well off the pace while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide entering the lane and found his best stride late to close the gap while
edging rivals for second on the wire. HARPOON HARRY broke out bumping BATTLE OF BRITAIN, was rated off the second flight between foes to the
backstretch angled inside on the far turn, then tipped out racing through the stretch to bid for command three deep between but was just outkicked by the
top pair. TOUR OF DUTY, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, moved to challenge that rival nearing upper stretch,
skirmished for command past midstretch but was outkicked to the wire. BROTHER IN ARMS angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes in
the opening half, shifted out three wide on the far turn to make brief progress between foes nearing the lane but had no final kick. BATTLE OF BRITAIN,
bumped at the start, went to the lead from between foes, then angled to the inside racing to the first turn, set a rapid pace on a narrow advantage to the
second bend, dueled inside a rival to midstretch and gave out late. LE COSTE, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders as part of
the second flight racing to the backstretch, faded between foes nearing the lane. HASN'T HAD ENOUGH tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight
racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. COASTAL WATERS proved no factor. MONAASIB was rated off the second flight along the inside to
the backstretch and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
DECIMATOR came through close quarters just after the start, then was rated off the first flight racing a bit off the inside, split foes three deep racing into the
turn to press the issue outside the pacesetter, gained a narrow advantage on his own courage racing into the stretch and was roused right handed in late
stages to go clear. ELLAS MY LOVE, in touch with the leaders four wide attending the pace to the turn, continued with a steady bid into upper stretch while
shifting inwards a bit and prevailed for the place honors. WELD, urged disputing the pace on a narrow advantage between foes just off the inside racing into
the turn, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch and weakened late. MYSTERY MAN came through some traffic in the opening stages to prompt the
pace three wide between foes racing into the turn, then faded in late stages. HIGH FIVE COTTON tracked off the first flight three wide between foes on the
backstretch, shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly. MAGICAL TALE was urged inside rivals prompting the pacesetter through
the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. SWAGGY GEORGE broke slowly, tracked outside foes in second flight racing to the turn but
offered no closing bid. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM shied while ducking outwards bumping MYSTERY MAN in the opening stages, was taken up sharply dropping
off the field, then angled to the inside on the backstretch tracking behind the second flight but offered no rally. RECORDER, held up between foes to drop off
the second flight in the opening stages, retreated from contention early.

Footnotes
PUGILIST was rated outside foes in second flight racing to the first turn, angled inwards midway through the backstretch while readily advancing to a
position just off the leaders nearing the second bend, awaited an opening racing into the far turn, shifted out to bid for command three deep between foes
approaching upper stretch and went clear in late stages under firm encouragement. GENNIE HIGHWAY, reserved near the inside in the opening stages,
shifted out entering the second bend steadily gaining position three deep between rivals, angled inwards to split foes just off the inside to bid inside the
winner but proved only second best. CLASSY WOMAN tracked off the second flight inside rivals racing to the backstretch, shifted out splitting foes four wide
racing through the far turn to advance in tandem with the eventual winner to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. ZARINA, reserved between foes
while dropping off the field racing to the far turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and made an effort to improve position. CAFE FLEUR (FR), off slowly,
settled along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. HANNAH DANCES
tracked off the first flight between foes to the backstretch, dropped out last racing to the far turn, then passed some tiring rivals in the closing stages.
ITSAKEYPER, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders in early stages, bid for command three deep racing into the far turn to gain a narrow advantage
nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly entering the lane. MARIES MELODY, reserved in the opening stages, switched outside foes racing to the
backstretch, was caught five wide racing into the second bend and quickly came up empty. SLIME QUEEN, urged prompting the pace outside a rival to the
far turn, gave way nearing the lane. BERNIE'S MISTRESS was urged inside rivals disputing the pace to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.
