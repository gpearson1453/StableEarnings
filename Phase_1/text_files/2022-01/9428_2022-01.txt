Footnotes
ROYAL SUSPECT was reserved early, then made a five wide sweep for the lead on the far turn, then drew out in the furlong grounds to prove much the
best, driving. MR HOOVER was allowed to settle on the inside, eased off the inside by the quarter pole while advancing, swung out six wide for the drive
and finished willingly to be clearly second best. DOLLARIZATION was four wide into the first turn, then settled three to four wide on the backstretch, made a
four wide move with the winner on the far turn but came up empty in the final furlong, bested rest. PAPA TONY vied for the lead three wide and weakened in
the drive. CARGO SHIP vied for the early lead between rivals, then made a bid to set the pace on the backstretch and weakened leaving the quarter pole.
ROLLING PALISADES was off a step slow and failed to menace. HERE'S WALDO vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. SURFER BOY GEORGE
was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUPER HOUDINI was allowed to settle early while three to four wide, made a four wide move on the far turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best
while being ridden out. BOOK OF DELANCEY was settled early, made a five wide middle move down the backstretch, then made a three wide move on the
turn to set the pace on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. GOLD FELLOW vied for the early lead three wide, made
a bid to set a pressured pace on the backstretch, then weakened, held show award. TOUCH OF PRINCE vied for the early lead in between horses, then
was shuffled back on the turn, came four wide into the drive and missed the show award. VATICAN MOON prompted the pace five wide, made a four wide
bid on the turn and tired. DON TATTO failed to menace. MISTER ARANGUIZ vied for the early lead on the inside and stopped.
