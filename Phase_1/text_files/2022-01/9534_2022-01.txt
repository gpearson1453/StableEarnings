Footnotes
BOWL OF CHERRIES raced outside a rival then steadied briefly and angled to the inside, stalked the top pair into and around the turn, tipped out into the
stretch, drew alongside the leader then took over at the eighth pole and kicked clear. AVENTAPP dueled for the lead from outside, led in upper stretch,
yielded to the winner with a furlong remaining and stayed on to be clearly second best. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE stalked off the rail then outside a rival, two
then three wide on the turn, was in the hunt in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick in the late stages. OPTIMAS trailed early and steered to the
inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten. AIR FORCE WOMAN broke a step slow then bobbled at the start, went
up to take control while dueling on the inside, battled through the turn, lost the lead at the top of the lane and tired in the furlong grounds. FIRST RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

SAULS CALL sped clear to establish the front, crossed over to the inside, showed the way into the stretch, responded when roused in the lane and flagged
with the whip and drew away. IM STILL THIRSTY raced up close from outside behind the pacesetter, chased two to three wide around the bend, could not
summon the needed response to challenge the winner in the lane but was clearly second best. PRINCE HUSSAR chased along the inside into and around
the bend, then weakened in the stretch run. TOASTED AT DAWN chased three wide into the turn, dropped back on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT SWEETIE stalked along the inside behind the pacesetter, angled out with a quarter mile left to run, came three wide into the stretch, rallied
outside the top pair and took over at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. CAYTON KID sped clear and steered to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch,
got tested by ELANA MY PRINCESS on the turn, maintained a short lead into the furlong grounds, put away that rival in midstretch but was overtaken by
the winner with a sixteenth remaining. ELANA MY PRINCESS forwardly placed in the beginning, bid outside on the turn, kept the pressure on into the lane,
drifted in to the hindquarters of the leader and had to steady in midstretch, then flattened in the final sixteenth. LIFE IN PARADISE got bumped solidly at the
start, raced near the back early on, saved ground through the bend and failed to menace. MONGOLIAN DREAM was off a bit slow to begin, trailed outside a
rival then off the rail, navigated the turn three to four wide and was not a factor. CAT LADY BLUES broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, raced up
close from outside, chased three wide into the lane and faded.

drove clear and held safely in the end. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) got forced in and bumped at the start, saved ground at the back through the turn, moved
out a bit in the drive and closed well to earn the place. ENCODER raced outside a pair of rivals at the back early on, moved a bit closer and chased three
then four wide around the turn, rallied from outside and got edged for the place. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) dueled for command inside NERO, battled
through the turn, put away that rival in upper stretch but was soon challenged by the winner at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead and weakened in the

into the stretch but flattened in the late stages. FIGHT ON came in at the start, tracked between foes then two wide around the turn, angled out the in the

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN FORD vied three deep into the first turn then chased the top pair four to three wide leaving the bend, bid three deep on the second turn, took
over at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared past the quarter pole, met the challenge from BRAVESTONE in the final sixteenth and held gamely. BRAVESTONE
hit gate the gate at the start, stalked in the two path, waited behind the frontrunners on the far turn, angled three wide with a quarter mile left to run, brushed
with SETTECENTO entering the stretch, rallied outside and collared the leader but could not get by. SETTECENTO broke out, chased four then three wide
around the first turn, continued four wide around the second bend, brushed with rival into the stretch and flattened out in the late stages. VETOED pressed
the pace from outside, vied between rivals on the far turn, lost contact with the leader leaving the bend and weakened down the lane. MONGOLIAN
KINGDOM lacked early speed and tucked inside for the first turn, trailed throughout and was always outrun. DESERVEDLY set the pace under pressure
from outside, vied with a pair of rivals on the far turn, chased the leader leaving the bend and gave way.

Footnotes
TONY ANN sped to the front, set the pace inside a rival then cleared at the three-eighths pole, kicked clear around the far turn and lasted over the late
charge from the runner-up. HOGANS HOLIDAY settled outside a rival, spun three to four wide into the stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth but could not get
by. CARPE VINUM angled in entering the first turn, saved ground into the stretch and gained the show. PULPIT RIDER was forwardly placed three deep in
the early stages, chased two to three wide into the drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. SASSYSERB raced up close outside the pacesetter, lost
contact with three-eighths remaining, chased a bit off the rail into the drive and could not summon the needed late kick. BEAUTIFUL GIFT was off a step
slow in the beginning, stalked along the rail, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ARMAGNAC broke alertly to take the early lead, led two wide through the clubhouse turn, moved to the inside and saved ground around the second bend,
was urged right-handed while drifting out in the furlong grounds and remained clear to the wire. PIROLI bumped SOUTH STREET leaving the gate, showed
early speed and ceded command around the first turn, stalked the leader three then two wide to the stretch, lacked the needed late punch to overtaken the
winner but was clearly second best. SOUTH STREET stumbled and bumped with inside rival at the start, rushed up on the heels of the leader into the first
turn, drifted out on the backstretch, traveled five then four wide on the second bend and bested the rest. KEROUAC was off slow to begin, angled in on the
first turn, moved out on the backstretch, nearing the far turn, went four then three wide around the bend and weakened. CORSICA FLAVOR got floated out
a bit on the first turn, carried out wider from the five-eighths pole to the nine-sixteenths, steered inside that rival and moved to the rail, saved ground around
the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BADGER KITTEN unhurried in the beginning from inside, moved out to the two path in the middle stages, waited for room on the far turn then swung out
into the stretch, surged to the front and kicked clear. WHISTLER'S STYLE got bumped and shuffled between rivals early, trailed up the backstretch, swung
six wide leaving the far turn, rallied and got up for second. ST HELENA pressed the pace early then went up to duel for command, took over at the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the lane, was overtaken midstretch and got edged for second. CHEERFUL CHARM was off a bit slow to begin, bumped
with inside rival early, stalked in the two path then between rivals, tipped three wide leaving the far turn and lacked a late bid. PISTACHIO PRINCESS
stalked the pace from inside, tipped two wide entering the stretch and flattened out late. ZAHRA was off a bit slow and got bumped at the start, went three
deep around the clubhouse turn, sat off the pace outside a rival on the backstretch then went three around the far turn, angled into the two path leaving the
bend, steered out in upper stretch and could not rally. KEEP YOUR COIL took control early, dueled for command from inside up the backstretch, battled
around the far turn, then weakened down the lane. READY AT MIDNIGHT went four then three wide around the first turn, forwardly placed in the middle
stages outside the top pair, chased three wide into the second bend, got floated out five wide by the winner entering the stretch and weakened.
