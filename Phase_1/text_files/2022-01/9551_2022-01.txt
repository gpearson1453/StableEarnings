Footnotes
CALI BAY (IRE) was closest in pursuit, took the turn two wide, drew alongside past the eight pole and overhauled rival in the final sixteenth. TRAINER
PLEASE broke in and brushed rival at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, remained unchallenged to the stretch, got collared with a sixteenth
remaining and yielded to the winner. MAGIC MAN was rated along the inside through the early stages, remained along the fence in the drive and lacked the
needed late kick. AIR FORCE RED got brushed at the start, steadied between foes early, traveled two wide then angled out in upper stretch and put in a
mild late bid. SANTOS TO WILSON pulled and steadied off heels between rivals early, chased two wide through the turn and could not rally.
HOUNDSTOOTH was off slow to begin, stalked three wide around the turn, then weakened in the stretch run. RACKATAPTAP got brushed and crowded at
the start, stumbled and jumped the dirt crossing early, trailed up the backstretch, raced two wide into the turn then moved to the rail and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DREAM PRINCESS was hard to load prior to the start, stalked the lone leader through the early stages, made a swift move from outside with five-sixteenths
remaining, took control and kicked clear late on the turn, then drew off under urging and coasted in late. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH settled on the inside, tipped
out nearing the stretch and bested the rest. FOR THE GOOD TIMES tracked off the rail, exited the far turn three wide and was along for the show.
NAUGHTY EVELYN sped clear to establish the front, remained in front to the far turn, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole and faded. BASIL
FLAVOR traveled along the rail into the first turn then angled out from behind a rival and went four wide into the backstretch, remained off the rail trailing the
field, came three wide into the drive and tired.

CLASSICAL ROMANCE fanned four wide entering the first turn, angled down to the two path, settled off the pace, closed in on the second bend, took aim
two wide entering the stretch, drew alongside with a furlong to go and drew clear late. ICE COLD GOLD sped to the front from inside, inched away and
padded the lead, challenged by the winner with a furlong left to run and yielded in deep stretch. HARDDIANE stumbled leaving the gate, chased in the two
path and weakened. K P KRYPTON went five wide into the turn then angled down to the rail around the bend, chased along the inside under coaxing into
the far turn but started to weaken, eased in the lane and walked off. HEAVEN'S GHOST up close three deep on the first turn, dropped back to trail on the
backstretch, angled to the inside for the second bend, fell back further and was eased in the lane and walked off. COLORATURA was off slow from outside,
went up outside the field to race six wide into the first turn, angled down to the four path around the bend, was forwardly placed from outside on the
backstretch, tired on the far turn, eased and walked across the wire and walked off following the race.

Footnotes
SUITE MADAM BLUE came away a step slow, went up inside and cleared the field, cut the corner into the lane, drew away in upper stretch and remained
strong to the wire. PLUM SEXY broke a step slow from inside, saved ground around the bend, steered out in the lane and closed well for the place honors.
PHILLY LISHES was brushed from outside leaving the gate, showed early speed then chased the leader off the inside, angled to the rail for the turn, saved
ground into the stretch and could not find the late kick necessary in the final furlong. SPANISH CHANNEL bumped inner rival at the start, angled in leaving
the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, got floated out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SHE LOVES KARAOKE got pinballed between
rivals at the start, stalked off the rail or outside a rival, went two wide around the turn and faded.

HOLDEN THE LUTE set the pace in the two path through the turns, roused in upper stretch, urged right-handed in the furlong grounds and held well.
IMPOSSIBLE TASK was closest in pursuit early on, went three wide into the far turn, got floated out a bit into the stretch, chased the winner through the
final furlong and gained ground late. DIRECT LINE came away slow, bumped with OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) early, settled in the two path, steered out widest in
the middle stages, went four wide through the second bend and rallied late to be finishing best of all. RONAMO was off slow from inside, stalked along the
rail, angled three wide leaving the second bend, moved inward in the stretch and faltered in the late stages. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) was off slow slow to
begin, bumped with rival prior to the first turn, went four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, dropped back on the second bend and tired.

Footnotes
BARRAZA went up to vie for the lead from inside, inched ahead near the half-mile pole, cleared into the turn, put to right-handed urging in the lane and
inched away. COMMANDER (FR) stalked the pace from inside, tipped two wide exiting the turn, chased the winner through the furlong grounds and had to
settle for second best. COMRADERY (IRE) broke a bit slow, steered to the inside, entered the stretch a bit off the rail, moved out and bested the rest.
BORDER TOWN raced in range early on from off the rail, went three wide into the bend, got floated five wide leaving the turn and could not rally. VANZZY
settled off the pace, checked off heels at the three-eighths pole, entered the lane four wide and never made an impact. CHAOS THEORY broke slow from
inside, was a bit rank early on, had to steady behind a rival at the three-eighths and steer four wide, maneuvered to the rail around the turn and was not a
factor. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) vied for the lead between foes early, pressed leaving the backstretch, chased the winner around the turn, drifted out
leaving the turn, traveled between foes with a furlong remaining and weakened. WESTON broke alertly, bobbled crossing the dirt surface, vied three deep
for command, chased leaving leaving the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and tired.

HAPPY JACK tracked off the rail, went two wide around the turn, rallied inside the top pair and drove clear. BLETCHLEY PARK stalked the duo up the
backstretch, went three wide around the turn, bid from outside in midstretch and got outkicked by the winner. MIDNIGHT FURY got bumped leaving the
gate, dueled for command from outside, cleared inner rival leaving the turn and yielded in the final sixteenth. VITTORO broke a bit slow, dropped back early,
saved ground inside, steered out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally. HAPPY RUNNER stumbled and bumped inner runner leaving the gate,
chased under coaxing early on, moved to the inside for the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and faltered in the final furlong. CLASSIC
MARK broke slow, went three deep and between rivals into the turn, got shuffled back at the three-eighths pole, exited the bend two wide and failed to
menace. SENSE OF DOMINANCE dueled for the lead from inside, lost contact leaving the turn and weakened down the lane. BEAUTIFUL ART came away
slow, went four then three wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SUNDOWN WARREN broke a step slow, steadied on the inside to avoid a shuffle early, pulled around the first turn, up the backstretch to the three-eighths
pole, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, reeled in the frontrunner and took over late and prevailed over the runner-up. SWEET SAVANT was
fractious in the gate, traveled along the inside, coaxed with five-sixteenths remaining, rallied up the inside and missed. LOOKOUT POINT went four wide
early on the first turn then angled to the rail while at the back, went between foes on the far turn, raced in a bit tight at the quarter pole and paused
momentarily, moved out in the stretch and rallied for the show. MO THEM DOWN dueled for command from inside, cleared approaching the five-sixteenths
pole, drew away in upper stretch but weakened late. ITS BIG angled out from behind rival into the three path on the first turn, traveled near the back outside
a rival, lacked room behind rivals and angled in on the far turn, kept on through the lane to improve position while tipping out late. EGOMANIA stalked two
wide, three wide into the far turn, lacked room behind MISSING MAURICE who was dropping back, moved into the two path and lacked a rally. BALDORO
settled outside a rival, angled four wide on the far turn and lacked further response. MISSING MAURICE dueled for command from outside, lost contact with
rival around the second bend, entered the stretch three wide and faded.
