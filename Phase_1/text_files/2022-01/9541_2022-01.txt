LIGHT AS A WHISPER vied for the early advantage, dueling with ZEATRICAL throughout, was all out and just held on for the win. MARILYN'S MAGIC void
of early speed, moved up around the final turn, rallied down the home stretch, split rivals and needed more ground, just missed. ZEATRICAL challenged on
the front end, dueled throughout and was outfinished by the top two. OLD TIME GIRL raced within striking distance and faded. IT'S TIME BABY lacked early
speed, came around the final turn wide and put forth an even effort. YOUR MEMORY raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn
and faded. TAP YOUR FRONT always raced near the back and showed little.

HONORING MAJOR broke out, quickly moved up, racing behind the leaders, stalked the leaders until the final turn, took command and was going away at
the end. GREELEY'S DEALER lacked early speed, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but was an easy second. HIGH CRUISE sprinted to
the front, saved ground, proved no match late for the top two, but held on for show. LATE NITE MISCHIEF pressed the early pace and weakened. POST
CLOSE raced near the back, put forth an even effort and was outrun. BAJAN CASH hopped at the start, raced in the back, came around the second turn
four wide and was never a threat.

VALLEJO raced in the back in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out, made a bid, split rivals deep in the stretch and proved the
best. VALID BREAK vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, came around the turn four wide, proved no match for the winner, but held on for
second. MISS DARLENE broke poorly, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally and just missed second. TWN MS
MIDSHIP dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and lacked a late kick. BRAVE CITY GIRL hopped outward, bumped rival, challenged for
early lead, raced close throughout and lacked a finish. CRYPTO BRAVE dueled for the early advantage and faded. SANDRA'S JUEL bumped start, raced
near the back and was never a threat.
