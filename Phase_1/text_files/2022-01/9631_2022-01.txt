Footnotes
VOLTE FACE raced off the pace outside, came under a drive near the half-mile pole, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the
lane and was up and clear late. LOVE IN PARADISE settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, took over leaving the quarter
pole, drew clear nearing the eighth pole but could no resist the winner late. GOGEES disputed the pace inside, could not keep pace nearing the quarter
pole, tipped out in upper stretch and churned on for the show. TEMPESTUOUS vied three wide down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, angled
in nearing the lane, continued on the left lead and tired. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM played no factor while racing three wide. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN chased
the pace three wide and was through after a half. SEND D PACKAGE was always outrun. TOYI vied between foes down the backstretch then retreated
inside after a half.

Footnotes
BAM BAM BLU bumped with rival at the start then steadily edged up closer entering the turn, took command three wide approaching the head of the lane,
stayed sharp under right handed encouragement and finished going away. NO COMMISSION came away last at the start, continued in the back and angled
inside leaving the backstretch, angled out and launched a bid mid-way through the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response and
cleared second best. BEINFUN was ridden along in steady pursuit, came five wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and captured a share. MONY
chased the embattled duo in early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane and needed more for impact. MILITARY DRILL dueled outside of
EMICRACK for the lead out of the gate, battled on around the turn, got overtaken by the winner at the head of the lane and gave way. EMICRACK (CHI)
bumped with the winner at the start, dueled inside of MILITARY DRILL in opening stages, matched strides through the turn, was no match when the winner
took over top stretch and steadily weakened.

Footnotes
MAIN EVENT got clear before reaching the first turn, rated along inside to the stretch, and held well to remain in command. EGYPTIAN GOD (IRE) saved
ground to midway on the far turn before shifting two wide, moved back in for the drive and finished with good energy to be clearly second best. MEN ON
THE HILL (IRE) raced close up inside from the start, briefly attempted to get through inside the pacesetter midway on the far turn but lacked clearance,
remained on hold past the quarter-pole, shifted out with a clear shot into the lane, but lacked the needed kick. CELESTIAL CITY raced three wide on the
turns in range, and lacked a final bid. NATIVE THUNDER bumped with CHELSEA DAGGER at the start, was bottled up in and among horses first time
through the stretch, and never factored. GENERAL'S DUTY was outrun inside. CHELSEA DAGGER bumped with NATIVE THUNDER at the start, was in
traffic behind and between horses through the stretch the first time, and was finished early. SUL PHAROAH chased outside MAIN EVENT for six furlongs,
and tired. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
DOLL BABY set the pace two wide, drew off entering the turn, set the pace in the two path from there and held safe under a drive. CATICHE chased the
pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to narrow the gap. MISS YEARWOOD saved ground off the pace, angled three wide
approaching the eighth pole and rallied outside. FROZEN SOLID chased the winner three and four wide and faded nearing the lane. DESERT DALLIANCE
had early speed inside of the winner, chased in the two path around the turn and tired inside in the lane. RELAXATION was off slow and outrun inside.
MANNHAL stumbled at the start, was never close, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
QUEEN CALYPSO was in a bit tight between foes in early stages then remained patiently handled around the turn, swung wide into the upper stretch,
rallied along the far outside, raced in tandem with FILLMORE EAST in final stages and approaching the wire. FILLMORE EAST was not too far back along
the outside, circled up closer late on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, steadily edged up closer racing in tandem with QUEEN CALYPSO and got
denied in final strides. TIDAL WATERS raced two wide up close then split foes mid-way through the turn and dueled outside of T. WALTZ, battled back into
the upper stretch, shook clear with a furlong left to run then got overtaken by outside duo in deep stretch. FOR EVER OURS briefly waited inside then tipped
to the two path moving through the turn, launched a bid three wide at the head of the lane, gained closer contention a furlong out then finished evenly.
CHEROKEE CHATTER got in tight along the rail mid-way through the turn, waited in traffic then hustled up two wide between foes in the upper stretch,
showed interest then had no closing response. BROADWAY PEGGY raced four wide in contention around the turn, sustained bid in the upper stretch then
gave way. T. WALTZ held a slim lead in opening stages, met bid midway around the turn, battled back for the lead into the upper stretch then came up
empty. BELLA SOFI showed response in opening stages then weakened mid-way around the turn. SPEEDY FIRE got bumped back at the start, raced in
the back, saved ground around the turn and never menaced.

Footnotes
BESIDE HERSELF took control after the start, rated along through leisurely fractions, and had ample reserves to remain well clear through the lane.
WONKA raced close up inside for six furlongs, shifted to the three-path coming off the far turn, overhauled MESAORIA for second in deep stretch but never
menaced the winner. MESAORIA bumped with PUBLIC SERVICE at the start, prompted the pace outside BESIDE HERSELF to upper stretch, and
weakened. UGHROUDA settled in the middle of the field toward the inside for six furlongs, and lacked a late response. HARDSPUN WOMAN saved ground
to the far turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and made no impact. AMUNET raced three wide on the turns, and tired after six furlongs.
LAVISH HABITS was three wide early, and never made her presence felt. PUBLIC SERVICE bumped with MESAORIA at the start, moved up mildly three
wide after six furlongs, then gave way. ATHENAIS trailed outside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

RACE DAY SPEED pressed the pace two wide, took the lead at the three-eighths pole, vied between foes the rest of the turn, dueled inside of LAVI through
the lane and dug in gamely to prevail. LAVI stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and was denied.
DON'T GET KHOZY raced off the pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn and had a mild stretch rally for the show. DEM A WONDER was
fractious in the gate, hesitated at the start, became rank and rushed up four wide down the backstretch, bid four wide between foes nearing the lane then
faded through the stretch. OUR FANTASY chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the pace along the rail, yielded near
the three-eighths pole and tired.

Footnotes
COLERIDGE was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried while saving ground up the backstretch, angled out mid-way around the far turn,
swung into action five wide entering the upper stretch, rallied while moving inward and surged clear. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE was forwardly placed
around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, headed in pursuit leaving the far turn, sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane
and got up late to take place. SOSUA SUMMER sped to the lead and angled inside around the first turn, set the pace near the inside up the backstretch,
given cue entering the lane, remained clear past the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner and lost place in final strides. CURBSTONE settled
inside near midpack up the backstretch, picked up the pace mid-way around the far turn, shifted out four wide in the upper stretch and failed to kick on.
BANDIMERE was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pace through early stages, tipped out three wide and headed in pursuit top stretch,
sustained bid to the furlong marker then flattened out. RIDEWITHTHEDEVIL was reserved racing in back along the outside, was ridden along four wide into
the lane, angled in a couple paths under pressure and lacked a needed rally. FLASH FROST raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around
the far turn and had no response. CELESTIAL GLAZE tracked the pace up the backstretch and tired in the drive. CONNECTED was allowed to settle
through early stages and came up empty around the far turn. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
UNPRECEDENTED sped clear early while kept well off the rail, remained with a daylight advantage into the final furlong, and held INDY LYON at a safe
distance late. INDY LYON saved ground in midpack to midway on the turn, moved to the two-path coming to the top of the stretch, and finished well to close
the gap. CUY chased from close range two wide to the turn, moved to the rail for the drive and lacked the needed bid. TROPICAT raced three to four wide
in the second flight for three furlongs, and offered a mild response to get the last major share. FRENCHMEN STREET never factored through an inside trip.
SELF TAUGHT raced three wide around the turn, and had no rally. MISTER KELLY bumped with BAILEY a stride out of the gate, pursued the winner from
outside for three-eighths of a mile, and tired. BAILEY bumped with MISTER KELLY just after the break, and trailed two wide.

Footnotes
SKYRO prompted the pace two wide, closed determinedly, was brushed late and was up in the final strides. MID DAY IMAGE set the pace along the rail,
drifted out a bit in upper stretch, drifted out under right-handed urging in deep stretch, brushed with the winner and was caught in the final strides. CALL
CURT stalked the pace from the rail, had a clear path throughout the stretch but lacked the needed rally. EAMONN was in range while racing two wide and
was one-paced through the lane. RISK MANAGER raced four wide in midpack, edged closer four deep rounding the far turn but faded in the lane. CATCH
THAT PARTY failed to menace while racing three wide. GINSBURNED hit the starting gate and was sluggish early, trailed inside for six furlongs, swung out
in upper stretch and passed some tiring rivals. LEASE steadied entering the first turn, saved ground and never threatened. KOBLA MAS was shuffled back
early, saved ground and made little impact. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) was in range three wide and came up empty in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND
TIMED. FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER raced under a snug hold and rated just off the early pace, began to edge up closer late on the far turn, swung into action five wide
into the lane, dug in under firm handling and got up in final strides. FARLEY was forwardly placed heading into the backstretch then edged up to duel
entering the far turn, battled on gamely into the final furlong, briefly shook clear then got caught by the winner. BENEFACTOR raced up close around the
first turn, dueled outside of CPTAIN THUNDER up the backstretch, continued to match strides with FARLEY into the lane, stayed on gamely into the final
sixteenth then lacked closing kick. UHTRED rated between foes near midpack up the backstretch, launched a bid approaching the upper stretch, dug in
three path under firm handling, edged up into closer then flattened in deep stages. DRILLOMATIC was unhurried and raced off the pace, was ridden along
four wide into the lane, angled inside in late stages and improved position. MIRACLE SILVER tracked outside up the backstretch, moved up three wide to
race in striking distance late on the far turn, raced in tight between rivals midway through the stretch and gave way. DEVOTED KITTEN tracked the pace
inside through early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn and steadily weakened. BUFFALO MAX raced in the back, swung wide
into the upper stretch and passed tiring foes. HERE COMES BULLET was headstrong, tugged through the first turn and into the backstretch then settled
and saved ground, shifted out around the far turn and failed to move on. CAPTAIN THUNDER held a slim lead around the first turn, dueled through the
backstretch and came up tired with a quarter mile remaining. LUCAS N' LORI was not too far back while rated outside up the backstretch then came up
empty on the final turn.
