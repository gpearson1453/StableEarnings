Footnotes
STEALING APRIORITY settled off of the pace along the inside, gained in upper stretch before tipping outside of the leading trio at the furlong grounds,
surged in the final sixteenth to reach PERFECT PERIGEE on the wire, but came in and bumped that foe in the process. PERFECT PERIGEE stalked three
wide, bid turning for home, forged ahead a sixteenth from home, but was bumped by an outer foe while getting nailed on the wire. CUSTOM SIERRA set the
pace inside of a vying LOUISIANA THUNDER, dug in to resist PERFECT PERIGEE's bid in upper stretch, but gave way to that foe at the sixteenth pole,
then just saved show. P T'S FLASH saved ground far off of the pace, rallied along the rail through the lane, but just missed reaching an outer foe for show.
LOUISIANA THUNDER vied two wide, then from between horses entering the lane, but yielded. BRAD EYE tracked outside of a foe while in the four to five
path around the turn, but failed to factor. BROOK IS GOLDEN raced in midpack inside of a rival while in the three to four path around the turn, and tired.
BARREL OF BOURBON broke outwardly, and never got involved. SHACKLE THE GOLD was outrun. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
CLOSING STAGES, STEALING APRIORITY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
CURTIN'S UP sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path while meeting W W KAN DO's bid approaching the five sixteenths, repelled that drifting
foe entering the lane, dug in to meet HERE COMES KYLE's bid in the final furlong, and held to the wire. HERE COMES KYLE saved ground off of the pace,
shifted to the three path and outside of a clear CURLIN'S UP in upper stretch, crept closer to bid at the sixteenth pole, but was denied. DEANO laid at the
rear two wide, improved inside of foes turning for home and entering the lane, and chased the leaders evenly through the final furlong. W W KAN DO
stalked two wide, ranged up outside of the leader to attempt a bid at the five sixteenths pole, but drifted to the five path entering the lane, and tired. TALE
OF A STORM chased three wide, but faltered outside of foes around the turn.

CRYPTOZONIC vied along the inside of a pair of rivals early on before rating back to stalk into the turn, tipped two wide and between horses passing the
quarter pole, only managed to chase the clear leader through midstretch, but inched closer as that foe tired in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage
on the wire. AW SHUCKS vied two wide and between horses down the backstretch, then only inside of ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE around the turn, shook
clear passing the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire. RAHFEES MAN stalked two wide, then
three wide and between horses entering the lane, and chased the leaders home evenly. TOO MUCH BOURBON raced off of the pace three wide, gained
turning for home while shifting five wide, but flattened out through the lane. ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE vied for the lead three to two wide into the turn, but
drifted four wide entering the lane before weakening. SR. CLARKY was adjusting his head when the gates opened and hopped at the start, spotted the field
multiple lengths in the process, then was outrun. RUN AWAY SON laid off of the pace along the inside under steady urging, swung six wide entering the
lane, and tired.

SARIAH SARIAH broke outwardly, recovered to set the pace into the first turn, inched clear from a pressing foe entering the lane, and held sway.
CARSON'S PRINCESS stalked two wide, chased the leader turning for home, and was second best. PERFECT DIVA hopped slightly at the start, tracked
her rivals, attempted a mild bid three wide around the far turn, but tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TOUCHDOWN JOE tracked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole, and forged an advantage late. BIG
SCULLY was briefly fractious in the starting gate, stalked along the inside, chased outside of the clear leader through upper stretch, kept on to bid for the
lead at the sixteenth pole as an outer TOUCHDOWN JOE did the same, but got outfinished. CUSTOM BOBBY'S set a clear pace around both turns, but
hung on his left lead through the lane, and weakened inside of a pair of rivals at the sixteenth pole. YOUR TIME'S COMING settled far off of the pace two
wide improved in the four path and outside of foes around the far turn, and stayed on for a minor share. DEER CROSSING laid off of the pace two wide,
shifted out down the backstretch, took the far turn in the five path far off of the pace, and failed to factor. CHROMPTON saved ground at the rear of the field,
but to no avail. LAURI'S WISH broke outwardly while off slowly, raced off of the pace three wide, but faded around the far turn. REAL CITY SPEED stalked
two wide, but weakened around the far turn, was eased through the lane, jogged across the wire, and walked off.

EXCELLENCY stalked along the inside, tipped three wide entering the lane, rallied to bid passing the furlong grounds, and edged an advantage in the final
sixteenth. COURTHOUSE COVE bumped an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, dug in as EXCELLENCY bid inside the final furlong, but
was bested approaching the wire. WHISKEY GENT bumped an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace two wide, chased the leader entering the lane, but
was outkicked by an outer foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and tired in the final furlong. BALTIC FLEET broke a bit outwardly and raced off of the pace
three wide into the turn, gained turning for home, but drifted four wide entering the lane, flattened out in upper stretch, and tired. CHOPPED took bumps
from rivals on either side at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SNOW CANDY was forced a bit outwardly while breaking slowly,
trailed the field two to three wide into the turn, and failed to make an impact. HENDERSON raced off of the pace two wide, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pressing rival entering the lane, drew off at the furlong grounds, and was
driven home to seal the deal. FREUDIAN stalked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, pressed the leader turning for home, but only managed
to chase through upper stretch before failing to keep pace passing the furlong pole, and was second best. TWIN CAUSE trailed in the five path around the
first turn, then off of the pace two wide around the far turn, and improved in inside of foes in upper stretch. SHE'S CUSTOM MADE tracked three wide,
inched closer while shifting four wide entering the lane, then faded in upper stretch. C C'S COWGIRL laid off of the pace four wide around the first turn, and
failed to make an impact. DRESSEDTOIMPRESS saved ground off of the pace, but tired. VERDANDI stalked two wide, then three wide around the far turn,
but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
RUNNINGINTHEMONEY took a bump from an outer rival soon after the start, set the pace inside of that foe while staying in the two path around the turn,
inched clear in upper stretch, and held sway on his left lead. EDDIE'S HUMOR raced far off of the pace two wide, split foes four wide in upper stretch, and
rallied to prove second best. BASTI BLUE leaned outwardly to regain balance at the start, stalked two wide, then three wide entering the lane, chased the
clear leader from between horses, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, then dead-heated for show. ITS WILD AGAIN broke slowly but
avoided trouble by doing so, saved ground far off of the pace, improved inside of foes at the quarter pole, then chased two wide and between horses while
hanging on his left lead, and dead-heated for show. BIG BOO tracked from midpack along the inside early on, shifted three wide into the turn, fanned six
wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick to bid. DONT CROSS EL HEFE stalked along the inside, chased while aiming to bid inside of the leader in upper
stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds. AUTUMN'S SUPER CED raced off of the pace two to four wide, shifted six wide entering the lane, and faded.
RENATI broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, vied for the lead two wide while in the three path, but drifted out to the five path while weakening
entering the lane. THAT ONE GUITAR showed little.
