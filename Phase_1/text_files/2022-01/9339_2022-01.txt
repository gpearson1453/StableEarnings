Footnotes
MAOTAI never far back to far turn, rallied into stretch, long drive. QUIERO MAS stayed close to the stretch, short lead, outfinished to wire. ETHERIC no
speed to far turn, angled in sharply stretch, just got show. BELLA RUNNER raced between horses to the half while evenly with no late kick. THEFABULOUS
MOOLAH never varied throughout. DANCIN DEE dueled leader to far turn, gave way grudgingly late. HEAVENLY HELLOS speed to duel inside to deep
stretch, faltered in late going. TWO FOR ONE never menaced. CLAIRE JUNE failed to contend. DANIELLA'S CAUSE stumbled after the start, never a
threat. JACCACI good position from inside while tracking, backed up from the turn. THAT'S SO FROSTY never threatened.
