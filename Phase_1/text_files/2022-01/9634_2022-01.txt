Footnotes
HANEY BOYS broke alertly, raced closest to the leader off the inside, stalked that one up the backstretch, took over midway on the final turn in the two path,
extended drive, enough left late to hold the next two safe. LOVING LUCKY off a step slow, continued to race devoid of foot for five furlongs, split foes when
beginning to advance late in the final turn, rallied up the rail to finished willingly and to be getting to the winner late. KNIEVEL lacked speed off the inside,
briefly lacked clear room in traffic into the far turn, advance on the winner from the outside soon after, pressed that one through upper stretch but did not
have enough for that one or the runner up in the waning strides. UNCLE MO'S CAT shuffled a bit in early traffic past the wire the first time, settled in mid
pack, steadied in tight quarters entering the far turn, recovered and improved into the lane, flattened out the final furlong. REMEMBER NORMANDY broke
with the field, fell back while rank into the first turn, moved out and raced four out to five wide into the lane, improved out in the middle of the strip while not a
serious threat. SERBIAN SAILOR carried out four wide into the first turn, continued off the inside, failed to muster a rally. BIG PETE used early, cleared into
the first turn, showed the way into the first turn, continued set the pace the middle half, gave way when headed by the winner in the second turn. PLENTY
OF CENTS carried out five wide into the first turn when with the second flight, three to four wide in the second bend, lacked closing response. OR'EFFICE
came out to be three wide and carry a couple of foes out into the first turn, raced forwardly the middle part then stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SPURWINK LANE away in good order, dueled up the backstretch inside and into the turn, edged away from the other speed past the furlong marker,
maintained daylight late under steady handling. VERY SPICY lacked early foot off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, came back out when
straightened for home, slow gain on the winner late while fully extended to preserve the place spot. FLASHY BIZ also raced back off the early pace, saved
ground through the turn, finished willingly while remaining inside to be getting to the runner up late. UNHERDOF one paced off the inside, three wide into
the lane, lacked a closing punch to finish up evenly. GRAPEVINE dueled up front outside the winner, could not keep pace with that one nearing the furlong
marker, weakened late to lose position. TOMS MAXIMILLIAN in mid pack while well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the
stretch. WICKED STREET forwardly placed in chasing the dueling leaders for a half in the two path, had little left for the drive. SPILLED PERFUME void of
early foot, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. FAST SOPHIA came out early to bother an outer rival, failed to menace. MISS
ALLIE GRACE was bothered just after the start, trialed early and was never involved. DO ME A FAVOR settled off the early pace while three wide, began a
steady fade before a half. BABY CLOUD off the pace while five wide turn, gave way drive, jogged in well back.

Footnotes
SMOKIN BOOTS unhurried in the early going, began to advance while four wide far turn, closest to the leader turning for home, kicked down that foe late
under firm handling. LUCKS BIG BOY broke on top, well clear through the first turn, continued to show the way by a considerable margin while toward the
inside, caught late, remained far clear of the others. JACKS SPRING BREAK settled off the pace toward the inside, chased the leader up the backstretch
and into the far turn, had little for that one or the winner in the drive, narrowly lasted for the show. SOUTHERN PECAN lacked early foot, saved ground into
and through the final turn, improved into the lane, continued up the rail to narrowly miss the show. RISKY SITUATION settled off the pace and the inside,
went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. TAPPED OUT off a step slow, raced well back and inside early, continued to save ground through
the second turn, improved position up the rail with some belated interest. CYBER MONDAY raced in mid pack while off the inside, came five wide into the
lane, failed to better his position while remaining well out in the strip. RIANTE SKY steadied in tight quarters just after the start, raced back and off the
inside, came five wide into the lane, improved a bit upper stretch, no real threat. PURE IRON void of speed, never a threat. PACIFIC HARBOR mid pack
toward the inside, had nothing for the drive. WOFFORD restless in the gate prior to the start, chased the runner up early, stopped, finished far back.
MAPACHE MAN came in just after the break, raced forwardly early and outside, began to give way before a half, pulled up second turn and into the stretch,
vanned off.

Footnotes
NIC AND ZOE with the pace from the start after an alert break, dueled into and through the turn, shook off the other speed and a second rival turning for
home, enough left to hold off the runner up late. GHAALEB THE GREAT bothered then bobbled just after the start, moved up to race in the second flight
while between horses turn, shifted out a bit for the drive and finished up willingly to be getting to the winner from the outside. INVALUABLE broke out,
bothered foe, off the early pace, shuffled back along the inside early in the turn, steered out to be three wide into the lane, along for the show while not a
threat to the top pair. NORTHERN DIAMOND behind the pace while moving out three wide early in the turn, advanced and loomed a threat three wide
exiting the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. KAY BEE GEE lacked early foot, raced four wide through the turn, failed to mount a serious bid in
the drive. TEENAGE KICKS in the second flight while racing three wide, failed to respond in the drive as well. CANADIAN GINGER dueled up front inside
the winner for a half and then caved in entering the stretch. KEWPIE DOLL finished early, fell further and further back, distanced after losing contact with the
field, jogged in.

Footnotes
CAN IMAGINE broke on top, set the pace just off the inside through the first turn and onto the backstretch, rated up the backstretch, shook clear in upper
stretch the had enough left late to hold off the runner up. FLATOUT WINNER in the second flight just off the inside early, between foes through the second
bend, shifted out a bit for the drive and finished willingly to be getting to the winner late while widest of the lead flight at the wire. RESTORING HOPE moved
up after the start to prompt the issue through the first turn three wide, closer before a half, proved stubborn in the drive. FOXY ACE dueled early inside the
winner, fell back off that one after a quarter, crept closer while continuing to save ground, in tight turning for home, moved out a bit for the drive, went evenly
to the wire. STOCK DEAL lacked speed, raced in the two path through the second turn, also went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response.
EGOMANIAC in mid pack off the inside, three out to four wide second turn, lacked a rally as well. MAJOR KONG void of speed, saved ground most of the
way, improved position with some mild late interest. REVENIO five wide into the first turn when off the pace, four wide through the second bend, set down,
little in the way of a response. GRAND DESIGN in the second flight for six furlongs, tired in the drive. RIVER FINN a bit rank while working way out a bit in
some traffic late in the first turn, continued in the second group outside, four wide through the final turn then backed up through the stretch. GAINER off a
step slow, raced well back as a result, five wide through the second turn, remained back in the run to the wire. TOOBADSOSAD was finished after a half,
trailed home.

Footnotes
NEWS BOX stalked the early leader outside up the backstretch, moved closer while remaining in the three path turn, engaged that rival from the outside
nearing the furlong grounds, put a head in front then kicked clear. TOMATO BILL broke alertly, vied early outside, got clear into the turn, two to three path
through the bend, responded briefly when the winner came alongside with less than a furlong remaining then proved no match. KIERKEGAARD void of
early foot off the inside, four to five wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip to be along for the show, not a threat to the top pair.
PRAETORIAN lacked speed outside, four down to three wide through the turn, improved to be closest to the top two with a furlong to run, also proved no
match for that duo, caught late for 6the show. WHENTHEDOVESCRY one paced in the two path, dropped to the inside for room late in the turn, continued
evenly through the stretch. MR. DOUGIE FRESH in the second group early inside, fell back turn, failed to launch a bit in the stretch. BOURBON COWBOY
lacked speed, raced four out to five wide exiting the turn, also was found lacking in the lane when called on. TWO DOT four wide throughout, was never
dangerous. SMARTY GRIMES brushed, in tight early, was never involved. POPIZAR jostled then steadied when also in tight just after the break, fell back to
trail, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. SMART TIME in mid pack early, fell back in some traffic late backstretch, remained there. TIME
HEIST vied early inside the runner up, stopped, trailed home.

Footnotes
RED QUEEN behind the pace inside, moved slightly closer through the second turn, slipped through along the rail inside the winner entering the stretch,
clear nearing midstretch, slight drift while being kept to task. PURRFECT MISTRESS broke on top, set the pace in the two path, allowed the winner the
inside entering the stretch, briefly dueled then could not match strides, clearly second best. EMITYAAZ lacked early foot off the inside, continued three wide
up the backstretch, swung five wide into the lane, rallied to be clear of the others, no threat to the top two. BLAME NELLIE pressed the runner up to that
one's outside, continued force the issue three path through the final turn, weakened in the drive. UNDECODED within striking distance while five wide into
the first turn, stayed outside, four wide through the second bend then came up empty when called on for the drive. CLAY'S CLOUD BURST went one paced
throughout while racing toward the inside. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE six wide into the first turn, five wide the rest of the way, failed to rally when set down for the
drive. KEINO last to leave, raced back, four wide into the lane, failed to threaten. WILD BIZNESS broke back, trailed most of the way and was never a
factor. BEYOND THE HYPE forwardly early, fell back before a half, jogged in well back.

Footnotes
RICHNESS away in good order, stalked the pace off the inside, roused for the drive, collared the leader nearing the furlong marker and drove well clear.
TAPIT RIGHT lacked early foot, moved outside, raced five wide into the bend, six wide exiting, rallied to be clear for the place while not a threat to the
winner. UNBRIDLED TWISTER in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide through the turn, went evenly in improving for the show stretch, no match
top two. GUEST IN MY HEART broke back, lacked speed, improved while racing in the two path late in the turn, not a serious threat. WILLOW MOON back
off the early pace, angled out four to five wide turning for home when improving a bit upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. KELLY BE KRUSIN
off a step slow, well back early, came four wide out of the turn, improved position with some mild, belated interest. TRULY A ROCKET within striking
distance early while inside, continued to save ground turn, tired. OLIVIAN broke alertly, sprinted clear, maintained daylight for over a half, gave way when
headed by the winner nearing midstretch. BIG ON BROADWAY broke sharp, chased the early leader off the inside, began a steady fade after three
furlongs. LITTLE BURRITO back off the early pace, checked up along the rail into the turn, fell back and did not recover. DOLLY DIMPLE in the second
flight early outside, stopped for the drive.

Footnotes
SWEET TEA broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, given a bit of a breather in the turn, held the runner up at bay through the length of the stretch under
steady handling. MUN LUV broke outward but toward the front, chased the winner in vain in three path, could not get to that one in the final furlong, clearly
second best. CHURCH SERVICE off the early pace just off the inside, remained in the two path into the stretch, up late for the show. CANDYWRAPPER
CRAZY settled off the pace while outside, four wide through the turn, flat to the wire, caught late for the show. MIDNIGHT MISTRESS forwardly placed early
inside, tired in the drive. PRAY GLORIA off a step slow, raced back early, four wide when improving into the lane, failed to muster any late gain. ROMANTIC
COMEDY off a step slow, lacked speed, four wide late in the turn, made little impact through the stretch. TAP THE LINE void of any early foot, moved
outside and raced five out to six wide turn, lacked a response. MAGIC MAGS broke inward but with the field, fell back steadily, four wide into the lane,
showed little. MANDONA within striking distance off the inside, tired.
