Footnotes
MAJESTIC EDGE dueled on the front end, took command down the home stretch, was all out and held on well. WICKED FLASHBACK lacked early speed,
saved ground around the turn, made a late bid and was gaining on the winner. TEXAS MAMA raced near the middle of the field, came around the turn four
wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. DIXIELAND DREAM void of early speed, made a late gain and was outfinished
for third. UNTETHERED SOUL raced evenly near the back, came around the turn five wide and was no factor. RED RED WINE vied for the early advantage
and was finished early. GENTLEMEN'S GIRL pressed the early pace and dropped back. LUCKY EVERY DAY showed early speed and retreated.

Footnotes
VALID BREAK challenged for the early lead, drove clear and proved the best. SHANGHAI HETTY raced within contention, came around the turn three wide,
proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TINCANDANCE hesitated at the start, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn,
gained ground and finished willingly. JULIO CHOICE pressed the pace, weakened and finished evenly. IT'S TIME BABY void of early speed, showed late
interest, but was no factor. OKLAHOMA STAR vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn, steadied, getting in tight quarters and faded.
LAKE SENSE raced in the middle of the field and weakened. FALYN'S GOLD RULER lacked early speed and showed little. TARGET VISION raced in the
middle of the pack and dropped back. HONOR AND RESPECT broke in, raced near the back and was never a threat. THE JOCKEY OF #6 OKLAHOMA
STAR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #8 VALID BREAK FOR INTERFERENCE COMING OUT OF THE TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS
STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
