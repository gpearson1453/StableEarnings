Footnotes
GRACELEADSUSHOME dueled for the lead two wide, assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off through the final furlong. PINEAPPLE ALLEY
brushed an outer foe at the start, dueled inside of GRACELEADSUSHOME around the turn, but gave way in upper stretch, and safely held place. MYLIES
STAR saved ground in midpack, shifted to the three path turning for home, chased through upper stretch, then caught an outer tiring for foe show late.
BOSTON MILLIE bumped with an outer foe early on putting that rival into tight quarters, stalked along the inside into the turn, shifted outside of the leading
pair approaching the five-sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner shortly after, tired through the
final furlong, and lost show late. HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT tracked three wide, came under urging to secure position between horses into the turn, but was
floated four wide at the five sixteenths pole, and faded on his left lead through the lane. CANDY'S PRIDE took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start,
pressed the leading pair from the outside early on, but bore out to the five path into the turn, then yielded through the lane. CONSERVATVE VALUES
brushed the outer part of the gate at the start, laid off of the pace four wide, and failed to factor. DREWSILLA leaned inwardly at the start and bumped a foe,
raced off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, lugged in slightly from right handed urging in upper stretch, and failed to rally. MARDI GRAS
GORMLEY latched on to an inner foe in the opening furlong, then took back after being corrected off of that rival, and was outrun. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA
was very fractious loading, then was put to tight quarters between horses in the opening furlong, raced off of the pace two wide, and weakened.

Footnotes
GUNFIGHTER stalked comfortably along the inside, but was urged into the turn to keep position as his stable-mate bid for the lead, shifted off the rail
turning for home, chased two wide and between horses passing the quarter pole before shifting inside of the aforementioned leading rival at the three
sixteenths pole, then bid inside the final furlong, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and edged away. MAASAI WARRIOR stalked two wide, bid for the
lead at the three furlong pole, led turning for home, inched clear in upper stretch as rivals on both sides pursued, but was bested by his inner stable-mate at
the sixteenth pole. BON BUENO broke half a beat slowly, tracked the pace three wide, stalked behind the leading pair around the far turn before tipping
outside of them at the quarter pole, gained to attempt a bid in midstretch, but flattened out at the sixteenth pole. ART HEIST raced off of the pace along the
inside while a bit keen to place into the first turn, advanced inside of foes to midpack at the half mile pole, tracked around the far turn before shifting four
wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase evenly through midstretch. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR trailed into the far turn, took that bend four wide,
and moved up turning for home. ONE MORE BABY stuttered a step at the start, raced off of the pace three wide, but came under strong urging into the far
turn, and lacked a response. FULLY CONNECTED set the pace, met a bid into the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper
stretch. HALFMOON tracked from midpack two wide, but came under a drive between horses into the far turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
PIONEER OF MEDINA stumbled inconsequentially at the start, set the pace outside of ST ANDREWS into the first turn, cleared that foe but stayed in the
two path at the thirteen-sixteenths pole, showed the way comfortably inside of a pressing rival into the far turn, shifted to the three path approaching the
three-sixteenths after his outer counterpart weakened, met KEVIN'S FOLLY's bid in the process, then repelled that foe leaving the furlong grounds, inched
clear, and held sway. KEVIN'S FOLLY raced off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, gained in the four path and outside of the leading pair into
and around the far turn, bumped an inner weakening UNDERHILL'S TAB at the quarter pole before producing a bid in upper stretch, but was turned away
entering the final furlong, and saved place on the wire. STELLAR TAP brushed an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide, then from between horses into the
far turn, bumped with an outer weakening UNDERHILL'S TAB at the quarter pole, lacked a kick to bid between horses soon after, failed to keep pace with
the top pair passing the three-sixteenths, altered outside of them, and kept on through the late stages while hanging on his left lead, but missed reaching
place. ST ANDREWS was briefly restless waiting for other horses to load, vied along the inside into the first turn, but rated back to stalk approaching the
backstretch, then only managed to chase through the lane without bidding. ACHILLES HEEL bumped an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the
two path, came under urging into the far turn, but failed to make an impact. UNDERHILL'S TAB bumped an outer foe while brushing with an inner rival at the
start, stalked three wide, then pressed outside of the pace setter while in the three path passing the three quarter pole, but came under urging into the far
turn, chased between horses around that bend, then weakened entering the lane before being bumped and jostled in tight quarters between horses passing
the quarter pole. INDEFENSIBLE got a bit antsy in the gate, then showed little.

Footnotes
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) rated off of the pace two wide, tracked before gaining three wide around the far turn, split foes in the five path in midstretch, and surged
late to reach the leader on the wire. ARABIAN PRINCE showed the way early on, allowed an outer KOUFAX to go on into the first turn, stalked comfortably
along the inside, re-bid inside of that foe while in the two path at the three sixteenths pole inched clear at the furlong grounds, but was worn down late.
AMERICAN DIAMOND rated off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path among foes, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, split
foes at the furlong grounds while rallying on his left lead, and reach show on the wire. WIN WORTHY broke slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, rallied
along the rail to bid inside the final furlong, but flattened out in the final sixteenth, and got outfinished for show. PICKING ROSES raced far back in the three
to five paths around the turns, fanned to the nine path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, and kept on. CALL ME
PLUCKY tracked four to three wide around the first turn, vied two wide and between horses into and around the far turn before being floated back to the four
path in upper stretch, and yielded between horses through the final furlong. KOUFAX rushed to clear into the first turn, showed the way along the inside,
met a pair of bids into the far turn, shifted back to the three path entering the lane after being headed, vied in upper stretch after an inner foe bid, and
yielded between horses approaching the furlong grounds. SHARPENDUP tracked from the two to four path around the turns, and faded in midstretch.
EVIE'S PRINCE never got involved. NATHAN DETROIT broke a step slowly, and got outrun. NEW YEAR SURPRISE tracked three to four wide, gained
outside of foes to bid three wide into the far turn, briefly led at the five sixteenths, but weakened in the six path in upper stretch. WING COMMANDER
stalked three to two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL WATERS set a clear pace, widened his margin down the backstretch, then held sway through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, and
lasted safely as PIONEERING SPIRIT closed in late. PIONEERING SPIRIT raced off of the pace in the three to four paths around the first turn, inched
closer four wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, rallied to reach place at the furlong grounds, and was gaining on the clear leader late, but ran out
of ground. ALMANZO stalked the clear leader along the inside around the first turn, tipped to the two path entering the backstretch, chased that rival under
urging around the far turn, but failed to bid before being outkicked for place at the furlong grounds. MINNESOTA READY tracked two wide and between
horses around the first turn, backed off of those rivals into the backstretch before re-engaging them from the inside passing the five furlong pole, but failed to
sustain a bid through the lane. FENWICK tracked four wide, then three wide and from between horses around the far turn, bid for show entering the lane,
but flattened out. ICE BLAST broke inwardly and was off slowly, shifted from the two to three path around the first turn while off of the pace, tucked into the
far turn, but failed to factor. LUCKMAN hopped at the start while off slowly, lagged well behind the field while outside of a rival, and never got involved.
CRYPTIC CODE broke slowly, lagged well behind inside of another foe, and was outrun. KEEN HEIR stalked three to two wide, then from between horses
passing the five furlong pole, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
TIZ OF THEE set the pace in the two path, vied outside of MAZUMA after that foe made a rail bid into the far turn, briefly failed to keep pace with that foe
while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, but changed over at the furlong grounds, completed a re-bid shortly after, battled gamely between horses as
rivals bid on either side in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. HOGSLAYERS R I P tracked from midpack in the three to two paths, swung four wide entering
the lane while commencing a rally, lugged inside of a drifting foe approaching the final furlong, rallied to split the leaders through tight quarters in the final
sixteenth, but missed. MORE THAN WORK tracked four to two wide around the first turn, stalked behind the leading pair around the far turn, tipped outside
of them entering the lane, but drifted further out passing the three sixteenths, straightened and sustained a grinding challenge to bid in the final sixteenth,
but missed. MAZUMA broke a bit inwardly, stalked along the inside before bidding inside of the leader passing the half mile pole, vied before leading in
upper stretch, but tired inside of a trio of rivals in the final sixteenth. FAITH RUNNER saved ground in midpack, and chased evenly through the lane.
WARRIOR JOHNY broke a step slowly, took the first turn in the five path, advanced to midpack into the far turn, took that bend in the three path, but only
chased through the lane. WORDS OF WISDOM broke slowly and trailed the field, took the far turn four to five wide, and moved up. NAPA VALLEY steadied
in tight quarters between horses early on, raced off of the pace in the four to two paths around the turns, and failed to rally. SEEKING SPLENDOR raced far
back in the two path, and failed to factor. BAJ pressed the pace three wide, but faded around the far turn. CO CONSPIRATOR hopped at the start while off
slowly, and never got involved. SHOOT THEMESSENGER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MR. CUNNINGHAM stalked four wide, then
tracked in the three path into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. AFTERNOON ANEJO was wrangled back after breaking well, then got outrun.

Footnotes
HAZY COMMAND bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked the pace four wide, inched closer turning for home, took aim on a clear RATHER BE
LUCKY while claiming place at the sixteenth pole, and rallied to reach that foe on the wire. RATHER BE LUCKY set the pace along the inside, inched away
from chasing foes in upper stretch, but was worn down late, and got nailed on the wire. ELLE OF THE BALL stalked three wide, ranged up between horses
turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the pace-setter in upper stretch, chased thereafter and lost place at the sixteenth pole. ARI OAKLEY pressed
the pace setter from the outside, but only managed to chase that for through upper stretch before fading. CHROME RACER broke outwardly and bumped a
foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. SUPER FIRE raced off of the pace two
wide and between horses, and failed to factor. CLASSY MISS took a bump from rivals on both sides at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to
no avail. MERCY WARREN was off poorly while spotting the field multiple lengths, and got outrun. LADY ARSINOE raced off of the pace three to four wide,
and tired.

JUST MIGHT shoed the way early on, but came in and bumped COWAN into SIR ALFRED JAMES at the nine-sixteenths pole causing that rival to steady
hard against the rail, set the pace while a bit off of the rail around the turn, and inched away handily through the lane. COWAN got bumped by an outer
JUST MIGHT into an inner SIR ALFRED JAMES at the nine-sixteenths pole, stalked comfortably along the inside around the turn, gained place in upper
stretch as the leader scooted away, then chased that foe home to prove second best. STRIKE ME DOWN laid off of the pace in the three path around the
turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on outside of foes while hanging on his left lead to reach show approaching the wire. MR.
HUSTLE pressed outside of the leader around the turn, but faded in upper stretch, and lost show late. CLASSY JOHN tracked two wide, tipped three wide
entering the lane, but lacked rally. MANNY WAH took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, swung four wide entering the lane, but failed to make an
impact. FROSTED GRACE got outrun. SIR ALFRED JAMES laid close up inside of the leaders early on, but steadied hard after being bumped into the
railing by outer foes at the nine sixteenths pole, lost many lengths of position due to the incident, then saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, and
failed to re-rally. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS; INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE NINE-SIXTEENTHS POLE, JUST MIGHT WAS DISQUALIFIED
AND PLACED EIGHTH.

Footnotes
FEROCIOUSLY hopped a bit while breaking a step slowly at the start, rushed between horses soon after to vie for the lead outside of VINTAGE VINYL,
stayed a path away from that foe around the turn, forged an advantage turning for home, then drew clear at the furlong grounds. VINCO took a bump from
an outer BOSS' DIALIN IN and steadied approaching the five furlong pole, trailed the field around the turn before swinging to the five path entering the lane,
rallied while shifting inwardly approaching the final furlong, then surged between horses in the closing stages to reach place late. VINTAGE VINYL set the
pace inside of the eventual winner around the turn, battled with that foe through upper stretch, but gave way passing the furlong pole, tired, but saved show.
BOSS' DIALIN IN broke a bit inwardly, then bumped an inner foe approaching the five furlong pole, tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path entering
the lane, and chased the leaders home. GUNOE raced off of the pace in the five to six path around the turn, and kept on late. PLANTERS PUNCH pressed
outside of the leading pair into the turn, stalked from the four path around the bend, but faded in upper stretch. SMARTY JOHN stalked along the inside
while in the two path around the turn, then failed to bid. BLUE BONZAI brushed the outer part of the gate at the start, and never got involved. I'M YOUR
CAPTAIN laid off of the pace in the two path around the turn, but tired.

Footnotes
PASS THE PLATE steadied at the start after taking a bump from an inner foe, trailed the field into the far turn, gained four wide around that bend before
fanning to the five path entering the lane, rallied through midstretch to bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire, and prevailed on it. LOVELY RIDE
stalked the clear leader from the three path around both turns, shifted to the four path in upper stretch while chasing that foe, closed in to bid at the furlong
grounds as that foe tired, led before meeting PASS THE PLATE's challenge entering the final sixteenth, dueled with that foe thereafter, but got outfinished.
ADELAIDE MISS cleared off in the four path around the first turn, managed a loose lead in the two path around the far turn, but met LOVELY RIDE's bid
approaching the final furlong, then yielded a sixteenth out. JANELLE MONAE (BRZ) was bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, stalked in
the three to two path around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with her inner stalking counterpart into the far turn, drifted to the four path entering the
lane, but sustained stride late to pass tired foes and miss reaching show. OUT OF SORTS broke outwardly and bumped a foe into another rival at the start,
raced off of the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, tucked to the rail into the far turn, then chased along the fence through the lane.
ABSCOND saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, hung on her left lead and lacked a kick between horses in midstretch,
then faltered late. PRINCESS THEOREM laid off of the pace in the three to four path, then two wide around the far turn before weakening between horses
turning for home.

Footnotes
LA CRETE set the pace in the two to three path around the first turn, met FANNIE AND FREDDIE's challenge into the far turn, was headed by that foe
passing the five sixteenths pole, but gamely fought on through midstretch, regained an advantage a sixteenth out, and edged away late. FANNIE AND
FREDDIE set up shop outside of the clear leader and in the three to four path around the first turn, ranged up to that foe into the far turn, forged an
advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to kick away as her inner counterpart battled gamely, dueled through midstretch, but got re-headed at the
sixteenth pole, and was outgamed. BERNABREEZY tracked along the inside while in the two path around the first turn, then chased the leading pair in
upper stretch with hopes of producing a bid inside of those rivals, but flattened out late, then saved show on the wire. CANDY RAID got hung out in the four
path while off of the pace around the first turn, tucked to the two path into the far turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane, then to the five path in
upper stretch, and stayed on with a grinding charge, but missed reaching an inner rival for show. MISS CHAMITA trailed in the two path around the first turn,
then in the three to four path around the far bend, but lacked a rally. SWEET AS PIE tracked the pace from the three path, but came under urging into the
far turn, lacked a true response around that bend, then weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FORTY UNDER pressed the pace setter two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, briefly failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, but kept on in the
finial furlong as HALO AGAIN rallied along side, bid along with that foe in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. HALO AGAIN stalked along the inside while in
the two path, rated just behind the leading pair around the far turn, tipped outside of them in upper stretch, grinded away through midstretch before rallying
to bid in the final sixteenth, but missed. TWO EMMYS set the pace inside of a pressing FORTY UNDER shook clear of that bidding foe in upper stretch, but
tired in the final sixteenth, and was caught by a pair of rivals approaching the wire. OWN AGENDA saved ground off of the pace, improved to a tracking
position into the backstretch, but decided to take back from that spot at the nine sixteenths pole, then chased the leading trio through the lane. LUCKY
CURLIN saved ground far off of the pace, awaiting racing room in the two path entering the lane, then moved up once clear approaching the final furlong.
DYN O MITE tracked three wide, then in the four to five path around the far turn, and chased from between horses through the lane. MONARCHS GLEN
(GB) brushed the gate while breaking slowly, trailed the field early on gained in the five path around the far turn before floating to the six path entering the
lane, but leveled off in upper stretch. EXCESS MAGIC settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted from the three to four path entering the
lane, but faltered among foes in upper stretch. CAVALRY CHARGE stalked two to three wide, but failed to keep pace around the far turn, then weakened
between horses in upper stretch. BODECREAM popped the gate opened pre-race without leaving it, then raced far off of the pace in the three path around
the first turn, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MANDALOUN stalked along the inside around the first turn, claimed place at the half mile pole before shifting outside of the clear leader to take aim into the
far turn, smoothly ranged up to bid at the five sixteenths sparking a duel, battled through midstretch before forging an advantage in the final sixteenth, and
edged away. MIDNIGHT BOURBON broke a bit inwardly at the start, established a clear advantage into the first turn, managed that loose lead from the two
to three path around that bend and down the backstretch, met MANDALOUN's challenge at the five sixteenths pole, gamely clung to an advantage through
midstretch, but was bested with fifty yards remaining. WARRANT saved ground off of the pace, then moved up entering the lane to claim show at the three
sixteenths pole, and proved best of the rest while not threatening the leaders. SPA CITY raced at the rear two wide around the first turn, trailed in the two
path around the far turn, then tipped three wide at the three sixteenths pole, and improved for a minor share. SPRAWL stalked the loose leader from the
outside while in the three to four path around the first turn, but was outmoved by an inner foe at the half mile pole, chased the top two around the far turn,
but lost show to an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. PIRATE'S PUNCH tracked the pace in the four path around the first turn, then in the
three path around the far turn, but failed to rally.

Footnotes
CALL ME MIDNIGHT settled far off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, then in the three path around the far turn, swung to the six path and
outside of rivals at the three sixteenths pole to commence his rally, charged outside of rivals through midstretch to take aim on the top pair in the final
sixteenth, and reached the leader at the wire. EPICENTER set the pace two wide around the first turn before clearing into the backstretch, showed the way
in the two path down the backstretch, met a group of outer bidders at the five sixteenths pole before encountering PAPPACAP's rail challenge entering the
lane, repulsed outer foes while dueling with his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, clung to an advantage from that foe into the final sixteenth,
gamely triumphed in that battle approaching the wire as an outer CALL ME MIDNIGHT menaced, but was nailed on the wire. PAPPACAP tracked two wide
before tucking to the rail around the first turn, stalked comfortably into the far turn, intently slipped inside of the leader entering the lane to bid at the quarter
pole, sparked a duel in the process, battled through the lane while not able to reach his outer counterpart's throatlatch, then yielded fifty yards from home.
TRAFALGAR tracked three to two wide while under light, but steady, urging, lost position to outer foes into the far turn, then improved inside of them
passing the quarter pole while just behind the top two, tipped outside of them at the three sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase while failing to
progress, then was outkicked for show approaching the final sixteenth. PRESIDENTIAL turned his head to the left as the gates opened and was off slowly,
trailed the field around both turns, shifted three wide entering the lane, and moved up before sustaining his advance to split foes at the sixteenth pole.
CYBERKNIFE settled off of the pace four wide, inched closer in the five path and outside of rivals around the far turn to attempt a bid approaching the lane,
but flattened out in upper stretch. BLUE KENTUCKY pressed the pace three wide early on before being floated to the four path entering the backstretch,
ranged up among rivals while under strong urging at the five sixteenths pole, but only produced a mild bid before fading passing the quarte rpole. UNIFIED
REPORT saved ground off of the pace, but failed to rally. SURFER DUDE vied along the inside around the first turn, but allowed his outer counterpart to
clear in order to stalk outside of that foe at the three quarter pole, then got outmoved by a pair of outer foes while under a drive at the five sixteenths pole,
and weakened entering the lane.
