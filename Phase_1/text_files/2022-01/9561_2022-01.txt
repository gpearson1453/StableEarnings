Footnotes
NO MALICE tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, loomed up on leaders flank in upper stretch, and edged away in
deep stretch under steady urging. INNATE led inside on the backstretch, led entering the turn and into the stretch, rival along the outside ranged up in upper
stretch, INNATE gamely resisted but unable to hold of rival in late stages while finishing a clear second best. HUMBOLDT tracked pace four wide on the
backstretch, continued four wide on the turn, entered stretch four wide and finished up willingly. WATER'S FOR FIGHTN off slow, lugged out exiting the
chute, entered turn four wide and had trouble taking the turn, lost much ground and received light urging to the wire after the race was lost. WILLIS broke
out, and away well, showed good speed and had lead approaching the first call, entered turn up close and began to shorten stride midway through the turn
and coasted in.
