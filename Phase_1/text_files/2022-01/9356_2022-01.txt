contended throughout and went evenly late. DUNN DEAL never far back early, had a mild bid late while no threat. PAPER FLOWERS allowed to settle,
failed to menace. TIGER SHARK was unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch and was no menace. ONLY ONE WAY BACK pressed early and tired in
the stretch. CHARLIE'S TRAFFIC was no factor. OLD MAN MAC flashed brief foot and gave way.

COWBOYS FEATHER dueled early, dropped back slightly on the turn, came again in the stretch on the rail and edged clear late. BREEZY MONEY dueled,
three wide early, rallied in the stretch and gained a clear late, held grudgingly and just missed. HEY SACH dueled on the lead for a half, then weakened in
the stretch. GRAND DEAL never far back, lacked a bid and went evenly. MUTUAL CONFIDENCE had good position early and was no menace. CHACO
SPIRIT was outrun. DORISTO allowed to settle, failed to menace. AUTOPILOT no factor.
