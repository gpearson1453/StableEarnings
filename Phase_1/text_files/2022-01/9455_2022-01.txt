ADHHAR off slowly lagged through the turn losing ground to upper stretch finding a late burst six wide arriving in time. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE hustled on
the inside put a head in front outside the quarter pole shaking clear in the three path upper stretch being grabbed from the outside on the wire. HOVER
pressured the pace dueling through the turn ceding in upper stretch fading late in the four and five paths. RED HOT DEVIL flashed early speed then gave
way on the turn easing to the wire. SKY WRITER took a bad step pulling up near the eighth pole being euthanized on the track.

evenly through the turn emerging off a loose leader in the four path upper stretch holding well as a solid second best. GOLOSA a step slow through the turn
mustered a mild rally in the six path upper stretch fiinishing evenly to best the others. TIDAL ROCKET raced evenly in mid pack gaining a couple of spots
down the lane while no threat. TV TIZ GORGEOUS slow early played no factor. I'M JAC'D raced evenly through the turn weakening in upper stretch.
SMALLTOWN CAT hustled clear into the turn set the pace then wilted abruptly in upper stretch. GIMME CLEARANCE played no factor. NOT JIMMY'S TOY
was never involved. CABARET FLEUR hustled along through the turn would fade in upper stretch. COMO ROSE showed little. MILA MINUTE hustled on
the outside would fade to upper stretch.

Footnotes
MISS TREATED STAR pressured the pace dueling through the turn taking on a new inside challenge from the four path in upper stretch finding more to win
clear. MY BELLE MICHELLE went evenly while saving ground surging into upper stretch challenging from the rail being turned away late hanging on for
place. UCANTKEEPUP slow early lagged to upper stretch finally responding a sixteenth out showing best after the fact. CUT RATES raced evenly on the
outside being roused near mid track in upper stretch lacking a late response. BEACH BABE slow early lost ground to upper stretch posing no menace there.
LOVELY LADY LINDA pressed on a narrow lead dueling through the turn wearing out in the two path upper stretch. GIFT FROM MOM chased the pace
through the turn then gave way in upper stretch. HEIDI'S BACK was never involved.
