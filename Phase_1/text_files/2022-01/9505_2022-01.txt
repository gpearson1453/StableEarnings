Footnotes
IRRESISTIBLY SEXY broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held EIGHT MAKAR at bay to
the wire. EIGHT MAKAR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. GONE
SOMEWHERE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, loomed the danger into the stretch and lacked the needed
closing response. SILVER KID was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EZ RULER disputed the pace with the winner
for a half and weakened. SMOKIN ARROW showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
REDACTION lagged far back early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing yards. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH
sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by ATTA BOY BILLY nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and
gave way grudgingly to the winner late. ATTA BOY BILLY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied
and gave way in the drive. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further nearing the quarter and gave way. THE
METAL MAN broke in the air, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FREEZING JIMMY was void of early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

NOUMEA showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly
drew clear. IROQUOIS HEART set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and yielded to the winner through the final
sixteenth. LOVE YA MOST chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. SAYITALL was forwardly placed early,
raced off the rail through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. PERKY BRUNETTE pressed the pace of IROQUOIS HEART while
racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival after going three furlongs, vied and weakened in the drive. AQUINAS was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SHEZA MACHIAVELLI was off slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did
not offer a bid. TWILIGHT GALAXY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CANDY WOMPUS was allowed to settle early, advanced seven-wide through the turn, was up in the closing yards to be going away late. EL CHUMELITO
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. CALL
YOU TOMORROW broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. KING PARKER was never far back,
raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced from off the rail
through the turn and finished evenly late. GOLDEN TIGER was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and gave way through the final
furlong. WESTERN SMOKE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and and did not offer a bid. SPENDAHOLIC pressed the pace from the inside,
lugged out through the turn and weakened. PAPER BOY was off a step slow, pulled up soon after and vanned off.

Footnotes
VROYSKY dueled for the lead from the inside with TIZ A SPEED BOMB, disposed of that rival approaching the stretch and drew off with complete authority.
MOONLITE GRAHAM was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but finished well to gain
the place. SOMBRA NEGRA chased the winner while racing four-wide and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. ALL AMERICAN HERO settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. FLYCATCHER lacked early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CIRCUS RIDE was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. TIZ A SPEED BOMB
was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. STARZAN showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

CLUB CHAMP dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held sway to the wire. TALKIN MALICE
appeared hard to rate, was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with good courage. IMPERATOR
lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. TWILIGHT RIDER raced four-wide through the first turn, settled
off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the leaders in mid-stretch but failed to sustain his bid. JEDI WARRIOR showed no
early speed, raced eighth-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. HELLO HANDSOME pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to
offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. SUNLAND STAR disputed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final
furlong. SWAGSATIONAL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to rally. SMILING MATT

Footnotes
THIRSTY JUNIOR was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with SUCCESS RATE while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead into the
stretch and drew off through the final furlong. SUCCESS RATE dueled for the lead from the inside with the winner, checked nearing the quarter, could not
match strides with that rival in the drive but held on well to save the place. JEN LORS LEGACY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and finished with a steady rally. KENZOU'S RHYTHM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the
drive. PRIVATE JOKE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. LITTLE JOHN was off a step slow, lagged
early, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. KODIAK KING was void of early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. INQUISITEUR lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
CRACK A COLD ONE raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. BRAVE HELIOS chased the leaders while
racing five-wide and weakened in the drive. ARDENLEE STAR raced off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CHEWY CHEWY GOOD stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, quickly opened a clear lead and held
sway to the wire. PRANCE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and rallied late to gain the place.
AMERICAN BOURBON tracked the leader from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain on the winner late. LITTLE MISS BELLE was void of
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but lacked the needed late response. MONGOLIAN WINDOW lacked
early speed, saved ground through the second turn, lacked room approaching the stretch and finished evenly when clear. LOOPY sprinted clear at once,
increased that advantage through the back-stretch and weakened through the final furlong. GALILETA chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
weakened after going five furlongs.
