Footnotes
HANDY DANDY had to check off heels then shifted out and bumped BARSABAS on the first turn, closed in on the far turn and came three to four wide into
the stretch, reached the front in upper stretch and drew clear from BARSABAS in the final sixteenth. BARSABAS got bumped from inside on the first turn,
stalked off the rail then three deep on the backstretch, went three then two wide around the far turn while taking closer order, bid outside the leader in upper
stretch but got outkicked by the winner. ARRABIATA dropped his head and came away slow, moved to the rail, tried to go inside a runner but was put in
tight quarters at the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch, tipped out in the drive and finished willingly for the show. STAR ENTRY vied three
deep early then cleared rivals and angled to the inside on the clubhouse turn, opened up a large lead on the backstretch, held a diminishing lead along the
rail into the stretch and faded. MAD STEVEN came away slow, vied between rivals into the first turn then steadied around the bend, tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival then between foes, dropped back on the far turn and weakened. LAST RENEGADE was off slow to being, moved down to the two path, sat at
the back of the pack off the rail, trailed two to three wide into the lane and made no impact. MR. T'S THIRSTY vied for the lead along the inside, was forced
to steady on the first turn, closed in around the far turn but tired in the lane.

Footnotes
ONEPARTICULRHARBOR came away slow from the outside, tracked three wide around the bend, closed in through the far turn, drew alongside and
quickly took over in upper stretch, kicked clear and drifted to the rail and was able to hold on in the end. KLIMTOGLORY stalked outside a rival early on,
chased three wide on the far turn, launched a late bid from outside but was not enough. MONGOLIAN BONUS broke a step slow and was taken to the rail
nearing the first turn, drifted out a bit while trying to be kept in by the rider on that bend, trailed two wide into the stretch and was along for the show. SYNC
stalked on the inside to the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked the needed response. BIG CREEK sped clear quickly, padded the lead in the middle
stages, remained clear into the drive, relinquished control in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
VIAZAR got bothered from inside at the start, reserved in the early going while traveling three wide, stalked three deep then outside a rival into the far turn,
took aim three wide into the stretch, bid three deep in the furlong grounds and overtook the runner-up late. WARRIOR'S MOON broke out but was quickly
corrected, pressed the pace from outside, headed rival near the five-sixteenths pole, took over in midstretch but was overtaken in the closing moments.
TAYET was a bit rank early on the first turn, stalked inside just off the top pair, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch, tipped out a bit and finished well
between foes late. LOOKIN SO LUCKY sped to the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure, tested on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, lost
the lead past the eighth pole, stayed on well from along the fence but yielded positions in the final sixteenth. UNUSUAL RIDE pulled between rivals on the
first turn, continued between foes up the backstretch then got crowded nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two then three wide around the second
bend, kept on willingly through the final furlong but needed more late.

SANGRE AZUL trailed early on well off the rail, went four then three wide around the turn, rallied steadily and reeled in the runner-up late. NIFF raced up
close outside the top pair, bid three deep on the turn, took over past the three-eighths pole, cleared outside the quarter pole and crossed to the inside,
roused in upper stretch and put to right then left-handed urging but was run down late. RUN AUNTIE T RUN pressed the pace from outside up the
backstretch, vied between rivals on the turn, lost contact past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. ONEFINEDAY set the pace under pressure from
outside, vie with a pair of foes on the turn, lost the lead past the three-eighths pole, became hard to ride when shifting around near the quarter pole, steered
out in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MUAY THAI (IRE) shifted inward at the start, settled off the pace, traveled along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, steered out in the lane and drew
clear. CROSSWORD bumped leaving the gate, stalked in the two path then moved inside, tipped three wide into the stretch, bid three deep with a furlong
left to run, led briefly in midstretch but could not fend off the winner. INCH broke a bit slow then got crowded at the start, saved ground through the turn,
angled to the outside in the stretch and put in a mild late bid. QUANTUM QUEST dueled along the inside into and around the turn, held a short lead into the
furlong grounds, was overtaken in midstretch and weakened late. DREAM ROBBER was forwardly placed from outside, moved down to the two path for the
bend, tipped four wide entering the stretch and could not produce a late bid. NICHIREN dueled for command from outside to the top of the stretch, fought
into deep stretch and weakened. SIR FLATTER broke in and bumped rival, chased off the rail, went two to three wide around the turn and made no impact.
ME MACHO broke a bit slow, went three then four wide on the turn and was not a factor. WARRENS CANDY MAN lacked early speed, traveled along the
inside on the turn and never got invovled.

Footnotes
DISTRACTEDPRINCESS raced greenly early while taking control, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, cleared while traveling greenly again
with a quarter mile left to run, drifted out in the stretch and drew off. FI FI PHAROAH stalked the pace on the inside, cut the corner into the drive and bested
the rest. TROUVILLE steadied three deep on the first turn, stalked outside the top pair up the backstretch, continued wide and was driven four wide into the
stretch and churned on for the show. LISETTE went five then four wide around the first turn, remained wide to the second bend, angled from the five path
down to the two path on the final turn and could not offer the needed response. EYES OPEN pressed the pace from outside, lost contact past the
five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
CROSBY BEACH brushed inner rival at the start, set the pace on the inside, took some pressure on the backstretch then inched clear again, showed the
way along the inside into the stretch, met the challenge from THIRTY FOUR COUPE with a furlong left to run and turned away that rival to win clear.
THIRTY FOUR COUPE was off alertly and raced closer up outside the pacesetter, applied pressure briefly early on the backstretch then had the leader
clear again, chased three wide into the drive, bid outside at the eighth pole but was turned away in deep stretch. BIRTH OF COOL got brushed and
bothered at the start, settled inside, exited the far turn two wide, angled out in the stretch and finished well to earn the show. PICOTA (GB) settled in the two
path, went between runners briefly near the half-mile pole, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane, launched a mild late bid and got outkicked for third.
LOTTERY PICK stalked the pace from inside, tipped two wide past the five-sixteenths pole but faltered in the lane. QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW broke slow
and lugged out leaving the gate, trailed early on, angled out then back in on the second bend and was not a factor. MAYNARD was off slow to begin,
traveled two wide then three wide up the backstretch, continued in the three path through the far turn and weakened down the lane. MALIBU MAYHEM was
unhurried through the early stages, swung out leaving the far turn, sustained an injury in deep stretch and was vanned off.
