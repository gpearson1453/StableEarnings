Footnotes
RIO CUTIE attended the pace from outside, moved clear three wide on the turn, kicked away in upper stretch and held under steady handling. EPIC
ADVENTURE contended between runners, went two wide on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, held the place. JUST AWESOME M was reluctant to
load, pressed from inside, continued to chase while losing some ground on the turn, kept on to get show honors. PALICE REVENGE chased from outside,
went four wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TORRIE THE RAPPER broke a bit awkwardly, switched out to go four
wide on the turn, failed to rally in the lane. SIR AMNESTY took slightly closer order five wide on the turn but came up empty in the stretch. TIZ A SLAYER
angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, was not a threat.

Footnotes
ARCH CITY was lightly bumped at the break, stalked two then three wide around the first turn, lost some ground up the backstretch and into the far turn,
went three to five wide on that bend, drove past in late stretch. ESTEEMED was taken back crossing the wire the first turn, raced on or just off the rail, came
out three to four wide in upper stretch and got the nod for place. DOM WAYNE stalked four wide early, pressed up the backstretch, bid three wide on the far
turn, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked. HIT A NOTE bumped a rival at the start, veered out from three to five wide on the first turn, moved closer
early up the backstretch, was within striking distance four wide on the far turn but had no extra. SMOOTHING IRON was carried out from four to six wide on
the first turn by a drifting foe, raced mid-pack outside going five wide on the far turn, failed to rally. ALEXANDER WHO set the early tempo two to three wide,
came up empty in the lane. ATTILA'S LEGEND saved ground to no avail.

SIGALERT was up close early, raced five wide into the second turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up, drifted in and held. SKY JUMPER raced in
mid pack early, advanced six wide into the second turn, was gaining late and finished second best. DIRT ROAD RED set a pressured early pace, raced off
the rail into the home turn, angled out and was empty. BIG MAC DADDY was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the second turn and flattened out.
LIFE ON THE ROAD was void of any early speed, angled out to the seven path and offered no late rally. BRICKBAT was unhurried early and was no threat.
FEEL THE BERNING pressed the early pace from between rivals and faded.
