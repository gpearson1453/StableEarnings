Footnotes
SHE'S SO SHINY broke alertly and grabbed an easy lead, set the pace on the inside, remained unchallenged to the top of the stretch and stayed clear to
the wire. BEACHGRASS stalked the lone leader on the inside, shifted to the two path on the far turn and chased the winner willingly to the wire.
UNFAITHFUL WAYS settled in hand on the inside early on, angled out then came back to the rail on the far turn, drifted to the rail in upper stretch and kept
on to gain the show honors. A CROWN FOR KITTEN traveled in mid-pack early on, took closer order for the second bend, went three wide into the lane and
nailed MACRELLETTA for a minor award while unable to threaten for the major placings. MACRELLETTA rated in the two path early on, chased three wide
into the drive and failed to summon the needed late kick. FULL SPEED ASTERN was off slow to begin, tucked into the two path for the clubhouse turn,
moved to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. RYANO ROSE came away slow at the start, traveled along the
inside early then went outside a rival on the backstretch, remained two wide to the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SOY TAPATIO set the pace under pressure from INVISIBLE WAR, cleared that rival nearing the far turn, saved ground into the lane and drew off under a
few taps of right-handed urging and steady handling. AMERICAN ADMIRAL bobbled leaving the gate, stalked two then three wide on the first turn, was
driven three wide into the lane and gained the place. INVISIBLE WAR pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader into and around the far turn in the
two path and flattened to third. DANCE COMPANY bobbled leaving the gate, went four then three wide outside the top pair on the first turn, well placed
behind the duo up the backstretch, started to tire on the far turn, eased down the lane and walked off. MAGNIFICENT went four then three wide on the first
turn, angled in on the second bend while trailing the field, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
BACCHANALIA vied for the lead from inside then took control around the first turn, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, maintained a short
lead through the far turn then cleared into the drive, led into deep stretch and lasted in the closing moments. OPERATIC tracked in the two path around the
first turn, outside a rival on the backstretch, angled out into the lane and was guided out further to race widest in the stretch, closed well from outside and
edged TIZNO'S DILEMMA for second. TIZNO'S DILEMMA settled in the two path early on, angled out and went three to four wide into the stretch, rallied
outside the winner but was too late and got outkicked for the place. SUGARY was off a bit slow to begin, steered down to the inside, tipped two wide on the
far turn, came back to the rail in the stretch and finished willingly along the inside. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) stalked the pace on the inside then outside rival
on the backstretch, took aim three wide into the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ZABAVA vied three deep first time through the stretch then pressed
the leader from outside, could not keep pace into the drive and weakened in the furlong grounds. SPANISH CHANNEL vied for the lead early between
rivals, ceded command on the first turn and moved inside to stalk the top pair, lost some ground on the far turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
STAR SAILOR chased four deep into the clubhouse turn then moved up outside the top pair around the bend, stalked outside up the backstretch, bid three
deep on the far turn then dueled with WHISKEY VISION around the bend, put that rival away in upper stretch and drew away. FUNKENSTEIN stalked along
the inside then tipped two wide on the far turn, moved out in the stretch and finished well to prove second best. WHISKEY VISION dueled outside DREW
BIG for command, put that rival away on the far turn then had to deal with STAR SAILOR around the far turn, contested the lead to upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. GRANADA FLAVOR chased between foes early on, was put in tight quarters near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out at the
top of the lane and never rallied. INESPERADO was off a bit slow to begin, was keen early between rivals and pulled on the first turn, was driven three wide
into the lane and lacked the needed response. DREW BIG cleared quickly and angled to the inside, dueled with WHISKEY VISION to he far turn, could not
go on with the leaders with five-sixteenths remaining, tired in the lane and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) got bumped from outside at the start, stalked the leaders outside a pair of rivals, took closer two wide on the turn, drew
alongside the leader with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. SEE THROUGH IT dueled between foes early then two wide on the turn, cleared inside rival
leaving the bend, led through the lane then was collared by the winner past the sixteenth pole and yielded late. FLY THE SKY broke in and got bumped on
both sides at the start, chased between foes and got put in tight quarters at the three-eighths pole then had to check soon after. JOE DON LOONEY shifted
in, bumped and checked at the start, angled to the inside in the early stages, saved ground to the stretch, angled out with a furlong remaining and finished
with late effort to miss the show. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) came out and bumped rival at the start, went up to duel from inside, battled around the turn
then lost touch with the leader entering the stretch and weakened along the inside. CASTLE was off alertly then dropped back off the pace up the
backstretch, went two wide around the bend, angled out in upper stretch, then lacked room and altered to the inside past the eighth pole but failed to
threaten. IAN GLASS broke in and bumped rival at the start, raced in mid-pack early on, navigated the turn three wide, tipped out at the top of the stretch
and made no impact. VIA EGNATIA got knocked into outside rival and checked at the start, chased along the inside to the stretch and could not rally. BABY
GRONK pressed three deep up the backstretch, chased the top pair three to four wide into the lane and weakened. FOREMAN got bumped and forced to
check at the start, trailed two wide into the lane and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH NEVER
HAVE I EVER (IRE) CAME OUT AND CAUSED A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN VIA EGNATIA, FOREMAN, AND FLY THE SKY AT THE START, NONE
OF THESE RIVALS WERE COST A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

EMERALD LAKE tracked in the two path on the first turn, was asked three wide on the second bend, then surged late under urging to overhaul the place
and show runners. SWANNING tucked inside and rated early, angled out on the far turn and took aim three wide into the stretch, reached the front with a
furlong remaining then got caught in the closing moments. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE pulled behind the leaders early on then angled to their outside, bid three
deep into the second bend, took over past the three-eighths pole then cleared, lost command with a furlong to but stayed on well for a game third. BONNIE
BRAE was off slow to begin, settled inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, split foes at the eighth pole then angled to the inside in the final sixteenth
and kept on to earn a minor award. LOVERS ODYSSEY broke a bit slow then got caught in traffic early, exited the far turn three to four wide, drifted inward
in the stretch and failed to rally. SQUARE FUN dueled outside PRESKITT for command, vied between runners into the far turn then angled to the rail once
clear of inside rival around the bend and weakened in the drive. ADDYDIDIT traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch and failed to respond
when called upon. PRESKITT dueled for the lead from inside, was trying to get out around the far turn and dropped back out of contention, then faded in the
lane. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL was off a bit slow from outside, traveled three deep early from off the pace, came four to five wide into the lane and had little
left for the drive.

Footnotes
UNDER THE STARS dueled for the lead inside a pair of rivals, battled UNDER THE STARS through the turn, maintained a short lead over AWAKE AT
MIDNYTE through the lane and held that rival at bay to the wire. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE stalked the leaders from off the rail, bid three wide with a quarter
mile left to run, challenged the winner through the drive but could not get by. MISS MATTIE B dueled for command three deep to the turn, moved to the two
path on the turn once clear of BIG SHAMROCK, fought into stretch but proved no match for the top pair in the final furlong. BIG SWITCH was off slow to
begin, stalked behind the top trio on the inside, angled out to the three path around the bend but lacked the needed response when called upon. BIG
SHAMROCK broke a bit slow then went up to press the pace between rivals, lost contact with the top pair with five-sixteenths remaining and weakened
down the lane. MIMAJOON stumbled badly at the start, tracked well off the rail, dropped back around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
URBAN was forwardly placed in the early stages then dropped back to stalk speedy rivals, went two wide into the turn, angled to the rail then came back out
leaving the bend and entered the stretch three wide, bid three deep with a furlong to, took a short lead with a sixteenth remaining and gamely prevailed.
KITTY KITANA (GB) was put in tight and steadied between rivals early, chased out of range and took the turn three then four wide, rallied outside the top
trio in the final furlong but was not enough to overtaken the winner. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) stalked the speed from inside, shifted to the two path and was
closest in pursuit leaving the turn, bid outside the leader in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole but outkicked by the top pair. PHENOM broke a step
slow then went up to take control early, held command into the turn then kicked clear around the bend, met challengers in upper stretch and was overtaken
at the eight pole, then weakened in deep stretch. PRECOCIOUS TIMES broke slow, settled inside, angled four wide on the turn and lugged out through the
lane. GLENALL (IRE) showed early speed off the inside, chased between rivals on the turn in the two path and weakened in the lane. SUNROOF was off
slow to begin, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, trailed two wide into the lane then angled out and improved position. SPUN BEAUTIFUL sat off the
pace early on, angled in nearing the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a rally. SILENT BEAUTY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, dropped back
early, saved ground through the turn, steered off the rail in the stretch but was not a factor. COLORATURA broke alertly and displayed early speed, chased
three deep and between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and tired. UNSOLVED MYSTERY came away well and was forwardly placed
outside rivals, chased the leader four deep on the turn, came six wide into the lane and faded. HAUTE LADY was off slow from inside, chased outside a
rival, three then two wide on the turn and came up empty.
