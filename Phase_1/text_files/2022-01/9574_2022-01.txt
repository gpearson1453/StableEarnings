BAVARIA was well rated early and made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, then drew clear leaving the turn and then
remained clear under right handed crop urging. RUN FAST chased the early pace three wide, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the drive,
finished willingly but could not gain on the winner, second best. JOINT AND SEVERAL dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive, bested
rest. YES FOR LESS was allowed to settle early towards the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive and had no rally while passing
the tiring rivals. MARKET had no rally while saving ground. COOS BAY dueled for the lead three wide and weakened. EYES OF ZEUS was not a factor
while wide. STONE SCULPTOR failed to menace.

wide, then was between rivals by the quarter pole and faded in the drive. MAE SAI PRINCESS lacked a rally. STORMY SPELL was settled early and made
a five wide move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole but was empty in the lane. RUN THE BLUES AWAY set a pressured pace in the three path

Footnotes
LEGS LIKE SHACK was well placed early and made a three wide bid in hand on the turn to take over, then drew clear by the quarter pole and was kept to
mild pressure to prove best. AWESOME TAP was reserved early between horses, came four wide into the drive and finished well. MY BRIDGET VERDOT
was bumped at the start, settled back early, came three wide into the drive and offered a late rally. SMOKE AND MIRRORS tracked the early pace three
wide, shifted to the inside and made a mild bid leaving the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. DENALI RAE was rated early and made a five
wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. OUR GOLDEN COLLEEN lacked a rally. ESTA CHUCK failed to menace. NOBLE CITY set the early
pace, then chased the pace on the turn and checked nearing the quarter pole while getting off the inside, stopped.

grounds and proved best under hand urging. HOUSE IMPEACHMENT was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn and finished well through
the lane to be clearly second best. MY MAGICAL MAN was allowed to settle and was three wide on the turn, shifted out four wide in the stretch and had a
late rally. VATICAN MOON chased the winner early while three wide and weakened. FLAT BUSTED settled early while four wide and came six wide into the
drive and had no rally. FLAHERTY was settled back early and advanced on the inside on the turn and lacked a rally. TOUCH OF PRINCE failed to menace.
