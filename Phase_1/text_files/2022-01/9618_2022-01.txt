Footnotes
ICY HARBOR stalked the duel down the backstretch under confident handling, circled foes three wide on the far turn, secured command approaching the
stretch and pulled away under a hand ride. BAD TEMPER , in the four path entering the first turn, was taken to the inner rail near the five eighths pole,
remained along the rail thereafter and passed tired rivals to gain the place. UNION BETTY , five deep entering the first turn, was always outside horses,
raced four wide entering the stretch and failed to sustain her move. LIKEHAIL showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace for six furlongs, drifted
out turning for home and gave way. GOT A GOOD REASON stumbled leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside LIKEHAIL, faltered in upper
stretch and was eased late. CAN I EVER dropped back leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE MS SCARLET settled close up to an early duel while outside a rival, circled four wide advancing and chased a clear leader into the lane, rolled up in
the center of the track to poke a head in front in mid stretch, kicked clear under right handed rousing with a sixteenth to go then widened. MINNETONKA
vied between foes while under rating, shook clear mid turn, shifted in a bit, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly
through the final seventy yards. TORCH CARRIER , off the pace, moved up between rivals in upper stretch, altered in then back out and closed willingly.
MISS IS ZIPPY saved ground early, angled out under a ride mid turn, circled four wide into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. LAMBEAU LADY forced the
pace three deep into the turn, stayed on and pursued into the lane, failed to go on past the three sixteenths and weakened. VOLNAY dropped off the early
pace and failed to menace. THEA'S THEME had speed to dispute the early pace inside rivals, eased back a bit leaving the far turn to stalk, failed to respond
to pressure near the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
CORDMAKER , a forward factor outside BUSTOFF down the backstretch and around the turn, secured command between horses in upper stretch, opened
a clear lead near the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and determinedly prevailed. HANALEI'S HOUDINI , caught in tight quarters after
stumbling at the break, saved ground on the turn stalking the pace behind three horses, was taken to the five path for clear room near the quarter pole and
rallied gamely outside the winner. GALERIO chased the pace three deep around the turn, reached a striking position turning for home and gradually
weakened in the drive. BUSTOFF set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way in mid stretch. THE POSER , always outside
horses, steadily retreated. DOUBLEOSEVEN raced along the inner rail on the turn and faltered.

KISS THE GIRL , nudged along toward the inside while holding a forward position, took closer order past the three eighths then angled out, made an
aggressive move between runners to engage ARTFUL SPLATTER soon past the quarter pole, responded to firm asking and kicked clear heading to the
furlong grounds, was kept to solid handling and widened. ARTFUL SPLATTER relaxed three wide stalking the pace, ranged up four wide under confident
handling to collar the leader past the three eighths, briefly went clear in upper stretch, battled outside the winner past the three sixteenths then gave way
grudgingly through the final furlong. COCONUT CAKE hopped at the break and was away a bit slow, regrouped and settled towards the inside, gained
towards the rail mid turn, eased out and took aim in upper stretch, failed to kick on with the top pair but gave effort to the wire. LOOKIN DYNAMIC rated
between foes early, was under asking three wide mid turn but could only pass fading rivals. GOOD LIFE CIDER settled outside a rival while in range
through the backstretch run, came under pressure mid turn, angled four to five wide, failed to kick on and gave way in the final eighth. DOUBLE FIREBALL
rated early stalking the pace, was put to urging past the three eighths, lacked a further response entering the lane and weakened. PAISLEY SINGING
quickly went clear then angled in to set the pace, was taken on nearing the lane, faltered past the three sixteenths and was under mild hand coaxing through
the final furlong.

Footnotes
TYREEK came out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace off the rail but inside horses around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch, closed
determinedly and was up in deep stretch. ON THE LAM set the rail and gave way grudgingly. VICTORY GIVEN hugged the inner rail around the turn in a
striking position, eased out to the two path turning for home and finished gamely between the top pair. KEEPING THE PEACE , very wide entering the
stretch, had a mild rally outside foes. EXTRA MEDIUM , shuffled back a bit leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path while inside horses through the
stretch and passed tired ones. JUNGLE WARRIOR , pinched back leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch
but failed to make an impact. MICE AND MEN , four wide on the turn, weakened. BARDOLINO chased the pace two wide around the turn and gave way.
BIG HAMBONE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. PET'S NIGHT was outrun. CAN HE SHINE was outrun.

WITTY , under a snug hold outside rivals while measuring the leaders, responded when given a bit of a nudge mid turn, cruised up four wide outside H P
MOON and seized command into the lane, quickly went clear, was put some left handed asking inside the furlong grounds then pulled away with vigor while
steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards. COASTAL MISSION tracked inside, eased out under pressure into the lane and gave game chase to
be second best. LOCAL MOTIVE came out at the break and bumped with H P MOON, dropped off the pace while climbing a bit early on, saved ground
under asking around the turn, eased out in the drive, worked between foes in the final furlong and finished with interest. ALOTTAHOPE drafted back off the
leaders following an alert start, dropped in and raced in about the two path while not far back, waited briefly mid turn, angled four wide under asking into the
lane, moved up a bit in mid stretch then flattened out. LAST ROMANCE , four wide outside rivals, chased the pace mid turn, came six wide for the drive but
lacked a solid finish. H P MOON bobbled after being bumped at the break, quickly recovered and accelerated inside to a short lead, took pressure then
kicked clear leaving the far turn, ceded to the winner entering the lane, stayed on with effort to mid stretch then faded. SHAKE EM LOOSE broke in the air
after being fidgety just prior the to gates opening, found herself well back into the turn, was under a ride around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
failed to seriously recover. UNCAPTURED SPIRIT showed good speed and disputed the early pace outside H P MOON, gave hard chase past the five
sixteenths, was fanned a bit wider into the lane and gave way.

LUNA BELLE lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, swept to command approaching the eighth pole and drew away under left hand urging. BUFF MY
BOOTS chased the pace in the two path around the turn and finished willingly while no match for the winner. BENEATH THE STARS sped to the early lead,
set the pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. JACKIE THE JOKER , outrun, swung wide turning for home. DETERMINED TRUTH hugged
the inner rail down the backstretch and around the turn and was no factor. SPARKLE SPRINKLE , a brief factor in the two path down the backstretch, gave
way.

Footnotes
TIME LIMIT , away alertly, prompted the pace outside PRINCESS KOKACHIN, was put to strong asking mid turn, went on the attack soon after, saw the
leader shake back clear inside the three sixteenths, kept on doggedly, secured command in deep stretch then kicked clear. KAYLASAURUS was steadied
back from between runners in the opening sixteenth, regrouped and edged up wide into the turn, advanced four to five wide under a ride heading to the
quarter pole, straightened away and continued on gamely to earn the place in the final yards. PRINCESS KOKACHIN sped clear early, set the pace towards
the inside, dug in when confronted after a half mile, was guided three wide into the lane, spurted back clear under pressure in mid stretch, ceded command
inside the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. PRODIGY DOLL chased the pace, raced to the inside of rivals mid turn and churned on. REGAL
RETORT saved ground while off the pace, was under a hearty ride mid turn, swung six wide into the stretch and had belated action. BUNTING , well placed
tracking the pace along the rail, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then faded. FILLE D'ESPRIT lost any real chance after hesitating and bobbling at the
break, found herself far back early, made a five wide between rivals in upper stretch then flattened out. DON'T CALL ME MARY lacked speed, raced well
back into the turn, saved some ground near the quarter pole but never generated a response. HIBISCUS PUNCH , a bit keyed up early, steadied between
rivals while close up past the five eighths, chased two wide between runners into the stretch and faded. PHANTOM SHOT failed to menace while wide near
the quarter pole. WHISKEY AND RYE , rated well back early, was outrun. OUR SWEET GIRL , four wide pursuing outside rivals, stayed in touch to the
quarter pole then gave way.

Footnotes
WONDRWHERECRAIGIS accelerated to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the inner rail and drew off through the stretch while kept under urging.
YOUNGEST OF FIVE raced in the two path on the turn while chasing the winner, angled out turning for home, faded and held the place.
SHACKQUEENKING hugged the inner rail throughout and lacked the necessary rally. THREES OVER DEUCES stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced
between horses on the turn, was in the two path through the stretch and lacked the needed rally. JAXON TRAVELER , jostled on both sides leaving the
starting gate, chased the pace outside horses on the turn, floated to the four path approaching the stretch and weakened. PENGUIN POWER bore in
bumping JAXON TRAVELER leaving the starting gate, chased the pace outside horses and gave way. STUDIO B bumped JAXON TRAVELER when
bearing out leaving the starting gate then trailed.

Footnotes
OXIDE rated kindly off the leader, crept closer into the turn, bid to challenge mid turn, dueled into the lane, shook clear past the three sixteenths, shifted in a
bit and widened under a drive. BAHAMA CHANNEL saved ground under some early rating, moved up under asking around the turn, angled four wide into
the lane and kept on willingly to gain the place. FRANKEE MERCH opened up early, set the pace towards the inside, was hooked mid turn, dueled into the
stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. LECTRIC CHOKE rated off the rail early on, came under pressure leaving the far turn but failed to
respond. LINDA'S NEKIA was outrun.
