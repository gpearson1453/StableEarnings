UNCLE GARY G vied for the early lead two wide, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch while clear, then remained clear to the wire to prove best
under a drive. BLO MY BUDGET stalked the pace three wide early, then chased the winner three wide on the turn but failed to gain on that rival while
second best. ADY'S MUNNY vied for the early lead on the inside, then chased the pace on the inside and faded, bested rest. ORASHI steadied slightly
nearing tyhe first turn, then settled early, was three wide on the turn and had no late rally. JUMP FREE was reserved early and lacked a rally, not a factor.
BENCH PRESS chased the early pace and tired.

into the drive and finished well to gain the place award. GUSSIE'S NOTION tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn and flattened out.
LOIS'S CAUSE was hustled along the inside to set the early pace and weakened. SAW was not a factor.

BUILT THAT WAY was four wide into the first turn, then was rated along four to five wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then continued that
bid in the drive to get up in time under a drive. CARGO SHIP vied for the early lead three wide and in between horses, then went on to set the pace on the
backstretch and shook clear by the quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the drive but was denied late. ESPRESSO CALIENTE was settled early on the
inside, then eased off the inside on the turn for racing room, swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied. PAL CAL was four wide into the first turn, then
chased the pace three wide on the backstretch, dropped down to the inside on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out. BOYS OF
QUEENS was taken abck early, came five wide into the drive and had a belated rally. FUEL THE BERN prompted the pace four wide and tired. MOON
