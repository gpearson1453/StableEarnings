Footnotes
CLASS CODE saved ground throughout while stalking the pace to the second turn, improved position into the stretch run, was set down for the drive and
reeled in BIG BRAND late to prevail. BIG BRAND was four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace outside of foes along the backstretch, gained ground
along the second turn to collar MARZANNA, edged clear into the stretch but was reeled in late by CLASS CODE, while besting the rest in the end. SHE'S
EXPENSIVE was forwardly placed while two wide through the second turn, did not offer a late rally in the stretch but was an easy third. MARZANNA tracked
the pace into the first turn, was a bit rank and pulled on the rider on the first turn and into the backstretch run, pressed the pace into the second turn, took
over nearing the furlong marker but was overtaken by BIG BRAND heading into the lane and weakened in the stretch run. TENDERONI was away alertly
and set contested fractions to the second turn, ceded the lead nearing the quarter-marker and faded in the stretch. ALLISON'S SURPRISE was allowed to
settle through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn and gave way in the drive. CONSENTIA was away a bit slowly and was unhurried in
the early stages, trailed to the second turn while saving ground and was not a threat.

Footnotes
HANDR'SDREAM tracked the early pace to the turn, gained ground from a three wide path along the turn, continued that run into the stretch to take
command inside of the furlong marker and held safely in the end over oncoming rivals. BARBIERE bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, settled
off of the pace on the turn while four wide, rallied in mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner in the end but could not reel him in while holding for second.
DARK PRINCE saved ground while chasing the pace and closed in the late going to secure third. KNOCKOUT BERT was away alertly and contested the
pace to the turn, met the bid of HANDR'SDREAM leaving the turn but could not hold him off inside of the furlong grounds and was outkicked in the drive.
SIERRA MELODY pressed the early pace, lost ground on the turn while three wide and was outfinished in the stretch. RUNKERRY dueled on the front end
with KNOCKOUT BERT through the turn, was outrun leaving the turn and weakened.

AVERY ON POINTE settled off of the pace while outside of rivals, mounted a steady bid from a four wide path on the turn, continued that run into the stretch
and closed on the tiring pacesetter in the final strides to get up in time for the win. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ was sent to set quick fractions into the turn, opened a
clear lead while in hand along the bend, extended that lead into the stretch run, was tiring in the final sixteenth, was all out in the final stages and was nailed
on the wire for the win while clear of the rest. CALIGRAPHY saved ground while stalking the pace from the midflight and closed well in the stretch to secure
third. DIZZY LIZZY sat just off of the pace from the second flight, was three wide on the turn, gained ground into the stretch and just missed for third. LA
POPIS was away well, was outsprinted to the turn, stalked the pace from a two wide path on the bend and weakened in the drive. NISHICO hit the gate and
broke in sharply at the start and was slow in the early going, was two wide while trailing on the turn and did not mount a late rally.

RIVIERA CHAMP was away alertly and took command of the early pace into the first turn, rated nicely through the backstretch run, extended the lead into
the stretch run and drew clear in the end. GOLDEN TRIBUTE stalked the pace from the second flight was outkicked in the stretch run. TEX HANLEY
stalked the pace from a two wide path through the second turn and ran evenly late. SUBITO SLEW was four wide along the first turn, tracked the pace
outside of rivals to the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late stages. BLESSED BROTHER pressed the pace from a three
wide path to the quarter-marker and tired in the drive. FANTASTIC DREAM saved ground while traveling off of the pace to the second turn and lacked a late
response. MAJESTIC LUCK was a bit slow in the early going and was allowed to settle while outside of foes, was four wide on the second turn and did not
mount a late bid.

MIDNIGHT FLOWER was off alertly and was sent to set the fractions, rated nicely to the second turn while being pressed, shook free of the pressing foe
leaving the second turn and inched clear in the end. REV REE was a bit rank and hard to place along the first turn and into the backstretch run, was three
wide along the second turn, steadied nearing the quarter-marker, shifted in for the drive and rallied along the rail in the stretch to claim second. MISS
SUPER SAINT tracked the pace from a three wide path, improved position along the second turn while three wide and into the stretch but was outkicked in
the late stages. ROSE PRINCESS saved ground while stalking the pace from the second flight, gained ground leaving the second turn and flattened out in
the stretch run. CASINO GAMES stalked the pace outside of rivals, was four wide on the second turn and weakened in the drive. TURA LURA stumbled
soon after the start, recovered to press the pace to the second turn and faded in the stretch.

MUSIC FESTIVAL was away quickly and set fast fractions through the turn, opened the lead into the stretch and drew clear under a hand ride in the end as
much the best. MISS IVES chased the quick pace from a two wide path on the turn and while no match for the winner in the late going kept on to be best of
the rest. DULCE EMMA disputed the early pace to the turn, was outrun on the turn while two wide and weakened in the stretch. CIELO DIAMANTE lacked
early speed to the turn while outside of rivals and was not a factor. HAUTE LADY tracked the pace to the turn, lost ground while three wide on the turn and
gave out in the stretch run. JAYS ANGEL ducked in sharply at the start, spotted the field many lengths in the early going and always trailed.

UNCLE FRED exchanged bumps with PAINT ME LUCKY at the break, settled in the midflight while never far back through the backstretch run, slipped to
the inside along the second turn, swung out for the drive, was put to firm right-handed encouragement in the stretch and dug in in the final strides to prevail.
TRASH TALKIN CAT was hustled leaving the break and cleared the field into the first turn to set the fractions, opened a long lead along the backstretch and
into the far turn while in a comfortable rhythm, came back to the field in the final furlong, was all out in the final stages and was tagged in the final strides,
while holding for second. GALLANT WARREN saved ground while settling just off of the early pace, was steered to the three path along the second turn,
angled out for the drive and rallied in the late going to secure third and to just miss for second. BOTTLE OF SMOKE stalked the pace outside of rivals to the
half-mile marker, was three wide along the second turn and closed willingly in the final stages but could not reel in the top trio. PAINT ME LUCKY traded
bumps with UNCLE FRED at the break, stalked the fractions through the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch. FINAL FINAL was unhurried
through the first half-mile, was four wide on the far turn and mounted a belated rally in the drive. J T'S WATCH settled in the early stages while outside of
foes, was four to five wide on the second turn while still towards the rear and did not rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BECCA TAYLOR pressed the early fast fractions, overtook ATLANTIC STRIKE nearing the top of the stretch and pulled away in the final furlong. THE
GREAT HAYNES saved ground while stalking the pace to the turn, lost ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the late going but kept on to secure
second. ATLANTIC STRIKE was away alertly and showed good early speed while carving out fast fractions from a two wide path, came under pressure
nearing the head of the lane, ceded the lead to the winner and tired in the last stages, while just holding on for third. GRINNINGEARTOEAR stalked the
pace from a three wide path on the turn and gave way in the stretch, just missing for third. LAGATHA tracked the pace outside of foes, gained ground while
four wide on the turn to come within aim, flattened out in the stretch and just missed for third. ANNIE GRAHAM was shuffled at the start and was away
slowly, chased the pace from a two wide position on the turn and finished evenly in the late going. STYLEDOME (IRE) saved ground while chasing the pace
from the second flight and weakened in the stretch. RED HOT LASS chased the pace outside of foes to the turn, was four wide on the bend and faltered in
the drive.

Footnotes
MANGOTANGO stalked the pace from the second flight while two wide to the second turn, gained ground on the second turn and into the stretch run, vied
for the lead between foes inside of the furlong grounds and made a late push in the end to prevail. STEIN'S GIRL was unhurried to the half-mile marker,
was steered four wide on the second turn, swung widest into the lane, gained ground and steadied nearing the sixteenth-marker, ran on the left lead and
was a bit erratic but closed well in the end to pressure the winner while getting up for second. BLUEGRASS SKY stalked the pace from a three wide path,
gained ground into the stretch run to come within aim nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late stages. SHANGHAI MIST settled off of the
pace, was three wide on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch run, though unable to reel in the top three. WHAT UP NOW J T was sent to
dispute the early pace, was under a tight hold leaving the first turn to the half-mile marker, was given rein to press SUNSET STAR to the far turn, made a
three wide bid to take the lead into the final furlong but weakened in the drive. SUNSET STAR was away alertly and was sent to set the fractions while being
pressed to the second turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker and faded in the late going. SASSY EINSTEIN saved ground while settling off
of the pace to the half-mile marker and was not a late factor.
