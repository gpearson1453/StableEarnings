Footnotes
ERRIGAL sent to lead and cleared early on the backstretch, continued to inch away on the turn and drew off under light urging. INNATE brushed by inside
rival at the start, chased winner two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and no match for winner while easily a clear second. WILLIS
broke in and asked for speed early, ceded lead to quicker rival, chased leader into the turn and began to steadily fade midway through the turn. A P
THUNDERSTORM step slow, and brushed with outside rival at the start, showed awkward strides for over a half furlong, lugged out around the three eights
pole, and eased in the stretch when no improving.
