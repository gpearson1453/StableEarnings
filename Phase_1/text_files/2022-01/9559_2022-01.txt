Footnotes
SIX FEET APART set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. MORNING COCKTAIL prompted the winner in the three path and was clearly
second best. BREEHAZEL chased the pace from the rail, lacked a rally and held well enough to maintain the show. KNOW HOW (GB) chased the pace two
wide and lacked a closing bid. CHICA BOOM had the two-path into the stretch and could not reach contention. BLACK SWAN had early speed outside then
steadily faded four wide. WIN OR CELLAR was off a bit slow and failed to menace while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SKY MAGICIAN pressed the pace two wide, took over from MALRAUX turning for home and kicked clear, then dug in to hold off BALISTICO through the
closing yards. BALISTICO sat patiently off the first flight around the turn, tipped to the three-path with a clear shot at SKY MAGICIAN into the stretch,
finished gamely outside and was edging closer at the finish. LARGE broke a step slow and was outsprinted early, circled six wide coming off the turn, and
offered a mild response to best the others. MALRAUX was skittish coming on the track and unseated the rider, went to post without further incident, set the
pace near the inside for three furlongs, yielded to the winner at that point and faded steadily. MIDNIGHT PUNK raced four to five wide in range to the end of
the turn, and tired. TENACITY ZIP was forwardly placed three wide between horses into the turn, and was finished approaching the stretch. REAGAN'S
HEART refused to break, and was escorted off the track.

Footnotes
YEGUITA QUEEN got bumped at the start then ranged up to be well placed just off the top pair, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead at the
quarter pole, came five wide into the upper stretch, vied for the lead past the the furlong marker, drifted out wider and edged away in late stages. HUSTLE
QUEEN vied inside of GT'S BLUE SQUALL in opening stages and matched strides entering the turn, took on the added challenge of the winner at the
quarter pole, vied into the stretch run, could not move on with YEGUITA QUEEN in late stages but ran on to secure place. FEARLESS GIRL shifted off the
inside to race five paths wide soon after the start, launched a wide bid into the upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and captured show in final strides.
STARSHIP NUGGET hustled up four wide around the turn, came five wide into the upper stretch, churned on with response and got edged out late for
show. G T'S BLUE SQUALL vied for the lead with HUSTLE QUEEN soon after the start, continued to duel for the lead around the turn, stayed on into the
upper stretch then gave way near the furlong marker. RAIN OF BLESSING was not too far back between in opening stages, went two wide into the stretch
run and failed to threaten. DRILLZILLA angled to the rail soon after the start, saved ground through the turn and weakened in the lane. RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. REDDINGTON pressed the
pace two wide, had the rider lose the whip near the five-sixteenths pole, was in a bit tight approaching the head of the lane, angled three wide in upper
stretch and stayed on to gain the place. CAPTURE THE TIME set the pace along the rail, gave way near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened inside.
LORD JAXSTON failed to menace while racing three wide. CRY MACHO tracked the pace from the rail, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty.
MIGHTY MIRACLE broke inwardly and slowly and was outrun inside. CATCHING MAGIC played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
RIVETING SPIRIT stalked behind SYLVANELLA for six furlongs, tipped out to the three-path leaving the far turn, overpowered the pacesetter and drew off
under a drive. KISSING FROGS saved ground to the far turn in striking range, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and finished well to go clear
for the place. SYLVANELLA took the lead with an alert beginning, ambled along clear in the two-path for six furlongs, proved no match for the winner in
upper stretch, and had enough to salvage the show spot. MIRABELL MEI settled in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, came four wide for the drive and
improved without threatening. VICTORY CRUSADE sat perched outside the pacesetter three wide on the turns, and weakened in the stretch. TRULY was
no factor three to four wide throughout. UPTOWN QUEEN broke slowest, bumped twice with AUBURN before reaching the first turn, and never got close.
CANDY'S DREAM raced wide throughout, and was outrun. STARSHIP MISHKA stayed in range for six furlongs, and gave way into the lane five wide.
AUBURN exchanged a couple of bumps with UPTOWN QUEEN at the back shortly after the start, and remained in arrears.

Footnotes
MANDY GREEN saved ground around the first turn and settled off the early pace, shifted out and loomed up five wide late on the far turn, took over the lead
turning from home, held a length advantage over ONLY TIME a furlong out and held clear under a driving finish. ONLY TIME tracked the pace three to four
wide through early stages, moved up closer late on the far turn, raced in striking distance of MANDY GREEN into the stretch run, tipped to the two path in
late stages, stayed on with good response and clear for second best. AMBAR rated near midpack between foes up the backstretch, raced in traffic around
the far turn, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the rest. GIRLY THE BUTCHER was
unhurried and saved ground, shifted out mid-way around the final turn, came five wide into the upper stretch and improved position. READY CANDY got
squeezed back and checked sharply entering the first turn, lost all momentum and dropped back, remained unhurried up the backstretch, was ridden along
four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. CHARMED WAY raced three wide around the first turn and settled off the early pace, roused five
wide mid-way around the far turn, showed brief response then gave way. VICTOREM got pinched back and stumbled at the start losing all momentum,
dropped to last and remained reserved in the back, raced wide into the upper stretch and passed tiring foes. HARD TO IGNORE attended the along the
outside in early stages, vied three deep around the far turn then weakened turning for home. COUNTLESS DREAMS secured inside position around the
first turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, raced in traffic around the far turn, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and gave way.
MOUNTAIN BELLATRIX was forwardly placed around the first turn, vied for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle for control into the far turn then
came up empty late on the turn. VALIANT MISS held a slim lead around the first turn, dueled up the backstretch, battled on around the far turn then tired in
the drive. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

RICHY settled off the early pace outside, edged closer three and four wide around the turn, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. NO QUE NO
prompted the pace three wide between foes, took the lead in midstretch and led until deep stretch. HARD COUNT was in tight early, trailed two and three
wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. DETERMINED FURY set the pace along the rail to midstretch and yielded in midstretch.
ZANNO tracked the pace from the rail and lacked the needed rally. THING vied two wide between foes and weakened in the lane. ENSIGN PARKER was
up close four wide and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
LUCAGO got ping-ponged between BACKATYA and WILLY THE SHOE at the start, raced four wide around the turn, rallied widest through the lane,
outdueled WOW RUN into the final furlong and edged clear. WOW RUN pursued the pacesetter from outside, challenged for command turning for home,
was head and head for the lead inside LUCAGO with a furlong remaining, and was outdueled from there. BACKATYA bumped with LUCAGO at the start,
raced near the inside on the turn, loomed a threat in the two-path through the furlong grounds but was outfinished. FROSTED ARMOUR broke slowly,
saved ground outsprinted around the turn, and made no late headway in the two-path. WILLY THE SHOE bumped with LUCAGO coming out, made the
pace near the inside to the stretch, and gave way into the last eighth of a mile.

Footnotes
PHANTOM VISION vied outside of MAMBA QUEEN for the lead in early stages, dueled between foes around the turn, took a slim lead turning for home,
continued to hold a slight edge over HEADLINE HUNTER from the inside, dug in gamely and held on. HEADLINE HUNTER was away in good order and
angled in to race up close in early stages, dueled three deep around the turn, continued in striking distance of PHANTOM VISION into late stages, stayed
on determinedly but failed to get by. HIT THE WOAH raced off the early speed and saved ground, picked up the pace around the turn, launched a three
wide bid into the upper stretch, showed good response and cleared the rest. WICKED WORKOUT was off a step slow at the start, moved up four wide into
closer contention entering the turn, came five wide into the upper stretch and lacked the needed response for serious impact. IGLOO raced in range along
the inside, sat patiently around the turn, angled out and hustled up four wide into the upper stretch and ran on midpack and finished evenly. ZIA'S SONG
raced off the early pace and saved ground, rode the rail around the turn, gained position in the upper stretch then flattened out in the final sixteenth.
AMUSING ANTICS angled in to race three wide near midpack in early stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn and had no kick in the lane.
ABUSE OF POWER raced under a snug hold off the early pace, got carried out wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. WOW raced off the
early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped out wider for the drive and never threatened. THAT'S MY BABY got bumped at the start, lacked early
speed, came five wide into the lane and never menaced. MAMBA QUEEN cleared on top and angled inside soon after the start, quickly came under under
pressure, dueled inside a duo around the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DOCTOR RON head his head turned at the start and was off last, advanced between foes down the backstretch to reach contention, was in range three
wide between foes around the far turn, found clear sailing in upper stretch, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under
left-handed urging. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS was bumped between foes at the start, made good progress between foes down the backstretch, vied three
wide into the far turn, took a short lead near the three-eighths pole, vied outside of BOURBON OVER ICE from there to midstretch, put that foe away and
angled in leaving the eighth pole but had no answer for the winner late. SENSEI LAWRENCE raced off the pace three wide and was along late for the show.
BOURBON OVER ICE set the pace along the rail, vied inside to midstretch and weakened. THOUSAND LETTERS broke out and bumped DIRT ROAD
DOLLARS at the start, raced four wide and played no further factor. GOGEES saved ground and failed to menace. ALL FOR GOLD broke inwardly, saved
ground and made little impact. RISK VS REWARD prompted the pace four wide and came up empty in the drive. MY MAN VITO pressed the pace two wide
and retreated after a half. EL CARDINAL broke inwardly and bumped DIRT ROAD DOLLARS at the start, raced two wide and never threatened.
