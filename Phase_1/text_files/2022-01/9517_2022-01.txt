Footnotes
FRECCIA D'ARGENTO was well placed tracking the early pacesetter along the outside, roused three wide around the far turn, stayed on determinedly in
the stretch run, dug in three deep in the final sixteenth and got up nearing the wire. NUMERIC sped to the lead at the start and took the inside position, set
the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, remained clear a furlong out, began to tire in final stages
and got edged out nearing the wire. PEARLINTHEROUGH was forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter up the backstretch, came under a ride two wide
through the far turn, sustained a steady bid into the stretch run, stayed on with good response and edged up closer in final stages. DOMINANT JOY secured
inside position soon after the start and raced near midpack, came under a ride around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, gained closer contention
then flattened out in the final sixteenth. FLECHE D'AMOUR was rated outside up the backstretch, hustled up four wide through the turn, swung five paths
wide into the upper stretch and ran on evenly. MISS BETH'EL tracked the pace in close range up the backstretch, weakened and lost position around the
turn and had no response in the stretch run. UNBRIDLED CHROME was reserved racing in the back, went two to three wide around the turn, came out
wider for the drive and never threatened. SCARLETT'S FLOWER raced off the pace and six paths wide up the backstretch, came four wide into the upper
stretch and steadily retreated.

furlong and drove clear. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) raced three wide around the turn, and was along for the place outside. POSITIVELY AWESOME vied
outside SCHOCHOH to the stretch, and weakened. SCHOCHOH dueled inside POSITIVELY AWESOME through the opening three furlongs, and

FABRICATE was off a bit slow, advanced inside down the backstretch, dueled along the rail around the turn the drew off under moderate urging. TWELFTH
MOON vied outside of the winner, could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but held on for the place. KHOZZY VALINTINE stalked the pace three
wide, lacked the needed rally and churned on to maintain the show. SHEA ON A MISSION chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. MISZLO settled
off the early place outside, advanced four wide around the turn but came up empty in the lane. SHANIAH trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
REBELDE was well rated racing just off the second flight up the backstretch, picked up the pace going by the three eighths pole, was ridden along five wide
into the upper stretch, dug in three deep past the furlong marker and kicked clear. MEADE broke out at the start then came in a couple paths, tracked the
pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a bid for command midway around the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch, angled inside near the furlong
marker, edged ahead of weakening OLD TIME REVIVAL but could not kick on with the winner. OLD TIME REVIVAL held a clear lead out of the chute, set
the pace inside up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the turn, came three to four wide into the upper stretch, got collared in the final furlong,
weakened to show and finished well clear over the rest. ONE EYED JACK settled in close range stalking the pacesetter between foes, weakened and lost
position upon entering the turn, saved ground into upper stretch and had no late response. TONE FEELIN tracked in close contention on the rail, weakened
mid-way around the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER raced off the pace, saved ground
around the turn and faded in the drive. DANI'S VICTORY raced in the back, went four wide around the turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
OUR COUNTRY settled in striking range four wide early, remained out in the four-path edging a bit closer around the far turn, rallied determinedly and
collared the leaders from outside in the closing yards. READY HERO was four wide into the first turn forwardly placed, prompted the pace two wide through
the middle stages, bid outside PRIVATE ISLAND at the top of the stretch, vied with the latter to deep stretch and got up for the place between horses.
PRIVATE ISLAND led three wide on the first turn, moved inward showing the way up the backstretch, dug in when confronted by PRIVATE ISLAND at the
top of the stretch, and stayed on to 70 yards out before giving way inside the top two. CATCH THAT PARTY was toward the back for six furlongs, swung
five wide coming off the far turn and gained belatedly outside. TALLIS was briefly in a bit tight between horses entering the first turn and eased back off the
leaders, went along two wide to the stretch, moved to the rail and finished evenly. LIGHTNING ROD advanced after a half-mile, lodged a three-wide bid
near the quarter-pole, then flattened out once straightened away for the drive. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) saved ground to the far turn, shifted out three wide
nearing the stretch, and made no headway. MY MAN FLINT vied early inside, and was finished after six furlongs.

DIAL TO WIN got bumped between foes soon after the start, hustled up between and advanced to challenge TREVESS for the lead, matched strides two
wide around the turn, battled on into stretch run, shook free in the final sixteenth, came under attack from NIKEE KAN in deep stretch, dug in gamely and
refused to let rival by. NIKEE KAN raced outside in the second flight heading into the turn, picked up the pace three wide late on the turn, hustled along
three to four wide into the upper stretch, roused forward to race in striking distance in deep stretch, dug in under firm handling but could not get by the game
winner. TREVESS dueled inside of NIKEE KAN for the early lead, cut the corner and battled on into stretch run, could not match strides with the winner in
late stages but stayed on with response and secured show. LARIMAR got bumped between rivals strides after the start, raced inside off the top flight leaving
the backstretch, sat patiently inside around the turn, launched a two wide bid entering the lane, raced in close range but lacked the needed kick for serious
impact. FOLLOW ME MOM raced inside of the a rival off the second flight entering the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, edged closer then finished
evenly. SASSY BEAST got bumped a bit after the start, raced in contention between foes around the turn, fanned out five wide into the upper stretch and

Footnotes
LADY DOMINANCE trailed while not far back early, shifted off the inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and caught LADY JAE
from outside with 50 yards remaining. LADY JAE was a step slow at the start, settled in striking range two wide, wrested the lead away from YOLANDA'S
PRIDE turning for home, led to deep stretch but could not hold the winner safe. YOLANDA'S PRIDE set the pace inside to upper stretch, and weakened.
BRODY'S HONOR saved ground held up behind the leaders early, continued inside being urged along through the far turn, and lacked a closing punch.
CAUSINGAHULLBALOO hit the right side of the gate and was slowest away, rushed up outside heading to the first turn, pressed YOLANDA'S PRICE to the
end of the far turn, and tired. DANCE TILL DAWN was three to four wide to the backstretch, and retired before reaching the stretch.
