Footnotes
KISSALOT bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked the dueling pair three wide, ranged up to them to bid in upper stretch, and drew off at the furlong
grounds. DR. BENNY dueled for the lead along the inside, but was surpassed by an outer bidding rival approaching the furlong grounds, and proved second
best. MATH MAN broke slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, stayed on through the lane, and altered course inside of a tiring foe in the late stages to
improve. WILLIAM GUSTAVO sparred with an inner foe for the lead into and around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidding rival in upper stretch,
and faded. SHADYFIED never got involved. WEBCAM took a bump from an inner foe at the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MALIBU MOIRA settled at the rear along the inside, shifted three wide at the quarter pole before altering course five wide in upper stretch, rallied through
the final furlong to bid outside of a leading HAVINFUNYET at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. HAVINFUNYET raced at the rear two wide around the first
turn, gained three wide around the far turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied through upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, led shortly after, but
was outkicked by an outer foe at the sixteenth pole. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON laid off of the pace two wide, gained inside of HAVINFUNYET around the far
turn, kept her path entering the lane as her outer counterpart had to shift out, rallied to bid for the lead along with that rival at the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked passing that junction, then lost place at the sixteenth pole. GOOD MONGOLIA dueled along the inside around the first turn, backed off to stalk at
the five furlong pole, but reengaged the leader two wide and between horses at the half mile pole as SUNDAY SCHEMING produced an early bid, vied
inside of that foe around the far turn, but faded turning for home. SUNDAY SCHEMING stalked the dueling pair from the three to two path around the first
turn, moved early to produce a three wide bid for the lead at the half mile pole, cleared inner foes turning for home, but tired entering the lane, got
overhauled by a trio of foes leaving the furlong grounds, and weakened. A LITTLE FLYER saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, and was done
early. KALLINIKI dueled for the lead two wide, cleared her inner counterpart entering the backstretch, met that foe's and another outer rival's bid at the half
mile pole, but gave way to them approaching the five-sixteenths, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
NOSY BANKER stalked two wide, bid at the three furlong pole, vied before shaking clear at the quarter pole, inched further away in upper stretch, met
GRIEF's challenge a sixteenth out, and held firm. GRIEF stalked three wide, laid within striking range around the turn, but failed to keep pace with a clearing
NOSY BANKER at the quarter pole, however rallied at the furlong grounds to take aim on that foe, ranged up a sixteenth from home, but was kept at bay.
MEAN CANNON was unhurried off of the pace along the inside, but lost position when tentative inside of foes into the turn, trailed the field in the three path
around the bend, shifted five wide at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to claim show approaching the wire. ADRENALINE raced off of the pace two
wide and among foes early on, cleared an inner and saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide and between horses entering the lane, forged on to
claim show at the furlong grounds, but was bested by an outer foe for that position in the final sixteenth. THUNK laid off of the pace three to two wide and
between horses, but lacked a kick in upper stretch, took a mild brush from an outer foe approaching the furlong grounds, and failed to factor.
LILRASCALMAN broke a step slow at the start, tracked from off of the pace four wide, but hung on his left lead through the lane, leaned in and brushed a
foe approaching the furlong grounds, and lacked a rally. GOT KRAMER sped clear early on, met an outer foe's bid at the three furlong pole, then gave way
entering the lane.

A SONG FOR ARCH tracked the leading trio from the outside around the turn, tugged closer turning for home, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel with an
inner X CLOWN, forged an advantage from that rival at the furlong grounds while shifting in a bit on his left lead, and held to the wire. X CLOWN bumped
with an inner foe at the start, vied three wide into the turn, led turning for home, dug in to resist an outer rival's bid in upper stretch, but was headed at the
furlong grounds, and fought on to the wire. CLASSY JOHN stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, but was held up behind
leading rivals entering the lane, shifted in approaching the three-sixteenths to split foes, but allowed outer rivals to get a jump in the process, then chased
them home to prove best of the rest. DRAKKAR vied for the lead two wide and between horses around the turn, but faded at the furlong grounds. CHANGI
bumped with an outer foe at the start, and got outrun. JIMMY TWO TIMES set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but
weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

EMERALD FOREST shifted outwardly early on while settling into stride, comfortably stalked the pace setter two wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch,
assumed command at the furlong grounds, and drew off. CRIME SPREE broke outwardly, stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader at the three
sixteenths pole while chasing a bidding EMERALD FOREST, claimed place at the furlong grounds, and lasted from an outer rival for that position late.
THIRSTY BETRAYAL laid off of the pace three wide, but drifted outwardly in upper stretch, stalled while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, but
changed over approaching the final sixteenth, produced a mild kick soon after in hopes of claiming place, but ran out of ground to reach that position.
HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT hopped slightly at the start and broke a step slowly, but rushed soon after to set the pace, showed the way around the turn, met
EMERALD FOREST's bid in upper stretch, but was headed at the three-sixteenths, and weakened at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
Prior to the start, every horse except NEW EAGLE rushed the gate without any stall opening. NOBRAG JUSTFACT tracked two to three wide, ranged up
outside of the leading pair around the far turn to bid turning for home, forged an advantage at the three-sixteenths, met an inner BARLEEWON's bid at the
furlong grounds, dueled with that foe thereafter while gamely clinging to an advantage, and held. BARLEEWON bumped the gate at the start, settled off of
the pace along the inside, moved two wide and between horses approaching the nine-sixteenths, tracked among foes around the far turn, tipped to the three
path in upper stretch, rallied to split the leaders and bid at the furlong pole, sparked a duel with an outer NOBRAG JUSTFACT in the process, battled to the
wire, but was denied. JUST GUN IT stalked the clear leader from the outside around the first turn, bid for the lead into the far turn, led between horses
turning for home as NOBRAG JUSTFACT ranged up, got headed by that foe at the three sixteenths, fought on through midstretch as BARLEEWON
menaced as well, but yielded to those foes in the final sixteenth. NEW EAGLE stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring WAR CHEST
turning for home to trail the field entering the lane, shifted outside of that foe shortly after, but lacked kick. YOUVESAIDITALL raced at the rear two wide,
took the far turn three to four wide while attempting to rally outside of foes, but flattened out entering the lane, and failed to factor. WAR CHEST sped clear
around the first turn, but got headed by an outer rival at the three furlong pole, gave way to that rival and another outer foe turning for home, then weakened
through the lane.

MOON OVER TUSCANY set the pace inside of a pressing FREUDIAN while staying a path off of the inner railing, shook clear of that foe passing the
quarter pole, and was driven home to seal the deal. FREUDIAN prompted the pace setter from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch, and was second best. ELI'S GIRL hesitated at the start while leaning on the outer part of the gate, trailed the field in the four path, gained into the far
turn to be within striking range of the top two turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. TETHERED tracked the top pair from the three path, inched
closer to press them into the far turn while getting outmoved by an outer foe, and faded turning for home, then was vanned off, and deemed to have bled.

Footnotes
CHINATOWN NANCY settled off of the pace three wide, inched closer to a four wide tracking position down the backstretch, shifted five wide in upper
stretch, rallied outside of foes through the final furlong while subtly shifting inwardly, produced a bid in the final sixteenth, and reeled the leader in on the
wire. EMPTY NET set the pace along the inside around the first turn, allowed a keyed-up BROOKLYNN'S DANCER to clear off at the nine sixteenths pole,
shifted out to stalk that foe two wide approaching the half mile marker, re-bid for the lead entering the lane, drove clear at the three sixteenths, but drifted
outwardly through the final sixteenth as outer foes closed in, and got nailed on the wire. COUNTRY TIME stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path in
upper stretch to chase the leaders drifted outwardly at the furlong grounds while engaging an outer rallying CHINATOWN NANCY, rallied along with that foe
through the late stages in an attempt to produce a late bid, but was shut off approaching the wire as the inner leader drifted across her path. COINMAKER
laid off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, stayed on inside of CHINATOWN NANCY before being put to tight quarters between horses
by that foe at the furlong grounds, got outkicked soon after, and kept on for a minor share. BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB stalked three wide while under stout
restraint into the first turn, pulled around that bend to bid for the lead entering the backstretch, led at the five-eighths before clearing and tucking to the rail
approaching the half mile pole, showed the way around the far turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. EPHEMERAL
stalked two wide, then three wide and between horses into the far turn, attempted a bid entering the lane, but flattened out at the quarter pole, and faltered.
ALITTLEBITOFSMARTY laid off of the pace along the inside, but was outrun. ST JOSEPHINE showed little. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN was distanced and
eased around the far turn, then pulled up in upper stretch before walking off.

GOLDEN ARTIST stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane to bid at the quarter pole, and drew off. CUSTOM GUITAR
tracked the pace from the two path, shifted four wide entering the lane before being pushed five wide by an inner SATISFY U, rallied along with that foe to
duel for place through the lane, and prevailed late. SATISFY U raced in midpack along the inside, tipped to the three path while moving up inside of
CUSTOM GUITAR entering the lane, pushed that foe a path wider while creating racing room passing the quarter pole, battled with that foe for place
through the final furlong, but got outfinished. TWO PUNCH FIST hopped slightly at the start and raced far off of the pace along the inside around the turn,
move up inside of horses in upper stretch, shifted five wide and outside of leading rivals at the sixteenth pole, and stayed on late to claim a minor share.
BOTH OURS dueled for the lead along the inside, but proved no match for an outer bidding foe passing the quarter pole, and yielded. AUTUMN'S LIL DOLL
dueled for the lead two wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the quarter pole, vied for place between rivals through upper stretch, but weakened
through the final furlong. I'M A CUSTOM TO IT broke slowly, laid four wide around the turn while off of the pace, shifted six wide entering the lane, but failed
to factor. AMERICAN FIRST tracked from midpack three wide, tucked two wide entering the lane, but made little impact. MEMPHIS MELTDOWN took the
turn in the five path while far off of the pace, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, but was outrun. B B GUN BULLSEYE pressed the pace three wide,
but weakened five wide at the quarter pole. GREY GREY showed little.
