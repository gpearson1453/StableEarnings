LOVE AND LEMONS was forwardly placed to lay up close down the backstretch while racing along the inside, moved up along the rail through the stretch
run and finished with good energy to be clear under strong handling. ALTERED DREAM was allowed to settle off the early pace, raced near the inside down
the backstretch moved up five wide near the quarter pole and finished well late to get up for the place position. BELMAR BEAUTY pressed the early pace,
took command through the far turn, raced three to four wide in the lane and weakened a bit in the final stages. CAVE CREEK stalked the early going,
moved up four wide through the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. AUTUMN ASPEN showed good early speed, raced in the two path and
weakened in the drive. CRY LIKE A BABY dropped back early, raced well off the inside in the lane and never menaced.

bumped with Tigerbeach and forced rival to take up midstretch. Jockey of Tigerbeach filed an objection against Blueridge Mountain for interference in the
stretch run and stewards disqualified the winner and placed him fifth. FOOLISH STEVE stalked the pace from the outside, moved up three to four wide in
the lane and finished gamely to the wire. BIG FALCON ROCKET was sent along to showed good early speed down the backstretch from the inside and
weakened a bit in the latter stages. LIGHTHAWK settled off the early pace, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive.

Footnotes
RELEASE THE BEAST was allowed to settle early, made a steady advance around the far turn while racing two wide, angled five wide through the lane and
finished well to edge clear under strong pressure. SWOT ANALYSIS showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and couldn't match strides
with the winner late to finish second best. DOUBLE BARREL MAN stalked the early going from the inside down the backstretch, was in tight quarters near
the half mile pole, raced three to four wide through the stretch run and had not enough for the top pair. ZION was forwardly placed to lay up close in the
early going, raced between rivals through the far turn through the upper lane and weakened a bit in the latter stages. OUR FREDDIE MAC settled off the
early pace, moved up six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. PICKENS pressed the early leaders while racing three wide and
gave way in the drive. FLASHY BREW settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the far turn and had no response. NO PEDIGREE raced five wide
near the quarter pole and never was a factor.
