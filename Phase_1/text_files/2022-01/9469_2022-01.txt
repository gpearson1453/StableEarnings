Footnotes
SOLAR TAP was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried off the early pace, made a move four wide around the far turn, advanced to
threaten approaching the top of the stretch, was set down three to four wide for the drive, responded under pressure, roused forward in the final sixteenth
and edged away. QUANTUM THEORY briefly held the lead and angled inside in opening stages then conceded position to BOGGIEMIESTER, stalked the
leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge rival entering the far turn, vied for the lead into the stretch, got by aforementioned foe then got outkicked
by the winner. BOGGIEMIESTER sped to the lead around the first turn, set the pace inside up the backstretch, vied for the lead inside of QUATUM
THEORY around the far turn, battled back gamely from the inside into the final furlong then failed to keep pace and weakened to show. STARSHIP
WIZARD rated two wide between foes mid-way through the backstretch, picked up the pace around the far turn, swung four wide into the upper stretch and
had a mild improve without threatening. OCTOBER TIME rated inside near midpack through the early going, came under a ride inside around the far turn,
tipped two to three wide into the upper stretch and chased on evenly. MOON AT MIDNIGHT was off a step slow at the start, remained unhurried in the back,
saved ground around the far turn, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. TRAVEL GUIDE got bumped at the start, raced in range tracking
the early pace, urged three wide around the far turn, failed to move on and flattened out in the lane. ALABAMA JAMMA broke in and bumped with rival at
the start, rated four wide near midpack up the backstretch, hustled up for response entering the far turn, failed to progress under pressure and steadily
weakened in the lane. TREPID settled outside not too far off the early pace, came under a ride three wide around the far turn, failed to move on and
retreated.

DEL REY DOLLY settled off the pace outside, raced three wide around the turn, closed outside and rolled past the pacesetter in deep stretch. LARA'S
LADY set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, remained well clear past the sixteenth pole but offered little resistance to the winner late.
STORMIN' COUGAR pressed the pace two wide to upper stretch, could not keep pace in the lane but churned on to hold second. RESTLESS EYES raced
off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. MADAME CLAUDE chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the
lane. HANNITA'S EMPIRE was outrun while racing three wide. VANISHING FAITH played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE pressed CLAUDE RAY from outside early, challenged for command on the far turn, took over into the stretch and edged away under
pressure. SIR TERRE saved ground early within range, moved out four wide late on the far turn, and finished well to be clearly second best.
SUPERPOSITION lodged a three-wide bid outside CONGLOMERATE midway on the far turn, but flattened out in the stretch. SHIMMERING LIGHT was
four wide early, and lacked the needed response. MIGHTY TOUGH saved ground reserved early, lost position entering the far turn, moved to the two-path
getting roused into the stretch, and had no rally. CONGRATS AGAIN lagged near the back early, circled five wide approaching the stretch, and made no
impact. CLAUDE RAY led in the three-path around the first turn, moved in through the middle stages, and yielded readily to challengers after six furlongs.
PERPETUAL CHANGE was five wide entering the first turn, and showed little at the back.

Footnotes
EMBRACE MY UNCLE was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced three wide around the first turn, rated off the pace up the backstretch, circled up four
wide late on the far turn, stayed on gamely into the lane, reached the leader in the final sixteenth and edged away under a driving finish. STRIKE THE TOP
was well placed racing three wide just off the early pace, loomed up three wide late on the far turn, vied for the lead into the stretch, stayed on gamely, got
by embattled duo but failed to hold off the winner. POPPY'S BOYS settled out of the gate and tucked inside on the first turn, remained unhurried up the
backstretch, roused three wide around the final turn, sustained a three wide bid into the lane, steadily edged up closer and captured show. GEMONTEER
steadied on the rail entering the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, roused forward to challenge PH FACTOR for the lead around the far
turn, battled on into the final furlong, weakened late and lost show. P H FACTOR took over the lead entering the first turn, set the pace by a comfortable
margin up the backstretch, dueled inside of POPPY'S BOYS around the far turn, battled on into the final furlong then came up empty and gave way.
CAUSALISTIC saved ground while tracking the pace through early stages, hustled up on the inside around the far turn, came two wide into the lane and
failed to kick on. POCO CHARLIE got bumped a bit right after the start and raced in the back outside through early stages, swung five wide into the upper
stretch and lacked a needed rally. AEQUOR raced in range and tracked the pace up the backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn
and steadily retreated.

FREEDOM MATTERS stalked the pace two wide in the clear around the first turn, dueled outside of INDY LYON down the backstretch and around the far
turn, was headed by THRESHOLD in upper stretch, battled on inside of that foe to deep stretch then drove clear late. THRESHOLD bumped with UNCLE
CURLY at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, swept to the front turning for home, dueled outside of the
winner to deep stretch and succumbed late. HEZA KITTEN was in range inside, could not quicken with the top two in upper stretch, battled inside of
BENELUX for the show and won that duel. BENELUX tracked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. UNCLE CURLY bumped with
THRESHOLD at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. INDY LYON set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of the winner down the
backstretch and around the far turn then tired in the lane. SIR SEAMUS was unprepared for the start and off well last, raced four wide around the first turn,
saved ground around the far turn and was never close. CASTAGNO played no factor while racing two and three wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SHAMROCKET settled off the first flight for six furlongs, advanced four wide approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly outside and wore down SIR
OLLIE in the closing stages. SIR OLLIE led early before yielding to BIG VENEZUELA, rebid along the inside entering the far turn, dug in gamely through a
long drive but could not hold off the top one. NACHO PAPA was never far back, challenged for command outside SIR OLLIE and BIG VENEZUELA on the
far turn, could not sustain the rally past midstretch and salvaged the show. BRACCIO DI FERRO lagged in the second flight for six furlongs, shifted out four
wide to the stretch and gained only mildly. HERCULES tossed his head spotting the field a couple lengths at the start, and never factored. BIG VENEZUELA
sparred with SIR OLLIE before getting clear briefly up the backstretch, came under attack from both flanks midway on the far turn, and retreated. GLORY
OF FLORIDA broke slowly, trailed throughout and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
BLACK SAND (GB) sped to the lead soon after the start and secured inside position, set the pace by a comfortable margin up the backstretch, held firm still
unasked around the far turn, came two to three wide into the upper stretch, roused for more, responded, widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp
under steady encouragement. SANURA was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, remained inside rated off the early
pace, shifted out late on the far turn and launched a four to five wide bid into the upper stretch, took closer order then angled inside, stayed on with good
response and cleared second best. FAST AS FLIGHT fanned four wide around the first turn, settled nicely and tracked the pace up the backstretch, came
under a ride midway through the far turn, came out four wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with response and cleared the rest. MARIA'S REVENGE was
allowed to settle out of the gate, raced inside in the last flight up the backstretch, swung out four to five wide turning for home, responded with a mild kick
and improved position. QUEEN OF LIES steadied sharply entering the first turn, secured inside position and settled off the early pace, roused forward four
wide late on the far turn, sustained bid into the upper stretch then flattened a furlong out. COPACETIC stalked the pace up the backstretch, launched an
inside bid around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane and weakened near mid-stretch. VENTRILOQUIST was forwardly placed racing just off the
early leader, came under a ride two wide through the far turn, continued in contention into the upper stretch then gave way. STARSHIP UNICA was forced
in tight and clipped heels shortly after the start, trailed throughout.

MIRA MISSION broke in and bumped JOURNEYMAN at the start, tracked the trio of pacesetters while racing in the two path, tipped three wide nearing the
quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and held firm under left-handed urging. HAWKISH settled off the early
pace, angled in entering the first turn, edged closer two wide between foes around the far turn, found clear sailing outside in upper stretch, rallied through
the lane and was gaining on the winner. HOT BLOODED raced three wide in midpack around both turns and rallied for the show. JOURNEYMAN was
bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. PROVEN STRATEGIES vied two wide
between foes for half, dueled inside around the far turn, fought on to midstretch then gave way. WINFROMWITHIN dueled inside for a half and faded inside
around the far turn. THE PROGRAMMER played no factor while racing two wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn. VOW ME NOW
pressed the pace three wide for a half then two wide around the far turn and tired in the drive. ABSAM was outrun inside. RUNUP UNAVAILABLE. PER
RULING #202202476 FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, HAWKISH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD bumped with LOOKIN AT ROSES at the start, stalked outside AMERICAN PRINCE for six furlongs, took over approaching the stretch and drew
off under a mild drive. COWBOY DIPLOMACY raced close up alternating between the rail and the two-path for six furlongs, was between horses into the
stretch, and won the place battle while not a threat to the winner. HIGHEST HONORS bumped with LOOKIN AT ROSES a couple strides from the gate,
raced three to four wide throughout, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. CAPOCOSTELLO broke a step slowly, and failed to factor in the two-path
much of the way. AMERICAN PRINCE set the pace near the inside for six furlongs, proved no match for the winner coming to the quarter-pole, and folded
up. LOOKIN AT ROSES bumped with OLYMPIAD at the break, then bumped with HIGHEST HONORS right after that, and trailed near the three-path.

Footnotes
GATSBY broke to the lead then conceded position to COOL QUEST, tracked the leader into the turn, moved up two wide to challenge near the quarter pole,
dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely from the outside and moved clear late under strong handling. COOL QUEST hustled up out of the gate and wrested
the advantage from GATSBY, led the way into the turn, took on the challenge from GATSBY near the quarter pole, dueled from the inside into stretch run,
battled back gamely then had no closing kick left in reserve. PUDDING raced two to three wide in the back through early stages, came under a ride two
wide around the turn, gained closer contention in the upper stretch, sustained a steady three wide bid in the final furlong and finished well clear over the
rest. LEGAL DEAL raced three wide in range through early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the turn, swung five wide into the lane and
steadily weakened. BOCA BOY raced off the early pace, was ridden along the inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch and failed to
move on. POPPY'S PRIDE raced in contention chasing the top pair into the turn, was ridden along three wide past the quarter pole, failed to keep pace out
of the turn and steadily retreated. CAJUN BROTHER raced outside off the early pace, came three to four wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
MOMS MOON set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of LA MAQUINA when that foe bid near the quarter pole, dueled inside through the lane and
prevailed. LA MAQUINA stalked the winner two wide, reached near even terms in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and was held at bay. GRAND
DAVID steadied along nearing the first turn and around much of the bend, tracked the pace from the rail and finished evenly to maintain the show.
TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE saved ground off the pace, angled out in midstretch and rallied belatedly. SKYLANDER raced two wide in midpack and never
threatened. LAST DAWN saved ground in range and lacked a rally. DREAM OF A DAY saved ground and failed to menace. BORDER WAR played no
factor while racing three and four wide. PRINCIPE D'ORO broke a bit awkwardly, lacked speed while racing three wide around the first turn, moved up four
wide around the far turn but tired in the lane. SIMMS was outrun while racing three wide. MALIBU TIME chased the pace three wide for six furlongs and
retreated through the lane. ROMANICHAL was pinched back at the break, raced well back three and four wide throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
