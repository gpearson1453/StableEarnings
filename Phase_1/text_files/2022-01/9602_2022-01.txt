STEELY BAND , three deep down the backstretch and on the turn, secured command mid way on the bend then steadily pulled away while not fully
extended. SUNDAY SWAGGER lacked speed, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and passed tired horses to gain the place. PASS IT ON
circled the turn three wide, was fanned to the four path approaching the stretch and weakened. ALL ABOUT AUDREY , a forward factor along the inner rail
entering the turn, angled to the three path near the five sixteenths pole and faded in the drive. CHARLIV slow to begin, saved ground on the turn, angled off
the rail entering the stretch and weakened. SUZZETTE STAR showed speed in the two path down the backstretch then gradually weakened the final three
furlongs.

Footnotes
RESPONSE TIME quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away to lengthy lead mid while under some coaxing past the five
sixteenths, kept on under a drive past mid stretch and maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire. CLOSERTOTHEHEART settled off the rail, edged
up four deep leaving the far turn, emerged as the closest pursuer into the lane and kept on willingly to the finish. FANCY PRINCESS chased the pace three
wide and raced between rivals past the three eighths, shifted out some and came up empty. SPANIKOPITA , a bit washy in the paddock, stalked two wide
early on, failed to kick on between rivals mid turn, dropped back then was angled out in the drive. TARGE , off a bit slow after bobbling inward, corrected
and moved up to the inside, chased inside rivals past the three eighths, had no response from there and retreated. PER RULING #22-077 FROM THE
MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, FANCY PRINCESS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

PARDSY , right to the front, set a rated pace two wide, turned away challenges from both sides nearing the lane, spurted away under strong handling in mid
stretch then held firm while kept to task. FRANCIS X. broke a step slow, settled off the pace, made a nice rail run mid turn, loomed into the stretch and kept
on willingly to be second best. DESHACKLED settled off the rail while not far back, came under a solid ride four wide past the five sixteenths, circled into the
stretch but failed to muster up a serious finish. AWESUMMER , urged from the gate, had speed three wide outside the winner, was put to a firm ride while
forcing the issue into the stretch, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faded. LOADED SNIPER stumbled at the break, regrouped and was sent
up between foes nearing the turn, shifted three wide approaching the stretch but failed to generate a response.

Footnotes
MISS CASEY , sharply angled to the inner rail near the five eighths pole, set the pace along the inner rail and was under urging in the drive. CHARMING
WAY , unhurried early, moved out to the four path leaving the turn, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. HELIACAL RISING lacked speed, was
taken to the five path in upper stretch and had a slight rally. BLUEBERRY INDYGO saved ground on the turn and failed to be a threat. ALWAYS MIA , three
deep chasing the winner around the turn, tired in the drive. SISTER SUPREAM , checked to avoid the heels of the winner near the five eighths pole, raced
outside horses in the stretch and finished willingly. MY SISTER CLURRIE , in the two path chasing the winner around the turn, gave way the final furlong.
YOLO JET , outrun, pulled up on the turn and was vanned off. An objection by the rider of SISTER SUPREAM against the winner for alleged interference
shortly after the break was not allowed.

Footnotes
MILITARY HOP , quickly to the front, handled some outside pressure early on before going clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away some
challenges approaching the stretch, kicked away and won under a mild hand ride. TITAN'S WILL prompted the pace outside the winner, came under a ride
around the turn, circled four wide to threaten near the five sixteenths, saw the leader pull away but gave valiant chase to the wire. WILLIAM CROTTY rated
towards the inside, eased out advancing past the three eighths, edged up between runner soon after, was forced in some by TITAN'S WILL near the three
sixteenths, shifted back out and kept on with effort. PERCHER , four wide outside rivals early on, dropped back some mid turn, was under asking while wide
for the drive and churned on. LOST MY VOWCHER , in tight at the break, pulled his way forward then steadied along from the five eighths to the turn, failed
to kick on past the three eighths and faded. CANTAKEITANYMORE was outrun. SUNMAN was checked repeatedly while saving ground through the
opening half and gave way. GO POKE THE BEAR stalked off the rail and faltered nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LIBERTY STAR sped to a short lead along the inside, set a rated pace while handling outside pressure, dueled mid turn while still under some rating,
responded and shook clear under stout encouragement past the three sixteenths, continued to widen in eager fashion and was kept alert to the wire.
RUFFY forced the pace outside the winner, battled on near even terms mid turn, failed to match strides hearing to the furlong grounds but stayed on well to
be clearly second best. MAILMAN'S A FLYER drifted in at the break and brushed with a foe, raced between rivals early, stalked the embattled leaders while
two wide around the turn, eased out under a drive entering the lane but went evenly from there. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE , off last when leaning in and hitting
the gate, raced off the pace while saving ground and failed to menace. IMMORTALIZATION edged up three wide into the turn and tracked, came under
pressure mid turn, drifted five to six wide entering the lane and faded. PATIENT GAME , brushed and put in tight at the break, dropped off the early pace,
was under a ride four to five wide nearing the lane but came up empty.

Footnotes
VISUAL ARTIST hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch then asserted himself and drew off under brisk urging. MAID THE JOURNEY lacked
speed, was five deep turning for home and rallied outside horses. SOUPER EMPEROR saved ground around the far turn, remained near the rail in the
stretch and failed to sustain his move. ALPHA QUEUE disputed the pace outside the winner and weakened through the stretch. CHAMBO , along the inner
rail to the three eighths pole, angled out leaving the turn and weakened. DR. FERBER , taken to the five path on the backstretch, remained well wide on the
far turn and gave way. RIPPOLINO raced in the three path between horses on the far turn and gave way. PAY THE KID , four wide the far turn, faltered and
was eased late. SHOULDA HAD IT , a forward factor along the inner rail for a half mile, faltered and was eased. FORE ON SEVEN , shuffled back entering
the far turn, faltered and was distanced while being eased and walked off.
