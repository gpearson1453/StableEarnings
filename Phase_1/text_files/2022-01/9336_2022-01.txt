Footnotes
WHO'S CANDY broke inward but quickly straightened course, sprinted to the front and cleared inside rivals then crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch
and drew away under right-handed urging. LIBERTY FOREVER stalked the pace from inside, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the stretch and
finished evenly in deep stretch. DARK MARCUS came away slow from the outside, angled inward on the backstretch, exited the turn two wide and
summoned a mild rally to outkick a pair of rivals for the show. WORSE READ SANCHEZ steadied off heels crossing surfaces early, raced along the inside
then swung four wide into the stretch, kept on to advance in the lane but was outkicked for the show honors. JACK SIXPACK was fractious in the gate, off a
bit slow from inside, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, moved into the range up the backstretch, went two wide into the lane then angled out in upper
stretch but failed to find the needed late kick in the final furlong. ARTHUR SPOONER broke well then settled in mid-pack, went three wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. PHILOSOPHER'S TONE tracked the pace from between rivals, moved to the rail on the turn and never threatened. STREET HUMOR was
away well but could not match strides with the pacesetter early, switched to the outside at the half-mile pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened.
DIVINE RASCAL chased outside a pair of rivals early on, went two to three wide into the lane and weakened. LORD FISC broke slow and bumped inner
rivals at the start, angled in leaving the turn and failed to respond when called upon. INDIO MO MO was forwardly placed outside a rival, came three wide
into the lane and tired. MAGNIFICENT RIDE broke slow and got bumped from outside, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, trailed three wide into the
lane and was not a factor.

SMUGGLER'S RUN broke a step slow to begin then went up to vie for the lead between runners, dueled outside AGADOR SPARTACUS around the turn,
cleared into the stretch, then drew off under right-handed urging and steady handling. BIG IMPACT vied four then three deep up the backstretch, chased the
top pair three wide leaving the bend, kept to task through the drive and got up for second. AGADOR SPARTACUS vied for the lead inside rivals to the turn,
dueled with the winner around the bend, could not keep pace into the lane and got edged for the place. HEAVEN'S MUSIC chased in the two path then
came three wide into the stretch and needed to find more in the final furlong. EREBUS saved ground chasing along the rail and weakened. BILL BUCKNER
vied three deep and got crowded between runners early, chased the top trio three deep into the turn, remained three wide to the stretch and weakened.
TUCKER'S TRIBUTE was off a bit slow to begin, trailed four then three wide on the turn and was outrun.

TRICKLE IN stalked the top pair up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane, bid outside SWIRLING nearing the eighth pole, took over
approaching the sixteenth pole and inched away. INVINCIBELLA (GB) settled off the pace on the inside, exited the bend two wide, angled out at the top of
the stretch and closed well to earn the place honors. MAGICAL GRAY tracked the top pair off the rail then angled to the inside, waited for room at the top of
the stretch, gained a clear path soon after and finished well but got outkicked for second. SWIRLING dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at the
top of the stretch, was tested by the winner approaching the furlong grounds, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go and yielded late. VELLA bumped
leaving the gate, tracked the pace outside a rival early on, went between foes on the turn, then finished evenly in the furlong grounds. CHEAP CHEAP
CHEAP dueled inside SWIRLING for the lead into and around the turn, started to weaken in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. SACRED PEACE
(FR) bumped with VELLA in the beginning, traveled two wide around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
MAD STEVEN was up close early on the inside, lost ground into the turn, asked two wide leaving the bend, had the rider lose the whip in midstretch, rallied
under hand urging and got up in time. FORT BRIDGER got bumped from inside at the start, pressed three deep early on, dueled for command around the
turn and took control with a quarter mile remaining, cleared inside rival nearing the eighth pole and got reeled in by the winner in the closing moments. ITS
BIG bumped leaving the gate, trailed under coaxing early, passed rivals saving ground on the turn, moved out in the stretch and put in a late rally to earn the
show. CURLY ESA got bumped at the start, set the pace under pressure from both sides, dueled inside a rival around the bend, was overtaken nearing the
quarter pole, fought back into the stretch but faltered in the late stages. KING ROB showed brief speed then dropped back while racing a greenly, went
three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch, continued to be a bit green at the top of the lane and could not rally. WALKING BOSS raced in range off
the inside, outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the drive and weakened. ARTABKEEN stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, chased widest up
the backstretch, three to four wide on the turn and weakened.

CHEWING GUM settled off the pace, closed in around the turn, went three wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch, bid outside BEER CAN MAN and
got up on the line. BEER CAN MAN stalked outside the leader, bid between on the turn, dueled in upper stretch and took a slim advantage into the final
furlong, fought with CHEWING GUM in deep stretch and was edged at the wire. BRAN (FR) was forwardly placed outside a rival, bid three deep on the turn,
entered the stretch four wide, drifted out in the lane and held the show. DELAWARE (GB) tracked the pace off the rail, went two wide into the turn, eased
out to the four path, angled widest in the drive and finished willingly while unable to get by BRAN (FR) for third. COMMANDER (FR) angled in on the
backstretch and stalked along the fence to the turn, exited the bend two wide, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch and could not rally when gaining a
clear path. MOMOS sped clear and crossed over, showed the way along the inside into the turn, vied with rivals on the bend, dueled in upper stretch,
relinquished the lead with a furlong remaining and flattened on the inside. CUPID'S CLAWS lacked early speed, angled to the inside, came two wide into the
stretch, found the rail again in the drive and made no impact.

NEWGRANGE set the pace along the rail with company to the outside, cleared around the second bend, coaxed along at the top of the lane, urged once
right-handed in midstretch and drew away. ROCKEFELLER pressed the pace from outside, chased the winner two wide around the far turn and stayed on
to save the place. OVIATT CLASS brushed with inside rival at the start, stalked in the two path outside a rival, angled four wide leaving the far turn, showed
late interest and rallied to miss the place. MACKINNON brushed leaving the gate, was rated on the inside early on, angled three wide leaving the second
bend and finished evenly in the final furlong. DEGREE OF RISK was off a bit slow from outside, stalked three deep outside the top pair, lost ground around
the far turn, got floated five wide by OVIATT CLASS entering the stretch and tired.

moved to the rail, set the pace up the backstretch, got pressured by MUCHO UNUSUAL on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and flattened in the
final furlong. GLOBAL BRAND unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, saved ground then tipped off the rail into the stretch, steered out further in the
lane and made no impact. ENGLAND'S ROSE brushed rival leaving the gate, rated in the early going off the rail, traveled three to four wide on the second

AS TIME GOES BY went three wide outside the leader on the first turn, applied pressure in the middle stages, raced on even terms into the second bend
and took a short lead with three furlongs remaining, held a short lead over PARK AVENUE AROUND the far turn then shook free nearing the stretch,
powered away under left-handed urging and was geared down late. PARK AVENUE took control early and led two wide through the first turn, set the pace
inside of AS TIME GOES BY on the backstretch, was headed by that rival into the far turn, lost command with three furlongs to go, fought back to the
quarter pole, chased the winner into the stretch and stayed on for a clear second. MOONLIGHT D'ORO was off a bit slow from inside, traveled a bit off the
rail around the first turn, moved out three on the second bend and gained the show. FI FI PHAROAH chased along the inside to the lane and weakened.
VELVET SLIPPERS went two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked the speed outside a rival, traveled in the two path to the stretch and came
up empty.

Footnotes
RIDING WITH DINO stalked the pace off the inside, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide leaving the bend, steered out further in the stretch, took
over with a sixteenth remaining and just held over the late charge from the runner-up. ALIGATO was off slow and climbed a bit early on, angled five wide
leaving the turn, rallied determinedly in the final furlong and just missed. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased the top pair outside a pair of rivals, bid three deep
at the five-sixteenths pole, took over in upper stretch while drifting out and yielded in the final sixteenth. BRIX chased off the pace early on, angled out then
back inward in the stretch, bumped rival at the sixteenth pole and got up for a minor award. RIFEY broke slow and bumped rival at the start, took the turn
three then four wide, weaved through traffic in the stretch and kept on to improved position. TOO LATE pressed the pace from outside, headed rival midway
around the turn, vied between into the stretch, could not kick on in the late stages and got bumped at the sixteenth pole. PLAY CHICKEN settled inside, got
blocked behind DREAM ROBBER checking early, moved off the rail, swung four wide into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, angled inward and could
not rally. ME LIKEY jumped the track crossing surfaces early, angled to the inside while forwardly placed, chased the top pair through the turn and flattened
out in the drive. CROSSWORD set the pace under pressure from outside, was headed by rival at the five-sixteenths pole, vied two wide around the turn and
weakened down the lane. PREACHING TRAINER was off slow to begin, got bothered a bit nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, went four to five wide around
the turn, was crowded between rivals and steadied in upper stretch and faded. DREAM ROBBER was forwardly placed along the inside then had to check
hard early, tracked in mid-pack from the rail into the turn, saved ground to the lane and weakened.
