Footnotes
MY DIXIE LASS was well rated three wide early, made a four wide move on the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch to
prove much the best under mild left handed crop urging. QUEEN CADENCE set a fast pace early, then was headed on the far turn, proved to be no match
for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. TIMEISGOLDEN was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace four to three wide, made a
three wide bid on the far turn to vie for command but came up empty, got nod for the show award. LIFE IS ETERNAL was reserved early on the inside, then
finished evenly late while just losing the bob for the show award. LAST OFFENSE stalked the early pace three wide, came five wide into the drive and
weakened. PEACEARELLA was well placed early on the inside and stopped.

the turn and then drew off in the furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. FAIR LASSIE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and
made a four wide bid on the turn to vie for command nearing the quarter pole, but could not go with the winner while getting up to be second best.
COURTING JENNY dueled for the early lead on the inside, then checked on the turn, then shifted to the outside and came five wide into the drive to be up
for the show late. HILL VALLEY dueled for the early lead three wide, then was two wide by the quarter pole and weakened on the inside in the drive.
ALLISON K was reserved early, then advanced three wide by the quarter pole but lacked a rally late.

pace while clear, then was rated along the backstretch, then drew clear again on the turn and remained clear by the furlong marker, but was headed nearing
the sixteenth pole and weakened, lost show late. TEACHER DRAMA was settled back early, then was three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.

DETERMINED LOVE was well placed on the inside, awaited room by the quarter pole, made a inside move leaving the turn and quickly responded and took
over by the furlong marker, then drew clear to prove best under a drive. HONORABLE LILLY prompted the pace and made a three to four wide bid leaving
the turn, could not match strides with the winner while finishing willingly to be second best. WILL TAKE ROSES steadied after the start, then was rated
along the inside, eased out and moved up between horses by the quarter pole, then was blocked by the furlong marker and angled out for racing room, then
was up for the show award, rough trip. BALI was allowed to settle early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and shifted out five wide by the three
sixteenths and offered a belated rally. STORMY SPELL was rated along three wide, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention but came
up empty in the lane. NORA RADD set the early pace and was well rated on the inside, came off the inside leaving the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. TRIPP ROAD had no response.

Footnotes
GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, continued that bid to edge clear late under a
drive. SHETALKSTOMUCH was taken back early, then advanced on the turn and was six wide by the quarter pole, came seven wide into the drive and
closed well on the outside to get the place award at the wire. KATESALUCKYGIRL was well placved on the inside throughout, made a inside bid leaving the
turn, needed more late while losing the bob for the place award. MADE TO HUSTLE set the early pace and shook clear on the turn while in the two path,
then held a short lead by the furlong marker and faded late. SISTER SADIE chased the early pace and was four wide by the quarter pole but had no rally.
TIP TOP TAPPER was allowed to settle early and lacked a solid rally. ROSES FROM HEAVEN prompted the pace three wide then chased the pace
between horses on the turn and weakened. SOCIAL EXCLUSION failed to menace.

Footnotes
HONESTA was reserved early towards the inside, then came three wide into the drive, angled in leaving the furlong marker, closed well on the inside to get
up in time under a drive. GLOSSY MADRINA chased the pacesetter and made a three wide bid in the lane, slowly wore down that rival to lead late but was
denied on the wire. REAWAKENED set the early pace while clear, dug in gamely in the drive but was caught late. NORMANS GIRL GAYLE was settled
back early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally. BUSTINMYGROOVE was allowed to settle early, made a mild bid four wide on
the turn and drifted out leaving the turn and came up empty. R CHERRY chased the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. MISS ALEX lacked a
rally. MIZSHIPMAN was allowed to settle early and was six wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
