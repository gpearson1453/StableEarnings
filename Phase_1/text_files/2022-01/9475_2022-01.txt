Footnotes
WORSE READ SANCHEZ was off a bit slow, pulled and had to steady off heels on the first turn, angled three wide into the drive, bid three deep in upper
stretch while drifting inward, reached the front with a sixteenth to go and inched ahead late. EREBUS sped to the front and angled to the inside, set the pace
under pressure up the backstretch, dueled around the second bend, fought with a pair of rivals in the lane and yielded grudgingly to the winner late. JACK
SIXPACK broke slow, was forwardly placed three wide early then prompted the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn and into the lane, vied
between rivals in upper stretch, then flattened in the late stages. VANISKY was off slow from outside, moved down to the inside on the first turn, trailed
under coaxing, exited the far turn two wide and improved position. FORE FLAG was off a bit slow to begin, caught in traffic between foes and off heels
shortly after, brushed with rival while angling out to the three path on the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep between foes in the middle stages, got caught
in a bit tight early on the first turn, went two wide into the lane and was kept to task through the final furlong. BIG PAPA STEVE hit the gate and came away
slowly, stalked inside then had to steady on the first turn, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. PHILOSOPHER'S TONE brushed with inner rival
while three then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace four deep up the backstretch, came three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CAUSE SHE'S A LADY was off alertly then cleared inside rival, padded the lead on the turn along the rail, then widened under left-handed encouragement
and strong handling in the stretch. TIZZY TWISTER broke a step slow then quickly recovered and went up inside the leader, ceded the lead and moved
back to a stalking position, chased two then three wide around the bend and ran on for a clear second. BLONDE BOMBSHELL hopped and came away
very slow, saved ground through the bend and showed a mild rally to earn the show. GHOSTEM hustled early from inside then had to steady when crowded
a bit by TIZZY TWISTER, angled off the rail, went three then four wide on the turn and weakened. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ broke a bit slow from outside,
sat off the pace early on, navigated the turn four wide and lacked rally. BELLE MY BELLE stumbled at the start, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went
three wide around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
FAST DRAW MUNNINGS got bumped from inside leaving the gate, stalked outside a pair of rivals, bid three deep on the far turn, dueled with STRAIGHT
UP G leaving the bend, battled down the stretch and dug in to prove best. STRAIGHT UP G prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the
three-eighths pole, took a short lead soon after, dueled with FAST DRAW MUNNINGS into and down the stretch and was bested in the end. FINNEUS
broke a step slow, traveled between rivals and became rank at the five-eighths pole, entered the lane three wide and chased the top pair to the wire,
finished a clear third. AGADOR SPARTACUS stumbled leaving the gate, went three to four wide on the first turn, trailed up the backstretch, angled in on the
second bend and was not a factor. SIPPIN N KISSIN broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked along the inside, got put in tight quarters and
steadied early on the far turn, eased off the rail and came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. HIGHLAND GHOST set the pace under
pressure from outside, was headed with three-eighths remaining, ceded control and could not keep up with a quarter mile left to run, tired in the lane, was
guided to the outside and eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
HAIL FREEDOM pressed the pace from outside into and around the bend, took over in upper stretch, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and held safely.
REALLY BIG NEWS stalked along the inside then moved to the two path around the bend, finished well through the final furlong but could not threaten the
winner. SQUARE CAT sped to the front and got pressured by HAIL FREEDOM, maintained a short advantage through the turn and into the lane, was
overtaken in upper stretch and flattened to third. LIMITED HEATWAVE broke slow and lost his path at the start, went two wide into the turn then angled to
the rail and kept on through the drive to earn a minor award. SAWASDEE was off a bit slow but recovered quickly and was forwardly placed off the rail then
outside a rival, navigated the turn three wide and weakened down the lane. LEMON SUSHI settled off the pace, went three wide around the turn and proved
no menace. PARTYOFSIXTEEN broke in, chased along the rail off the pace, lost his path into the turn, remained inside to the stretch and failed to make an
impact.

Footnotes
MAKE MINE WINE pressed the issue from outside early on, took over nearing the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and drew away. ARTHUR
SPOONER broke well from outside then moved back a bit to stalk from outside, went three wide around the turn and outkicked BIG GUN for the place
honors. BIG GUN lacked early speed then hit a nice stride and advanced up the backstretch, chased two wide into the stretch and got outkicked for second.
SMILING GOODBYE showed the way under pressure from outside, lost command approaching the quarter pole, fought to upper stretch and weakened
along the inside. BIG EVENT stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail and lacked further response. STAY LIT chased
off the inside, two to three wide around the bend and was not a factor. REAL POUCH was off a bit slow to start, tracked four then three wide on the turn and
lacked a rally. DON DANIEL broke a step slow, raced off the pace under coaxing, took the turn three then four wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
ALIGATO broke out and bumped rival, settled off the pace, closed in around the far turn and tipped three wide, bid four deep in upper stretch and kicked
clear at the sixteenth pole. CAMINO DEL PARAISO got brushed from inside at the start, moved to the inside to stalk the pace, waited for room leaving the
far turn and lacked room in upper stretch, dove down to the inside nearing the eighth pole and rallied for the place. FERRARIANO stalked the lone leader in
the two path, bid outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, yielded to the winner in midstretch and lost the place. LUVLUV got bumped and
squeezed between rivals at the start, steered to the inside, tipped out leaving the second bend, angled back down to the rail in the stretch and improved
position. BIG FISH brushed the gate and was off slow, was unhurried at the back outside a rival, swung four wide into the lane and failed to threaten.
INDIAN PEAK pulled early then steadied on the first turn, stalked off the rail in the middle stages, took aim three wide exiting the far turn but weakened
down the stretch. WHOOPING JAY sped clear to establish the front early, showed the way to the far turn, pressured by FERRARIANO around the bend, lost
the lead in upper stretch, fought back to midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE sped to the front, remained unchallenged to the top of the stretch, put to right-handed urging in the drive and stayed clear to the wire.
ALICE MARBLE stalked the leader from inside, went two wide into the stretch, finished willingly in the furlong grounds but had to settle for second best.
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM raced in range in the three path, lacked the needed response in the stretch run but kept on to secure the show. WARREN'S
SHOWTIME chased off the pace, steadied briefly off heels on the turn, swung seven wide leaving the turn and missed the show. NARDINI was forwardly
placed in the beginning then had to check behind the leader, chased three wide then angled out and came five wide into the stretch and lacked a late bid.
SEDAMAR traveled in mid-pack in the three path, steered out to the five path and could not offer the needed response when called upon. REBALATION
was taken back early, moved down to the two path, angled out leaving the turn, produced a mild rally and improved position. SHE'S DEVOTED dropped
back off the pace, went three wide into the turn, angled out six wide into the stretch and failed to menace. GOVERNOR GOTEVEN tracked off the inside
then moved down and raced a bit off the rail on the turn, entered the stretch two wide and weakened in the lane. CALIFORNIA KOOK was off slow to begin,
tucked inside on the turn, angled out near the dirt crossing and made no impact. SUPER GAME stalked along the inside, steadied briefly on the turn, angled
out late on the bend and came up empty in the drive. SMILING SHIRLEE raced off the pace, angled to the two path for the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE sped to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, set all the pace to the lane, drew away in upper stretch and held safely under
hand urging. POSITIVITY stumbled leaving the gate, stalked from inside, cut the corner into the stretch and finished well to whittle the gap while gaining the
place. LETSGETLUCKY was coaxed early chasing the leader up the backstretch, went three then two wide around the turn, could not produce a bid in the
final furlong and stayed on to hold the show. PRINCIPE CARLO broke well then moved into a stalking position, took the turn three wide and flattened out in
the final sixteenth. RIFEY lacked early speed, traveled along the inside, swung five wide exiting the turn and passed tired rivals. COLT FICTION dropped
back early, took the turn three wide and never got involved. PEACEFUL TRANSFER settled out of range early, went two wide into the turn, steered four
wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. LOUD MOUTH was off a bit slow to begin, tracked the pace outside a rival, went four then three wide on the turn
and tired.

Footnotes
ROSE DAWSON was off a bit slow to begin, drifted out a bit into the first turn, traveled near the back of the pack in the middle stages, swung out at the top
of the lane, surged from outside and took over at the sixteenth pole and edged away. BIG NOVEL settled inside, shifted two wide nearing the stretch, tipped
three wide in upper stretch, reached the front with a furlong remaining and got outkicked by ROSE DAWSON in the final sixteenth. VIVACIOUS VANESSA
pulled early first time through the stretch, raced in mid-pack then moved closer three deep leaving the backstretch, exited the far turn four wide, bid five
deep in the lane and faltered in deep stretch. ELLAMIRA was off a bit slow at the start, checked between rivals soon after, moved to the inside, saved
ground to the stretch, tried to split foes at the eighth pole but lacked room and was forced to check, gained room and kept on to round out the superfecta.
DENDERA checked early between rivals, tucked inside on the first turn, went between foes on the second bend, waited for room at the quarter pole, went
three wide into the lane, checked again between foes in upper stretch and kept to task after gaining a clear path. MADIHA got bumped from outside at the
start, pulled early, went three then two wide on the first turn, angled five wide leaving the second bend and summoned a mild rally. ELEUTHERA broke in
and bumped rival, went up outside PROFESSORS' PRIDE to duel for the lead, battled around the far turn and into the stretch, relinquished the lead with a
furlong remaining and weakened late. MUNNY PENNY stalked the top pair through the early going, raced two to three wide into the stretch, got crowded at
the eighth pole and weakened. VAPING ANGEL got floated out into the four path entering the first turn then angled to the rail around that bend, traveled two
wide into the second bend, angled four wide entering the stretch, came in a bit in the drive and failed to menace. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE drifted out entering
the first turn, steered out wide on the backstretch, went five then four wide on the far turn and weakened. PRECIOUS INSIGHT stalked the pace in the two
path, moved out a bit then got shuffled between runners near the five-sixteenths pole, had her path taken by the winner at the top of the stretch and
weakened. PROFESSORS' PRIDE dueled for command inside ELEUTHERA to the stretch, battled to the eighth pole and gave way along the rail.
