Footnotes
MY WYNTER ECHO saved ground rallying to bid on the far turn surging clear in upper stretch holding sway in the three and four paths.
LONGDRINKOFWATER stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch proving no match for the winner while saving place. RACK DADDY slow early gave a
mild rally to upper stretch finding best stride late. FAIRY faded along the inside on the far turn finishing evenly to best the others. GIRLINTHEFIREPLACE
played no factor. SEE YOU AT THE BAR sent clear set the pace being hooked on the far turn wilting in upper stretch. VOODOOISM was always outrun.
PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2022-MVR-35, DATED 02/25/2022. MY WYNTER ECHO WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
