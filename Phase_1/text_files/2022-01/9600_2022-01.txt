Footnotes
CAMPEADOR checked back to last early, was behind a wall of horses coming off the turn and into the stretch in a tightly-packed field, split foes with a
sixteenth remaining and edged away. LOYAL LOUIE raced in midpack early, came four wide into the stretch, and finished well outside rivals to get up for
second. DRUM AND DRUMMER set the pace inside to deep stretch, and had enough to salvage the show spot. WHERE'S JOEY raced four wide in striking
range, bid between horses through midstretch and was outkicked. WAR FEATHER got shut off behind MR. COOL at the start, put in a five-wide run coming
off the turn, loomed outside through the furlong grounds but weakened late. HIGH YIELD KITTEN lacked the needed closing bid inside. PRIDE AND
PASSION raced five wide and could not reach contention. THE RED MAN was five wide at the top of the stretch, and made no headway. MR. COOL broke
outward several paths, checked soon after, was mired behind horses on the rail turning for home, and had no response when clear. NAVY PIER chased
between horses three wide early, and faltered. PALIZA chased between horses two wide early, and had nothing left in the drive.

Footnotes
AMERICAN TAP raced in contention along the inside through early stages, tipped out two wide approaching the upper stretch, roused forward to challenge
WORKINONBEINGSINGLE for the late lead, dug in under right handed pressure and edged away. WORKINONBEINSINGLE sprinted to the lead and
angled inside soon after the start, showed the way into the turn and held a slim lead over INDIA PILAGA, widened to a clear advantage turning for home,
came under attack from AMERICAN TAP in deep stretch, fought back under left handed urging and got denied in final strides. ILKNUR was not too far back
in early stages, saved ground through the turn, angled out three wide in the upper stretch and ran on to secure a share. GREGS POSSE came away last
and angled inside to save ground, came off the inside at the head of the lane then moved back inside, gained position then finished evenly. TUDOX
ROADSTER chased three to four wide in range, sustained a bid through the turn then gave way. POLISHED LADY raced off the early pace, was ridden
along four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) raced two wide in striking distance around the turn and tired in the
drive.

Footnotes
TUWAIM stalked the pace in the clear in the two path, closed determinedly and was up on the wire. FROSTED FAITH set a clear pace along the rail,
switched leads near the quarter pole and appeared to lose some momentum, re-cleared in upper stretch and led until the final stride. OUT WORK'N chased
the top two while racing three wide and lasted for the show. READY TO FLY failed to menace while racing four wide. ROYAL HARRY was bumped off stride
just after the start, gave chase three wide and lacked a response. WHATA GUY bumped with SCREENPLAY just after the start, had brief speed inside,
retreated around the turn and was easing through the lane. SCREENPLAY was bumped between foes just after the start, trailed two wide and was easing
through the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH FRONT popped clear after the start, rated along unbothered to the stretch, and widened under pressure while drifting out. MAYA PRINCE was
outsprinted early, cut the corner finding stride turning for home, moved to the three-path and rallied past rivals for the place. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE)
moved off the inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, and lacked the needed response. HILARIOUS AFFAIR broke a step slow, trailed to the top of
the stretch, and passed tired horses on the far outside. INDIA INK saved ground in pursuit of the pacesetter for three furlongs, and tired. OUTLAW KID
chased the pace two to three wide, and tired through the stretch. PORK CHOP was finished early two wide. STARTING UP raced three to four wide, and
dropped far back after three-eighths of a mile. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE. TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
CONVERTER cleared on top and angled in soon after the start, set the pace by a comfortable margin up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, roused
for more turning for home, responded gamely, turned back the bid from VINNY DREAM and finished clear. VINNY DREAM was forwardly placed out of the
chute and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, began to edge up closer nearing the quarter pole then given cue turning for home, was set down four
wide in the upper stretch, raced in striking range of CONVERTER but had to settle for second best. MACHO REAL raced outside in last flight, was ridden
two to three wide into the upper stretch, ran on with interest and cleared the rest. KLEON angled inside and raced in the last flight, saved ground entering
the stretch run and passed tiring foes. BEYOND MY DREAMS rated off the second flight up the backstretch, failed to progress under urging around the turn
then gave way. EASTERN SYMPHONY stalked the pace through the backstretch, chased around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

BARGAINAIRE saved ground early in the second flight, stayed on the rail and got past a tiring SWEET PENELOPE in upper stretch, set sail after MIZZEN
while staying glued to the fence, and overhauled that rival to win going away. MIZZEN was well placed off the dueling leaders into the turn, took over with a
three-wide run after straightening away for the drive, kicked clear into the final furlong, but was no match for the winner late. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL raced two
wide around the turn, offered a mild response in the stretch and went clear of the remainder. SWEET PENELOPE vied inside PANAREA early, edged away
from that one after a half-mile, came into the stretch in the two-path facing challengers from both sides, and gave way. KATIESDREAMGIRL broke slowly,
and was never close. PANAREA contested the pace outside SWEET PENELOPE for a half, and tired.

Footnotes
KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) saved ground around the first turn, remained near the inside and rated near midpack up the backstretch, waited for a clear path
around the far turn then roused three wide into the upper stretch, gathered momentum under a drive and drew clear. GRAND AVE GIRL held a slim lead
around the first turn then vied inside of DAWN'S DANCER up the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead around the final turn, shook clear entering the
upper stretch, stayed on with response but failed to hold off the winner in late stages. DAWN'S DANCER was forwardly placed around the first turn then
vied outside of GRAND AVENUE GIRL up the backstretch, battled for the lead around the far turn, could not match strides approaching the upper stretch
but ran on and secured show. WICKED GROOVE raced two wide around the first turn and settled off the early pace, circled up closer late on the far turn,
launched a five wide bid into the lane and had a mild improve. HALLAWALLAH tracked the pace outside through early stages, came under a ride around the
final turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. KAHIKO stalked the pace up the backstretch, waited inside then launched a bid leaving
the turn, raced just off the inside in the upper stretch then gave way a furlong out. WHY NOT TONIGHT rated off the second flight up the backstretch, was
ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. HELPING LISA D was reserved racing in the back, saved ground while hustled
along into the upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
UNA LUNA settled in range inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, kicked in nearing the eighth pole, swept to front near the sixteenth pole and
quickly cleared. KITTEN'S ROMANCE tracked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the stretch, was
overhauled near the sixteenth pole and fought on to hold second. DANGER tucked in two wide in midpack around the first turn, saved ground around the far
turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. MADEIRA WINE saved ground off the runaway pacesetter, edged closer inside around the far turn,
tipped out near the eighth pole and was one-paced between foes in the final furlong. CENTSLESS DRAMA sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and
weakened in the lane. FRANKIE'S GIRL lacked early speed while racing two wide, steadied midway around the first turn, continued two wide around the far
turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MY SWEET WIFE saved ground and failed to menace. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT had her head turned
at the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, edged closer four wide around the far turn and was
one-paced through the lane. SWEET PEARL was outrun inside. ANONYMOUSLY threw her head as the gates opened and was off well last, raced three
wide and never threatened. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY played no factor while racing two and three wide. STARRY HOPE lunged at the start and trailed
inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
