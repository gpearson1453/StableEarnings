Footnotes
TICK TOCK sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. A DIME FOR ME chased the
leaders while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. CARRIE'S SUCCESS settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. BLACKBERRY LISA was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and
lacked the needed closing response. SHARMEL threw her head at the start, raced unhurried early and was not a factor. MY EXPRESSION showed no early
speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. COSMIC TRIPSTER was void of early foot , raced three-wide through the turn and did not
menace.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN RIDER stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off through the lane.
BODEGA raced four-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but
failed to gain on the winner late. BLUES RAPPER was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but
lacked the needed closing response. OFF THE BOOKS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. CAPTAIN
DASHI disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. MY PAL was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn
and was not a factor. LUCKY CHANCE broke through the gate prior to the start, lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not
offer a bid. FISHIN THE RIVER was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN MEMORY was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and quickly drew
off. THE MET broke sharply to duel for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but held to
save the place. NOT THAT SERIOUS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. HEY NOW disputed the pace from
the inside and gave way through the final furlong. DRINKING AGAIN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
EXECUTIVE ACTION was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ABRAAJ MIRAGE showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. CERNAN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second
