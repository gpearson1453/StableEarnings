through the turn extending four wide into upper stretch proving no match for the winner holding on to salvage place. BUSYBEING FABULOUS slow early
lost ground to upper stretch giving a late move six wide to gain position. SKIPSHOT LILLY slow early lagged to upper stretch showing some late interest
there. WELLOILEDCAT slow early played no factor. TREASURE WILBURNYA breaking slowly was not involved. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE tracked evenly
to upper stretch fading the final eighth. HIDDEN PRIDE chased through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. ALL THE BEST was always outrun.

Footnotes
MAGIC CREDIT stalked the pace looming to upper stretch rallying clear at mid track. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE pressed a narrow lead through the turn shaking
clear in upper stretch being grabbed from the outside late. CHARGE IT ALL saved ground rallying to upper stretch bidding gamely there along the rail.
HARD TO ACCESS pressed the pace dueling all out on the turn weakening in upper stretch. BLUE ROCKETTE played no factor. BIRDIE BLUE was always
outrun. COOKIN ROSES pressured between horses steadying back past the three eighths pole. A STEWARDS CONDCUTED AN INQUIRY INTO AN
INCIDENT NEAR THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE AND TOOK NO ACTION.
