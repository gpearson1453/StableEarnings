Footnotes
FORT BONZ showed the way two wide around the first turn, cleared his inner vying counterpart into the far turn, but got headed by a bidding MAGNOLIA
RIDGE at the five sixteenths pole, repelled that rival in upper stretch, but greenly bumped the inner railing at the furlong grounds, took a sixteenth of a mile
to regain stride as the aforementioned foe re-bid, but spurted away again late. MAGNOLIA RIDGE was briefly restless in the gate while waiting for other
rivals to load, then hesitated at the start while hopping a bit, settled off of the pace three wide, gained four wide into the far turn to bid for the lead outside of
FORT BONZ, forged a brief advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was turned away in upper stretch, then kept on to re-bid entering the final sixteenth as
the leader raced greenly, but was kept at bay. MORE HARDER saved ground in midpack around the turn, then stayed on along the rail to gain show leaving
the furlong grounds. NICE STAR stalked while tucking from the three path to the two path around the first turn, gained mildly four wide turning for home to
bid for show between horses entering the lane, but hung on his left lead thereafter, and got outkicked by an inner rival. MY LITTLE LEO laid off of the pace
two wide, improved four to five wide turning for home to bid for show outside of rivals entering the lane, but flattened out. RUNWILDWITHDREAMS bumped
an outer rival at the start, vied along the inside of the eventual winner around the first turn, failed to keep pace with that foe into the far turn, and faded
between horses through the lane. SOLAR STAR raced far off of the pace while in the five path, got caught five wide around the far turn, and failed to factor.
CLASSIC'S OMEGA took up when put to a bit of tight quarters between horses at the start, trailed the field, and never got involved. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS
stumbled a few strides after the start, tracked the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, stalked before getting outmoved by an outer foe with
three furlongs remaining, then weakened turning for home. BIT PART shied from an inner foe at the start while being slow into stride, took the first turn in
the six path while far off of the pace, and was done early, then eased through the lane.

Footnotes
EVERLOVINGHAND tracked two wide while in the three path around the first turn, gained outside of foes into the far turn to bid three wide at the three
furlong grounds, assumed command entering the lane, drew off under driving pressure approaching midstretch, and was geared down through the closing
stages. CHARLIE G trailed early on, gained four wide around the far turn, then sustained a rally through the lane to bid for place entering the final furlong,
and drove clear of a inner foe for that position a sixteenth out. PORT O' CALL settled far off of the pace three wide, gained to track the pace four wide
around the far turn, then rallied through the lane to bid for place entering the final furlong as an outer CHARLIE G did the same, but was outkicked for that
position at the sixteenth pole. DUVEE ranked bore to the four path while off of the pace into the first turn, tucked to the two path around that bend, shifted to
the three path in upper stretch, then chased to pass tiring foes in the late stages for a minor share. ONEFORVIVI saved ground at the rear of the field,
improved entering the lane, shifted to the four path in midstretch while under light encouragement, and passed tired foes. APACHE TEARS bumped an
outer foe at the start, vied two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but proved no match for his outer counterpart at the quarter pole, and
weakened while losing place in the early stages of the final furlong. DOCTRINAIRE bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, but was outmoved
by the eventual winner into the far turn, sustained his chase into upper stretch, but faded through the final furlong. ENCHANTED MOON set the pace, vied
inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. PERMANENTDETENTION took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, got
floated outwardly into the first turn while far off of the pace, and never got involved. OLE STUD MUFFIN tracked along the inside, but faded around the far
turn, and was eased through the lane.

AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN took mild bump from an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, rated just behind the leaders around the turn,
split those rivals passing the quarter pole, took over at the three-sixteenths, and drew off with good energy. HERE COMES LOVIE trailed in the three path
around the turn, split foes five wide approaching the final furlong, and rallied to reach place at the sixteenth pole. MARAMA bumped an outer rival at the
start, tracked along the inside, improved two wide and between horses in midstretch, then caught an outer tiring foe for show in the very late stages. THIEF
OF HEARTS vied for the lead two wide and between horses, led around the bend, but proved no match for an inner bidding foe at the three sixteenths pole,
and tired through the final sixteenth. SKY FACTOR prompted the pace three wide, but faded in upper stretch. WINK TEXAS got a bit antsy awaiting the
start, vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, but yielded approaching the final five-sixteenths, and weakened thereafter. SCARLETT O'HARA
tracked three to four wide around the turn, chased five to six wide and outside of foes through upper stretch, but failed to factor.

SEVEN SCENTS vied for the lead three two wide into the turn while outside of LOOKIN FOR LOKI, sustained the long duel through the lane with that foe,
and prevailed. LOOKIN FOR LOKI vied for the lead two wide and between horses early on, cleared an inner foe into the turn, battled inside of his outer
counterpart via a long duel through the lane, but yielded late, and held place. CHIMNEY ROCK vied along the inside of a pair of foes early on, rated back to
stalk those foes into the turn, shifted outside of them entering the lane, chased without progressing through upper stretch, grinded away on their margin late,
but missed reaching place. MCFEELY raced at the rear two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and rallied for a minor share. HONEY WON'T tracked
from midpack three wide, but only managed to chase evenly through midstretch, and lacked a bid. MISTER BANJOMAN turned his head to the left just
before the gates opened causing him to be unprepared for the start and break slowly, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to
factor. TAPIZARS SECRET saved ground in midpack around the turn, but faded. PALVERA was outrun along the inside.

KASEN'S SISTER vied for the lead two wide and between horses early on, but was forced to brush an inner foe at the nine sixteenths pole due to an outer
CHEYANN GLITTERS shifting inwardly, showed the way from a pair of outer vying foes into the turn, drew clear of them at the five sixteenths pole, and held
sway while hanging on her left lead. APHRODITES REVENGE vied along the inside of a group of foes early on, but was put to tight quarters at the
nine-sixteenths pole, got shuffled to a stalking position due to the incident, bid for place inside of foes at the quarter pole as the leader drew off, and proved
second best. SONG OF PARADISE saved ground far off of the pace, then improved along the rail in the final furlong to reach show late. STAR PRADO
broke a step slowly at the start and raced well off of the pace into the turn, split foes while being floated from the five to six path turning for home, and rallied
outside of rivals through the lane, but was outkicked by an inner foe for show. ENOUGH HEART vied for the lead four to three wide, but failed to keep pace
with an inner foe at the five sixteenths pole, and faltered between horses late. CHEYANN GLITTERS vied for the lead three wide, shifted inwardly at the
nine sixteenths pole while not leaving room for a pair of inner foes, then failed to keep pace with the eventual winner at the five-sixteenths, and weakened
late. TEMPLE QUEST bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked the leading trio from the four path around the turn, but faded. EMERY'S DREAM laid off
of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK lagged behind the field, and passed tiring
foes in upper stretch. MISSBUDLITELIME took the turn in the five path while off of the pace and weakened in the seven path entering the lane.
KOHENSRISING chased from midpack while in the four path around the turn, and weakened at the three furlong pole. THE RIDER OF APHRODITES
REVENGE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF KASEN'S SISTER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE BACKSTRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED

WHO TOOK THE MONEY settled off of the pace in the five to four path around the first turn while outside of rivals, picked up stride turning for home, rallied
with a good kick at the furlong grounds to take aim on a clear GRAND LUWEGEE, and reeled that foe in on the wire. GRAND LUWEGEE established a
clear advantage early on, maintained that loose lead around the far turn, widened his margin in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong as WHO TOOK
THE MONEY loomed large, and got nailed on the wire. TREYS MIDNITE MOON rated off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, swung to
the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly for a minor share. BUDRO TALKING bobbled slightly at the start and raced at the rear along the
inside around both turns, then shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and passed tired foes. SYDSTER tracked three wide, bid for place around the far
turn, but failed to sustain that bid, and faltered at the furlong grounds. GET THEM JUSTIN tracked along the inside, tugged in the bit into the backstretch,
but weakened through the final furlong. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT stalked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA stalked along the inside, bid for the lead through a wide rail opening entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway safely to the wire.
BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN broke a beat slowly, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted from the three path to the five path turning for
home while commencing a rally, and sustained that charge to reach place at the sixteenth pole without threatening the leader. BIG FALCON ROCKET set
the pace, shifted from the two to the three path while showing the way entering the lane, allowed ample racing room for an inner foe in the process, got
headed by that rival in upper stretch, drifted outwardly approaching the furlong grounds while tiring, and lost place at the sixteenth pole. CALL THE
COLONEL trailed while hung in the five path around the first turn, tucked entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn before bidding for show
inside of rivals at the furlong grounds, but failed to keep pace with an outer foe for that position leaving that junction, then kept on. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE
bobbled at the start, tracked the pace three wide, produced an early bid at the half mile pole, prompted the pace around the far turn, but weakened through
the final furlong. KING OF THE TESTO stalked two wide, vied between horses at the half mile pole as MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE forced his hand, then
weakened turning for home. WOMAN WITH A BOOK settled off of the pace in the three path, gained briefly in the four path turning for home, but got floated
six wide entering the lane, and flattened out. SKYCRAFT raced far off of the pace in the four path around the first turn, and got outrun.

RISKY REWARD tracked three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, grinded away through midstretch to bid for the lead passing the furlong pole, got up
at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. FLATTER ME SILLY got bumped by an inner foe and took back from tight quarters at the start, rated far off of the
pace in the two to three path around the turn, tipped to the seven path in upper stretch, and rallied well while outside of foes through the final furlong to
reach place on the wire. SALVAJE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked the pace along the inside, got outkicked by an outer rallying rival
while shifting to the three path at the furlong grounds, bid for place at the sixteenth pole, forged that position shortly after, but was nailed on the wire.

Footnotes
STAR APPEARANCE broke inwardly and solidly bumped CRYPTORITHM at the start, saved ground in midpack around the turns, tipped to the three path
while commencing a rally in midstretch, and caught the tiring leader on the wire. THE THREE KS stalked the clear leader from the outside, ranged up
around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch, but tired through the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT hesitated at the start, but
avoided trouble by doing so, trailed the field, swung six wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor share. MUSADA sped clear early on, but tired
around the far turn as THE THREE K'S closed in, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths, gave way, but saved a minor placing. DAVES FRIEND
DEWEY tracked the pace in the three path around the turns, and faded. I DON'T FLY COACH raced far off of the pace two wo three wide, came into the
lane in the seven path, and lacked a rally. STARVICTORY laid far off of the pace, shifted five wide entering the lane, and failed to make an impact.
CRYPTORITHM took a solid bump from an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace three to four wide, and was done early. THE SEVEN FURLONG
FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.
