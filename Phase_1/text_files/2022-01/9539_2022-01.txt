Footnotes
BANK ON ANNA showed good speed, set the pace on the inside, controlled the action around the turn, responded well when asked at the five-sixteenths,
powered away into upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong and widened under a brisk hand-ride while much the best. KISSES FOR
EMILY broke a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, gained along the rail on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the
three-sixteenths and safely secured the place while unable to threaten the winner. DARN THAT SONG was taken in hand early then rated while tugging
keenly at the bit, came under urging while let out approaching the half-mile pole, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and weakened but was best of the rest. LAOCHI moved up on the outside to race just off the pace, was
asked three wide on the turn, chased five wide into the stretch and tired. CINDY'S CHOICE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then came
back around and was reloaded, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the two path around the turn and capitulated. EASY PLAY settled on the
outside, dropped back under urging with a half-mile to run, went four to five wide on the turn, dropped to the two path coming to the quarter-pole and failed
to respond. HUDSON CANYON settled off the pace, dropped back in the four path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MY FIRST GRAMMY chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch advancing to take
command straightened away for home, went clear under a drive and was ridden out to the finish. OPT chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the place honors while never threatening the winner. AIR SHOW chased three
to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, tipped five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FINGAL dueled four then three wide
with DEVIOUS MO to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over sole command near the quarter pole, swung four wide for home and
was displaced from the front straightened away, then weakened to the finish. BOURBON BAY four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on
the turn, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and tired. BINGO JOHN three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn
getting placed to coaxing with three-eighths remaining, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired. DEVIOUS MO dueled from the two path with
FINGAL to his outside, got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and spun three wide at that station, then tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
HANDY broke out at the start then bumped with a foe early, was ridden along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, moved out while gaining into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. COLORMEPAZZI broke a half-step slow then bumped with an
opponent early, moved up under urging to set the pace, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, drew off
under a hand-ride into the final furlong, had the rider take a look behind him outside the sixteenth-pole, was put to a right-handed crop with a quickly
diminishing advantage coming to that pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. CHARGER angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground
under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. FAIR HAIRED BOY broke a
step slow, was taken up early then moved in, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to
rally. ROYAL REALM was off slow and spotted the front around four lengths, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to
rally. F F ROCKET broke out at the start then was hustled, raced on the outside under urging, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. MO MISCHIEF tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn and tired. RUDY ROD was slow into
stride and spotted the front a few lengths, had the rider lose his crop while un-cocking it early, angled to the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
MISTER LARRY just off the inside in closest pursuit of the gap duel up front, tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the leader a furlong out taking command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish to
prevail. HOT ROD RUMBLE hustled from the start, placed the latched on CENTRAL PRIDE in tight along his inside bumping that foe repeatedly for the
opening sixteenth of a mile before relenting the rail to that rival while knocking heads and widening away in tandem from the rest of the field, remained in
hand until placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home continuing the duel, shook off that rival and spun just off the inside for home, took to the inside
straightened away, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside, got collared nearing the sixteenth pole, dug in and held for the place honors
over a trio. MOPED DENNIS chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside
route into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. JUGGLER chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. CENTRAL PRIDE bobbled at the break and recovered under hustling, was latched on along
the inside of HOT ROD RUMBLE when placed in tight by that foe and bumped repeatedly through the opening sixteenth while widening away as a pair from
the rest of the field, refused to concede his rightful lane and was given clearance thereafter while engaged in head to head combat for command lightly
coaxed along, remained inside through the turn continuing the duel, got shaken off near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then
weakened in the final furlong. CLASH A. J. chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, SARATOGA SKY chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled three to
four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
BETTY'S SMILE went to the front, set the clear pace, dictated terms along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, drew off under a
drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. QUEENTIGUA broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was
brought back around and reloaded, bumped with a foe at the break, settled off the pace, saved ground while guided around the turn under heavy left-rein
pressure, came under a drive in upper stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. APPRECIATE settled under some restraint, raced in
hand in the two path around the early portion of the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths and improved to garner the show. GRAPE THERAPY chased
the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. CARLY HUSTLE was coaxed along off the
pace, went three wide under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to threaten. PAZZION was off slow and spotted the front two to three lengths,
went then three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and improved position without threatening. DAZZLING SPEED settled on the outside, was
urged four to five wide on the turn and came up empty. STORMI CAT LADY bumped with a rival at the start, was void of speed under urging, went three
wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor. MISSION TRAIL settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to
respond. GOING GOING GONE was urged along well back in the field, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. COOKIE COVE broke in and bumped
with a foe, was urged along towards the front, dropped back leaving the backstretch and retreated. TOOTSIE'S SONG bumped with a foe at the start,
chased the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, came up empty in the three path on the turn and also retreated.

FIRST CONSTITUTION (CHI) was hustled to the front, set the pace on the inside under pressure to the outside, shook clear with seven-sixteenths to run,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, drew off under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside
the sixteenth-pole then placed back under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. WHY WHY PAUL WHY went around the first turn in the two
path, settled comfortably in third position, was urged three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and safely secured the place while
no match for the winner. TWELVE VOLT MAN went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved
ground on the far turn and came up empty while best of the rest. FOREWARNED was last to commence while hustled, went around the first turn in the four
path, was coaxed along at the rear, went three wide while ridden along on the far turn and failed to threaten. CORE CONVICTION was hustled from the
start, pressed the pace on the outside in the two to three path, came up empty on the far turn and faltered.

OLIVER'S FORTUNE disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, shook clear with five-sixteenths to run, extended the advantage into
