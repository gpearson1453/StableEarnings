Footnotes
J T'S LA NENA stalked the pace of COASTAL RUN while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive, wore that rival down in the closing
yards and was going away late. MULLIGAN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. COASTAL RUN
sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final yards. OUR LITTLE TIGER was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. THRILL'S LEGACY was forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn and weakened in the drive.
BOOGIE TWO SHOES settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. CHARMANT E showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

stretch and did not menace. OBSTRUCTED VIEW settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. TIGER'S SONG was
void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN settled off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide

Footnotes
OPAL CREEK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and proved best late. ROPERS N WRANGLERS was
away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by SCAM LIKELY nearing the half, opened a clear margin with a
furlong to run but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. OUTLAW DAISY settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out with a furlong to
run and failed to gain late. PONTIFFANY pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. KEEP IT ROLLIN raced four-wide through the
first turn, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. LAFONDA was void of early speed, saved
ground through the second turn and did not menace. LIP'S OF WINE was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn
and did not offer a bid. SCAM LIKELY pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half and weakened. PHANTOM
MISTRESS was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
