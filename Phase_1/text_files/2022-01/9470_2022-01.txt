pole then faded into the far turn. PAINT IT GREEN rounded the opening turn three wide and stalked from the seven eighths pole, gave chase at the three

ROOKIE SALSA broke a bit awkwardly then took the lead and rated the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, contested the
advantage at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on well. ANOTHER VICTORY saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, couldn't gain through the stretch and just lasted in second. BOASTER settled back off the rail, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, came along for third late stretch and was gaining on the runner-up. MARTINKELLY stalked two deep and
moved to even terms into the backstretch, dueled from that point and raced close off the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride late stretch. BROTHER
CORBIN settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little
further. HOBE SOUND settled in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still in the four path and showed little
more.

in the three and four paths of the turn and came along for third late. NICE BUT NAUGHTY broke awkwardly, gave distant early chase, rounded the turn near

MS HEADLEY took the lead at the half mile pole and set the pace, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled through the lane. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT gave chase toward the outside, ran in the three path of the turn and settled for second.
COMPETENT gave chase through the backstretch, exchanged contact with Nancysaidso approaching the quarter pole, raced near the rail on the turn then
flattened stride. MAKE IT A DOUBLE chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail, drifted into the stretch then flattened late. STYLISH PAINT chased and
entered the turn about the three path, angled to the seven path toward the head of the lane and passed rivals outside. NANCYSAIDSO gave chase,
exchanged contact with Competent nearing the quarter pole then flattened stride. COUNTRY MAGIC proved no factor and rounded the turn about the four
path. BELLA GIANNA was not a factor and rounded the turn about the six path.

Footnotes
MISSIONSNINETYNINE took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three
eighths, dueled clear of Deshackled approaching the quarter, ran at the rail on the far turn and held well with steady handling. BOP MARLEY settled back
inside, bid into the backstretch, ran five wide on the far turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. PISTOL P stalked inside the
first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, was eased to the four path leaving the turn then flattened
stride late. LET US MAKE GOLD settled off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and finished well to pass rivals. DESHACKLED
stalked in the three path, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back nearing the quarter, continued close through the far turn then
weakened the final sixteenth. TWEET THIS settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then flattened
stride in the five path of the far turn. ELVIRUS rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. ROOF TOP BAR was never a factor.

Footnotes
TO THE FRONT rated a short lead while tapering inward, contested the edge off the rail on the turn, was met by BLACK CANDY entering the stretch but
dug in determinedly to put that one away through later yards. The latter chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and dueled to a slim
brief lead past the eighth pole, though, relented inside the sixteenth. GRAN CITY engaged in close early chase, ran in the four path of the turn and finished
evenly to duel for third mid-stretch. FLUENT IN SARCASM gave close chase through the backstretch, came through the turn in the three path then
weakened. MOSBY'S RANGER steadied near the rail in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane.
GAMING JACK gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted nearing the head of the lane and had little left. WARM SUNNY
BREEZE was not a factor and raced wide on the turn. STRETCH THE TRUTH gave close early chase then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
JESSICA took a quick clear lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest
the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly for the nod. KALENJIN stalked two deep, challenged at the three eighths pole and contested close through
the far turn, dug in gamely the final furlong but missed the nod. ALPINE MOON rounded the opening turn about the four path, started an outside bid nearing
the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then flattened later yards. WICKED JANE saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and ran in the three path of the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. LADY MACHO rated just off the pace and off the rail,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. TAKE CHARGE TINA saved
ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. DAZZLE ME rounded the opening turn about
the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. DUSTWHIRL WONDER ran in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
SUNMAN ran in the four path the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the eight path and dug in from the head
of the lane to get up the final strides. ADMIRE settled off the earlier pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch but was caught in the final strides. BANKER'S ISLAND saved ground and raced well back leaving the first turn, started a
bid past the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the seven path on the far turn, and while outfinished for the win, was gaining on the runner-up. FIT BUT FAT
stalked two deep then challenged at the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the three eighths and raced clear at the five sixteenths, but was caught
mid-stretch and weakened later yards. SUCCESSFUL ZIP settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little further. ODDS ON hustled clear and set the early pace inside, was met at the seven sixteenths
pole and dueled from that point, gave up the lead nearing the three eighths, dropped back at the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted
toward the head of the lane and weakened. PECULIAR SENSATION saved early ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened while
losing ground on the far turn. IRISHTOWN rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside leaving the turn, but showed little response down the
backstretch. HACKER MAN was not a factor.
