Footnotes
SOPHIE'S ANGEL settled off the pace and the inside, ranged up closer four wide turning for home, lost some ground to the leader, collared that one from
the outside with less than a furlong remaining, took over, held runner up at bay late. MONGOLIAN LOTUS lacked speed for a half, came three wide into the
lane, angled in steadily, finished up willingly to be clear for the place. TAPALONG with the pace outside, vied three wide through the turn, narrowly showed
the way into upper stretch, could not contain the top two, comfortably saved the show. COURTLY last to leave, dropped inside backstretch, saved ground
turn, improved position a bit, no real threat to the top three. SANDY SANGRIA stalked the early leaders off the inside, ranged up to lodge a brief bid in the
four path late in the turn, hung in th drive. HENRYS DEAL narrowly set the pace for a half along the inside, weakened through the stretch. COULD YOU
pressed the pace between horses, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TRULY A ROCKET with the pace from the start, narrowly showed the way through the turn closest to the inside, shook clear past the sixteenth marker,
enough left to last. PATTERN BET off a step slow, raced back toward the inside, steered out when beginning to advance late in the turn, late burst outside
the winner to be rapidly closing the gap on that one at the wire. PUNCHY GIRL raced up front outside the winner and between horses, dueled with that one
into and through upper stretch, proved no match for that one late nor could she contain the runner up. WAR MUSIC back off the pace, angled out four wide
turning into the lane, improved position while remaining well out in the strip. HAMAZING DEBATE settled off the pace while racing in the two path, lacked a
response. TWENTYTWENTYREDO hesitated at the start to spot the field a few lengths, remained sluggish in the run up the backstretch, came three wide
out of the turn, late arally to improve position, no real threat. SATET broke back, raced outside up the backstretch, three out to four wide through the turn,
also improved position without posing a serious threat. GOLD STRATEGY in the second flight outside, four wide exiting the turn, failed to respond. SOBER
SUNDAY off slowly, remained back while saving ground. LIGHTNING HART flashed some early speed up the backstretch on the outside, gave way in the
drive. VALENTINE ANGEL forwardly placed along the inside, began a steady retreat after a quarter.

Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE lacked early foot inside, two to three wide late turn when moving closer, blocked into the stretch, steered to the inside, rallied up the rail to
lodge a late bid, led final strides, enough left to hold off the runner up. CALIFORNIA SWING well back early along with the winner, angled out five wide
turning into the stretch, angled five wide into the lane, steady rally down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. CHAKRA dueled up front in
the two path, disposed of the other speed turning for home to be clear past the furlong marker, failed to contain the top two while remaining clear of the
others. TAPPIN FORA DANCE in the second flight while racing in the two path, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. FUTILE well back
off the pace and the inside, floated out six wide by the runner up exiting the turn, managed to only pick off a couple of tiring rivals while widest through the
lane. VERRAZANO FIRST in the second group while racing three wide, tired in the drive. RIVER RULER settled off the pace outside, four wide turning for
home, failed to muster a rally. TOMATO BILL set or forced the pace along the inside four furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
ALEXANDROS in mid pack for a half inside, saved ground when moving closer late in the turn, challenged while continuing inside approaching the furlong
grounds, finished up willingly to prove best. CAVE RUN away in good order, raced with the pace while between horses, narrowly showed the way upper
stretch, responded when challenged by the winner soon after, gave ground grudgingly to that one the final sixteenth, clear of the others. FLAT LUCKY void
of speed, came three wide out of the turn, shifted out a bit when straightened for home, along for the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. BULL
HOLLOW broke on top, held a slight advantage in the run up the backstretch just off the inside, dueled into the lane, weakened from between the top two
the final furlong, caught for the show. BABY I'M PERFECT with the pace on the outside, continued to vie while in the four path turn, faltered in the drive.
WILD BEHAVIOR last to leave, trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after swinging out four wide out of the turn. FREUDIAN FATE in the second
flight in the two path and outside the winner, tired through the stretch. WAR DETONATOR finished early, well back.

Footnotes
WOBBERJOD broke on top, alternated up front off the inside, asked along into the lane, shook off the other speed past the furlong marker and kicked clear
under continued steady handling. SHACKS WAY also away well, dueled up front inside the winner, could not match strides with that one the final furlong,
clearly second best. SEASIDE BOY void of early foot, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit for room in the drive, rallied through traffic while not a
threat to the top pair. THE FEATURE in the second flight along the inside, angled out to be three wide and outside the top two when moving slightly closer
turning for home, had nothing more for that duo, caught late for the show. FUNANDFUNNY in the second group while racing in the two path, lacked a
closing kick. HARD TO PARK lacked speed inside, continued to save ground to no avail. MR. COUGAR pushed in at the break, three wide up the
backstretch, two path into the lane, failed to menace. LOCH GARMAN off slowly, raced back early as a result, was four wide into the turn, three wide exiting,
passed a couple of faltering rivals to improve slightly. DEMIGOD also away slowly, trailed well back for a half, passed tiring rivals as well while never a
serious threat. MAJOR CHANCE broke inward, was straightened to race in mid pack for four furlongs, had little for the drive. WINDY NATIONS in the
second flight early, tired while racing outside. FALLEN EMPIRE was finished before a half.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S BATTLE with the early pace while between rivals, dueled through the turn off the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, not
threatened to the wire under steady handling. CURBS AND CONES in the second group off the inside, angled three wide into the lane, fully extended to
grind out the second spot, no threat to winner. ESSENTIAL BELLA broke alertly, helped set the pace along the inside, proved no match for the winner in the
drive, outkicked late for the place. A PAYCHEQUE SMILE bobbled a bit at the break, moved out, three out to four wide in the turn, flattened out in the run to
the wire. TONE IT UP broke back, lacked speed, three wide trip most of the way, improved slightly. MUMBLEBEE made little impact while racing off the
inside. VERKLEMPT off slowly, raced back, failed to menace. GUAJIRA in the main group early, tired in the drive. STANLEY MARKET with the early pace
while outside, began to fade early in the turn.

Footnotes
WINGS OF AN ANGEL broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, edged clear when straightened for home, held sway late under
steady handling. CHURCH SERVICE lacked speed toward the rail, came in the two path for the drive, waited briefly in some traffic a furlong out, altered
course to the outside for room with a sixteenth remaining, finished well to be in time for the place. BEGUINE forwardly placed, raced forwardly up the
backstretch, angled three wide into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, drifted in slightly, caught late for the second spot. TAP FOR ME
broke back, checked up across a foe's heels early in the turn when moving out widest, six path turning into the stretch, mild late interest to improve position.
TASHA within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for the stretch run while remaining inside. LADY COMMANDER void of speed, saved
ground through the turn, improved position with some belated interest. NOVEMBER ROSE back off the pace, came three wide out of the turn, made little
impact through the stretch. TERRANOVA pressed the winner early, moved closer to duel through the turn then gave way in the drive. FAST AND FEMININE
broke a step slow, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. GOLDENA lacked speed, four wide through the turn, remained always back.
SHOSHONI MOON tired off rail. HIGH CON in the main group early, steadily retreated. FOLLOWING STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH
RUN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
WATERWORKS moved up to show the way through the first turn in the two path, remained off the rail while setting the pace the middle half, shook clear
entering the stretch, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. TORTE forwardly placed off the inside, four wide onto the backstretch, continued to
pursue the winner into the stretch three wide, could do little with that one, comfortably clear for the place. FAMED last away, four out to five wide first turn,
continued outside, five wide again in the far turn, four wide into the lane, could not match top two, came back late to retake the show spot. HOLY JUSTICE
off the pace inside, continued to save ground up the backstretch and through the final turn, crept a bit closer when straightened for home, flattened out late,
outkicked for the show. LAVENDAR LANE closest to the winner for five furlongs, weakened. C. C. HARBOR off a bit slow and then was a bit rank, raced
back and four wide most of the way. ICE BABY was not involved while racing well off the inside.

PRIORITIZATION moved out to be four wide and within striking distance late in the first turn, stalked in the run up the backstretch, took over in the three
path far turn, clear into the lane, enough left to last. LEADING WEST settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer by moving out four wide midway on
the far turn, steered in turning into the stretch, challegned late inside the winner, missed, clear for the place. JAY VEE BEE void of speed, continued back
the middle half mile, steered out four wide in some traffic when advancing second turn, shifted out a bit wider for the drive, finished willingly to be closing the
gap on the top two late. OUTLIER broke on top, allowed the pace to go early while under restraint, moved closest to the winner turning for home, chased
that one upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. AMONGST FRIENDS raced outside and off the pace, four wide late
in the final turn, lacked a closing kick. SHOFAR broke back, lacked any early foot, traffic, angled out to be four wide by late in the final turn, improved a bit
while not a serious threat. SPHEROID lacked speed, raced inside, continued to save ground second turn, traffic late in that bend, also picked up a couple of
rivals nearing midstretch while not a serious menace. MOST SANDISFACTORY forwardly placed early along the inside, backed up. SONO GRATO off
slowly, raced five wide into the first turn, continued outside, five to six side into the lane, failed to rally. HANKS settled in mid pack off the inside, had nothing
for the drive. NAMESAKE narrowly set the pace for five furlongs, stopped when headed in the final turn. AMANI'S EAGLE four wide when off the pace in the
first turn, four wide again into the far turn, also stopped.
