Footnotes
MAJESTIC WIND was off slow from inside, advanced quickly up the backstretch, waited behind the leader through the turn, swung out at the top of the
stretch and cleared in the final sixteenth under hand urging. CURLY ESA lost his path behind ABADON early, stalked the duo up the backstretch, went three
deep into the turn, took aim two wide entering the stretch, grabbed the lead in upper stretch but got outkicked by the winner in the late stages. CENTRE
CIRCLE was off a bit slow to begin, tracked along the inside the angled three wide late on the turn, summoned a mild rally and earned the show honors.
ASPHALT ANDY broke slow, chased near the back outside rivals then off the rail, went two then three wide on the turn and kept on for a minor award. MO
THEM DOWN was off a step slow then sent for the front, set the pace inside ABADON, cleared that rival into the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and
tired in the final furlong. STEMWINDER hit inner gate and was off slowest from outside, angled to the inside trailing the field, saved ground into the drive
and could not rally. ABADON came away well, pressed the pace up the backstretch from outside, chased the leader into the turn, started to weaken around
the bend and faded.

Footnotes
BRONN raced up close early outside the top pair, vied three deep around the turn, kept the pressure on WIPE THE SLATE in the lane and edged past in
the final sixteenth. WIPE THE SLATE dueled for the lead outside REBEL WAR, vied between rivals on the turn, took a short lead into the lane, held
command into the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly in deep stretch. ACTIVE ACCOUNT was off slow and lost his path at the start, trailed up the
backstretch, went four wide into the turn then angled down to the two path, closed well through the lane and was gaining to the wire. REBEL WAR dueled
for the lead from inside, vied along the rail with a pair of rivals through the turn, fought into the furlong grounds and faltered a bit but kept on to the wire.
PELICAN WAY stumbled leaving the gate, stalked the top trio from well off the rail, navigated the turn four wide and could not rally.

AWESOME PAMELA raced off the pace in the two path, angled five wide around the far turn, rallied three deep while drifting in late and got up. MEDUSA'S
GAZE sped to the front from inside, kicked clear on the far turn, put to right then left-handed urging in the lane and was caught in the closing moments.
GLORY OF CHROME stumbled and bumped inner rival at the start, stalked outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch, bid between rivals in the final
sixteenth and got crowded a bit late while finishing a game third. SIDEWAYS SUANCES went four to five wide around the first turn, remained four wide into
the stretch and could not rally. DORITA'S HAPPY stalked a bit off the rail on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. QUEEN OF LOVE got
bumped leaving the gate, went three wide around the first turn, angled to the rail on the second bend and had little left for the drive. MONGOLIAN DREAM
was off slow to begin and never got involved. CAYTON KID raced up close in the two path or outside the pacesetter, lost some ground around the second
bend and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
COTOPAXI (IRE) sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, inched away in upper stretch and held safely in the end. SWISS SWOO (IRE) lost his
path briefly when the leader crossed over early, chased a bit off the rail through the turn, rallied late but was not enough. CHERUBIC FACTOR angled off
the rail early, went two then three wide on the turn, put in a late run and gained the show. EXPLOSIVE checked outside a pair of rivals early, chased in the
two path then tipped out in upper stretch, finished willingly but was outkicked for the place and show. ALEXANDER'S DREAM got crowded between rivals
early, continued to chase between then in the two path outside a rival into the turn and could not rally in the drive. ALGERIA (IRE) was off slow to begin,
trailed along the rail then shifted to the two path to go around a rival on the bend and failed to menace. PRIANO chased on the inside, dropped back on the
turn, eased in the lane and pulled up late and walked off.

Footnotes
BELLA RENELLA sat off the pace early on, went three wide around the turn, rallied from outside and dueled with TIZ A MASTER in the furlong grounds and
dug in late to win the photo. TIZ A MASTER was forwardly placed to the outside of the top pair, bid outside the leader on the turn, reached the front in upper
stretch, dueled with BELLA RENELLA in the final furlong and missed. BUSY PAYNTER stumbled leaving the gate, went up to take control, held a short lead
into the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the show. HOT ON THE TRAIL tossed his head and came away a bit slow, saved
ground while drawing closer through the turn but flattened out in the late stages. IT'S A RIDDLE raced up close to the outside of the leader, chased that rival
two wide around the turn and weakened. ELGOFRANCO traveled in range from the far outside, took the turn four wide and weakened. DISCRETE STEVIE
B was off slow to begin, dropped back early, trailed four wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE CAT sat off the pace in the beginning, angled out around the turn and came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair with a sixteenth
left and got up. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) stalked three wide then came four wide into the lane, got brushed by MISS FIA in upper stretch, took a short lead
with a sixteenth left to run and got nailed in the final moments. SPIRIT OF BERMUDA (IRE) set the pace under pressure, moved to the rail on the turn,
cleared briefly into the stretch, was overtaken at the sixteenth pole but stayed on gamely to the line. MISS FIA pressed the pace from outside, brushed rival
in upper stretch, checked at the eighth pole and raced in traffic to the wire. NEW HEAT broke slow and inward, saved ground from off the pace, lacked room
behind foes in upper stretch, tipped out with a furlong remaining and kept on through the final sixteenth. SHORE BREAK (IRE) tracked between foes around
the turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and needed to find more late. CORDIALITY chased along the inside and could not summon
the needed late kick in the final furlong.

PROVERB brushed with inner rival at the start, went four then three wide around the first turn, bid three deep on the second bend, lost touch at the top of
the lane, then re-bid four deep in the furlong grounds and got up late. MONGOLIAN WIND was closest in pursuit off the rail, bid outside on the far turn and
dueled into the drive, took over in upper stretch, vied between briefly in the furlong grounds, finished gamely to the wire but was overtaken in the end.
ABSOLUTE UNIT was rated early on the inside, lacked room approaching the eighth pole, split foes in tight quarters midstretch but was outkicked.
SIGNOFTHECROSS chased in the two path then between rivals, moved out into the clear on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, bid five deep in
the lane but lacked then needed late kick. ZIMBA WARRIOR stumbled leaving the gate, tucked inside early, angled out on the far turn and came five wide
into the stretch, bid six deep in the lane but faltered in the final sixteenth. C FALLS set the pace from inside, challenged around the far turn and dueled into
the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, drifted out and then back to the inside and weakened late. GRAY MAGICIAN hopped and was off slow to begin,
trailed two wide around the first turn, saved ground around the second bend and made no impact. HEARTFULLOFSTARS sat off the pace and went two to
three wide around both turns and was not a factor.

Footnotes
YOUTE was off a bit slow to begin, settled off the rail, went two then three wide on the turn, angled widest in the drive and drew clear. SWANNING went five
wide early on the first turn then moved in a few paths, stalked off the rail then moved inside, waited behind the lead leaving the turn, bid between foes in
upper stretch and took a short lead at the eighth pole but proved no match for the winner in deep stretch. INCREASE STAKES broke well, stalked the lone
leader up the backstretch, took aim two leaving the turn, bid three deep in upper stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. FUNNY FELINE was off a bit slow
from inside, recovered quickly and went up to take a clear lead, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. SHE'S A BIT SASSY
was off slow to begin, lacked room and checked hard with a quarter mile left to run, angled inward leaving the bend and kept on to improve placings. MIX
AND MATCH went four then three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace and moved inside, lacked room inside a rival and checked near the
five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch and could not rally. SWEET CALIFORNIA was off slow to begin, taken back early on the inside, altered
around rival at the five-sixteenths pole, altered again around another rival at the quarter pole and came five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
COPPER BO TEN chased three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened.
