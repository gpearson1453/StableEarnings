Footnotes
YOUNG TUSCAN set the pace from an outer pressing foe, drew away from that rival at the quarter pole, and held sway through the lane. LS'SHOE'S
IMAGE pressed the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, and held place through the lane. IKNOWIDIDN'TDOTHAT
laid at the rear along the inside after breaking a bit flat-footed, but was held up behind MAGIC ICE into the turn, lost position behind that rival as that foe
faded around the bend, remained behind traffic while trailing entering the lane, shifted to the three path in search of racing room in upper stretch, altered five
wide for clear sailing at the furlong grounds, and rallied to reach show on the wire. BACK ALLEY JAMMIN broke a step slowly, raced at the rear two to three
wide around the turn, tucked two wide and between horses passing the quarter pole, attempted a bid for place inside of LS'SHOE'S IMAGE, but flattened
out, and got nailed on the wire for show. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW laid close up along the inside, but failed to corner into the turn, steadied while getting
out, tracked from the three path around the bend, floated to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. MAGIC ICE chased while off
of the pace along the inside, but failed to sustain position into and around the turn, briefly regained stride entering the lane, but faded in upper stretch. MR. K
W raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, then was outside of foes through the lane, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
AKIANE'S SOLDIER settled off of the pace two wide, rallied three wide around the far turn to cut the gap on the run-off leader, then assumed command
passing the three sixteenths pole, and was wrapped up late. SUMMER IS HOT tracked along the inside, gained two wide and between horses around the
far turn as AKIANE'S SOLDIER rallied along side, but lugged inwardly and behind the stopping pace setter passing the quarter pole while hanging on his left
lead, got outkicked by his outer rallying counterpart approaching the three-sixteenths, and kept on to prove second best. SERIOUSLY SAM raced far off of
the pace along the inside, inched closer in the three to four path around the far turn, and stayed on through the lane. RESPOSADO laid at the rear two wide
around the first turn, and passed tired rivals. CHEAPSKATE DIVA showed the way in the thee path around the first turn, but ran off to a clear advantage
entering the backstretch, set a quick pace before tiring turning for home, got bested at the three sixteenths pole, and stopped. DREAM TOWN took a bump
from an inner foe at the start, vied inside of CHEAPSKATE DIVA around the first turn, allowed that foe to sprint clear entering the backstretch, but weakened
around the far turn. MAC LEGACY broke outwardly and bumped an outer foe before brushing into an inner rival at the start, then saved ground in midpack
around the first turn, but was done early. BAD GAL RIRI was outrun.

Footnotes
DEANO settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, took the turn inside of a rival while in the two path , tipped outside of the dueling leaders at the
furlong grounds with multiple lengths to find, and rallied to reel in the leader on the wire. GLENN'S JUMPER stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the three
furlong pole sparking a duel outside of KID SLIPPER, cleared that foe at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, and got nailed by an outer rival
on the wire. KID SLIPPER set a quick early pace, dug in at the three furlong pole to resist GLENN'S JUMPER's bid, dueled with that foe entering the lane,
but gave way at the furlong grounds. MOSTA FLYIN raced off of the pace along the inside, faltered to trail the field into the turn, then passed tired foes
through the lane. HARPER'S DEELITE laid far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. MAGI stalked two wide, attempted a bid
for the lead between horses along with GLENN'S JUMPER approaching the three furlong pole, but got outmoved at that marker, shifted three wide shortly
after, but weakened entering the lane. SIR ADVENT tracked from midpack three wide, took the turn in the three path, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
CITADEL rated off of the pace two wide, gained three to four wide around the far turn, then sustained his charge to bid at the furlong grounds, and drove
clear late. GROOM LAKE stalked three to two wide into the backstretch, bid at the five sixteenths pole, cleared passing the quarter pole, dug in at the
furlong grounds as CITADEL menaced, but was bested by that foe a sixteenth out, and saved place. ZOFFA took a bump and backed out of tight quarters
soon after the start, trailed the field, took the far turn three wide, swung five wide entering the lane, and rallied willingly through the final furlong, but missed
reaching place. GUNNER PAUL tracked along the inside, then stalked two wide into the far turn, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane as
CITADEL rallied alongside, got outkicked by that foe at the three-sixteenths pole, then by another rival at the sixteenth pole, and kept on for a minor share.
ANICLUDE raced at the rear along the inside, then two wide and between horses into the far turn, but failed to make an impact. CHIEF ALPHA laid far back
three wide, improved but still raced off of the pace into the far turn, tucked two wide around that bend, but failed to factor before flattening out. A. K. SAFARI
set a clear pace while tugging against the bit with his mouth open, met GROOM LAKE's bid at the five sixteenths, yielded to that foe entering the lane, and
weakened. QUIET PRAYER tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring POSEIDEON WRATH turning for home, and failed to re-rally.
POSEIDON WRATH stalked two wide, tucked to the inside entering the backstretch, but faded at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
CREOLE CHARLIE set the pace along the inside, drew off passing the quarter pole, and was driven home to seal the deal. FOOLISH DREAMS stalked
along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, stayed on to bid for place at the three-sixteenths, forged that position at the
furlong grounds, and was second best. JANETS JAY JAY tracked three wide while under steady urging, gained turning for home to attempt entering the
lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader passing the quarter pole, faded, but lasted for show. TOUCHDOWN JOE raced at the rear along the inside,
shifted to the five path in upper stretch, moved up late, but missed reaching show. MUCHO MARVIN pressed the pace two wide, attempted a bid for the
lead between horses entering the lane, but faded passing the quarter pole. CHROMPTON raced off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and failed to
factor.

DUKE OF CARTHANIA saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path entering the lane, altered course outside of a drifting SMOKEY HARBOR
approaching the furlong grounds, but solidly bumped an outer CAVE HILL in the process, bumped with that foe repeatedly while in tight quarters between
rivals approaching the final sixteenth, then surged and forged an advantage fifty yards from home, and fended off his outer counterpart to the wire. CAVE
HILL rated off of the pace two wide, awaited racing room between horses into the far turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, then to the six path in
upper stretch while commencing a rally, but was bumped solidly by an inner DUKE OF CARTHANIA at the furlong grounds, continued to exchange bumps
with that rival approaching the final sixteenth, battled with that foe while both bidding in the closing stages, but was denied. POLICY OPTION stalked while
tucking four to two wide around the first turn, bid for the lead at the five-sixteenths, led in upper stretch, but lugged outwardly at the sixteenth pole as a trio of
outer foes closed in, and got bested by a pair of rivals in the closing stages. SMOKEY HARBOR laid off of the pace in the five to three path around the first
turn, gained three wide around the far turn to take aim on a leading POLICY OPTION in upper stretch, but drifted outwardly approaching the final furlong,
sustained a grind inside of a pair of outer foes approaching the final sixteenth in hopes of bidding between horses, but was shut off when the inner leaded
lugged across his path passing that marker. GO SPEED RACER GO set the pace along the inside, met POLICY OPTION's bid around the far turn, but got
headed in upper stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. INDY TOURIST staled from the two path into the far turn before tucking to the rail around
that bend, but lacked a bid, and faded in midstretch. EAST LEX trailed, took the far turn in the three to five paths, and never got involved. EMPTY
HOLSTER tracked three to two wide around the first turn, but faded between horses at the five sixteenths pole. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED. THE RIDER OF CAVE HILL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DUKE OF CARTHANIA, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SCARLET FUSION trailed the field in the three path around the first turn, circled rivals with a four wide rally around the far turn to bid for the lead entering
the lane, led at the three sixteenths pole, cleared shortly after, and held sway from a rallying HOMBRAZO late. HOMBRAZO raced forwardly placed two
wide and between horses while under a snug hold down the backstretch, awaited racing room while getting outmoved by the eventual winner around the far
turn, altered course five wide and outside of foes in upper stretch, and rallied to take aim on the aforementioned foe in the late stages, but did not have
enough to reel that foe in. PERFECT CUT stalked three wide, pressed the leader around the far turn, bid for the lead between horses entering the lane, but
was outkicked by his outer bidding counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, then lost place at the furlong grounds. CABERTOSS stalked along the inside,
but failed to slip inside of the leader through a narrow hole passing the quarter pole causing outer foes to get the jump, got blocked when the leader closed
that hole at the three sixteenths pole, got through shortly after, but lacked a bid. EDITOR IN CHIEF set the pace in the two path, met a pair of bidders
entering the lane, then gave way after requiring right rein correction at the three sixteenths pole. LUCKENBACHER laid off of the pace four wide, and got
outrun.

TROBAIRITZ laid off of the pace four wide, commenced a rally turning for home before getting fanned to the seven path entering the lane, bid for the lead in
upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds as an inner ABOUKIR BAY bid, dueled gamely with that foe through the late stages, and held. ABOUKIR BAY
tracked two wide, shifted to the five path at the quarter pole while rallying inside of TROBAIRITZ, got briefly outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, bid and
sparked a duel with her passing the furlong pole, but was denied via a close photo finish. COCO PUFF raced far off of the pace three wide, gained turning
for home, chased from behind the leaders through midstretch, shifted out at the sixteenth pole to claim show shortly after, and was gaining on the top two
late, but ran out of ground. SUMMER TSUNAMI stalked three wide, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides while shifting to the six path at the quarter
pole, and kept on thereafter for a minor share. VINEGAR VEGGIES prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, but was bested by a pair of outer foes at the furlong grounds, lost show at the sixteenth pole, and tired. SHEGOTTHEGOLDMINE bobbled slightly at
the start, saved ground while lacking early speed, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, and moved up. FANCY MARTINI set the pace, vied inside of a
rival around the turn, dug in to sustain vying position through upper stretch, but yielded at the furlong grounds. JIBE laid off of the pace two wide and failed
to factor. BOURN got outrun. SOULSTONE stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
GUTZY stalked four wide while just off of the embattled group, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage from MR ELVIN approaching
the final furlong, and drew clear. MR ELVIN dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, vied inside of a pair of foes turning for home, clung to a minor
advantage from a bidding GUTZY passing the quarter pole, but was headed at the three-sixteenths, got bested at the furlong grounds, and kept on. ADIEU
LE CHAT laid off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead, and was the best of the rest. SINGLE
SHOT laid close up in the two to three path around the turn, and chased the leaders home without bidding. HALF CAPPUCCINO lagged behind the field
early on, then passed a pair of inner foes in the final furlong. HALF MAGIC dueled for the lead three wide, vied between horses turning for home, but gave
way at the quarter pole. STARSHIP FESTIVAL dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but gave way to those rivals at the three furlong pole, and faded.
