Footnotes
INDIAN BUZZ was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, turned back several
challengers shifting a bit off the inside racing through the stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under left handed pressure. END ALL GET ALL
was settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly outside foes to close the gap on the winner
late. GHOST STALKER was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, came through inside foes to close the gap on the
pacesetter racing into upper stretch, tipped off the inside in late stages but lacked the needed final kick. SANCOCHO (MEX), urged between foes to gain a
position tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was urged to close the gap on the leader racing into upper stretch but quickly flattened out.
INTERNET OF THINGS, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued in that path to the far turn, was fanned
four wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. BLACK V. K., off last, was urged to gain a position tracking off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
backstretch but offered no closing bid.

Footnotes
KHOZANDO was rated tracking just off the leaders along the inside racing into the first turn, tipped out three deep after a half, continued with a steady bid to
wrest command nearing upper stretch, went clear under pressure and was taken in hand in late stages. SEAZAN, off a bit slowly, settled outside rivals
racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, split rivals just off the inside racing past midstretch
and prevailed for the place honors. MISTA DONZELLA, four deep in the opening stages, dropped off the second flight while angling to the inside racing into
the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes racing through the far turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick.
YOU'RE IN COREY broke in bumping VIGO at the start, was righted, then urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch and gave way
racing into the far turn. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, edged forward racing into the
far turn but gave out abruptly once headed by the winner nearing upper stretch. FARM STRONG, urged three deep between foes into the first turn, tracked
off the first flight outside a rival while shifting out on the backstretch, continued four deep into the second bend and steadily faded. VIGO, bumped start, was
rated off the second flight a bit off the inside to the backstretch, continued three deep between foes into the far turn but never gained contention.

Footnotes
BETTERMENT, forwardly placed three wide between foes racing to the first turn, shifted inwards stalking a rival between foes through the backstretch,
moved to press the issue racing into the far turn, then forged clear racing through the stretch, widening to the end under pressure. PHAROAH CAT, off
slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch, then altered course four wide in the closing stages to just
prevail for the place honors on the wire. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE, caught four wide as part of the second flight racing to the first turn, continued three
deep into the backstretch while being prompted to advance after a half, continued in that path to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. FLORIDA
PHARAOH, pulling against restraint while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch,
dueled for command inside the winner on the far turn and gave way in the drive. SHIPWRECK angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing into the first
turn, tipped out to split rivals racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, lacked the needed late response, then was steadied avoiding tight
quarters in the closing stages. MONETIZED, reluctant to load, was held up between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into
the far turn while making some brief progress but lacked the needed closing response. LORD OF THE NILE, held up along the inside racing into the first
turn, continued in tight quarters to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the lane but had no rally. ROGUE ELEMENT settled outside foes racing
to the backstretch and failed to menace. MOCA MONSTER, urged prompting the pace between foes racing to the first turn, dropped off the leaders while
angling inside on the backstretch and soon retreated. O DANNY BOY, urged four wide through the chute to the first turn gaining terms with the leaders,
shifted inwards after a half to track off the first flight and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BABY GUNDIN was rated out of striking distance racing four wide to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three wide racing into the far turn, then
continued with a sustained response to wear down ALL GOOD TIMES in time under firm left handed pressure. The latter raced unhurried while switching
outside foes racing to the first turn, gained terms with the leaders three wide after a half, pressed the issue outside a rival racing through the far turn, edged
forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't quite fend off the winner. INEDATEQUILA, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace
racing to the backstretch, took over from that foe after a half, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn to upper stretch but yielded to the top pair in
the last furlong. CAIRA ,reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. BAZZARINA was urged to gain the lead while angling
to the inside racing to the first turn, dueled inside foes on the backstretch and gave way early. QUALITY TOO SPARE was held up just off the first flight
along the inside racing to the first turn but dropped back early.

Footnotes
JIMMY D was rated near the inside, then between foes racing to the first turn, shifted inwards midway through that bend avoiding tight quarters crossing the
path of PICCADILLY BEAU, continued along the inside to the second bend, saved ground advancing inside foes nearing upper stretch, clipped heels with
the pacesetter leaving the three sixteenths marker, quickly righted himself, then shifted out three deep in the closing stages while producing a solid closing
response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. EL PILLO angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, conceded
some ground to the pacesetter for a half, steadily drew into striking distance to bid for command between foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch,
moved to wrest the advantage leaving midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. KRAMDEN, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter
racing to the first turn, continued between foes in second flight on the backstretch, was eased back from that position nearing the second bend, was
prompted to advance swinging out five wide racing into the lane and continued with late interest to edge MINNESOTA LUCKY on the wire for a share.
MINNESOTA LUCKY moved to the fore along the inside on his own courage racing through the chute, went clear racing into the backstretch, was roused to
resist several challengers, then dueled for command into upper stretch but yielded once headed. THANK YOU RICKETTS was reserved while guided to the
inside early, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped off the inside while continuing with an effort to improve position between foes. FADE AWAY
switched off the inside early while tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, was urged making brief progress racing four wide through the far turn but
flattened out leaving midstretch. SNAP HOOK tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance with an early move
three deep to close the gap on the pacesetter racing into the far turn but emptied out racing into upper stretch. CROI MOR angled to the inside tracking just
off the leaders racing to the backstretch and faded early. UNSPOILED MOMENTS hesitated at the start losing position to the field, settled last to the
backstretch and never gained contention. PICCADILLY BEAU angled to the rail leaving the chute dropping off the second flight, checked off rivals when
being cut off racing through the first turn and quickly dropped out.

CAPTAIN was urged between foes, then angled to the rail after the opening furlong to press the pace inside foes racing into the bend, dueled inside a rival
to upper stretch, was roused left handed to go clear leaving midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire. UNIQUE PATH angled to the inside tracking
off the first flight racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to secure the place honors late. THE SKIPSTER,
prominent three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner to midstretch but gave out late. NEPTUNES REVENGE broke
readily, vied for command between foes to the turn, lost terms with the top pair nearing upper stretch shifted out three, then four wide racing through the
lane and finished evenly late. TINKER'S PAL tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the turn turn and steadily faded into the stretch. NO EASY ROAD
was rated just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn but faded early. KHOZANITO, off slowly, was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight
on the backstretch and never gained contention. MARCH MAGIC trailed throughout.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCE LAW broke readily, raced four deep leaving the chute, shifted inwards tracking the pacesetter outside foes in second flight to the
backstretch, steadily moved to terms with that rival while shifting inwards racing into the far turn, was roused to wrest the advantage racing into upper
stretch, gained a clear advantage between calls late and held safe the late challenge of BOCA under firm handling. The latter was reserved along the inside
to the backstretch, swung outside rivals racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance four wide, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but
continued willingly to the end to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire. MAP THE MOMENT, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance and found some late response to gain position between rivals
while earning a share nearing the wire. TOWERING GAZE was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained
contention racing three wide into the far turn to draw on terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. MYSTIC DREAMS tracked off the
second flight between foes to the backstretch, came under prompting to advance between foes into the far turn but lacked the needed closing bid.
DONTMESSWITHTESS, urged to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, briefly contested the
issue inside the winner but gave way in late stages. SCHATZI was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but offered no rally.
BIONDA SUPRISE, forwardly placed three wide tracing just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, shifted inwards on the backstretch tracking that rival in
second flight but gave way racing through the far turn. GET BACK HOME was a brief factor between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but
dropped out early. LADY TEUFLESBERG shifted out five wide leaving the chute, continued in that path to the backstretch while being prompted to contend
but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LA VIEXA was caught four, then five wide racing to the backstretch racing just off the first flight, continued under light rating through the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, continued in that path into upper stretch and wore down GINGERONMYMIND in the closing stages under
firm handling. The latter was prompted to a forward placing three wide between foes racing to the first turn, moved to challenge for command four deep
racing into the second bend, moved to gain a clear advantage outside foes racing into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. TIZ LOTTIE, urged
disputing the pace inside foes while shifting a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into the second bend, dropped
back midway through the far turn, then produced a second effort shifting out four wide racing into the stretch to regain position while prevailing for a share.
FANCYSOUL broke inwards, was rated off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to bid for command inside foes racing into the far
turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. LA BRODY was rated just off the second flight between foes to the backstretch,
then passed between tiring rivals in the closing stages. JUST LIKE INDY was urged prompting the pacesetter between foes to the backstretch, dueled for
command three deep between rivals into the far turn but gave way racing into upper stretch. OB LA DI, reserved while angling inwards to race between foes
in the last flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn but had no closing response. DEESSE settled outside foes in the last flight
racing to the backstretch and never proved a threat. ESTILO ELEGANTE was settled in the last flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn and
dropped out early.

Footnotes
SKIPPY'S STRIKE was reserved dropping well off the leaders while being guided to the inside in the opening stages, saved ground on the turn gathering
momentum, tipped out to split foes just off the inside when presented an opening in upper stretch and continued with a solid late kick inside the pacesetter
to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. OUR DESTINY sprinted to the lead while angling inside in the opening stages, disputed
the issue on a narrow advantage inside foes into the turn, shifted out to three path racing into upper stretch and proved no match when confronted by the
winner. SAMAY tracked off the first flight while angling inside in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position inside foes and finished
evenly in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. JAZZY TIMES tracked just off the pacesetter racing five wide to the turn, continued in that path to
upper stretch and couldn't produce a closing response. TENCH vied for command four deep between foes racing into the turn and faded nearing upper
stretch. FOX ROX, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. ABE HONESTLY ducked out at the
start momentarily dislodging his rider from his irons while losing contact with the field and never regained contention. OCEANIC was urged in pursuit of the
pacesetter while tipping outside that foe racing through the backstretch to press the issue between foes into the turn but gave way early. BABY BOOMER
broke slowly and trailed throughout.
