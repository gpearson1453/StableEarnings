Footnotes
STAR PRADO was bumped and bothered by an outer foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, rallied through upper stretch, then
split the leaders at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. CHEYANN GLITTERS stalked the clear leader from the two path, grinded away through upper
stretch while on her left lead, reached the tiring pace setter approaching the final sixteenth, led briefly, but was outkicked by an inner foe at that marker.
FLASHY SASSY sped clear and ran off into the turn, remained clear around the bend, but tired noticeably in upper stretch, and was overhauled by a pair of
foes entering the final sixteenth. AUDACIOUS GIRL laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to threaten. EMERY'S DREAM
tracked the pace from the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. MISSBUDLITELIME was a bit fractious in the gate, then broke inwardly and
hindered a rival at the start, then was outrun.

Footnotes
LA GIOIOSA (FR) bobbled at the start and trailed the short field into the far turn, gained four wide and outside of rivals around that bend to bid in upper
stretch, and drove clear approaching the final furlong. SUMMER MATE stalked three wide, got outkicked by the eventual winner entering the lane, then
stayed on to claim place from inner foes passing the furlong grounds. ENGLISH TREASURE set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that foe at
the five sixteenths pole, then failed to keep pace with an outer bidding rival in upper stretch while vying for minors, and saved show. AWESOME TREAT
vied for the lead two wide, forged a narrow advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, and hung on her left
lead while yielding between horses in the final sixteenth. BUONGIORNO BEE stalked along the inside and from the pocket, but chased behind traffic
through upper stretch, then lacked a bid.

Footnotes
COMMERCIAL FLASH stalked outside of the leading pair, ranged up to them in the four path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led passing the three
sixteenths pole, drove clear leaving the furlong grounds, and held sway. POINT OF VICTORY set the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path entering
the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch, fought on through through midstretch while securing place, but was only second best.
MIDNIGHT TRIP laid off of the pace in the two path, gained two wide turning for home before tipping five wide entering the lane, and stayed on for show.
SHE'S A FAIR CATCH stalked along the inside, then chased along the rail through the lane, but flattened out late. BLUE RIDGE HEAT vied for the lead two
wide, but faded three wide and between horses passing the quarter pole. NINE LINE BIND trailed around the turn, and was outrun. ROCKIN SUNDAY laid
off of the pace in the three path, was roused at the half mile pole, then driven into the turn to pick up stride, but lacked a response while being fanned six
wide entering the lane, and weakened.

HIGHLAND CREEK laid close up inside of the pace setter early on, vied around the far turn, led turning for home, and drew off through the lane under
driving pressure. SILVER GALAXY saved ground far off of the pace, then rallied along the rail to claim place approaching the wire. TREYS MIDNITE MOON
tracked along the inside, shifted three wide at the three furlong pole to take aim on the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase through upper
stretch, and tired in the late stages to lose place. MAGEEZ trailed two wide, and failed to factor. GET THEM JUSTIN set the pace outside of HIGHLAND
CREEK, but was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. SYDSTER stalked three wide, but chased four wide while
under urging around the far turn, and weakened turning for home.

FLUFFPOINT vied for the lead two wide, dueled through the turn while in the three path, sustained the battle through upper stretch, then edged away from
his inner counterpart through the final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead. ENCHANTED MOON set the pace inside of a vying FLUFFPOINT, dueled
with that foe while in the two path around the turn, battled gamely through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, and was
bested at that marker. MR. K W stalked along the inside, chased the outer leaders through the lane, then tired in the late stages, but saved show. R AND R
STAR stalked two wide, tipped to the four path entering the lane to be outside of the leading pair, but only managed to chase those foes into midstretch,
then missed reaching a tiring foe for show. THAT VEGAS BOY raced off of the pace two wide around the turn, then stayed on through the final furlong while
shifting ground inwardly and hanging on his left lead. PRIORITY POINTS never got involved. MY PAL GREELEY laid off of the pace along the inside, but
tired through the final furlong. GUILTY AS CHARGED was outrun.

TOMMY BEE laid close up along the inside into the first turn, allowed an outer rival to clear around that bend before vacating the rail, stalked two wide after
an inner move from MANNIX (IRE) passing the five furlong pole, re-bid along with that foe at the nine-sixteenths, vied two wide around the far turn, then
drew off in upper stretch, and widened while drifting away from the rider's use of the crop through midstretch. SHAMAYIM trailed early on, gained four wide
around the far turn, and reached place at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead. JESUIT tracked from midpack two to three wide, then chased
through the lane before getting outkicked for place at the furlong grounds. MANNIX (IRE) hopped a bit at the start while off slowly, saved ground while
tracking around the first turn, decidedly advanced inside of rivals passing the five furlong pole before bidding for the lead two wide and between horses at
the nine-sixteenths pole, vied inside of TOMMY BEE around the far turn, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch.
MONARCH MAN cleared off in the three path around the first turn, settled into stride entering the backstretch before meeting a pair outer bids at the
nine-sixteenths pole, then weakened soon after, and was done early.

YES HE CAN set the pace inside of a vying COVE BLUE, shook clear of that rival at the quarter pole, and drew off through the lane under driving pressure.
POPULIST stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, made a bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, battled
outside of a pair of rivals for place thereafter, and forged that position a sixteenth from home. COVE BLUE vied two wide, but failed to keep pace with his
inner counterpart entering the lane, dug in for place between horses approaching midstretch, got headed for that position approaching the final sixteenth,
then fought on, but failed to re-claim it. TAPIZARS SECRET tracked along the inside, bid for place inside of a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, but
flattened on approaching the wire. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER trailed three wide around the turn, and moved up without threatening. THE GREEN MO'STER
raced off of the pace two wide, but failed to factor. FROLIC MORE saved ground off of the pace, but faded.

Footnotes
SURVEILLANCE tracked in the three to four path around the turn, came into the lane between horses as an outer WIN YA WIN ranged up, rallied while
outkicking that foe in upper stretch, took aim on a tiring clear leader in the final sixteenth, and reached that foe approaching the wire. CHARGE THE LINE
set a clear pace around the turn, widened his advantage in upper stretch, but tired in the final sixteenth as a pair of outer foes closed in, then was caught a
few strides from the wire, but saved place. WIN YA WIN bobbled very slightly at the start while last away, took the turn in the four to five path before ranging
up outside of SURVEILLANCE entering the lane, failed to match rallying strides with that foe in upper stretch, but chased that rival home well while hanging
on his left lead, and just missed reaching place. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE popped open the gate as other foes were loading, then stalked along the inside,
shifted to the two path turning for home, but only managed to chase through midstretch before fading. LOOKIN HIGH saved ground at the back of the pack,
but to no avail. CITY MISCHIEF stalked two wide, but faded while getting floated to the three path at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared entering the backstretch, inched further away into the far turn, then maintained a
margin through midstretch, and lasted safely from a rallying rival late. BLUE JAYS tracked three wide, then four to five wide around the far turn, rallied
through the lane to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground to catch him. STARRININMYDREAMS tracked along the inside,
improved inside of rivals into the far turn to bid for place while vacating the rail at the five sixteenths pole, gained that position entering the lane before
drifting outwardly approaching the three sixteenths pole, got outkicked outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, then tired, but saved show. AMERICAN
TATTOO (ARG) stumbled at the start without drastically being costed position, stalked two wide, chased under mild urging three to four wide around the far
turn, then was put to tight quarters by inner foes at the three sixteenths pole while hanging on his left lead, sustained stride before changing to his right lead
a sixteenth from home, then picked up rivals late to just miss reaching show. READY TO POUNCE settled off of the pace in the two path around the first
turn, then saved ground around the far turn, chased along the rail to attempt a place bid in midstretch, but flattened out. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL laid close
up inside of WARRIOR IN CHIEF early on, allowed that foe to clear approaching the three quarter pole to switch outside of that rival soon after, but failed to
keep pace into the far turn, met an inner rival's place bid around that turn, then was herded outwardly by that foe approaching the three sixteenths pole, put
AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) into tight quarters in the process, then faded. MOLIERE raced at the rear in the three path around the first turn, then never got
involved. EXTRAORDINARY saved ground at the rear while a bit keen under restraint around the first turn, and was outrun.
