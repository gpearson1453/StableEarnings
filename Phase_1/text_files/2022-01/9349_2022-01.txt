Footnotes
BAYERN TO BE WILD was reserved early, went five wide into the turn, was gaining, took control late and edged clear. COWBOY TOBY set a pressured
early pace, went four wide into the turn, kept on, was no match late and finished second best. JUST CALL ME KEN was unhurried early, raced four wide
and finished belatedly. SAMURAI JACK tracked the early pace, raced six wide and was empty late. SHANGHAI MIKE pressed the early pace from between
rivals and faded. MORO APPEAL was allowed to settle, advanced seven wide through the turn and flattened out. FLICKERING LIGHT was void of any early
speed and was no threat. TRES CHIFLADOS was up close early from the inside and retreated.
