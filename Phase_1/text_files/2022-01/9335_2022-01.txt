Footnotes
SALADO broke alertly, dueled early off the inside, shook clear turning for home, drew out under steady handling to prove clearly best. RESERVE broke
back, settled toward the inside, steered out turning for home, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. FORSAKEN within striking distance
off the inside early, moved closer to the winner in the three path turning for home, flattened out in the drive to be caught for the place. GUNSTONE reluctant
to load, broke out, settled off the pace, went evenly paced throughout while racing three wide. BRODY BOUCHER saved ground when well off the pace,
improved slightly while not a serious threat. J'S LITTLE MAN bothered early, remained always back while saving ground. SMOKEYMOUNTAINRAIN came
out soon after the start, was straightened and dueled up front along the inside, gave way late in the turn. PRINCE OF EARL crowded back soon after the
start, remained back in failing to rally. AMAZING ROCKET in mid pack early, faded.

Footnotes
AFLEET SKY ibn the second flight while racing outside, four wide through most of the turn, floated out five wide into the lane, outside bid past the furlong
marker, wore that one down to be edging away late. MAX'S HEART broke sharp, set the pace while off the inside, showed the way in the two path, came
out a bit to be three wide turning for home, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, well clear of the others. ALL IN GOOD TIME prompted the pace outside,
four wide turning into the lane, proved no match for the top two in the drive, gained the nod for the show. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH forwardly placed just
off the inside, raced in some traffic in the turn, went evenly through the lane to miss the show. PACIFIC HARBOR back off the pace while along the inside,
improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. MOONSHINE VISION broke back, trailed early off the inside, came five wide when steering out
turning for home, displayed some mild late interest well out in the strip. MUCHO ROCKET CAT off a step slow, was used to rush up the inside and contest
the pace inside the runner up, gave way through the stretch. BUMPER POOL failed to menace. SOUTHERN PECAN remained back throughout.
WOFFORD raced in mid pack for a half, backed up through the stretch. BACKGATE RED finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL STREET broke on top, set the pace off the inside, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the turn and into the lane, held the
runner up at bay late under steady handling. STONEVICIOUS settled off the pace, came four wide into the stretch when moving a bit closer, continued to
slowly carve into the winner's margin in the final furlong. CATCH THE SMOKE off the early pace toward the inside, steadied behind a rival midway on the
turn, recovered and improved into the lane while in the two path, flattened out a bit from the furlong marker on in. DEALMEINBUD forwardly placed along
the inside, came up empty for the drive. REQUISITION in tight and bothered at the break to be last away, continued to lack speed into the turn, improved
position off the inside. CAN'T BEAT ME void of speed, made little impact while four wide through the turn. JERRY'S EIGHTY tired while racing outside.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY chased the winner for a half, gave way in the drive. RODEO MAN bothered at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ALLEGE saved ground through the first turn when behind the leaders, continued to stalk inside up the backstretch, steadily moved out to be three then four
wide into the stretch, late bid outside, up final strides. CANDY TYCOON prompted the leader in the three path and in hand, advanced on that one and
challenged in the final turn, long drive, outkicked between rivals at the wire. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, responded when
challenged second turn, proved stubborn until late. INDIMAAJ within striking distance off the inside, four wide exiting the final turn, failed to muster a closing
response. ANTIGRAVITY lacked speed along the inside, moved slightly closer while enjoying a clear trip along the inside, came up empty in the drive. RAM
void of speed while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four out to five wide second bend, made little impact in the drive. WHAT A COUNTRY
last to leave, was never a threat in the two path. JUDGE PHILLIP M gave way after a half, pulled up second turn, walked off.

Footnotes
DANCING COSSACK forwardly placed while off the inside, ranged up outside the two leaders turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker then kicked
clear late. CAN MAN DO pressed the early leader off the inside, dueled into the turn, put that rival away just as the winner was challenging exiting the bend,
continued on equal terms with that rival past midstretch then could not keep up, lasted for the place. MESMERIZED in the second group along the inside,
continued to save ground through the turn, staged a mild rally to be getting to the runner up late. NO HUDDLE dwelt at the start to spot the field several
lengths, continued to trail turn while three wide, shifted out for room when advancing into the stretch, improved position while too late. CLASSIC SHINE
raced in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the stretch, went evenly through the stretch. WE THANK YOU in the second group off the inside in the
run up the backstretch, had little for the drive. TEQUILA REVOLUTION went evenly paced outside early, four wide through the turn, brushed with BLUES
TUNE in upper stretch, lacked a rally. BLUES TUNE fell back after the start, lacked speed off the inside, three wide through much of the turn, four wide into
the lane, brushed upper stretch, also came up empty for the run to the wire. ELUSIVE FREUD lacked speed, came three wide out of the turn, lacked a
closing kick as well. PIKACHU five wide into the turn, remained always back. OUTCOME away in good order, narrowly set the pace inside early, dueled into
the turn while continuing closest to the rail, moved out a bit for the drive and stopped.

Footnotes
LONG TERM THINKING in the second flight off the inside, advanced steadily to challenge three wide turning for home, shook clear, kept to task.
KERSHAW hesitated break, trailed first turn, began to advance far turn, three to four wide rally into the lane, finished up willingly to be up for the place.
RIVER ECHO (GB) in mid pack early toward the inside, moved closer into the far turn, blocked behind the leaders late in the final turn, recovered and
moved out, raced closest to the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, nipped late for the place. BEAR OAK broke alertly, set the
pace toward but not on the inside well in hand, continued to show the way second turn, weakened when headed by the winner when straightened for home.
ESKENFORIT four wide in the first turn, continued outside, raced four wide again in the second bend, lacked a closing kick in the drive. DAVID'S GEM
pressed the leader off the inside, continued to apply pressure up the backstretch, bid second turn then faltered in the drive. HOOKED A GOODWIN was
never dangerous while racing off the inside. GITA'S LAD in the second flight early three wide, dropped inside for the second turn then tired in the drive.
SKYSCANNER was never a factor in remaining back. SOMETHING NATURAL tired after four furlongs. GO FOR SHERRIE showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
HOME BASE stalked the pace outside, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, drove clear the final furlong. NUCLEAR OPTION behind the
pace while along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, staged a mild rally up the rail to annex the place. MUCH BETTER broke alertly, soon
sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, saw that advantage shrink late in the bend then began to weaken when headed by the winner soon after.
SHOTSKI void of early foot, swung out to be four wide into the lane, rallied on the outside, narrowly missed the show. BOURBON FRONTIER in mid pack in
the run up the backstretch in the two path, evenly paced through the turn, lacked a serious closing response through the lane. DRENA'S STAR also turned
in an even effort while racing off the inside. KADRI prompted the pace off the inside, moved briefly closer between horses exiting the turn, weakened in the
run through the stretch. BEST OF GREELEY settled off the pace inside, lacked a response when called on for the drive. PIT BOSS void of speed, remained
always back. TOWN CHAMP began to tire before a half. OURNATIONONPARADE was never involved.

Footnotes
ONE FAST CAT in the second flight early while between foes, moved closer late in the turn in the three path, hooked up with the runner up when
straightened for home, spirited duel, brush, proved narrow best in game fashion. MACRON broke on top, vied up front in the run up the backstretch,
garnered a larger lead in the turn, dueled with the winner through the stretch inside that one, brush, outkicked late to miss. BELFAST BOY lacked early foot
toward the inside, moved closer in some traffic turning for home, proved no match for the top two the final furlong, finished clear of the others. REPROBATE
last away, trailed well back, saved ground through the turn, steered out a bit entering the stretch, improved with some late interest through traffic. MARTINI
BLU lacked early foot, called on for some run late in the turn, improved three wide into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. WINDCRACKER lacked
speed, came in the two path out of the turn, lacked the needed closing response. COMMANDER KHAI forwardly placed for a half toward the inside, had
little left for the drive. NAME REJECTED lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, also failed to muster a closing response. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE
four wide trip, tired in the drive. POLAR WIND broke back, was never a threat while also four wide late in the turn. RIDE RICHIE RIDE flashed brief speed
closest to the inside, gave way just before a half. MONEY MIKE pressed the issue early from the outside and stopped.

Footnotes
DASH ATTACK off a step slow, settled off the pace while saving some ground through the first turn, began to creep closer into the far turn, behind traffic
midway on that bend, tipped out four to five wide for room turning for home, finished full of run to win going away. BARBER ROAD came in just after the
start to tighten up DON'TCROSSTHE DEVIL, settled in mid pack while off the inside, asked along second turn, in some traffic between horses into the lane,
light brush, up late for the place, not a threat to the winner. IGNITIS unhurried for five furlongs, fanned six wide turning into the stretch, displayed some late
interest to pick off some tiring foes and narrowly be up for the show late. KAVOD forwardly placed off the inside, went after the leaders and took over in the
three path turning into the lane, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner then faltered late to lose a couple more
positions in the final strides. VIVAR void of speed, began to rally into the far turn, fanned seven wide into the stretch, rallied widest, willingly. CAIRAMA off a
step slow, raced back early and three wide, improved through some traffic midstretch. BEN DIESEL used a bit from the outside to make the front, dueled
through some quick fractions then gave way when the running began at the head of the lane. RUGGS away in good order, alternated up front through those
quick splits and also faltered in the drive. ALL IN SYNC within striking distance along the inside in the second flight, angled out four wide around the tiring
leaders turning for home and then came up empty. HOME BREW settled off the pace, saved some ground through the second turn, had little left for the
drive. BUREAU was never a factor off the inside. DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL tight, steadied early, remained always back. COOL PAPA G was finished after
half.

Footnotes
ZITMAN in traffic when forwardly placed in the first turn, settled middle half mile, asked along far turn, traffic then three wide into the lane, rallied to be up in
time. SO ALIVE settled off the pace and the inside, four to six wide through the final turn, belated rally to be getting to the winner late while determined for
the place. ANDREAS void of speed after breaking a step slow, trailed most of the way, staged a belated run through traffic. MAJOR BROWN within striking
distance along the inside, lacked a closing punch. THAT'S WHAT I SAY settled behind the pace inside, raced in the two path when advancing into the lane,
lugged in midstretch, put a head in front then faltered. IKE broke on top from the outside cleared into the first turn, set the pace until headed nearing
midstretch and gave way. CHICORY BLUE in some traffic when forwardly placed in the first turn, remained within striking distance the middle half, three
then four wide into the lane, had little left for the run to the wire. SHAKE IT remained always back in failing to threaten. KNIGHTS KEY off a step slow, was
never close. ISTILLGOTIT chased the leader for five furlongs and began to stop. ONE MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.
