BREEZY MONEY checked along the rail entering the first turn, altered course three wide soon thereafter, went up to match strides for the lead before a half,
dug in through the stretch under left handed urging, drifted in nearing the wire and prevailed. CENTSOFWANDER unhurried early, shifted out to the six path
nearing the top of the stretch and rallied for second three wide. GRAND DEAL battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, and checked along the
rail just before the wire. LEND AMERICA trailed for five furlong, dropped inside in upper stretch and closed some ground. UNCAPTURED PULSE battled for
the lead between horses two wide into the stretch and faded late. MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE moved up along the inside before a half then came up empty.
GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD with the second flight three wide, gave way on the far turn. LEWD was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

GRAY FASHION prompted the pace three then two wide into the turn, split rivals to make the lead before the quarter pole then widened the balance of the
trip while drifting out to win as much the best. WILDCAT DREAM delayed the start while reluctant to load, was never far back, swung wide then rallied in the
seven path through the stretch and got up for second. RUN KITTY battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. MISSISSIPPI
MUSE failed to menace. WHAT'S SO FUNNY broke in front, contested the lead four the three wide to the top of the stretch and weakened. MY
D'VALENTINE had brief speed. HIGH HEAVEN was a sharp early threat between rivals, checked entering the turn and dropped out of it. YARMA D' BOSS
trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

failed. INDY PRINCESS KOKO slow early, was steadily gaining ground late three wide. TICKETY BOO moved up four wide on the turn then leveled off.
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE vied for the lead four then three wide into the stretch and faded late. MAYAN QUEEN was no threat. ULTRA RAYS was outrun.
FLOWZANO pressed the pace two wide, had speed into the stretch and gave way late. COMPANYS COMING stalked the pace three wide and was through
after a half.

Footnotes
STARSHIP TAXI never far back, closed fast three wide through the turn, made the lead in the five path at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of
the trip to win as much the best. HIT THIS TOWN broke step slow, rallied steadily through the stretch along the rail and finished clear for second.
SHARINGTHEJOURNEY unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally. ASTROMAN slow early, found his best stride late inside. AWESOME OX
stalked the pace along the inside and lacked the needed response. EXCLUSIVE DONALD was a sharp threat two wide into the turn then faded. J P'S
SONG battled for the lead along the inside through the turn then was used up. JOE COOL matched strides for the lead two wide and stopped in the stretch.
