Footnotes
QUEENS RANSOM broke sharply to duel for the lead with MISS REBEKAH while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was up in
the closing yards. MISS REBEKAH disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run but could not hold
the winner safe late. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY was forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn and lacked the closing response. INDIAN
AFFAIR was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. GOLDEN SUN DROPS showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn, rider lost whip in mid-stretch and did not threaten. TAHOE BLUE chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going three
furlongs.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC CAFE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached INDIAN GAMBLER into the lane, vied with that foe and
proved best late. INDIAN GAMBLER was away in good order to dispute the pace with DOUGS PAL while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by
the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with that foe through a prolonged drive but could not match strides late. HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE was
forwardly placed from the inside, moved up for a striking position in mid-stretch but could not get by the top pair. SHARK HARBOR settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PAITASKA was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
MINEHUNTER was pinched back at the start, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. DOUGS PAL pressed
the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.
