BANKER'S HOURS sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. MR MAC QUHAE chased the winner three
wide and stayed on to be clearly second best. UNIFIED CONQUEST lacked speed, saved ground throughout and was along for the show.
BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE chased the pace two wide between foes and weakened in the lane. TIME OF PEACE failed to menace while racing two wide.
REGIO played no factor while racing two wide. CANAAN had early speed inside and retreated through the lane. TAKEMYSHOT was outrun while racing two
and three wide. WOW LINE hit the starting gate and made little impact while racing three wide.

Footnotes
COZY CAFE settled nicely and stalked the pace outside up the backstretch, moved up to engage GAGA OH LA LA at the five sixteenths pole, cleared
command late on the turn, was ridden along three wide into the lane, responded willingly under right-handed pressure, widened to a commanding margin
and finished going away. GAGA OH LA LA showed the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace near the inside, fought back when challenged by the
COZY CAFE midway through the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner turning for home but ran on and secured place. ELLIEREESEASTON
was not far back along the outside through early stages, was ridden along two to three wide through the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and
churned on for a share. KENYA SUN applied pace pressure from the inside up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn, swung wide for
the drive and flattened out. AUDREY got brushed at the start and was slow into stride in opening stages, remained reserved in the back saving ground up
the backstretch, angled out three wide approaching the upper stretch and failed to move on. BELLE'S KINGDOM raced in range through early stages and
retreated after the half.

Footnotes
TAPE TO TAPE set the pace inside, gave his pursuers the slip turning for home, and was driving to 70 yards out before being geared down. PROUD
CONTENDER was outsprinted early, moved to the rail before reaching the turn, and rallied mildly inside for the place. OUT WORK'N stumbled at the start,
saved ground behind the first flight on the turn, and finished evenly in the two-path. STARLITE WALKER pursued TAPE TO TAPE three wide, lodged a brief
bid after a half-mile, got shaken off into the stretch and faded. READYSEEKGO broke slowly, raced three to four wide, and never reached contention.
TINKER TAILER became fractious in the gate dislodging the rider, came away without incident and pressed TAPE TO TAPE from outside, and was finished
soon after going a half-mile.

Footnotes
JAZZY T bumped with WHAT KNOT at the start but was still away forwardly, set the pace in the two path, shook clear around the far turn and held clear
under a drive. SWEET ACTRESS stalked the pace two wide, angled in midway around the far turn, could not gain on the winner in the lane but won the
place battle. LA COSTA prompted the pace three wide, could not gain on the winner in the lane and was outfinished for the place. WHAT KNOT bumped
with the winner at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and flattened out a bit in the lane. FOXTROT SEVILLE
failed to menace while racing two wide. BONNIE'S THE BEST was in range inside, was shuffled midway around the far turn and lacked any further bids.
DREAMING OF AUDREY chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
DILIGENT settled nicely and tracked the pace up the backstretch, moved up closer late on the far turn, advanced to duel three deep at the head of the lane,
battled on past the furlong marker, dug in under steady pressure and edged away. J P HELLISH was forwardly placed and three wide around the first turn,
stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, advanced to duel two wide between rivals in the upper stretch, fought back in the final furlong, then yielded in
deep stretch. OUTSHINE led the way around the first turn, set the pace inside up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, then came under attack at
the head of the lane, dueled in tight quarters along the rail into the final furlong, and flattened late. DEVOTED KITTEN settled nicely while rated outside
through early stages, was ridden along around the far turn, came five wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve. MR MATUSCHEK was unhurried
and saved ground up the backstretch, given cue two wide late on the far turn, briefly gained closer contention, then failed to sustain bid and gave way.
CENTERFOLDPROSPECT settled near the inside through early stages, was ridden along three to four wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on.
DANI'S VICTORY raced off the early pace, roused three wide around the far turn and failed to respond. CAPTAIN THUNDER stalked inside up the
backstretch, remained in contention through the far turn and retreated in the upper stretch. SEGUIMI raced in the back and saved ground through early
stages, angled out five wide leaving the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
REINAGOL bumped soundly with FOUZIA at the start, raced close up three wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly to wear down SENORA ROMA from
outside, then held off RICHIES GREAT GIRL to the finish. RICHIES GREAT GIRL saved ground reserved early, swung three wide coming off the turn,
finished with good energy and was gaining outside the winner. RUNNING MEMORIES chased inside to the stretch, moved to the two-path and finished
evenly. SENORA ROMA sprinted to the front after the start, showed the way in the two-path for three furlongs, moved inside and weakened through the
lane. CAN'T BUY LOVE was outrun to the stretch three to four wide, and gained mildly without threatening. TIPLE (IRE) lagged well back early toward the
inside, and never factored. FOUZIA bumped hard with REINAGOL at the start and was slowest away, moved up to midpack early three wide, and faded in
the stretch. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY moved in from the two-path on the turn, and tired on the rail through the stretch.

YES I'M A BEAST set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of two foes nearing the lane, dueled inside of NEVER SATISFIED through most of the lane, put
that foe away late and fended off PRINCE OF IRON'S late charge. PRINCE OF IRON was in range inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied outside
and just missed. NEVER SATISFIED pressed the winner two wide, reached near even terms between foes near the quarter pole, dueled outside of the
winner past the sixteenth pole and weakened late. ADVENTURE SEEKER stalked the pace three wide, bid near the quarter pole, turned for home on near
even terms then tired. FROSTED ARMOUR chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. ICY STORM trailed inside.

CRITICAL THREAT settled nicely outside near midpack up the backstretch, advanced four wide to challenge for the lead late on the turn, responded under
pressure in the upper stretch, roused forward to a slim lead with a furlong left to run, stayed on gamely under firm handling and drew clear. MAN ON THE
MOON stalked three wide through early stages, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead into the stretch run, could not move on with
the winner in late stages but stayed on with response and edged foe to take place. GUMP applied pace pressure to MENELIK up the backstretch, vied for
the lead around the far turn, battled on into upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in late stages, stayed on with response and got edged for place.
TIZ RYE TIME got bumped at the start, raced in range and saved ground up the backstretch, shifted out leaving the turn, came five wide into the lane,
shifted in a couple paths and had a mild improve. MENELIK set a pressured pace through early stages, dueled with rivals around the turn and tired in the
upper stretch. MAGIC ECLIPSE got bumped between rivals at the start, was not far back through early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the
turn, swung wide into the lane and failed to threaten. CARMICHAEL bumped with rival at the start, raced off the pace, moved through the turn two to three
wide and never menaced. BROTHER BRAD raced three to four wide and had no response.

Footnotes
CHACALOSA bumped with FIRENSPICE at the start, then got bumped again by that rival soon after and was shuffled back, advanced approaching the
stretch while shifting out four wide, rallied determinedly outside to catch POIEMA in deep stretch and was clear at the wire. POIEMA tracked outside the
early leaders, took over with a three-wide run after three furlongs, went clear into the stretch, could not withstand the winner in deep stretch and just saved
the place. DAVID'S ROSE raced two wide around the turn, ran on willingly but did not have enough and just missed the place between horses. ARROW
SHAPE advanced to contention around the turn three wide, but flattened out leaving the furlong grounds. MOUNT SINAI saved ground throughout, and
lacked the needed response. RUNAWAY BREEZE got pinched back and steadied between DAVID'S ROSE and CHACALOSA shortly after the start, came
five wide off the turn and made no headway. FIRENSPICE bumped with CHACALOSA at the start, then came in bumping that rival while being hustled to
the front, vied inside for three-eighths of a mile, and had nothing left. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY pressed the pace two wide early, and stopped around the turn.
