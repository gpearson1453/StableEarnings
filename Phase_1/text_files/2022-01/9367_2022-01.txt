early going, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and showed good late interest. TRACK BOUND dueled in the early stages, raced three wide and
weakened in the drive. CAPPER broke in the air, dropped back to the back of the pack early, raced three wide and never was a factor. AUTISM SAVANT
was coaxed from the inside to press the early pace and tired in the stretch run.

KISSABLE U vied for the early lead from the inside and drew clear late under strong handling. BONITA RAPIDS settled off the early going, moved up near
the rail in the stretch and finished well to get up for the place position late. FICTIONAL hopped at the start, was then rushed from the outside to contention,
raced two deep in the stretch run, lost his whip near the eighth marker and kept on to the wire. SHARMEL stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near
the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. TRANS MISSISSIPPI settled off the early going, raced four wide around the far turn and had no
late response. SWEET RYAN was hustled in the early stages, took up near the half mile pole, angled through the upper stretch and had no late threat.
LINDA'S BALLET dwelt at the start, raced far back early and never threatened. A stewards inquiry was lodged to review the break and stewards ruled no
change.

Footnotes
BALTIMORE BEECHO was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up three wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong
pressure. BIBLEMAN showed good early speed from the outside to set the early pace and was wore down late to finish second best. GOT EVEN
SMARTER stalked the early going, moved up near the inside in the stretch run and showed good late interest. MOJAVE stalked the pace, raced three to
four wide and had no final winning bid. KING PARKER dropped back early on, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain.
RAOFTHESUN dropped back early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. THE METAL MAN stalked the pace, raced in
tight near the half mile pole and never threatened. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE was slow early and never threatened. CROOKED FINGER RAY stalked the pace,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and failed to sustain a bid.
