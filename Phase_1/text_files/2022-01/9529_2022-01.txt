Footnotes
ALGEBRAIC dueled inside W W SPRINGTIME early, raced in the two path around the turn, remained in the two path through the stretch and held sway
outside EL SOBREVIVIENTE in an extended drive. EL SOBREVIVIENTE , shuffled back soon after the break, saved ground around the turn, advanced
along the inner rail to challenged for the lead in mid stretch and finished gamely. JOHN'S PROMISE drifted in soon after the break, raced in the three path
between horses on the turn, eased out four wide turning for home and lacked a rally. SEANOW lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to
the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. ROBEY'S BOY lacked speed, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired horses.
ANNAMATED MOON chased the pace inside horses, was in the two path mid way on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. W W SPRINGTIME showed
speed outside the winner, drifted wide mid way on the turn, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
KOBE TOUGH broke a step slow, quickly recovered and moved up to prompt the pace outside WHENIGETTOHEAVEN, was coaxed along past the five
sixteenths, gained a slim lead inside the three sixteenths, dueled under left handed encouragement and held firm. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN , right to the
front, set the pace towards the rail while handling outside pressure, lost command in upper stretch, stayed on and battled gamely inside the winner to the
wire. SENATOR KELLY appeared to lose his footing in behind at the break and was off a bit slow, regrouped and advanced outside rivals heading to the far
turn, took closer order off the dueling leaders heading the quarter pole, gave hard chase three to four wide nearing mid stretch but came up empty late.
BLAMEITONTHEFUN saved ground off the early pace, slipped through along the rail to make a mild run mid turn then flattened out late. BRETTMEISTER ,
three wide pursuing outside rivals mid turn, gave way. AWESOME STEPHEN , off the pace, raced four wide in upper stretch and failed to menace.
SELVATICO , sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
PARCHED GHOST , taken to rate while saving ground off the early pace, eased out advancing mid turn, went after the leader with a two wide bid past the
quarter pole, shook clear leaving mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. CONGRESS HALL , four wide outside runners early on, moved up three
wide between rivals in mid stretch, kept on grinding but had her rally fall just short. MAVILUS cleared early, dropped in and set the pace, was taken on past
the quarter pole, fought on past mid stretch then faded. POSTINO'S CHAMPION gave chase two wide and came up empty. DUSTWHIRL WONDER , three
wide early, had aim five wide into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN prompted the pace outside the leader, was under pressure
three wide mid turn and gave way. HETTY G. , off the pace while saving ground, failed to rally. NYMUE'S TREASURE , five wide, lacked a bid.
SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) broke poorly then stumbled and was outrun.

Footnotes
PAINT MUSIC FOR ME , four deep stalking the pace around the turn, closed determinedly the final furlong and was up at the wire. BOONDOGGLE gained
the lead about a quarter of a mile after the start, opened up entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly. TRADITION , inside horses entering the turn,
swung to the five path leaving the bend and rallied outside. TINY TIN lacked speed, raced inside horses through the stretch and rallied. IRON PEARLS , up
close early, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened in the drive. ROCKIN RON , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, hugged the
inner rail on the turn and weakened in upper stretch. PEACHY KEEN , six deep entering the stretch, was not a factor. ARTILLERY , along the inner rail on
the turn, eased out for the drive and passed tired horses. TRIPLE AMERICANO raced between horses and was not a factor. JUST PICK ONE , swung to
the five path entering the stretch, lacked a rally. AMAZING CAT , under urging soon after the break, chased the pace along the inner and tired. STAND MY
GROUND , no factor, was six wide turning for home. EL EQUALIZER , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
EL BOCHINCHE , well in hand tracking the dueling leaders, bid three deep leaving the far turn, sparred outside PEARLYVILLE and gained a short lead near
the quarter pole, kicked clear after being roused in upper stretch and widened under a left handed drive. PEARLYVILLE vied two wide outside TIPSY
TOURIST, held a short advantage between foes leaving the far turn, fought on to the inside of the winner into the lane, failed to kick on with that one past
the three sixteenths but kept on with some interest to be well clear for second. LIKEHAIL chased the pace off the rail, came three wide for the drive but
lacked a solid response. TIPSY TOURIST , away alertly, vied along the rail for three furlongs, failed to keep pace with the top pair past the five sixteenths
and faded through the final furlong. EL MILAGRA lacked speed, raced wide in the drive and had belated action while not threatening. TUA saved some
ground leaving the far turn, eased out three wide but failed to respond. CAN I EVER broke slowly and was outrun. MADE MY WISH , brushed at the break,
regrouped and edged up early, chased two to three wide and weakened. ARBELA flashed speed, gave early pursuit four wide and dropped back.

AIR TOKEN stalked the duel for three furlongs, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch and drew out under
urging. BORRACHO saved ground disputing the pace with ZABRACADABRA, remained prominent to upper stretch then gradually weakened. ARTHUR'S
HOPE hit the outside of her starting gate stall at the break, hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path, remained on his left lead and
passed tired rivals. WHISKEY AND YOU circled foes on the turn, was four deep approaching the stretch and came up empty. MCCAIN , outrun while
always well off the inner rail, swung to the four path in upper stretch. ZABRACADABRA , urged soon after the break, dueled outside BORRACHO, tired and
was eased late.

Footnotes
TORCH OF TRUTH dropped in nearing the first turn then stalked to the inside of a rival, eased out into the lane, leveled off when put to strong handling past
the three sixteenths, kept on determinedly, forged to command outside GENTLEMAN JOE in the final yards and was edging away. GENTLEMAN JOE ,
keen early when going clear, set the pace towards the rail, was coaxed along past the three eighths, remained well clear into the stretch, wandered outward
a bit in mid stretch, clung to command past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. CROUCHELLI settled off the pace, saved ground making some
headway near the five sixteenths, shifted out and churned on with interest. PLOT THE DOTS stalked outside the winner, was under pressure nearing the
quarter pole, drifted in a bit and steadied off heels soon into the lane, failed to kick on and faded. BOBBY G dropped off the early pace, saved some ground
under pressure into the stretch but failed to generate a serious kick. MIDNIGHT ACT , off the pace, raced three wide leaving the far turn and dropped back.
SARATOGA JACK broke outward, raced five wide into the first turn, shifted in and gave way.

JOE MIKE JIM set the pace outside MISS FOXANN and drew out the final furlong while kept to her business. FASHIONISTA lacked speed, saved ground
around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied while floated out by MISS FOXANN late. MISS FOXANN hugged the inner rail around the
turn, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, failed to keep up with the winner the final furlong, angled out near the sixteenth pole and drifted out badly
late. DOOMSCROLLER , sluggish early, moved to the rail on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. ISABELLA'S GLORY ,
unhurried down the backstretch, circled the turn, was five deep entering the stretch and passed tired horses. BOSS ANGEL raced in the two path inside
horses on the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally while floated out late. VIOLET JESSOP raced in the three path between
horses on the turn and lacked a rally. MARKET OF STOCKS bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace three wide on the turn and gave way.
LADY MOSLER hit the outside of her starting gate stall at the break, circled the four deep and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
EDICT , away alertly, attended the pace four wide outside JUNGLE WARRIOR, shifted a bit wider into the lane, came back to put a head in front with a
furlong remaining then spurted clear late after an extended drive. LUCKY RAMSEY rated towards the inside, eased out mid turn, raced six to seven wide in
upper stretch, kept on grinding and got up late for the place. JUNGLE WARRIOR vied inside the winner early on, pulled his way clear with five furlongs
remaining, set a rated pace around the turn, was guided out three to four wide when set down past the quarter pole, was headed a furlong out, fought on to
the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. LUDICROUS MODE settled off the pace, saved ground mid turn, swung very wide and closed. ALWAYS
FORGIVEN , rank at the break, lagged back off the pace and off the rail, came four to five wide for the drive, altered in late and rallied. PURIMETER , four
wide chasing, faded. LINDA'S NEKIA stalked the early pace, raced between rivals leaving the far turn and gave way. HAYNE'S FEVER dropped back off the
early pace, raced wide and was dull. SYNERGIZED bobbled at the break, stalked early while saving ground and faltered.
