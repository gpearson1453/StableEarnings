Footnotes
THANKS stalked leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid three wide in the stretch and worn down game rival to
get up. TIGER MOM cleared rivals after a good start, entered turn clear and into the stretch clear, met bid from closing rival, resisted but no match late and
finished up a clear second best. VIDALIA chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch three wide, angled in,
and stayed on to hold show. BADGER GAL off a bit slow and in tight at the start, settled two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, swung four
wide into the stretch and failed to improve. COPPER COWGIRL saved ground on the backstretch, steadied out of a spot when rival made it tight entering
the turn, and failed to threaten thereafter. COMMISSIONESS sent to contest pace, settled for a chasing inside position, continued along the inside on the
turn and into the stretch, within rang in upper stretch and tired readily inside the final sixteenth.

WHATWASITHINKING off slow, and bumped at the start, showed good speed and dueled inside of rival on the backstretch, continued along the inside on
the turn, entered stretch in the lead and proved best under strong urging. NEAH BAY away well and cleared early, stayed off the rail which allowed rival to
come up inside and take the lead, entered turn two wide, continued two wide into the stretch, responded to urging and denied by game rival. TOMASINO
came out and bumped rivals at the start, settled into a good stalking position, entered turn along the inside, entered stretch in the three path and held show.
LOST THE MINISTER off slow and trailed early on, entered turn trailing, continued to save ground through the turn and passed tired rival in the stretch while
never threatening. CONEJOS off slow, steadied and pushed out at the start, settled off the pace two wide, entered turn two wide, lugged out into the stretch
and came up empty.
