unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid, finished willingly and missed second. UNSPOKEN MEMORIES
challenged for the front end, raced three wide around the second turn and lacked a late kick. MACHO BOB pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat
late. AWESOME NOW void of early speed, trailed throughout, lost contact and was eased to the wire.

SCRAPBOOK unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, took the lead entering the home stretch, rallied down the lane and
was going away at the end. JENNIFER'S ARCH vied for the early lead, saved ground the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others.
BIND ON EARTH dueled for the early advantage, took the lead around the final turn and lacked a late kick. KASEN'S SISTER lacked early speed, lacked a
bid and raced evenly near the back. ENDURING PEACE was an early factor, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. BEYOND D'ORO
raced in the back of the field, lost contact and was eased to the wire.

was outfinished for second. MAJESTIC SOCIETY lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a bid and hung. DRIVER raced within
striking distance and weakened. SHOT ON WINDY HILL raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside, finished wide and was
no threat. UNBRIDLED PULPIT reserved in the beginning and was never close. MONZZA sprinted to the front, drove clear and was finished early. HOPE
FOR CHANGE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
DA DUE RUN RUN pressed the pace, took the lead around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. WICKED FLASHBACK went
to the front, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. SWEET AMELIA raced within striking distance, saved ground around
the final turn, made a late bid and proved third best. IZEONPOINT raced near the back, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid,
finished wide and was never a threat. A WISH FOR MADELYN raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside and faded.
STREETTALKINHOTTIE always raced near the back, had an outside trip and showed little.
