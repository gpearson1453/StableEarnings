Footnotes
PHANCY PHILLY broke alertly, advanced three wide on the turn, collared the pacesetter passing the eighth pole and edged clear. BELLA LINO moved to
the front down the backstretch, was collared in mid-stretch and continued willingly. ARGENTINA GIRL hustled close up inside, was in tight on the turn then
flattened out. ROSE LEGACY made a menacing move in the two path on the turn then weakened late. PEARLBDANCING lacked speed very wide and was
never a factor. TIME ALTERING trailed throughout losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
ESPRESSO CALIENTE was off slowly and steadied, moved up early on the inside to track the pace, chased inside on the turn, angled out, came three wide
into the lane, closed steadily outside in the final sixteenth and was just up at the wire. CANTSTOPRUNNING stalked close up outside, bid on the turn,
dueled with BIG BAD BUD, took over, drew clear, dug in gamely and was caught at the wire. CATCH FIRE raced off the pace inside, came four wide into
the lane, failed to threaten and bested the others for the show spot. BIG BAD BUD showed good early speed outside, dueled inside on the turn and faded in
the lane. CHANGING LANES raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. PER RULING #2211PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING
COMMISSION, BIG BAD BUD WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 4th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

clear and was kept to the task. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN tracked close up inside, waited behind rivals on the turn, angled out, rallied three wide into the
stretch, finished well but second best. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE raced off the pace, moved up on the turn, rallied mildly and held well late to earn the show
spot. WILLIE MAYS HAYS hopped at the start, raced two wide off the pace and rallied mildly outside. DEPUTIES EDGE showed good speed inside, dueled
inside of the winner on the turn and faded in the stretch. E T'S SUPER STAR did not factor. SUNSHINE TOMMY was off slowly and steadied, raced off the
