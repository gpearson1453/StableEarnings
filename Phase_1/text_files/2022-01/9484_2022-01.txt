secured command at the head of the stretch and drew out while kept to his business. IMAGE MAKER stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a two
wide lead entering the far turn, moved over to the inner rail, was hooked near the quarter pole, weakened and held the pace. SOLOMON'S CHOICE

Footnotes
OWEN'S PLEASURE lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, drifted out near the eighth pole, secured command in mid stretch and drove clear.
HASHTAG LUCKY broke in the air, sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace off the rail and gave way grudgingly. FROSTED ANGEL
bobbled leaving the starting gate, chased the pace well off the rail and came up empty. GOLD TIME VIXEN , four wide leaving the backstretch, remained off
the rail on the turn and gave way. CORAL SUMMER , pinched back after bobbling at the break, hugged the inner rail and was not a factor. TORCH
CARRIER raced in the three path entering the turn and retreated through the stretch.
